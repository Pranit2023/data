(Nasdaq: FNKO), a leading pop culture lifestyle brand, today reported its consolidated financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\n**Third Quarter Financial Results Summary: 2024 vs 2023**\n\n  * Net sales were $292.8 million compared with $312.9 million \n  * Gross profit was $119.8 million, equal to gross margin of 40.9%. This compares with $104.0 million, equal to gross margin of 33.2%, which included $6.4 million of non-recurring charges \n  * SG&A expenses were $92.7 million, which included $0.4 million of non-recurring charges. This compares with $94.0 million, which included $9.9 million of non-recurring charges. Details related to the non-recurring charges can be found in footnotes 4, 5 and 10 of the attached reconciliations \n  * Net income was $4.6 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, compared with net loss of $16.2 million, or $0.31 per share \n  * Adjusted net income* was $8.0 million, or $0.14 per diluted share*, compared to $1.7 million, or $0.03 per share \n  * Adjusted EBITDA* was $31.0 million versus $25.4 million \n\n\n\n\"We reported solid financial results for the 2024 third quarter,” said Cynthia Williams, Chief Executive Officer of Funko. “As expected, net sales were down compared with the prior-year quarter, though in the top end of our guidance range. On the other hand, we delivered better than expected profitability on improved gross margins, as we did in the first two quarters of this year. \n\n\"We've updated our full-year 2024 outlook for net sales to reflect a more cautious consumer environment, which we began to see in the third quarter. We now expect net sales to be at the low end to slightly below our previous range. Adjusted EBITDA is a different matter, we have raised our full-year outlook to above the high end of the range. \n\n\"We are deep in the process of developing our strategic plan for 2025 and beyond, and pleased that we have already begun executing several elements of that plan. Recently, we enabled direct-to-consumer shipping capability to Canada, and we expanded our collaboration with the National Football League (NFL), and its fanbase of more than 200 million, to include the option to customize Pop! Yourself with any NFL team logo. Additionally, and just in time for the holidays, we are announcing that Harry Potter accessories will be available to customize Pop! Yourself beginning tomorrow.\" \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Net Sales by Category and Geography**\n\nThe tables below show the breakdown of net sales on a brand category and geographical basis (in thousands): \n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,** |  **Period Over Period Change**  \n---|---  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **Dollar** |  **Percentage**  \n**Net sales by brand category:**  \nCore Collectible  |  $  |  227,845  |  $  |  233,269  |  $  |  (5,424  |  )  |  (2.3  |  )%   \nLoungefly  |  47,310  |  57,439  |  (10,129  |  )  |  (17.6  |  )%   \nOther  |  17,610  |  22,236  |  (4,626  |  )  |  (20.8  |  )%   \nTotal net sales  |  $  |  292,765  |  $  |  312,944  |  $  |  (20,179  |  )  |  (6.4  |  )%   \n**Three Months Ended September 30,** |  **Period Over Period Change**  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **Dollar** |  **Percentage**  \n**Net sales by geography (shipped to):**  \nUnited States  |  $  |  194,416  |  $  |  209,966  |  $  |  (15,550  |  )  |  (7.4  |  )%   \nEurope  |  74,473  |  81,938  |  (7,465  |  )  |  (9.1  |  )%   \nOther International  |  23,876  |  21,040  |  2,836  |  13.5  |  %   \nTotal net sales  |  $  |  292,765  |  $  |  312,944  |  $  |  (20,179  |  )  |  (6.4  |  )%   \n  \n**Balance Sheet Highlights - At September 30, 2024 vs December 31, 2023**\n\n  * Total cash and cash equivalents were $28.5 million at September 30, 2024 compared with $36.5 million at December 31, 2023 \n  * Inventory was $118.6 million at September 30, 2024 down from $119.5 million at December 31, 2023 \n  * Total debt was $223.4 million at September 30, 2024 versus $273.6 million at December 31, 2023. Total debt includes the amount outstanding under the company's term loan facility, net of unamortized discounts, revolving line of credit and equipment finance loan \n\n\n\n**Outlook for 2024**\n\nRegarding its 2024 full-year outlook, the company lowered the range for net sales and raised the range for adjusted EBITDA, and provided guidance for its 2024 fourth quarter, as follows: \n\n**Current Outlook**  \n---  \n**2024 Full Year**  \nNet Sales  |  $1.037 billion to $1.050 billion   \nAdjusted EBITDA*  |  $85 million to $90 million   \n**2024 Fourth Quarter**  \nNet sales  |  $280 million to $294 million   \nGross margin %  |  38% to 40%   \nSG&A expense, in dollars  |  $93 million to $99 million   \nAdjusted net income (loss)*  |  ($3) million to $1 million   \nAdjusted net income (loss) per diluted share*  |  ($0.05) to $0.02   \nAdjusted EBITDA*  |  $17 million to $22 million   \n  \n*Adjusted net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of historical adjusted net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) per share, and adjusted EBITDA, to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, please refer to the “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section of this press release. A reconciliation of adjusted net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) per share and adjusted EBITDA outlook to the corresponding GAAP measure on a forward-looking basis cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts, as we are unable to provide reconciling information with respect to certain items. However, for the fourth quarter of 2024 the company expects equity-based compensation of approximately $4 million, depreciation and amortization of approximately $15 million and interest expense of approximately $5 million. For the full year 2024, the company expects equity-based compensation of approximately $14 million, depreciation and amortization of approximately $62 million and interest expense of approximately $21 million, each of which is a reconciling item to net loss. See \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" and the attached reconciliations for more information. \n\n**Conference Call and Webcast**\n\nThe company will host a conference call at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time (1:30 p.m. Pacific Time) today, November 7, 2024, to further discuss its third quarter results and business update. A live webcast and a replay of the event will be available on the Investor Relations section on the Company’s website at investor.funko.com. The replay of the webcast will be available for one year. \n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThis release contains references to non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted net income (loss), including per share amounts, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted net income (loss) margin, which are financial measures that are not prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). Management uses these measures internally for evaluating its operating performance, for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and financials projections, and to assess incentive compensation for our employees, and to evaluate our capacity to expand our business. In addition, our senior secured credit facilities use adjusted EBITDA to measure our compliance with covenants, such as senior leverage ratio. The company's management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplementary information regarding operational performance because it enhances an investor's overall understanding of the financial results for the company's core business. Additionally, it provides a basis for the comparison of the financial results for the company's core business between current, past and future periods as they remove the impact of items not directly resulting from our core operations. The company also believes that including adjusted EBITDA and the other non-GAAP financial measures presented in this release is appropriate to provide additional information to investors and help to compare against other companies in our industry. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should be considered only as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for or as a superior measure to, financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We caution investors that amounts presented in accordance with our definitions of adjusted net income (loss), including per share amounts, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by our competitors, because not all companies and analysts calculate these measures in the same manner. \n\nDetailed reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the financial tables following this release. \n\n**About Funko**\n\nHeadquartered in Everett, Washington, Funko is a leading pop culture lifestyle brand.
