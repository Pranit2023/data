(NASDAQ: AAON) (“AAON” or the “Company”), a leader in high-performance and energy-efficient HVAC solutions, is reaffirming its commitment to the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Better Buildings Commercial Building Heat Pump Technology Challenge. As the DOE raises the stakes with new regulations, AAON is rising to the challenge by leveraging strong partnerships with Copeland, Oklahoma State University (OSU), Montana State University and the University of Maryland.\n\nCopeland, a global leader in sustainable heating, cooling, refrigeration and industrial solutions, has a long-standing relationship of over 30 years with AAON. Copeland plays a pivotal role in the DOE Challenge by providing advanced compressor technology and engineering support. “Our partnership with AAON is built on mutual respect and a shared vision for the future of HVAC,” said Mark Bills, vice president and general manager of commercial HVAC at Copeland. “Together, we are pushing the boundaries of what’s possible as we work on the DOE challenge. Our collaboration has never been stronger.”\n\nKnown for its expertise in thermal systems, OSU provides critical research on the shifting regulatory climate, including low global warming potential (GWP) refrigerants and heat pump system components and technologies.

(NASDAQ: AAON) (including its affiliates, “AAON” or the “Company”), a leader in high-performing, energy-efficient HVAC solutions that bring long-term value to customers and owners, is pleased to announce the expansion of the Company's production capacity with the purchase of a new 787,000 square foot facility in Memphis, Tennessee. This facility will primarily facilitate the growing demand from the data center market and is projected to create 828 skilled jobs at this location over the next five years of operation. The expansion will also add geographic diversification to AAON's current manufacturing footprint, mitigating certain operational risks and better serving our data center customers.\n\nThis facility will manufacture various types of thermal management equipment for data centers, including air-cooled systems, computer room air handlers (CRAHs), direct evaporative coolers, and liquid cooling distribution units (CDUs), both liquid-to-liquid and liquid-to-air. The facility is expected to have limited production in early 2025 and be fully operational in approximately 12 months. \n\n“The expansion of our production capacity through the purchase of this new facility marks a new chapter for AAON,” said Gary Fields, AAON CEO, “Not only will this allow us to continue to capitalize on the rapidly growing data center market, it demonstrates the commitment we have to our data center customers and the confidence we have in the vertical strategy of this market. At the same time, we are thrilled to bring new jobs and investment to the Memphis community and look forward to seeing the positive impact it will have on both our company and the local economy.”\n\n“After a rigorous due diligence process that included an intricate site search and detailed analysis of costs, risks, and return on investment, we are thrilled to announce the purchase of this new facility,” said Matt Tobolski, AAON President, and COO, “This new capacity will ensure we are able to meet the growing demands from our data center customers, while also generating compelling returns on invested capital for our shareholders. To date, AAON has successfully supplied the highest performing, most efficient thermal management solutions to this end-market, and we look forward to continued success in the future.”\n\nAAON leadership extends appreciation to the State of Tennessee, the City of Memphis, the Memphis Chamber, and Memphis EDGE. These impressive organizations, with top-notch teams and competitive programs, were helpful in our decision and we look forward to collaborative partnerships.\n\n\"Building a robust recruitment pipeline requires strong relationships with both industry leaders and our economic development partners,” said City of Memphis Mayor Paul Young, “Welcoming AAON to Memphis represents a significant step toward making our market even more competitive on a national level. With AAON's commitment, we are enhancing our local economy and elevating Memphis as a destination for high-quality jobs and sustainable industry growth.”\n\n“Memphis is gaining recognition for its speed and agility in attracting businesses. Paired with our diverse workforce and manufacturing talent, Memphis is America’s newest high-tech hub—the Digital Delta,” said Ted Townsend, President & CEO of the Greater Memphis Chamber, “AAON embodies a new chapter for Memphis. As a dynamic, high job-creation company with a focus on data centers, we are proud to welcome them to the Digital Delta.”\n\n\"Memphis continues to prove itself as a vibrant hub for economic growth and opportunity,” said Dr. Joann Massey, EDGE President, and CEO, “We are committed to welcoming innovative companies, like AAON, that invest in our community and support the creation of new jobs, further strengthening the city’s position as a key player in the manufacturing and industrial sectors.\" \n\n_AAON was represented in their site selection and real estate negotiations by John Beach and Susan Arledge, SIOR with Newmark, a global real estate service provider to large global corporations and other occupiers of commercial real estate._\n\nThrough the dedication of our people, we push the industry forward with innovative air solutions and pave the way for a better tomorrow.

(NASDAQ-AAON), a leader in high-performing, energy-efficient HVAC solutions that bring long-term value to customers and owners, today announced its results for the third quarter of 2024.\n\nNet sales for the third quarter of 2024 increased 4.9% to a record $327.3 million from $312.0 million in the third quarter of 2023.The year-over-year increase was largely driven by the BASX and AAON Coil Products segments, which realized growth of 58.8% and 36.7%, respectively. Sales at the AAON Oklahoma segment declined year-over-year 7.1%.\n\nGross profit margin in the quarter was 34.9%, down from 37.2% in the comparable quarter in 2023. The contraction in gross margin was a result of lower volumes at the AAON Oklahoma segment and temporary inefficiencies at BASX, partially offset by strong results at the AAON Coil Products segment which benefited from a favorable product mix and an increase in volumes. \n\nSG&A expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, continue to have elevated depreciation costs from the additional investments in technology we've made, offset by a decrease in professional fees due to the absence of the one-time $7.5 million settlement that occurred in the same period of 2023.Earnings per diluted share for the three months ended September 30, 2024, were $0.63, approximately flat from the adjusted earnings per diluted share in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n![Screenshot 2024-11-07 at 11.06.39 AM](https://investors.aaon.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screenshot%202024-11-07%20at%2011.06.39%20AM.png?width=1208&height=666&name=Screenshot%202024-11-07%20at%2011.06.39%20AM.png)\n\n![Screenshot 2024-11-07 at 11.11.33 AM](https://investors.aaon.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screenshot%202024-11-07%20at%2011.11.33%20AM.png?width=841&height=154&name=Screenshot%202024-11-07%20at%2011.11.33%20AM.png)\n\nAt September 30, 2024, we had a backlog of $647.7 million, approximately flat with the backlog at the end of the second quarter. Compared to a year ago, backlog was up 32.0% from $490.6 million, driven by the BASX and AAON Coil Products segments. At the end of the quarter, a majority of total backlog consisted of orders of data center equipment that will be produced and deliveredin 2025.\n\nGary Fields, CEO, stated, “The third quarter marked another quarter of strong results. Net sales for the quarter were a Company record, driven by robust growth at the BASX and AAON Coil Products segments. Demand at these two segments was largely spurred by the data center market as we continue to opportunistically leverage this high-growth market with our highly-engineered solutions-based product offerings. At the AAON Oklahoma segment, sales and profitability were in line with our expectations. Operationally, this segment continued to perform at a high level. The BASX segment still has some room for margin improvement, which we expect will occur over the next six months as disruptions related to the capacity expansion project, including outsourcing of parts manufacturing, dissipates and its shop reaches optimal efficiency. Overall, we were pleased with the third quarter results.”\n\nMr. Fields continued, “Bookings in the third quarter performed well, partially fueled by an increase in demand of traditional packaged rooftop units configured with the soon-to-be outdated R-410A refrigerant. While we also began realizing a pick-up in rooftop units configured with the new R-454B refrigerant, we anticipate a softening in overall rooftop demand in the near-term mainly due to the slower economic backdrop. At the same time, demand for data center equipment remained strong, a trend we expect will continue.”\n\nMr. Fields proceeded, “Subsequent to the end of the quarter, in October, we received approximately $174.5 million of orders that we expect will mostly be produced and shipped in the first half of 2025. These orders are associated with a liquid cooling solution for one data center customer and will be produced at our Longview, Texas location. This year, we have spoken at length about a large pipeline of opportunity in the data center space. These orders represent a fraction of that pipeline. The expansion project at the Texas location is on schedule to be complete by the end of this year with production to commence in early 2025. In addition, we recently entered into a definitive agreement to purchase a new 787,000 square foot facility in Memphis, Tennessee, which will accommodate incremental demand from the data center market over the next several years, at the same time providing more geographic diversification across our manufacturing footprint.”\n\nMr. Fields concluded, “At this point in time, AAON is positioned for growth to accelerate in a transformative way over the next 12 months. As such, it is a very exciting time at the Company. However, we are managing the Company in a way to achieve sustainable growth over a much longer period. As demand for higher quality HVAC equipment and solutions increases, AAON is becoming increasingly more competitive. Furthermore, the vast build-out of data center capacity in North America is a massive opportunity for the Company. With our superior innovation and engineering, highly productive operations and world class sales channel, along with an enhanced group of leadership and enterprise resources, AAON is well positioned to take advantage of these opportunities and achieve our long-term growth and sustainability goals.” \n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $6.7 million and a balance on its revolving credit facility of $55.7 million. Rebecca Thompson, CFO and Treasurer, commented, “During the quarter, we paid down $30.2 million on the revolving credit facility, reducing our leverage ratio to 0.19x. Capital expenditures in the quarter totaled $38.4 million, bringing our year-to-date investments to $113.7 million. Within the quarter we completed the expansion project at BASX, and we are on schedule to complete the expansion project at ACP by year-end. Looking ahead, with a strong balance sheet and many compelling growth opportunities, we will continue to reinvest our operating cash flows into additional production capacity, product innovation and infrastructure to help sustain long-term growth.” \n\n##### **Conference Call**\n\nThe Company will host a conference call and webcast today at 5:15 P.M.

Surpassing this milestone required one\nof the strongest years of performance in AAON’s history.\nOrganic sales grew 31.5%, including an increase in volume\nof 14.5%. The Company’s core packaged rooftop business,\nwhich made up 68.8% of total sales in 2023, realized even\nmore unit volume growth. This compared to the U.S.\nmarket which realized a 6.0% increase in units five tons\nand greater, the comparable tonnage category of our\nrooftop portfolio. The Company clearly continued to gain\nmarket share, a reflection of successful planning\nand execution of strategy. Last year also marked a strong\nyear of profitability. Gross margin expanded 740 basis\npoints to 34.1% and net income grew 77.0% to a record\nlevel for the second straight year.\nREMAINING TRUE TO OUR FOUNDING PRINCIPLES\nThirty-five years ago, our founder, Norm Asbjornson, created AAON\nwith one mission, manufacturing the best HVAC equipment in the\nworld for the best value. This mission remains true today. Through a\nunique semi-custom design and manufacturing process which evolved\nover decades, AAON is providing the highest performing, most energy\nefficient equipment there is on the market. No other market competitor\noffers a solutions-based configurable portfolio of rooftop equipment\nthat helps contractors and building owners maximize performance and\nefficiency as does AAON. Furthermore, continuous improvements in\noperational efficiencies have resulted in AAON products being the most\ncost competitive in Company history. We made great strides in this\nover the past two years. The price premium of AAON equipment versus\nalternative equipment in the market has never been smaller than it is\ntoday. This has made the AAON value proposition of the total cost of\nownership immensely more compelling, allowing the Company to continue\nto gain share. Incremental investments made in 2023, including product\ndevelopment, sales & marketing, information technology and leadership,\nposition us to accelerate share gains in the next several years.\nAAON’S EVOLUTION CONTINUES\nSince 2017, AAON has undergone significant changes in\nleadership, from both a structural and personnel standpoint.\nToday, the organization is managed by executive and senior\nleadership teams with layers of leaders below that have\ngoals, responsibilities, structure and succession planning.\nThese changes were critical to position the Company for\nlong-term sustainable growth. In 2023, we took the next step\nin this evolution when we announced in November several\nchanges in senior management. Along with promoting\nMatt Tobolski to President and COO of AAON, we established\nseveral new global roles to manage our four geographical\nMATT TOBOLSKI, PRESIDENT AND COO locations more efficiently, both in respect to productivity\nand growth.\nLEADING IN CLIMATE SOLUTIONS AND INNOVATION\nThe commercial HVAC market that AAON competes in is currently\nundergoing significant change driven by shifts in demand\nand increased regulations. These changes create challenges\nfor most of the industry, and particularly for companies focused\non mass production of basic equipment. Our unique design\nand manufacturing process which focuses on performance\nand energy efficiency, insulates AAON from the impact of shifts\nin the market related to energy efficiency, decarbonization\nand electrification as well as regulations focused on\nThese changes are\nenvironmentally friendly equipment. In fact, these changes\na benefit to AAON\nare a benefit to AAON as our products excel when the customer\nas our products\nis focused on performance. Leading up to the higher minimum\nexcel when the\nenergy efficiency standards that the Department of Energy\nput into effect starting January 1, 2023, AAON’s product portfolio customer is focused\nfully met those standards years in advance, while most of the on performance.\nindustry did not fully meet the minimum efficiency standards\nuntil the second half of 2022. Similarly, well ahead of the EPA’s\nnew regulation requiring manufacturers to utilize a lower\nGlobal Warming Potential (GWP) refrigerant, AAON began accepting\norders of equipment with lower GWP refrigerant on January 1, 2024.\nWe are proud to lead the way as the only manufacturer to our\nknowledge currently accepting orders for equipment with lower\nGWP refrigerant.\nAt the same time, AAON continues to innovate. In 2023, AAON\nintroduced its newly branded Alpha Class heat pump rooftop units.\nAlpha Class is a fully electric heat pump operable down to zero\ndegrees Fahrenheit. This product is significant in that it is the\nfirst viable climate solution to fulfilling electrification demands\nin the commercial rooftop market. Today, no other competitor\nhas a heat pump on the market that is operable much lower than\n25–30 degrees. The Company has always led the industry through\nNEWLY BRANDED ALPHA CLASS\ninnovation and expects to continue to push boundaries through\ninnovation and climate solutions into the future.\nLEVERAGING THE CORE THROUGH OUR SALES CHANNEL\nHistorically, AAON excelled in developing the most advanced HVAC\nequipment for the best value. While we have always valued our\nindependently owned and operated sales channel, our investment in\nadditional resources to help channel partners penetrate the market\nhas been lacking. We see this as a significant opportunity and are now\nmaking such investments. In 2023, we began establishing a marketing\ndepartment equipped with the resources to educate our sales channel\nand end-users of AAON’s value proposition. In addition, we finished\nconstruction of our Exploration Center last year. This facility showcases\nour equipment alongside market alternatives, and has quickly proved\nto be a valuable resource in the marketing of our equipment. We are\nalso investing in more capacity to train our sales representatives\nand additional resources to help build out our channel partners’ parts\nand services businesses. All of these investments are made with the\nintent of leveraging a premier product that has a superior value.\nLOOKING FORWARD\nAAON has a superior product offering and world class sales\nchannel. This combination provides the Company with a strong\nfoundation. Leveraging this with certain investments and strategies\nwill result in further share gains in 2024 and beyond. Given the\nadvancements we are making relative to the market, we will\naccomplish this while also being a leading contributor in reducing\nthe carbon footprint of commercial buildings. The Company has\nnever been more well managed than it is currently and we have\nnever been more optimistic of the future than we are today.\nTo our stakeholders, we cannot achieve these results without\nyour support and commitment. We continue to benefit from the\ntotal cooperation and dedicated service of our employees and\nindependent sales representatives.\nTo our stockholders, we are honored to have each of you with us\nand look forward to delivering the returns that will justify your\ncontinued ownership.\nUNITED STATES\nSECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION\nWashington, D.C. 20549\nFORM 10-K\nANNUAL REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE\n☒ ACT OF 1934\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023\nor\n☐ TRANSITION REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE SECURITIES\nEXCHANGE ACT OF 1934\nFor the transition period from _________________ to _________________\nCommission file number: 0-18953\nAAON, INC.\n(Exact name of registrant as specified in its charter)\nNevada 87-0448736\n(State or other jurisdiction (IRS Employer\nof incorporation or organization) Identification No.)\n2425 South Yukon Ave., Tulsa, Oklahoma 74107\n(Address of principal executive offices) (Zip Code)\nRegistrant’s telephone number, including area code: (918) 583-2266\nSecurities registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Act:\nTitle of each class Trading Symbol(s) Name of each exchange on which registered\nCommon Stock AAON NASDAQ\nSecurities registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Act: None\nIndicate by check mark if the registrant is a well-known seasoned issuer, as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities\nAct.\n☐ Yes ☒ No\nIndicate by check mark if the registrant is not required to file reports pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Act.\n☐ Yes ☒ No\nIndicate by check mark whether the registrant (1) has filed all reports required to be filed by Section 13 or 15(d) of\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 during the preceding 12 months (or for such shorter period that the registrant\nwas required to file such reports), and (2) has been subject to such filing requirements for the past 90 days.\n☒ Yes ☐ No\nIndicate by check mark whether the registrant has submitted electronically and posted on its corporate Web site, if\nany, every Interactive Data File required to be submitted and posted pursuant to Rule 405 of Regulation S-T during\nthe preceding 12 months (or for such shorter period that the registrant was required to submit and post such files).\n☒ Yes ☐ No\nIndicate by IcnhdeIicncIkadn tidmeci acabtaryekt e bcw hybhe ycce hcktheh mceekrca ktrmh kmea wrarkerh kgew itwshhteerharteh nttehth reei sr t rhateeh g lerai serrtggeriegas nitasrtct aricnase tna ltie slri aasar t agel adelr aagfriceglce eaer c,al eccarecnale tealerecdarc taefetildelee drfr ai,fl tieaelrnde,r aa,f icnalce naer c,al eccarec anleteolerendar- tafaeticdelce dfer i,fll eiealrr ea,nr toa,e nadn - onafinoclc-enaer-c aleccrecaleteleredar tafetidele dfr i flielre r\nor a smaller orre paoo rosr mrat i anas lgmsl mecarola lrmleelrepp rroa errnpetyiopn ro(gtari stnci ogndm gec fopcinmoaenmpdyap in(anayn sR y (d au(esalfe sdi n1ede2fedibfn i-ien2nde odRifn ui ntlRhe Re u1 luS2ele be1c- 212ub2 roi-bt2fi- e 2tosh f oeE f tSh xteceh hceSua Senrciegtucieeru isArt iiEtecisxte csoE hfEx a1cxn9hcg3ahe4na A)gn.eg c etA oAcftc 1ot 9fo 3f14 91)39. 43)4.) .\nLarge acceleLraatreLgdLea fraaigrlceegc reae claeccrecaleteelredar tafeitdlee dfr ifleilrer ☒ Acceler☒ate☒d☒ AfilcecAreAcleccrecaleteelredar tafeitdlee dfr ifleilrer ☐ ☐ ☐☐\nNon-acceleraNteodnN -fNoailcnoec-nrae-claeccrecaleteelredar tafeitdlee dfr ifleilrer ☐ Smaller☐ re☐po☐SrtminSaglmS lcemaorl amlrelelprpe aorrn errpyteiopnrogtr icntiognm gc pocamonmpyapnayny ☐ ☐ ☐☐\nEmerging grEowmtEehrEm gcmieonrmeggr ipggnairgnno gygw rgtohrwo cwtohtm hc pocamonmpyapnayny ☐ ☐ ☐☐\nIf an emergIifn gaI nfI g fa renoam nwee trmehgm eicnreoggrmig ngipgnra gong wyrgto,rh wo iwncthdot himcc aopctmoaenm pybap,yn a iynnc,yhd ,iei ncciadnktid ecim acbtaaeytr e kb c ybhi yfe c cthckheh ecem kcra kermg kmias triarfkra knti htf ie fh t harteehsg erei selrtegercigastnietsrtdt ar hnanatn osth t ahetslaoe s ce utleeesldece tcentthdeoe dt n etonoxto tteut onst odeu esutdhes e e t hetehx etee nxedtxeetneddn edde d\ntransition petrriaontdrsta irftnaoiosnrin stcii toopimneor nppi olepydreii rnofiogdor d wfc ofoirotm hrc opcamolnymypin lpnygleiy wnwign io tgwhr w iratenihtvy hai snnaeyendw y nf enionweraw nroe crovi rari selr eveadivcs icfesiodenu dafn niftnciiannianaglcn siacatcialac nlao dcauaccnrocdtuoisnnu gptni rtnsoitgnva gnisd dtsaeatndard ndpadsu raprdrsrsduo spav rnpiodtr voetdoivd ipSedduee rdcpst uiupoarunsnru st autnoatn Stt oet coSt iSeocentci toino n\n13(a) of the 1E3x(1cah31) a(3oan(f)ag t)oeh f oeA f tEh ctehxt. ec E☐ hExacxnhcgahena Agnegc etA.

Business.\nOverview\nAAON, Inc., a Nevada corporation, (“AAON Nevada”) was incorporated on August 18, 1987. Our operating\nsubsidiaries include AAON, Inc., an Oklahoma corporation (\"AAON Oklahoma\"), AAON Coil Products, Inc., a\nTexas corporation (\"AAON Coil Products\"), and BASX, Inc., an Oregon corporation (\"BASX\"). Unless the context\notherwise requires, references in this Annual Report to “AAON”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, “our”, or “ours” refer\nto AAON Nevada and our subsidiaries.\nAAON is a lead producer in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (\"HVAC\") systems for commercial and\nindustrial indoor environments. We are engaged in the engineering, manufacturing, and selling of premium heating,\nventilation, and air conditioning equipment consisting primarily of semi-custom and custom rooftop units, data\ncenter cooling solutions, cleanroom systems, packaged outdoor mechanical rooms, air handling units, makeup air\nunits, energy recovery units, condensing units, geothermal/water-source heat pumps, coils, and controls.\nBusiness Segments\nThe Company conducts its business through three business segments: AAON Oklahoma, AAON Coil Products, and\nBASX.\nAAON Oklahoma: AAON Oklahoma engineers, manufactures, and sells, semi-custom, and custom HVAC systems,\ndesigns and manufactures controls solutions, and sells retail parts to customers through retail part stores and online.\nAAON Oklahoma includes the operations of our Tulsa, OK and Parkville, MO manufacturing facilities, two retail\nlocations, and the Norman Asbjornson Innovation Center (\"NAIC\") research and development laboratory accredited\nby the Air Movement and Control Association International, Inc. (\"AMCA\").\nWith the NAIC, a world-class research and development (\"R&D\") laboratory in Tulsa, OK, our products are\ncontinuously tested under a variety of extreme environmental conditions to ensure they deliver the ultimate\nperformance, efficiency, and value.\nAlso located in Tulsa, OK, our cutting-edge Customer Exploration Center showcases the engineering, design\nattributes and premium build quality of our equipment side-by-side the market alternatives.\nAAON Coil Products: AAON Coil Products engineers and manufactures a selection of our semi-custom, and custom\nHVAC systems as well as a variety of heating and cooling coils to be used in HVAC systems, mostly for the benefit\nof AAON Oklahoma, AAON Coil Products, and BASX. AAON Coil Products consists of operations at our\nLongview, TX manufacturing facilities.\nBASX: BASX engineers, manufactures, and sells an array of custom, high-performance cooling solutions for the\nrapidly growing hyperscale data center market, ventilation solutions for cleanroom environments in the bio-\npharmaceutical, semiconductor, medical and agriculture markets, and highly custom, air handlers and modular\nsolutions for a vast array of markets. BASX consists of operations at our Redmond, OR manufacturing facilities.\nFor more information on our business segments' financial position and results of operations, refer to Note 22,\n\"Segments,\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements.\nBusiness and Marketing Strategy\nOur products serve the commercial, industrial, data center, and cleanroom markets within the HVAC equipment\nindustry. Our business strategy involves mass semi-customization leveraging flexible computer-aided manufacturing\nsystems to produce highly configurable equipment. We differentiate from other HVAC manufacturers by combining\nthe low unit costs of mass production processes with the flexibility of individual customization.\nThrough a collaborative effort with our network of independent sales representatives, we engineer and manufacture\nproducts and systems that best serve the buyer's unique needs and applications.\nOur go-to-market strategy is centered around customers and markets that demand HVAC equipment with\nextraordinary performance and durability, greater energy efficiency, and best overall value. We manufacture\nequipment with more configurability than other \"standard\" offerings found in the HVAC equipment industry and we\ndo not manufacture equipment that has not been pre-specified by our customers with an emphasis on high customer\nsatisfaction and reduced product delivery channel time.\n2\nSince day one, AAON has been dedicated to manufacturing and product leadership with innovation through research\nand development with a specific emphasis on energy performance, durability, efficiency, and indoor air quality.\nAs a result of our strategy to engineer and manufacture innovative HVAC products of the highest performance,\nefficiency, and value, we are naturally committed to meeting regulatory and certification standards of the relevant\nstandard setting bodies, including the Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute (“AHRI”); the\nAmerican National Standards Institute (\"ANSI\"); American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning\nEngineers (\"ASHRAE\"); the AMCA and the International Organization for Standardization (\"ISO\").\nTo date, our sales have been primarily derived from the domestic market. Foreign sales accounted for approximately\n$39.9 million, $27.6 million, and $14.8 million of our net sales in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. As a\npercentage of net sales, foreign sales accounted for approximately 3.4%, 3.1%, and 3.0% of our net sales in each of\nthose years, respectively.\nProducts - AAON Oklahoma and AAON Coil Products\nOur rooftop and condensing units are primarily installed on commercial or industrial structures. Our air handling\nunits, self-contained units, geothermal/water-source heat pumps, and coils are suitable for all sizes of commercial\nand industrial buildings.\nThe size of these markets is determined primarily by the number of commercial and industrial building completions\nand replacement demand from existing buildings. The replacement market consists of products installed to replace\nexisting units/components that are worn or damaged and products to upgrade certain components, such as low\nleakage dampers, high efficiency heat exchangers and modern controls components.\nThe commercial and industrial new construction markets are subject to cyclical fluctuations in that they generally\nlag behind the housing market. The housing market, in turn, is influenced by cyclical factors such as interest rates,\ninflation, consumer spending habits, employment rates, the state of the economy and other macroeconomic\nfactors. When new construction is down, we emphasize the replacement market. The ratio of sales for new\nconstruction versus replacement is related to various factors. Generally, the cyclicality of the new construction\nmarket impacts this ratio the most over an economic cycle.\nWe purchase certain components, fabricate sheet metal and tubing and then assemble and test the finished products.\nOur primary finished product consists of a single unit system that generates heating and cooling in a self-contained\ncabinet, referred to in the industry as “unitary product”. Our other finished products are coils, air handling units,\ncondensing units, makeup air units, energy recovery units, rooftop units, geothermal/water-source heat pumps, and\ncontrols.\nWe offer three groups of rooftop units: the RQ Series, consisting of five cooling sizes ranging from two to six tons;\nthe RN Series, offered in 28 cooling sizes ranging from six to 140 tons; and the RZ Series, which is offered in 15\ncooling sizes ranging from 45 to 261 tons.\nWhen configured as Air-Source Heat Pumps (\"ASHP\"), the RQ and RN Series (2 to 50 tons), are capable of\noperating in ambient outside temperatures as low as zero degrees Fahrenheit. Known as the AAON Alpha Class, our\nomni-climate ASHPs are a critical solution that meet the increasing demand for building decarbonization. Utilizing\nvariable speed technology, these innovative ASHPs provide energy-efficient heating and cooling throughout the year\nin virtually any climate.\nIn addition to our legendary RTUs, we offer the SA, SB and M2 Series as indoor packaged, water-cooled or\ngeothermal/water-source heat pump self-contained units with cooling capacities of three to 70 tons.\nOur condensing unit, the CF Series, is available from two to 70 tons and can be configured as an Alpha Class ASHP.\nOur air handling units consist of the indoor H3 and V3 Series and the modular M2 Series, as well as air handling\nunit configurations of the RQ, RN, RZ, and SA Series units.\nOur energy recovery option applicable to our RQ, RN, RZ, and SB units, as well as our H3, V3, and M2 Series air\nhandling units, responds to the U.S. Clean Air Act mandate to increase fresh air in commercial structures. Our\nproducts are designed to compete on the higher quality end of standardized products.\nOur RN, RQ, M2, and SB Series, are AHRI certified in accordance with ANSI/AHRI/ASHRAE/ISO 13256.\nOur unitary products (RQ and RN Series) are certified with AHRI and the US Department of Energy to ANSI/AHRI\n210/240 up to five tons capacity and ANSI/AHRI 340/360 up to 63 tons capacity.\n3\nPerformance characteristics of our products range in cooling capacity from two to 261 tons and in heating capacity\nfrom 7,200 to 4,500,000 British Thermal Units (\"BTUs\"). Many of our products far exceed these minimum\nstandards and are among the highest efficiency products currently available in the market.\nA typical commercial building installation requires one ton of air conditioning for every 300-400 square feet or, for\na 100,000 square foot building, 250 tons of air conditioning, which can involve multiple units.\nOur packaged RTUs with two stage or variable speed compressors are optimized with high efficiency evaporator\nand condenser coils and variable speed fans, leading to an AHRI Certified performance up to 20.3 seasonal energy\nefficiency ratio (\"SEER\") and 22.5 integrated energy efficiency ratio (\"IEER\"). AAON H3/V3 Series energy\nrecovery wheel air handling units provide energy efficient 100% outside air ventilation by recovering energy that\nwould otherwise be exhausted from a building.\nIn addition to the equipment we manufacture, we design and produce high-performance controls solutions that\nenhances our equipment’s unique features and capabilities. Our controls division provides factory-developed and\ntested control options for Variable Air Volume, Make-Up Air, Single Zone VAV, Constant Volume, and Zoning\nsystems associated with our products and other HVAC related equipment.\nWe offer several controls options: the Orion Controller, factory installed customer provided controls, and terminal\nblock for field installed controls. Most of our controls are Underwriters Laboratories category ZPVI2 compliant and\nBACnet Testing Laboratories certified which ensures our products meet internationally recognized standards for\nsafety, traceability, conformance, and production quality. Our economizer function is California Title 24 certified to\nminimize energy consumption. Our proven sequences of operation optimize the performance of our HVAC units.\nOut of the box, our controls are user-friendly and configurable to provide a variety of HVAC unit application\noptions, in addition, we are able to customize our controls to meet customers’ unique requirements.\nProducts - BASX\nThe products BASX manufactures are highly engineered and customized products, fully complementing our legacy\nbusiness. BASX data center cooling solutions are focused on providing highly configurable, purpose-built\nequipment with a focus on efficiency, speed of deployment, and quality. High-performance air-cooled chiller\nsolutions are provided with indirect airside economization and optional adiabatic assisted cooling, and are designed\nto integrate with high performance computing systems requiring direct to chip cooling. White space process cooling\nsolutions include fan coil walls, computer room air handling (\"CRAH\") units, overhead fan coils, in-row coolers,\nand chilled water air handlers. Packaged solutions include coupled economizing chillers with integrated air handling\nunits, direct evaporative coolers, and packaged direct expansion (\"DX\") solutions with airside economizers.\nBASX cleanroom products are built to provide environmental control serving critical processes and high-fidelity\ncontrol for precise industry requirements. Process cooling solutions include recirculation air handling units and\nmake up air handling units including integration of piping systems and controls. Environmental control solutions\ninclude modular cleanroom environments, fan filter units, filtered ceiling grids with integral flush mount lighting,\npressurized plenums with integral ceiling grids, and hospital surgical suites.\nBASX custom air handling products are primarily used in commercial, industrial, healthcare, and institutional\nfacilities employing chilled water cooling, packaged direct expansion, heating hot water, indirect gas direct heat,\nhumidification, dehumidification, filtration, and integrated controls. BASX manufactures plenum fans for\nintegration into air handling units as well as for replacement applications. BASX also offers integrated sound\nperformance solutions.\nAir Quality Products\nThe ASHRAE, a professional association with a goal of advancing HVAC systems designs and construction,\nestablished an Epidemic Task Force in 2020 and determined several recommendations to mitigate the spread of the\nvirus, including humidity control, air filtration, increased outdoor air ventilation, and air disinfection.\nHumidity control - We continue to lead the market in developing energy efficient humidity control with the use of\nvariable capacity compressors and modulating hot gas reheat. Designing HVAC systems with superior humidity\ncontrol allows building management to maintain ASHRAE’s recommended ambient relative humidity levels of\n40%-60%, the ideal level to inactivate viruses in the air and on surfaces.\nAir Filtration - We standardized a design that uses a backward curved fan wheel, which can accommodate higher\nairflow and static pressure required for the ASHRAE recommended MERV 13 filtration, the minimum filter level\nfor virus mitigation, with very little reconfiguration. Prior to 2020, a vast majority of commercial buildings used\n4\nfiltration levels of MERV 4 to MERV 8, which has always been acceptable for filtering out typical particulates in\nthe air stream.\nOutdoor Air Ventilation - Our innovative use of energy recovery wheels and energy recovery plates combined with\nits superior humidity control design can help building management follow outdoor ventilation air recommendations\nwhile limiting an increase of energy usage and maintaining recommended humidity levels. AAON has been the\nleader in Dedicated Outdoor Air Systems (\"DOAS\") for many years.\nOn October 31st, 2022, the US Department of Energy (\"DOE\") released their final ruling concerning DX-DOAS.\nThese are systems that condition primarily fresh outside air streams to maintain space comfort and air quality.\nStarting May 1, 2024 the DOE will begin regulating the efficiency of dedicated outdoor air units separately from\nother comfort cooling systems. AAON perceives this as an advantage because our equipment is designed for higher\nenergy efficiency and superior part load and dehumidification performance than competitors who focus on the initial\nsale price of their equipment or do not participate in the certification programs offered by AHRI.\nAir Disinfection - Our basic design characteristics allow for an easy installation of ultraviolet lighting equipment. In\naddition to this equipment offered as options in new units sold, our basic design characteristics allow for easy\ninstallation in units already used in the field.\nOverall, we are well positioned to accommodate the heightened demand for features that can help mitigate virus\ntransmission and improve indoor air quality. The features that ASHRAE recommends require premium designs and\nconfigurations that are standard in our units. As a result, we are able to incorporate air quality features into our units\nat a minimal price premium and with no delivery delay.\nRepresentatives\nAs of December 31, 2023, we employ a sales staff of 82 individuals and utilize approximately 59 independent\nmanufacturer representatives’ organizations (“Representatives”) having 139 offices to market our products primarily\nin the United States and Canada. Sales are made directly to the contractor or end user, with shipments being made\nfrom our Tulsa, Oklahoma, Longview, Texas, Parkville, Missouri, or Redmond, Oregon facilities to the job site.\nHistorically, our products and sales strategy focused on niche markets and applications. However, market trends\nrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic and indoor air quality, decarbonization and energy efficiency, and higher energy\nprices, have positioned us to focus on a wider spectrum of the nonresidential HVAC equipment industry. The\ntargeted markets for our equipment are customers seeking products of higher performance and better quality than\nthose offered, and/or options not offered, by standardized manufacturers.\nTo support and service our customers and the ultimate consumer, we provide parts availability through our\nRepresentatives' sales offices, as well as our two Tulsa, Oklahoma operated retail parts stores, to serve the local\nmarkets. We also have factory service organizations at each of our facilities. Additionally, a number of the\nRepresentatives we utilize have their own service organizations, which, in connection with us, provide the necessary\nwarranty work and/or normal service to customers.\nWe have a program focused on increasing service capabilities across our North America Representative network, by\nassisting Representatives with business plans, providing training, and creating a cohesive network of service\norganizations to better meet the operational and maintenance needs of our customer base.\nWarranties\nOur product warranty policy is the earlier of one year from the date of first use or 18 months from date of shipment\nfor parts only, including controls; 18 months for data center cooling solutions and cleanroom systems; five years for\ncompressors (if applicable); 15 years on aluminized steel gas-fired heat exchangers (if applicable); 25 years on\nstainless steel heat exchangers (if applicable); and ten years on gas-fired heat exchangers in our historical RL\nproducts (if applicable). Our warranty policy for the RQ series covers parts for two years from date of unit shipment.\nOur warranty policy for the WH and WV Series geothermal/water-source heat pumps covers parts for five years\nfrom the date of installation.\nThe Company also sells extended warranties on parts for various lengths of time ranging from six months to ten\nyears. Revenue for these separately priced warranties is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the\nseparately priced warranty period.\n5\nMajor Customers\nFor the years-ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, Texas AirSystems accounted for approximately 13.8%,\n12.4%, and 11.7% of our sales, respectively. Through portfolio groups, Meriton has an ownership interest in Texas\nAirSystems and certain other of our sales representatives. The aggregate sales percentages through Meriton-\naffiliated groups that are in addition to Texas AirSystems’ sales for the years-ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and\n2021 accounted for an additional 2.3%, 1.4% and 2.7%, respectively. Two other similar groups, Ambient and\nHobbs/Insight, share common ownership of some of our other sales representatives through portfolio groups and for\nthe year-ended December 31, 2023, aggregate sales through their portfolio groups accounted for approximately\n11.5% and 10.2% of our sales, respectively. Sales through the portfolio groups of either Ambient or Hobbs/Insight\ndid not account for 10% or more of our sales for any years-ended prior to December 31, 2023.\nBacklog\nOur backlog as of February 1, 2024 was approximately $507.7 million. Management considers the orders that make\nup the backlog to be firm commitments with minimal risk of cancellation. This is consistent with historical trends as\nwe rarely receive cancellations, even during recessionary times. Nonetheless, orders are subject to cancellation, in\nwhich case, cancellation charges apply up to the full price of the equipment. After an order is deemed firm and is\nentered into the backlog, lead times to fulfill orders for AAON Oklahoma and AAON Coil Products is generally\naround 11 weeks. Orders for BASX product, including orders built at AAON Coil Products' Longview location are\ntypically placed months in advance of requested delivery to secure production for those projects. As a result,\nportions of the backlog do not turn over within our 11 week lead time.\nCompetition\nOur AAON Oklahoma and AAON Coil Products product offerings primarily compete with Lennox (Lennox\nInternational, Inc.), Trane (Trane Technologies plc), York International (Johnson Controls International PLC),\nCarrier (Carrier Global Corporation), and Daikin (Daikin Industries). Our BASX product offerings primarily\ncompete with Vertiv (Vertiv Holdings Co.), STULZ (STULZ Air Technology Systems, Inc.), Munters, Silent Aire\n(Johnson Controls International PLC), Nortek (Nortek Air Solutions), and Engineered Air.\nAll of our publicly traded competitors are substantially larger and have greater resources than we do. Our products\ncompete on the basis of total value, quality, function, serviceability, efficiency, availability of product, reliability,\nproduct line recognition, and acceptability of sales outlets. Historically, our premium equipment was sold at a higher\naverage price compared to most of the competition. In the replacement market and other owner-controlled\npurchases, we have been successful at taking market share due to the total value proposition and lower cost of\nownership our products provide to building owners over the life span of the equipment. In the new construction\nmarket where the contractor is the purchasing decision maker, we were often at a competitive disadvantage because\nof the emphasis placed on initial cost. However, due to operational efficiency improvements we made over the last\nseveral years, the cost of our semi-custom equipment is more comparable to the standard equipment market. As a\nresult, the value proposition of our higher quality equipment is now more attractive, making us more competitive in\nboth the new construction and replacement markets.\nResources\nSources and Availability of Raw Materials\nThe most important materials we purchase are steel, copper, and aluminum. We also purchase from other\nmanufacturers certain components, including coils, compressors, electric motors, and electrical controls used in our\nproducts. We attempt to obtain the lowest possible cost in our purchases of raw materials and components,\nconsistent with meeting specified quality standards. We are not dependent upon any one source for raw materials or\nthe major components of our manufactured products. By having multiple suppliers, we believe that we will have\nadequate sources of supplies to meet our manufacturing requirements for the foreseeable future.\nWe attempt to limit the impact of price fluctuations on these materials by entering into cancellable and non-\ncancellable contracts with our major suppliers for periods of six to 18 months. We expect to receive delivery of raw\nmaterials from our contracts for use in our manufacturing operations.\n6\nWorking Capital Practices\nWorking capital practices in the industry center on inventories and accounts receivable. Our management regularly\nreviews our working capital with a view of maintaining the lowest level consistent with requirements of anticipated\nlevels of operation and expected supply chain restraints. Our working capital requirements are generally met by cash\nflow from operations and a bank revolving credit facility, which currently permits borrowings up to $200.0 million\nand had a $38.3 million outstanding balance at December 31, 2023. Borrowings available under the revolving credit\nfacility at December 31, 2023, were $159.4 million. We believe that we will have sufficient funds available to meet\nour working capital needs for the foreseeable future.\nResearch and Development\nOur products are engineered for performance, flexibility, and serviceability. This has become a critical factor in\ncompeting in the HVAC equipment industry. We must continually develop new and improved products in order to\ncompete effectively and to meet evolving regulatory standards in all of our major product lines.\nWe self-sponsor our R&D activities, rather than needing to be customer-sponsored. R&D activities have involved\nthe RQ, RN, and RZ (rooftop units), H3, SA, V3, and M2 (air handling units), CF (condensing units), and the SA\nand SB (self-contained units), as well as component evaluation and refinement, development of control systems and\nnew product development. R&D expenses incurred were approximately $43.7 million, $46.8 million, and $16.6\nmillion in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The significant increase for the year ended December 31, 2022 was\nrelated to the inclusion of a full year of operations of BASX (Note 4) as well as our commitment to product\nperformance and innovation.\nOur NAIC research and development laboratory facility includes many unique capabilities, which, to our\nknowledge, exist nowhere else in the world. A few features of the NAIC include supply, return, and outside sound\ntesting at actual load conditions, testing of up to a 300 ton air conditioning system, up to a 540 ton chiller system,\nand 80 million BTU/hr of gas heating test capacity. The NAIC carries accreditation from AMCA for standards\nAMCA 210 (aerodynamic performance rating) & AMCA 300 (reverberant room sound testing). Environmental\napplication testing capabilities include -20 to 130°F testing conditions, up to 8 inches per hour rain testing, up to 2\ninches per hour snow testing, and up to 50 mph wind testing. We believe we have the largest sound-testing chamber\nin the world for testing heating and air conditioning equipment and are not aware of any similar labs that can\nconduct this testing while putting the equipment under full environmental load. The unique capabilities of the NAIC\nwill enable us to lead the industry in the development of quiet, energy efficient commercial and industrial heating\nand air conditioning equipment.\nThe NAIC currently houses twelve testing chambers. These testing chambers allow us to meet and maintain AHRI\nand DOE certification and solidify the Company’s industry position as a technological leader in the manufacturing\nof HVAC equipment. Current voluntary industry certification programs and government regulations only go up to\n63 tons of air conditioning. The NAIC contains both a 100 ton and a 300 ton chamber, allowing us to uniquely prove\nto customers our capacity and efficiency on these larger units.\nThe NAIC was designed to test products well beyond the standard AHRI rating points and allows us to offer testing\nservices on our equipment throughout our range of product application. This capability is vital for critical facilities\nwhere the units must perform properly and allows our customers to verify the performance of our units in advance,\nrather than after installation. These same capabilities have allowed AAON to develop low ambient air source heat\npump products that are unique in being able to address the growing need for these type units that address\nelectrification initiatives and commitments.\nOur Parkville, Missouri location is home to our new Electronics Prototyping Lab (\"Lab\") featuring a fully functional\nSMD (Surface Mount Device) production line. The production line incorporates automated pick-and-place\nequipment able to quickly and accurately place devices as small as 0.1mm by 0.2mm, the same technology scale\nused in cell phones. The production line also includes a profiled reflow oven to assure reliability in the finished\nprototypes. The Lab has allowed us to increase our speed to market and incorporate cutting-edge technology into our\ncontrol designs. In addition, it allows our Controls Engineering team to utilize their hardware and software\ndevelopment skills to outpace our competitors in responding to market changes and upsets.\nPatents, Trademarks, Licenses, and Concessions\nWe do not consider any patents, trademarks, licenses, or concessions to be material to our business operations, other\nthan those described below.\n7\nWe hold several patents that relate to the design and use of our products. We consider these patents important, but\nno single patent is material to the overall conduct of our business. We proactively obtain patents to further our\nstrategic intellectual property objectives. We own certain trademarks we consider important in the marketing of our\nproducts and services, and we protect our marks through national registrations and common law rights. Our patents\nhave legal terms of 20 years with expiration dates ranging from 2023 to 2039.\nThe Company’s trademarks, certain of which are material to its business, are registered or otherwise legally\nprotected in the U.S.\nSeasonality\nHistorically, sales of our products were moderately seasonal with the peak period being May-October of each year\ndue to timing of construction projects being directly related to warmer weather. However, in recent years, given the\nincrease in demand of our products and increase in our backlog, sales has become more constant throughout the\nyear.\nEnvironmental & Regulatory Matters\nLaws concerning the environment that affect or could affect our operations include, among others, the Clean Water\nAct, the Clean Air Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the\nNational Environmental Policy Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, regulations promulgated under these Acts\nand any other federal, state or local laws or regulations governing environmental matters. We believe that we are in\ncompliance with these laws and that future compliance will not materially affect our earnings or competitive\nposition.\nSince our founding in 1987, we have maintained a commitment to design, develop, manufacture, and deliver heating\nand cooling products to perform beyond all expectations and to demonstrate our quality and value to our customers.\nOur equipment is designed with energy efficiency in mind, without sacrificing premium features and options. In\naddition to our high standard of product performance, is a commitment to sustainability for our employees, our\nstockholders, and our customers. We strive to conduct our business in a socially responsible and ethical manner with\na focus on environmental stewardship, team member safety and community engagement. We comply with industry\nregulations and requirements while pursuing responsible economic growth and profitability.\nIn 2023, we published our fifth annual environmental, social, and governance (\"ESG\") report sharing our approach\nin the material areas of stakeholder engagement, innovation and efficiency, environmental responsibility, climate\nchange, occupational health and safety, talent attraction and retention, diversity and inclusion, community\nengagement and investment, corporate governance and ethics and compliance. The report also highlights\nachievements and long-term targets related to greenhouse gas emissions, hazardous waste recycling, and non-fossil\nfuel consuming products. We participate in a sustainability benchmarking initiative, the Sustainability Alliance\nScor3card, through which we monitor and report in the material areas of energy, material management, water,\ncommunity stewardship, transportation, communication, and health. We achieved Platinum level in this program in\n2023 and 2022. Our ESG committee provides oversight for ESG activities, ESG report development and an internal\ngrassroots sustainability committee provides education opportunities, communications and recommendations to the\nCompany on a regular basis.\nWe are committed to environmental responsibility and continue to make progress toward reducing greenhouse gas\n(\"GHG\") emissions, increasing paint byproduct recycling from our facilities and increasing the percentage of non-\nfossil fuel powered units we produce. Our approach toward emissions reduction and climate change includes product\nsolutions for our customers and improvements to our own facilities. Approximately 36% of our energy portfolio is\ncurrently derived from renewable sources, and the Company's Scope 1 and 2 emissions (emissions that occur from\nsources that are controlled or owned by an organization and emissions associated with the purchase of electricity,\nsteam, heat, or cooling) are being tracked. We opted into an additional percentage of renewable energy at our Tulsa,\nOklahoma facilities in 2022, continued to invest and partner on projects that reduce GHG emissions globally and\nhave begun the transition to the lower global warming potential R-454B refrigerant. We continue to develop and\nmanufacture non-fossil fuel consuming units to provide the most sustainable commercial HVAC equipment in the\nmarket and announced the zero degree cold air-source heat pump in 2022 as a critical solution that meets the\nincreasing demand for building decarbonization in cold climates.\nIn the area of energy efficiency and conservation, our Tulsa, Oklahoma and Longview, Texas facilities have\ntransitioned to nearly 100% LED lighting in our facilities leading to considerable cost savings and reduced energy\nconsumption. Our Redmond, Oregon facilities are installing LED lights into any new fixtures in their current facility\nand working towards retrofitting old fixtures to LED. We participate in an energy demand response program through\n8\nthe public utility provider to reduce demand during peak hours. Energy efficiency has been a priority not only in\nproduct development, but also in overall capital investments which include the acquisition of new, energy efficient\nequipment for the production floor, new high-speed overhead facility doors, the installation of new HVAC\nequipment, building control systems, the application of heat and light reflective material to production facilities,\nalong with other behavioral-based energy efficiency changes. We are tracking our energy usage intensity before and\nafter these updates. We also opened the Customer Exploration Center in 2023, a net-zero facility powered by solar\nand geothermal energy.\nIn the area of material management, we focus on recycling, reducing, reusing and sourcing more environmentally-\nfriendly materials into our processes. At our Tulsa, Oklahoma and Longview, Texas facilities, we recycled over\n13,678 tons, 14,928 tons, and 13,793 tons of metal in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Also, through our\npartnership with a waste to energy facility, we successfully diverted over 694 tons, 668 tons, and 460 tons of waste\nfrom landfills in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. We have identified paint product recycling partners at both our\nTulsa, Oklahoma and Longview, Texas facilities. We also recycle paper, wood, and cardboard where available. We\ncontinue to innovate ways to reduce and reuse shipping packaging between facilities and identify new opportunities\nto reduce or reuse items in our production and administrative areas.\nHuman Capital Resources\nOur employees are not represented by unions or other collective bargaining agreements. Management considers its\nrelations with our employees to be good. The following table represents the number of our direct employees and\ncontract personnel we employed on each respective date:\nAs of As of As of\nFebruary 20, 2024 February 22, 2023 February 23, 2022\nAAON Oklahoma 2,663 2,474 1,979\nAAON Coil Products 586 681 574\nBASX 607 511 328\nTotal employees 3,856 3,666 2,881\nOur key human capital measures include employee safety, turnover, absenteeism, and production. We frequently\nbenchmark our compensation practices and benefits programs against those of comparable industries and in the\ngeographic areas where our facilities are located. We believe that our compensation and employee benefits are\ncompetitive and allow us to attract and retain skilled and unskilled labor throughout our organization. Some of our\nnotable health, welfare, and retirement benefits include:\n• Employee medical plan (with 175% employer health saving plan match)\n• 401(k) Plan (with 175% employer match)\n• Profit sharing bonus plan\n• Tuition assistance program\n• Paid time off\n• Paid parental leave\n• Military pay\n• Short-term and long-term disability\n• Identity theft protection\n• Group life insurance\nAvailable Information\nOur Internet website address is http://www.aaon.com. Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form\n10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or\n15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, will be available free of charge through our Internet\nwebsite as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC.\nThe information on our website is not a part of, or incorporated by reference into, this annual report on Form 10-K.\nCopies of any materials we file with the SEC can also be obtained free of charge through the SEC’s website at http://\nwww.sec.gov, at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549, or by calling the\nSEC at 1-800-732-0330.\n9\nItem 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe following risks and uncertainties may affect our performance and results of operations. The discussion below\ncontains “forward-looking statements” as outlined in the Forward-Looking Statements section above. Our ability to\nmitigate risks may cause our future results to materially differ from what we currently anticipate. Additionally, the\nability of our competitors to react to material risks will affect our future results.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nOur business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, and stock price can be adversely affected\nby pandemics, epidemics, or other public health emergencies, such as COVID-19.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic, and the President of the\nUnited States declared the COVID-19 outbreak a national emergency. The outbreak resulted in governments around\nthe world implementing increasingly stringent measures to help control the spread of the virus, including\nquarantines, “shelter in place” and “stay at home” orders, travel restrictions, business curtailments, school closures,\nvaccination or testing mandates and other measures. In addition, governments and central banks in several parts of\nthe world enacted fiscal and monetary stimulus measures to counteract the impacts of COVID-19.\nWe are considered a critical infrastructure industry, as defined by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\nAlthough we have continued to operate our facilities to date consistent with federal guidelines and state and local\norders, the outbreak of COVID-19 and any preventive or protective actions taken by governmental authorities may\nhave a material adverse effect on our operations, supply chain, customers, and transportation networks, including\nbusiness shutdowns or disruptions. During 2023, 2022, and 2021 we experienced some price increases in our\ncomponents and raw materials, which appear to be a result of COVID-19 and subsequent inflation, as well as supply\nchain challenges related to certain manufacturing parts.\nEven though the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may experience materially adverse impacts to our business\ndue to any resulting economic recession or depression. Additionally, concerns over the economic impact of\nCOVID-19 have caused extreme volatility in financial and other capital markets which may adversely impact our\nstock price and our ability to access capital markets. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our\nbusiness and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this\nAnnual Report, such as those relating to our products and financial performance.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur business can be hurt by economic conditions.\nOur business is affected by a number of economic factors, including the level of economic activity in the markets in\nwhich we operate. Sales in the commercial and industrial new construction markets correlate to the number of new\nhomes and buildings that are built, which in turn is influenced by cyclical factors such as interest rates, inflation,\nconsumer spending habits, employment rates, and other macroeconomic factors over which we have no control. In\nthe HVAC business, a decline in economic activity as a result of these cyclical or other factors typically results in a\ndecline in new construction and replacement purchases which could impact our sales volume and profitability.\nOur results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted by the loss of one or more\nmajor customers.\nFrom time to time in the past we derived a significant portion of our sales from a limited number of customers, and\nsuch concentration may continue in the future. The loss of, or significant reduction in sales to significant customers\n(or a related portfolio group of customers) could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial\ncondition and cash flow. Further, the addition of new major customers in the future could increase our customer\nconcentration risks as described above.\nOur results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted by the loss of a major third-\nparty representative.\nWe are dependent on our third-party representatives to market and sell our products. If such relationships were\nterminated or impaired for any reason, it could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and\nprofits. Certain of our competitors with greater financial resources than us could target our third-party\nrepresentatives for exclusive sales channels. We may not be able to secure additional third-party representatives who\nwill effectively market our products in certain geographical areas. In addition, adding new representatives requires\n10\nadditional administrative efforts and costs. If we are unable to establish new representative relationships or continue\ncurrent relationships, or terminate and replace our third-party representatives, our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may incur material costs as a result of warranty and product liability claims that would negatively affect\nour profitability.\nThe development, manufacture, sale and use of our products involve a risk of warranty and product liability\nclaims. Our product liability insurance policies have limits that, if exceeded, may result in material costs that would\nhave an adverse effect on our future profitability. An excess of or significant claim(s) could lead to the cancellation\nof our polices and the loss of and inability to find additional insurance carriers. In addition, warranty claims are not\ncovered by our product liability insurance and there may be types of product liability claims that are also not\ncovered by our product liability insurance.\nWe depend on our senior leadership team and the loss of our Chief Executive Officer or one or more key\nemployees or an inability to attract and retain highly skilled employees could adversely affect our business.\nOur success depends largely upon the continued services of our officers and senior leadership team. In particular,\nour Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\"), Gary D. Fields, is critical to our vision, strategic direction, culture, and overall\nbusiness success. Furthermore, Mr. Fields' extensive industry knowledge and sales-channel experience would be\ndifficult to replace. We also rely on our senior leadership team in the areas of research and development, marketing,\nproduction, sales, and general and administrative functions. From time to time, there may be changes in our senior\nleadership team resulting from the hiring or departure of senior leadership team members, which could disrupt our\nbusiness. While we have a robust succession plan in place for each one of our officers and senior leadership team\nmembers, the loss of one or more could have a serious adverse effect on our business.\nWe do not maintain key-man insurance for Gary D. Fields or any other member of our senior leadership team. Other\nthan the employment agreements negotiated with certain employees of BASX, we do not have employment\nagreements with our officers or senior leadership team members that require them to continue to work for us for any\nspecified period and, therefore, they could terminate their employment with us at any time. The employment\nagreements with the employees of BASX guarantee certain compensation, such as salary and benefits, and\nemployment terms. We do not believe the terms or conditions of these agreements are outside the standard\nexpectation of another employee at a similar level.\nOperations may be affected by natural disasters, especially since most of our operations are performed at a\nsingle location.\nNatural disasters such as tornadoes, ice storms and fires, as well as accidents, acts of terror, infection, and other\nfactors beyond our control could adversely affect our operations. Our facilities are in areas where tornadoes are\nlikely to occur, and the majority of our operations are at our Tulsa, Oklahoma facilities. With the acquisition of\nBASX in 2021, we now have operations in an area that is, historically, impacted by wild fires. The effects of natural\ndisasters and other events could damage our facilities and equipment and force a temporary halt to manufacturing\nand other operations, and such events could consequently cause severe damage to our business. We maintain\ninsurance against these sorts of events; however, this is not guaranteed to cover all the losses and damages incurred.\nFurthermore, we may experience significant increases in our insurance premium costs in relation to these matters\nthat may have a material adverse effect upon our business, liquidity, financial condition, or results of operations.\nIf we are unable to hire, develop or retain employees, it could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe compete to hire new employees and then seek to train them to develop their skills. We may not be able to\nsuccessfully recruit, develop, and retain the personnel we need. Unplanned turnover or failure to hire and retain a\ndiverse, skilled workforce, could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our results of operations.\nVariability in self-insurance liability estimates could impact our results of operations.\nWe self-insure for certain employee health insurance and workers’ compensation insurance coverage up to a\npredetermined level, beyond which we maintain stop-loss insurance from a third-party insurer. Our aggregate\nexposure varies from year to year based upon the number of participants in our insurance plans. We estimate our\nself-insurance liabilities using an analysis provided by our claims administrator and our historical claims experience.\nOur accruals for insurance reserves reflect these estimates and other management judgments, which are subject to a\n11\nhigh degree of variability. If the number or severity of claims for which we self-insure increases, it could cause a\nmaterial and adverse change to our reserves for self-insurance liabilities, as well as to our earnings.\nRisks Related to Our Brand and Product Offerings\nWe may not be able to compete favorably in the highly competitive HVAC business.\nCompetition in our various markets could cause us to reduce our prices or lose market share, which could have an\nadverse effect on our future financial results. Substantially all of the markets in which we participate are highly\ncompetitive. The most significant competitive factors we face are product reliability, product performance, service,\nmanufacturing lead-times, and price, with the relative importance of these factors varying among our product\nline. Other factors that affect competition in the HVAC market include the development and application of new\ntechnologies and an increasing emphasis on the development of more efficient HVAC products. Moreover, new\nproduct introductions are an important factor in the market categories in which our products compete. Several of our\ncompetitors have greater financial and other resources than we have, allowing them to invest in more extensive\nresearch and development. We may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competition and\ncurrent and future competitive pressures faced by us may materially adversely affect our business and results of\noperations.\nWe may not be able to successfully develop and market new products.\nOur future success will depend upon our continued investment in research and new product development and our\nability to continue to achieve new technological advances in the HVAC industry. Our inability to continue to\nsuccessfully develop and market new products or our inability to implement technological advances on a pace\nconsistent with that of our competitors could lead to a material adverse effect on our business and results of\noperations. Furthermore, our continued investment in new product development may render certain legacy products\nand components obsolete resulting in increased inventory obsolescence expense that may have a material adverse\neffect upon our financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Material Sourcing and Supply\nWe may be adversely affected by problems in the availability, or increases in the prices, of raw materials and\ncomponents.\nProblems in the availability, or increases in the prices, of raw materials or components could depress our sales or\nincrease the costs of our products. We are dependent upon components purchased from third parties, as well as raw\nmaterials such as steel, copper and aluminum. Occasionally, we enter into cancellable and non-cancellable contracts\non terms from six to 18 months for raw materials and components. However, if a key supplier is unable or unwilling\nto meet our supply requirements, we could experience supply interruptions or cost increases, either of which could\nhave an adverse effect on our gross profit.\nWe risk having losses resulting from the use of non-cancellable contracts.\nHistorically, we have attempted to limit the impact of price fluctuations on commodities by entering into non-\ncancellable contracts with our major suppliers for periods of six to 18 months. We expect to receive delivery of raw\nmaterials from our contracts for use in our manufacturing operations. These contracts are not accounted for using\nhedge accounting since they meet the normal purchases and sales exemption. The use of such contracts could cause\nus to forego the economic benefits we would otherwise realize if prices were to change in our favor. Additionally,\nshould there be a downturn in the market, we could be committed to purchase more materials than necessary for our\nproduction and carry excess inventory which could result in additional costs to the business.\n12\nRisks Related to Electronic Data Processing and Digital Information\nOur business is subject to the risks of interruptions by cybersecurity attacks.\nWe depend upon information technology infrastructure, including network, hardware and software systems to\nconduct our business. Despite our implementation of network and other cybersecurity measures, our information\ntechnology system and networks could be disrupted due to technological problems, a cyber-attack, acts of terrorism,\nsevere weather, a solar event, an electromagnetic event, a natural disaster, the age and condition of information\ntechnology assets, human error, or other reasons. To date, we have not experienced a material impact to our business\nor operations resulting from cyber-security or other similar information attacks, but due to the ever-evolving attack\nmethods, as well as the increased amount and level of sophistication of these attacks, our security measures may not\nbe adequate to protect against highly targeted sophisticated cyber-attacks, or other improper disclosures of\nconfidential and/or sensitive information. Additionally, we may have access to confidential or other sensitive\ninformation of our customers, which, despite our efforts to protect, may be vulnerable to security breaches, theft, or\nother improper disclosure. Any cyber-related attack or other improper disclosure of confidential information could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, as well as other negative consequences, including significant damage\nto our reputation, litigation, regulatory actions, and increased cost.\nWe are reliant on information technology.\nWe are reliant on information technology in all aspects of our business, operated and maintained by the Company as\nwell as under control of third parties. If we do not invest sufficient capital in a timely manner to acquire, develop, or\nimplement new information technologies or maintain or upgrade current information technologies, we could suffer\noutages as well as be at a competitive disadvantage within our industry which could have a material adverse effect\nupon our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Governmental Regulation and Policies\nExposure to environmental liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur future profitability could be adversely affected by current or future environmental laws. We are subject to\nextensive and changing federal, state and local laws and regulations designed to protect the environment in the\nUnited States and in other parts of the world. These laws and regulations could impose liability for remediation costs\nand result in civil or criminal penalties in case of non-compliance. Compliance with environmental laws increases\nour costs of doing business. Because these laws are subject to frequent change, we are unable to predict the future\ncosts resulting from environmental compliance.\nWe are subject to potentially extreme governmental regulations and policies.\nWe always face the possibility of new governmental regulations, policies and trade agreements which could have a\nsubstantial or even extreme negative effect on our operations and profitability. Several intrusive component part\ngovernmental regulations are in process. If these proposals become final rules, the effect would be the regulation of\ncompressors and fans in products for which the Department of Energy does not have current authority. This could\naffect equipment we currently manufacture and could have an impact on our product design, operations, and\nprofitability.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and\naccountability concerning the supply of certain minerals, known as “conflict minerals”, originating from the\nDemocratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. As a result, in August 2012, the SEC adopted annual\ndisclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use conflict minerals in their products. Accordingly,\nwe began our reasonable country of origin inquiries in fiscal year 2013, with initial disclosure requirements\nbeginning in May 2014. There are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including for\ndue diligence to determine the sources of conflict minerals used in our products and other potential changes to\nproducts, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. The implementation of\nthese rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply, and pricing of materials used in our products. As there may\nbe only a limited number of suppliers offering “conflict free” conflict minerals, we cannot be sure that we will be\nable to obtain necessary conflict minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also,\nwe may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to\nbe conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products\nthrough the procedures we may implement.\n13\nOur operations could be negatively impacted by new legislation as well as changes in regulations and trade\nagreements, including tariffs and taxes. Unfavorable conditions resulting from such changes could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to adverse changes in tax laws.\nOur tax expense or benefits could be adversely affected by changes in tax provisions, unfavorable findings in tax\nexaminations, or differing interpretations by tax authorities. We are unable to estimate the impact that current and\nfuture tax proposals and tax laws could have on our results of operations. We are currently subject to state and local\ntax examinations for which we do not expect any major assessments.\nWe are subject to international regulations that could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nDue to our use of Representatives in foreign markets, we are subject to many laws governing international relations,\nincluding those that prohibit improper payments to government officials and commercial customers, and restrict\nwhere we can do business, what information or products we can supply to certain countries and what information we\ncan provide to a non-U.S. government, including but not limited to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, U.K. Bribery\nAct and the U.S. Export Administration Act. Violations of these laws, which are complex, may result in criminal\npenalties or sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nChanges in legislation or government regulations or policies could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur sales, gross margins and profitability could be directly impacted by changes in legislation or government\nregulations or policies. Specifically, changes in environmental and energy efficiency standards and regulations\nrelated to global climate change are being implemented to curtail the use of hydrofluorocarbons which are used in\nrefrigerants that are essential to many of our products. Our inability or delay in developing or marketing products\nthat match customer demand while also meeting applicable efficiency and environmental standards may negatively\nimpact our results.\nWe are transitioning to a new refrigerant with lower global warming potential for our HVAC systems and must be\nfully compliant under current governmental regulations by 2025. We expect to incur costs associated with this\ntransition related to the purchase of the new refrigerant as well as additional sensors and detectors on our HVAC\nsystems. In addition, we expect to incur cost to our facilities, specifically costs to store and use the new refrigerant in\nproduction; however, we do not expect these costs to be significant. Due to the increased flammability of the new\nrefrigerant, the insurance industry may require higher premiums for companies once the conversion begins.\nFurthermore, due to the expected increased demand of the newer refrigerants as well as the older hydrofluorocarbon\nrefrigerants (as they are phased out), we expect to see increased manufacturing costs related to purchases of\nrefrigerants and could see higher costs for future warranty claims. As with any significant regulatory change, delays\nor other changes to implementation timing could also have a negative impact on our operations and profitability.\nAdditionally, regulations that reduce or eliminate the use of fossil fuels such as natural gas and propane may reduce\nor eliminate sales of gas fired equipment for which AAON holds a strong market position. This will result in a shift\nto more air- and water-cooled heat pump type units to provide space heating. This shift in product line could affect\nproduction productivity material costs and aftermarket warranty costs.\nFuture legislation or regulations relating to environmental policies, product certification, product liability, taxes,\namount and availability of tax incentives and other matters, may impact the results of each of our operating\nsegments and our consolidated results.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.\nNone.\nITEM 1C. Cybersecurity\nCybersecurity risk management and strategy\nOur cybersecurity risk management is based on recognized cybersecurity industry frameworks and standards,\nincluding those of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (\"NIST\"), the Center for Internet Security\n(\"CIS\"), the Computer Objectives for Information and related Technology (\"COBIT\"), and the International\nOrganization for Standardization (\"ISO\"). We use these frameworks, together with information collected from\n14\ninternal assessments, to develop policies for use of our information assets, access to specific intellectual property or\ntechnologies, and protection of personal information. We protect these information assets through industry-standard\ntechniques, such as multifactor authentication and malware defenses. We also work with internal stakeholders across\nthe company to integrate foundational cybersecurity principles throughout our organization’s operations, including\nemployment of multiple layers of cybersecurity defenses, restricted access based on business need, and integrity of\nour business information. Throughout the year, we also regularly train our employees on cybersecurity awareness,\nconfidential information protection and simulated phishing attacks.\nWe engage third-party assessors to conduct penetration testing and measure our program to industry standard\nframeworks as needed. We also have standing engagements with incident response experts and external counsel. We\nfrequently collaborate with industry experts and cybersecurity practitioners at other companies to exchange\ninformation about potential cybersecurity threats, best practices and trends.\nOur cybersecurity risk management is an important part of our comprehensive business continuity program and\ninternal risk management. Our information security team periodically engages with a cross-functional group of\nsubject matter experts and leaders to assess and refine our cybersecurity risk posture and preparedness. We practice\nour response to potential cybersecurity incidents through regular tabletop exercises, threat hunting and red team\nexercises.\nFor more information about cybersecurity risks, see the Risk factors discussion in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nGovernance of cybersecurity risk management\nThe board of directors, as a whole, has oversight responsibility for our strategic and operational risks. The audit\ncommittee assists the board of directors with this responsibility by reviewing and discussing our risk assessment and\nrisk management practices, including cybersecurity risks, with members of management. The audit committee, in\nturn, periodically reports on its review with the board of directors.\nManagement is responsible for day-to-day assessment and management of cybersecurity risks. Our chief information\nofficer has primary oversight of material risks from cybersecurity threats. Our chief information officer has more\nthan 25 years of experience across various engineering, business and management roles, including leading the\ndevelopment and implementation of information technology strategies and roadmaps for manufacturing automation.\nOur chief information officer assesses our cybersecurity readiness through internal assessment tools as well as third-\nparty control tests, vulnerability assessments, audits and evaluation against industry standards. We have governance\nand compliance structures that are designed to elevate issues relating to cybersecurity to our chief information\nofficer, such as potential threats or vulnerabilities. We also employ various defensive and continuous monitoring\ntechniques using recognized industry frameworks and cybersecurity standards.\nOur chief information officer meets with the audit committee periodically to review our information technology\nsystems and discuss key cybersecurity risks. In addition, the chief financial officer reviews with the audit committee\nat least annually our risk management program, which includes cybersecurity risks, and is also reported to the board.\nItem 2. Properties.\nOur manufacturing areas are heavy industrial type buildings, with some coverage by overhead cranes, containing\nmanufacturing equipment designed for sheet metal fabrication, metal stamping and tube forming. The manufacturing\nequipment contained in the facilities consists primarily of automated sheet metal fabrication equipment,\nsupplemented by presses and tube bending equipment. Assembly lines consist of cart-type and roller-type conveyor\nlines with variable line speed adjustment. Subassembly areas and production line manning are based upon line rates\nset by production management.\nWe own and lease our properties and facilities, as further described below. We believe that all of our facilities are\nwell maintained and are in good condition and suitable for the conduct of our business.\nAAON Oklahoma\nOur plant and office facilities in Tulsa, Oklahoma, consist of a 342,000 square foot building (327,000 square feet of\nmanufacturing/warehouse space and 15,000 square feet of office space) located on a 12-acre tract of land at 2425\nSouth Yukon Avenue. Additionally we own a 940,000 square foot manufacturing/warehouse building and a 70,000\nsquare foot office building located on an approximately 79-acre tract of land across the street from the original\nfacility (2440 South Yukon Avenue) and a 40,000 square foot building used as warehouse space located on a 6-acre\ntract.\n15\nIn 2023, we acquired an additional 17-acre tract of land adjacent to the east side of the current 12-acre tract.

This discussion should be read in\nconjunction with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial\nstatements and related notes contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. A detailed\ndiscussion of the year to year changes for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is not included herein and\ncan be found in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations section of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nDescription of the Company\nAAON is a leader in HVAC solutions for commercial and industrial indoor environments. The company’s industry-\nleading approach to designing and manufacturing highly configurable equipment to meet exact needs creates a\npremier ownership experience with greater efficiency, performance, and long-term value. AAON is headquartered\nin Tulsa, Oklahoma, where its world-class innovation center and testing capabilities enable continuous advancement\ntoward a cleaner and more sustainable future.\nWe engineer, manufacture, and sell premium heating, ventilation, and air conditioning equipment consisting of\nsemi-custom and custom rooftop units, data center cooling solutions, cleanroom systems, packaged outdoor\nmechanical rooms, air handling units, makeup air units, energy recovery units, condensing units, geothermal/water-\nsource heat pumps, coils, and controls. These products are marketed and sold to a variety of vertical markets\nincluding retail, manufacturing, educational, lodging, supermarket, data centers, medical and pharmaceutical,\nindustrial, and other commercial markets. We sell our products to all 50 states in the United States and certain\nprovinces in Canada.\nOur business can be affected by a number of economic factors, including the level of economic activity in the\nmarkets in which we operate. The uncertainty of the economy negatively impacted the commercial and industrial\nnew construction markets in 2020 and the first half of 2021. Since mid-2021, nonresidential construction spending\nhas been strong, recovering well beyond pre-2020 levels and finishing 2023 near record levels. Recently, however,\ncertain leading indicators, including architectural billings and construction starts, signal a slowing in construction\nspending within the next 12 months. Furthermore, some economic general indicators are suggesting the general\neconomy is slowing, which could also impact the replacement market. If the domestic economy were to slow or\nenter a recession, this could result in a decline in our sales volume and profitability. Sales in the commercial and\nindustrial new construction markets generally lag the housing market, which in turn is influenced by cyclical factors\nsuch as interest rates, inflation, consumer spending habits, employment rates, the state of the economy and other\nmacroeconomic factors over which we have no control. Sales in the replacement markets are driven by various\nfactors, including general economic growth, the Company's new product introductions, fluctuations in the average\nage of existing equipment in the market, government regulations and stimulus, change in market demand between\nmore customized, higher performing HVAC equipment and lower priced standard equipment, as well as many other\nfactors. When new construction is down, we emphasize the replacement market.\nWe sell our products to property owners and contractors mainly through a network of independent manufacturers’\nRepresentatives. This go-to-market strategy is unique compared to most of our larger competitors in that most\ncontrol their sales channel. We value the independent sales channel as we think it is a more effective way of\nincreasing market share. Although we concede full control of the sales process with this strategy, the entrepreneurial\naspect of the independent sales channel attracts the most talent and provides greater financial incentives for its\nsalespeople. Furthermore, the independent sales channel sells different types of equipment from various\nmanufacturers, allowing it to operate with more of a solutions-based mindset, as opposed to an internal sales\ndepartment of a manufacturing company that is incentivized to only sell its equipment regardless if it is the best\nsolution for the end customer. We also have a small internal sales force that supports the relationships between the\nCompany and our sales channel partners. BASX sells highly customized products for unique applications for a more\nconcentrated customer base and an internal sales force is more effective for such products.\nThe principal components of cost of sales are labor, raw materials, component costs, factory overhead, freight out,\nand engineering expense. The principal high volume raw materials used in our manufacturing processes are steel,\ncopper, and aluminum, and are obtained from domestic suppliers. We also purchase from domestic manufacturers\ncertain components, including coils, compressors, motors, and electrical controls.\n20\nThe price levels of our raw materials fluctuate due to various economic factors within the U.S. and global\neconomy. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the prices for copper, galvanized steel, and stainless steel\ndecreased by approximately 4.5%, 38.9%, and 3.3%, respectively, and aluminum increased by approximately 15.5%\nfrom 2022.\nWe attempt to limit the impact of price fluctuations on these materials by entering into cancellable and non-\ncancellable contracts with our major suppliers for periods of six to 18 months. We expect to receive delivery of raw\nmaterials from our contracts for use in our manufacturing operations.\nWe occasionally increase the price of our products to help offset any inflationary headwinds. In recent years, price\nincreases have been more frequent due to the amount of inflation the business has endured. In 2021, we\nimplemented three price increases. In 2022, we implemented two significant price increases as well as a recurring\n1% monthly price increase beginning June 1, 2022 and ending on April 1, 2023. We reinstated a recurring 1%\nmonthly price increase on October 1, 2023 and carried that through February 1, 2024.\nAdditionally, we continue to experience challenges in a tight labor market, especially the hiring of both skilled and\nunskilled production labor. We have implemented the following wage increases to remain competitive and to attract\nand retain employees:\n• In March 2021, we awarded annual merit raises for an overall 5.0% increase to wages.\n• In July 2021, we increased starting wages for our production workforce by 7.0%.\n• In October 2021, we implemented a cost of living increase of 3.5% in place for all employees\nbelow our Senior Leadership Team (\"SLT\") which consists of officers and key members of\nmanagement.\n• In March 2022, we awarded annual merit raises for an overall 3.0% increase to wages.\n• In October 2022, we implemented a cost of living increase of 3.5% in place for all employees\nbelow the SLT level.\n• In March 2023, we awarded annual merit raises for an overall 3.9% increase to wages.\nWe will continue to implement human resource initiatives to retain and attract labor to further improve productivity\nand production efficiencies.\n21\nBacklog\nThe following table shows our historical backlog levels:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\n(in thousands)\n$ 510,028 $ 548,022\nWhile our backlog is down at December 31, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022, our bookings remain strong. The\nyear-ended December 31, 2022 was a record year for bookings and our backlog was elevated causing us to extend\nlead times. Investments made in our facilities and workforce have significantly improved our capacity and\noperational efficiencies. Production rates are at all time highs, trimming our backlog down to a more manageable\nsize and allowing our lead times to improve.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nNet Sales $ 1,168,518 $ 888,788\nCost of Sales 769,498 651,216\nGross Profit 399,020 237,572\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 171,539 110,823\nGain on disposal of assets (13) (12)\nIncome from operations $ 227,494 $ 126,761\nThe following are highlights of our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition:\n• Net sales for 2023 grew 31.5% to $1,168.5 million due to record production rates and price increases\nrealized during the period as compared to the same period in the prior year.\n• Overall gross margin increased 740 basis points in 2023 due to increased organic volumes for operational\nefficiencies and better overhead absorption.\n• We continue to invest in the future growth of the Company as evidenced by our $104.3 million in capital\nexpenditures in 2023, an increase $50.3 million or 93.1% when compared to 2022 .\n• We completed the repurchase of $25.0 million of shares under our current share repurchase authorization.\nWe report our financial results based on three reportable segments: AAON Oklahoma, AAON Coil Products, and\nBASX, which are further described in Item 1 and Item 8. The Company's chief decision maker (\"CODM\"), our\nCEO, allocates resources and assesses the performance of each operating segment using information about the\noperating segment's net sales and income from operations. The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using\nasset or liability information.\n22\nSegment Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\nFor the years ended December 31,\nPercent of Percent of %\n2023 Sales2 2022 Sales1 $ Change Change\n(in thousands)\nNet Sales2\nAAON Oklahoma $ 897,919 76.8 % $ 663,845 74.7 % $ 234,074 35.3 %\nAAON Coil Products 112,320 9.6 % 107,290 12.1 % 5,030 4.7 %\nBASX 158,279 13.5 % 117,653 13.2 % 40,626 34.5 %\nNet sales $ 1,168,518 $ 888,788 $ 279,730 31.5 %\nCost of Sales2\nAAON Oklahoma $ 577,852 64.4 % 490,862 73.9 % $ 86,990 17.7 %\nAAON Coil Products 82,996 73.9 % 73,979 69.0 % 9,017 12.2 %\nBASX 108,650 68.6 % 86,375 73.4 % 22,275 25.8 %\nCost of sales $ 769,498 65.9 % $ 651,216 73.3 % $ 118,282 18.2 %\nGross Profit2\nAAON Oklahoma $ 320,067 35.6 % $ 172,983 26.1 % $ 147,084 85.0 %\nAAON Coil Products 29,324 26.1 % 33,311 31.0 % (3,987) (12.0) %\nBASX 49,629 31.4 % 31,278 26.6 % 18,351 58.7 %\nGross profit $ 399,020 34.1 % $ 237,572 26.7 % $ 161,448 68.0 %\n1 Cost of sales and gross profit for each segment are calculated as a percentage of the respective segment's net sales. Total cost of sales and total\ngross profit are calculated as a percentage of total net sales.\n2 Presented after intercompany eliminations.\nTotal net sales increased $279.7 million, or 31.5%, with 17.0% of the increase coming from realization of price\nincreases and the remaining 14.5% coming from increases in organic volume. AAON Coil Products had a smaller\nbacklog and along with inefficiencies related to implementing a new production line of BASX product at AAON\nCoil Products led to smaller year over year increase sales for this segment. The increase in BASX net sales is\nprimarily related to large jobs in the data center market as a result of the revenue synergies created by being part of\nAAON.\nGross profit as a percent of sales increased to 34.1% during 2023 as compared 26.7% in 2022. As noted above,\nrealization of price increases has improved our margin profile along with the slowing of inflation. Additionally, most\nof the organic growth noted above comes from our AAON Oklahoma segment, significantly improving overhead\nabsorption and margin performance. The increase in net sales at BASX has improved their overhead absorption, thus\nincreasing their gross profit margin year over year.\nAs shown in the table below, we've experienced year over year fluctuations in the cost of several raw materials. We\nimplemented multiple price increases during 2022 and 2023 to counteract the increased cost of material. Some of the\nprice increases have yet to be realized. Additionally, in order to retain our existing employees, we continue to award\nperiodic raises in addition to our annual merit raises to our employees.\n23\nRaw Material Costs\nTwelve month average raw material cost per pound as of December 31:\n2023 2022 % Change\nCopper $ 5.35 $ 5.60 (4.5) %\nGalvanized Steel $ 0.58 $ 0.95 (38.9) %\nStainless Steel $ 3.19 $ 3.30 (3.3) %\nAluminum $ 2.54 $ 2.20 15.5 %\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nYears Ended December 31, Percent of Sales\n2023 2022 2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nWarranty $ 16,165 $ 8,497 1.4 % 1.0 %\nProfit Sharing 24,590 14,009 2.1 % 1.6 %\nSalaries & Benefits 53,281 41,351 4.6 % 4.7 %\nStock Compensation 9,318 7,025 0.8 % 0.8 %\nAdvertising 2,594 2,353 0.2 % 0.3 %\nDepreciation & Amortization 13,761 8,050 1.2 % 0.9 %\nInsurance 5,354 3,755 0.5 % 0.4 %\nProfessional Fees 15,372 5,754 1.3 % 0.6 %\nDonations 1,242 1,134 0.1 % 0.1 %\nOther 29,862 18,895 2.6 % 2.1 %\nTotal SG&A $ 171,539 $ 110,823 14.7 % 12.5 %\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $60.7 million or 54.8% during 2023 as compared to the prior\nyear. As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative increased from 12.5% to 14.7%. Most of the\nincrease is due to professional fees that increased $9.6 million due to the litigation settlement (Note 18).\nProfit sharing increased $10.6 million or 75.5% due to our increased operating results. Other expenses increased\n$11.0 million or 58.0% during year due mostly to increased travel, consulting expenses and closing costs related to\nthe 2023 New Market Tax Credit (Note 17).\nIncome Taxes\nYears Ended December 31, Effective Tax Rate\n2023 2022 2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nIncome tax provision $ 45,531 $ 24,157 20.4 % 19.4 %\nThe Company’s estimated annual 2023 effective tax rate, excluding discrete events, was 23.8%.\nThe increase year over year in the overall effective tax rate was primarily due the non-deductible executive\ncompensation. In accordance with the 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, under Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m), the\ntax deduction for covered executives of public companies is limited to $1.0 million per individual. Because of our\nhigh stock price and timing of executive stock option exercises this resulted in an increase to the income tax\nprovision of $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n24\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur working capital and capital expenditure requirements are generally met through net cash provided by operations\nand the use of the revolving bank line of credit based on our current liquidity at the time.\nWorking Capital - Our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents decreased $5.2 million from December 31, 2022 to\nDecember 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, we had $9.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash.\nRevolving Line of Credit - Our revolving credit facility (\"Revolver\"), as amended and restated, provides for\nmaximum borrowings of $200.0 million. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had an outstanding\nbalance under the Revolver of $38.3 million and $71.0 million, respectively. We had two standby letters of credit\ntotaling $2.3 million as of December 31, 2023 and one standby letter of credit totaling $0.8 million as of\nDecember 31, 2022. Borrowings available under the Revolver at December 31, 2023, were $159.4 million. The\nRevolver expires on May 27, 2027.\nAny outstanding loans under the Revolver bear interest at the daily compounded secured overnight financing rate\n(\"SOFR\") plus the applicable margin. Applicable margin, ranging from 1.25% - 1.75%, is determined quarterly\nbased on the Company's leverage ratio. The Company is also subject to letter of credit fees, ranging from 1.25% -\n1.75%, and a commitment fee, ranging from 0.10% - 0.20%. The applicable fee percentage is determined quarterly\nbased on the Company's leverage ratio. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the weighted average interest rate of our\nRevolver was 6.3% and 3.0%, respectively. Fees associated with the unused portion of the committed amount are\nincluded in interest expense on our consolidated statements of income and were not material for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022.\nIf SOFR cannot be determined pursuant to the definition, as defined by the Revolver agreement, any outstanding\neffected loans will be deemed to have been converted into alternative base rate (\"ABR\") loans. ABR loans would\nbear interest at a rate per annum equal to the highest of (a) the Prime Rate in effect on such day, (b) the Federal\nFunds Rate in effect on such day plus 0.50%, or (c) daily simple SOFR for a one-month tenor in effect on such day\nplus 1.00%.\nAt December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with our financial covenants, as defined by the Revolver. These\ncovenants require that we meet certain parameters related to our leverage ratio. At December 31, 2023, our leverage\nratio was 0.15 to 1.0, which meets the requirement of not being above 3 to 1.\n2019 New Markets Tax Credit - On October 24, 2019, the Company entered into a transaction with a subsidiary of\nan unrelated third-party financial institution (the “2019 Investor”) and a certified Community Development Entity\nunder a qualified New Markets Tax Credit (“2019 NMTC”) program pursuant to Section 45D of the Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended, related to an investment in plant and equipment to facilitate the expansion of\nour Longview, Texas manufacturing operations (the “2019 Project”).

The Company may\npurchase shares on the open market from time to time. The Board must authorize the timing and amount of these\npurchases and all repurchases are in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC allowing the Company to\nrepurchase shares from the open market.\nOur open market repurchase programs are as follows:\nAgreement Execution Date Authorized Repurchase $ Expiration Date\nMarch 13, 2020 $20 million November 9, 2022\nNovember 3, 2022 $50 million **1, 2\n1 Expiration Date is at Board's discretion.

In\nearly 2022, the Company began increasing the purchase of inventory to take advantage of favorable pricing\nopportunities and also to mitigate the impact of future supply chain disruptions on our operations.\nPayment terms for BASX jobs typically require upfront cash to fund the job resulting in cash inflows related to our\ncontract liabilities and cash inflows fluctuate due to job timing and scheduling.\n28\nThe decrease in cash flows from income taxes is primarily due to the 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, which requires\nresearch and development expenses incurred after December 31, 2021 to be capitalized and amortized over 5 years.\nThis defers our current period income tax deduction which increased our income tax payments due at the end of\n2022.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nThe capital expenditures increase during 2023 related to our continued investment in our production capabilities.\nPurchases during 2023 relate to additional sheet metal and other machinery for both replacement and growth,\nadditional production and warehouse space in Longview, Texas, additional office space in Tulsa, Oklahoma,\nadditional land in Tulsa, Oklahoma for future growth, and a partial interest in an airplane. The cash paid for building\nis related to the purchase of the BASX office and manufacturing facility in May 2022 (Note 4).\nOur capital expenditure program for 2024 is estimated to be approximately $125.0 million. Many of these projects\nare subject to review and cancellation at the discretion of our CEO and Board of Directors without incurring\nsubstantial charges.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nThe change in cash from financing activities in 2023 is primarily related to borrowings under our revolving credit\nfacility to manage our working capital needs, especially strategic purchases of inventory to avoid supply chain\ndelays and the funding of certain capital expenditures, offset by repayments we were able to make due to our\nincreased operating results and financial condition.\nFurthermore, cash flows from financing activities is historically affected by the timing of stock options exercised by\nour employees. Stock options exercised increased due to the increase in the number of employee options exercised\nand increase in our average stock price during 2023 as compared to the previous period.\nAdditionally, we repurchased approximately 424,777 shares for approximately $26.3 million during 2023 (Note 16).\nEffective with the cash dividend declared on March 1, 2023 (paid on March 31, 2023), the Company moved from\nsemi-annual cash dividends to quarterly cash dividends.\nCommitments and Contractual Agreements\nWe are occasionally party to short-term, cancellable and occasionally non-cancellable, contracts with major\nsuppliers for the purchase of raw material and component parts. We expect to receive delivery of raw materials for\nuse in our manufacturing operations. These contracts are not accounted for as derivative instruments because they\nmeet the normal purchase and normal sales exemption. In 2023, the Company executed a five-year purchase\ncommitment for refrigerants. In 2023, the Company made payments of $10.1 million on this contract. Estimated\nminimum future payments are $11.9 million, $9.1 million, $10.5 million, and $11.2 million for 2024, 2025, 2026,\nand 2027, respectively. We had no other material contractual purchase obligations as of December 31, 2023.\nContingencies\nWe are subject to various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. We closely monitor\nthese claims and legal actions and frequently consult with our legal counsel to determine whether they may, when\nresolved, have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows and we accrue\nand/or disclose loss contingencies as appropriate. See Note 18 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for\nadditional information with respect to specific legal proceedings.\n29\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”) and the Company's discussion and analysis of its financial\ncondition and operating results require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events, and\napply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses in our consolidated\nfinancial statements and related notes. We base our estimates, assumptions, and judgments on historical experience,\ncurrent trends, and other factors believed to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are\nprepared. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could\ndiffer from our estimates and assumptions, and such differences could be material. We believe the following critical\naccounting policies affect our more significant estimates, assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of our\nconsolidated financial statements. We discuss these estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors\nperiodically.\nInventory - Raw material or component inventory typically transfers from one stage of manufacturing to another\nwhere it accumulates additional costs directly incurred with the production of finished goods, including estimated\nstandard labor and overhead costs. Labor and overhead costs associated with the manufacturing of our products are\ncapitalized into inventory on an estimated standard basis. These include certain direct and indirect costs such as\ncompensation, manufacturing, and facility costs associated with manufacturing support functions. We continually\nmonitor our labor and overhead standard costs to ensure that standard costs reasonably reflects our actual costs and\nmake manual adjusts the value of inventory accordingly. Our manual adjustments from standard to actual labor and\noverhead costs contain uncertainties that require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding\na number of factors, including inventory turns, supply usage, manufacturing efficiencies, and historical production\ncosts.\nInventory Reserves – We establish a reserve for inventories based on the change in inventory requirements due to\nproduct line changes, the feasibility of using obsolete parts for upgraded part substitutions, the required parts needed\nfor part supply sales and replacement parts, and for estimated shrinkage. Assumptions used to estimate inventory\nreserves include future manufacturing requirements and industry trends. Evolving technology and changes in\nproduct mix or customer demand can significantly affect the outcome of this analysis.\nWarranty Accrual – A provision is made for estimated warranty costs at the time the product is shipped and revenue\nis recognized. Our product warranty policy is the earlier of one year from the date of first use or 18 months from\ndate of shipment for parts only; 18 months for data center cooling solutions and cleanroom systems; an additional\nfour years for compressors (if applicable); 15 years on aluminized steel gas-fired heat exchangers (if applicable); 25\nyears on stainless steel heat exchangers (if applicable); and ten years on gas-fired heat exchangers in our historical\nRL products (if applicable). Our warranty policy for the RQ series covers parts for two years from date of unit\nshipment. Our warranty policy for the WH and WV Series geothermal/water-source heat pumps covers parts for five\nyears from the date of installation. Warranty expense is estimated based on the warranty period, historical warranty\ntrends and associated costs, and any known identifiable warranty issue.\nDue to the absence of warranty history on new products, an additional provision may be made for such\nproducts. Our estimated future warranty cost is subject to adjustment from time to time depending on changes in\nactual warranty trends and cost experience. Should actual claim rates differ from our estimates, revisions to the\nestimated product warranty liability would be required.\nShare-Based Compensation – We measure and recognize compensation expense for all share-based payment\nawards made to our employees and directors, including stock options, restricted stock awards, performance stock\nunits (\"PSUs\"), and key employee awards (\"Key Employee Awards\") based on their fair values at the time of grant.\nCompensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period of stock options, restricted stock\nawards, and PSUs. Compensation expense is recognized for the Key Employee Awards on a straight line basis over\nthe service period when the performance condition is determined to be probable. Forfeitures are accounted for as\nthey occur. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton\noption pricing model. The fair value of the PSUs is estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo Model. The\nuse of the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model and the Monte Carlo Model requires the input of subjective\nassumptions such as: the expected volatility, the expected term of the grant, forward-looking market conditions, risk-\nfree rate, and expected dividend yield for stock options. The fair value of restricted stock awards and Key Employee\nAwards is based on the fair market value of AAON common stock on the respective grant dates. The fair value of\nrestricted stock awards is reduced for the present value of dividends.\n30\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets – Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration paid for the\nacquired businesses over the fair value of the individual assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed. Indefinite-lived\nintangible assets consist of trademarks and trade names.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but instead are evaluated for impairment at least\nannually. We perform our annual assessment of impairment during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, and more\nfrequently if circumstances warrant.\nTo perform this assessment, we first consider qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that\nthe fair value of the reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds their carrying amount. If we\nconclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit and indefinite-lived assets does not\nexceed their carrying amount, we calculate the fair value for the reporting unit and indefinite-lived assets and\ncompare the amount to their carrying amount. If the fair value of a reporting unit and indefinite-lived asset exceeds\ntheir carrying amount, the reporting unit and indefinite-lived assets are not considered impaired. If the carrying\namount of the reporting unit and indefinite-lived assets exceeds their fair value, the reporting unit and indefinite-\nlived assets are considered to be impaired and the balance is reduced by the difference between the fair value and\ncarrying amount of the reporting unit and indefinite-lived assets.\nWe performed a qualitative assessment as of December 31, 2023 to determine whether it was more likely than not\nthat the fair value of the reporting unit and indefinite-lived assets was greater than the carrying value of the reporting\nunit and indefinite-lived assets. Based on these qualitative assessments, we determined that the fair value of the\nreporting unit and indefinite-lived assets was more likely than not greater than the carrying value of the reporting\nunit and indefinite-lived assets.\nEstimates and assumptions used to perform the impairment evaluation are inherently uncertain and can significantly\naffect the outcome of the analysis. The estimates and assumptions we use in the annual impairment assessment\nincluded macro-industry trends, market participant considerations, historical profitability, including free cash flows,\nand forecasted multi-year operating results. Changes in operating results and other assumptions could materially\naffect these estimates. A considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing\nthe impairment tests.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nChanges to U.S. GAAP are established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) in the form of\naccounting standards updates (“ASUs”) to the FASB’s Accounting Standards Codification.\nWe consider the applicability and impact of all ASUs. ASUs not listed below were assessed and determined to be\neither not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on our consolidated financial statements and notes\nthereto.\nIn October 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-06, Disclosure Improvements: Codification Amendments in Response\nto SEC's Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative. The new guidance is intended to update a variety of\ndisclosure requirements. The effective date for each amendment will be the date on with the SEC's removal of that\nrelated disclosure from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K becomes effective. Early adoption is prohibited. Upon\nadoption, this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements and related\ndisclosures.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280). The new guidance\nimproves reportable segment disclosures primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses\nand by requiring current annual disclosures to be provided in interim periods. The amendments in this ASU are\neffective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption, this ASU is not expected to have a material\nimpact on the Company's financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740). The new guidance is intended to\nenhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The amendments in this ASU are\neffective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Upon adoption, this ASU is not expected to have a\nmaterial impact on the Company's financial statements and related disclosures.\n31\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nCommodity Price Risk\nWe are exposed to volatility in the prices of commodities used in some of our products and, occasionally, we use\ncancellable and non-cancellable contracts with our major suppliers for periods of six to 18 months to manage this\nexposure.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to changes in interest rates related to our outstanding debt. As of December 31, 2023, we had an\noutstanding balance of $38.3 million. For each one percentage point increase in the interest rate applicable to our\noutstanding debt, our annual income before taxes would decrease by approximately $0.4 million.\n32\nItem 8.

(a Nevada corporation) and\nsubsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income,\nstockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the\nrelated notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present\nfairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the\nresults of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in\nconformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on\ncriteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”), and our report dated February 28, 2024 expressed an\nunqualified opinion.\nBasis for opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with\nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the\nPCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of\nmaterial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.\nWe believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical audit matters\nCritical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were\ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures\nthat are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex\njudgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.\n/s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2004.\nTulsa, Oklahoma\nFebruary 28, 2024\n34\nAAON, Inc. and

Business Description\nAAON, Inc. is a Nevada corporation which was incorporated on August 18, 1987. Our operating subsidiaries\ninclude AAON, Inc., an Oklahoma corporation, AAON Coil Products, Inc., a Texas corporation, and BASX, Inc., an\nOregon corporation (collectively, the “Company”). The consolidated financial statements include our accounts and\nthe accounts of our subsidiaries.\nWe are engaged in the engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and sale of premium air conditioning and heating\nequipment consisting of standard, semi-custom, and custom rooftop units, data centers cooling solutions, cleanroom\nsystems, packaged outdoor mechanical rooms, air handling units, makeup air units, energy recovery units,\ncondensing units, geothermal/water-source heat pumps, coils, and controls.\nInflation and Labor Market\nIn late 2021 and throughout 2022, we witnessed increases in our raw material and component prices. Due to our\nfavorable liquidity position, we continued to make strategic purchases of materials when we see opportunities. We\ncontinue to manage the increase in the cost of raw materials through price increases for our products. We have also\nexperienced supply chain challenges related to specific manufacturing parts, which we have managed through our\nstrong vendor relationships as well as expanding our list of vendors.\nAdditionally, we continue to experience challenges in a tight labor market, especially the hiring of both skilled and\nunskilled production labor. We have implemented the following wage increases to remain competitive and to attract\nand retain employees:\n• In March 2021, we awarded annual merit raises for an overall 5.0% increase to wages.\n• In July 2021, we increased starting wages for our production workforce by 7.0%.\n• In October 2021, we implemented a cost of living increase of 3.5% in place for all employees\nbelow our Senior Leadership Team (\"SLT\"), which consists of officers and key members of\nmanagement.\n• In March 2022, we awarded annual merit raises for an overall 3.0% increase to wages.\n• In October 2022, we implemented a cost of living increase of 3.5% in place for all employees\nbelow the SLT level.\n• In March 2023, we awarded annual merit raises for an overall 3.9% increase to wages.\nWe will continue to implement human resource initiatives to retain and attract labor to further improve productivity\nand production efficiencies.\nDespite efforts to mitigate the impact of inflation, supply chain issues and the tight labor market, future disruptions,\nwhile temporary, could negatively impact our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nFirst Quarter 2021 Planned Maintenance and Adverse Weather\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, we made the strategic decision to shut down our Tulsa, OK and Longview, TX\nmanufacturing facilities to perform planned and necessary maintenance during the last week of December 2020 as\nwell several days in early January 2021.\nIn February 2021, record-breaking winter storms affected Oklahoma and Texas, causing sustained below freezing\ntemperatures, hazardous driving conditions, rolling blackouts, water main breaks, and a host of other weather related\nissues. In addition to significant absenteeism as a result of employees being unable to travel to and from work due to\ninadequate transportation and/or hazardous road conditions, the Company made the decision to shut down the Tulsa,\nOK and Longview, TX plants for several days. This decision was based on the expected employee absenteeism, as\nwell as the expected rolling blackouts caused by the increased demand on the electrical and natural gas power grids.\n39\nWH Series and WV Series Water Source Heat Pump Units\nAs part of the normal course of business, management continually monitors the profitability of the Company's\nvarious product series offerings. During the third quarter of 2022, management made the decision to no longer\nproduce our small packaged geothermal/water-source heat pump units consisting of the WH Series horizontal\nconfiguration and WV Series vertical configuration, from one-half to 12 1/2 tons (\"WH/WV\"). These WH/WV units\nwere produced solely out of the AAON Oklahoma facility. Production of the remaining WH/WV backlog was\ncompleted during the second quarter 2023.\nChange in Estimate\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, a review of the Company's useful lives for certain sheet metal manufacturing\nequipment at our Longview, Texas facilities resulted in a change in estimate that increased the useful lives from\nbetween ten and twelve years to fifteen years. This determination was based on recent and estimated future\nproduction levels as well as management's knowledge of the equipment and historical and future use of the\nequipment. The change in estimate was made prospectively and resulted in a decrease to depreciation expense within\ncost of sales on our consolidated statements of income of $1.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nWe do not believe the impact of these events had a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position,\nresults of operations and cash flows.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThese financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United\nStates of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the\nCompany and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\nOur financial statements also consolidate all of our affiliated entities in which we have a controlling financial\ninterest. Because we hold certain rights that give us the power to direct the activities of five variable interest entities\n(\"VIEs\") (Note 17) that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance, combined with a variable\ninterest that gives us the right to receive potentially significant benefits or the obligation to absorb potentially\nsignificant losses, we have a controlling financial interest in those VIEs.\nOn December 10, 2021, we closed on the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding equity ownership of BASX,\nLLC, doing business as BASX Solutions (Note 4). On December 29, 2021, BASX, LLC converted to a C-\nCorporation, BASX, Inc. (\"BASX\"), and is subject to income tax. We have included the results of BASX’s\noperations in our consolidated financial statements beginning December 11, 2021.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nWe consider all highly liquid temporary investments with original maturity dates of three months or less to be cash\nequivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of bank deposits and highly liquid, interest-bearing money market\nfunds.\nThe Company’s cash and cash equivalents are held in a few financial institutions in amounts that exceed the\ninsurance limits of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. However, management believes that the Company’s\ncounterparty risks are minimal based on the reputation and history of the institutions selected.\nRestricted Cash\nRestricted cash held at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 consists of bank deposits and highly liquid,\ninterest-bearing money market funds held for the purpose of the Company's qualified New Markets Tax Credit\nprograms (Note 17) to benefit an investment in plant and equipment to facilitate the expansion of our Longview,\nTexas manufacturing operations.\nThe Company’s restricted cash is held in financial institutions in amounts that exceed the insurance limits of the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation. However, management believes that the Company’s counterparty risks are\nminimal based on the reputation and history of the institutions selected.\n40\nAccounts and Note Receivable\nAccounts and note receivable are stated at amounts due from customers, net of an allowance for credit losses. We\ngenerally do not require that our customers provide collateral; however, our billings and customer payment terms\ncan vary based on product type as a way to manage collections risk. The Company determines its allowance for\ncredit losses by considering a number of factors, including the credit risk of specific customers, the customer’s\nability to pay current obligations, historical trends, economic and market conditions, and the age of the\nreceivable. Accounts are considered past due when the balance has been outstanding for ninety days past negotiated\ncredit terms. Past due accounts are generally written-off against the allowance for credit losses only after all\ncollection attempts have been exhausted.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nOur customers are concentrated primarily in the domestic commercial and industrial new construction and\nreplacement markets. To date, our sales have been primarily to the domestic market, with foreign sales accounting\nfor approximately 3.4%, 3.1%, and 3.0% of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021,\nrespectively.\nFor the years-ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, Texas AirSystems accounted for approximately 13.8%,\n12.4%, and 11.7% of our sales, respectively. Through portfolio groups, Meriton has an ownership interest in Texas\nAirSystems and certain other of our sales representatives. The aggregate sales percentages through Meriton-\naffiliated groups that are in addition to Texas AirSystems’ sales for the years-ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and\n2021 accounted for an additional 2.3%, 1.4% and 2.7%, respectively. Two other similar groups, Ambient and\nHobbs/Insight, share common ownership of some of our other sales representatives through portfolio groups and for\nthe year-ended December 31, 2023, aggregate sales through their portfolio groups accounted for approximately\n11.5% and 10.2% of our sales, respectively. Sales through the portfolio groups of either Ambient or Hobbs/Insight\ndid not account for 10% or more of our sales for any years-ended prior to December 31, 2023.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, Texas AirSystems accounted for approximately 13.5% and 12.3%, of our\naccounts receivable balance, respectively. The aggregate percentages through Meriton-affiliated groups that are in\naddition to Texas AirSystems’ accounts receivable as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, accounted for an additional\n2.0% and 3.2%, respectively. Two other similar groups, Ambient and Hobbs/Insight, aggregate percentages through\ntheir portfolio groups accounted for approximately 16.8% and 11.5% of our accounts receivable as of December 31,\n2023, respectively. Accounts receivables of the portfolio groups did not account for 10% or more of our accounts\nreceivable as of December 31, 2022, except for Ambient's aggregate percentage of approximately 10.9%.\nInventories\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) or average cost\nmethod. Cost in inventory includes purchased parts and materials, direct labor and applied manufacturing overhead.\nWe establish an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories based on product line changes, the feasibility of\nsubstituting parts and the need for supply and replacement parts.\n41\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant, and equipment, including significant improvements, are recorded at cost, net of accumulated\ndepreciation; except for property, plant, and equipment acquired in a business combination which is recorded at fair\nvalue. Repairs and maintenance and any gains or losses on disposition are included in operations.\nDepreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:\nBuildings and leasehold improvements 3 - 40 years\nMachinery and equipment 3 - 20 years\nFurniture and fixtures 3 - 15 years\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company applies the acquisition method of accounting for business acquisitions. The results of operations of\nthe businesses acquired by the Company are included as of the respective acquisition date. The acquisition date fair\nvalue of the consideration transferred, including the fair value of any contingent consideration, is allocated to the\nunderlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition.\nTo the extent the acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred exceeds the fair value of the identifiable\ntangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, such excess is allocated to goodwill. The Company\nmay adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, as it obtains more information regarding asset\nvaluations and liabilities assumed that existed but were not available at the acquisition date, which is generally up to\none year after the acquisition closing date. Acquisition related expenses are recognized separately from the business\ncombination and are expensed as incurred.\nFair Value Financial Instruments and Measurements\nThe carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities\napproximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of the items. The carrying amount of the Company’s\nrevolving line of credit, and other payables, approximate their fair values either due to their short term nature, the\nvariable rates associated with the debt or based on current rates offered to the Company for debt with similar\ncharacteristics.\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in\nan orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is based upon assumptions\nthat market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability. We use the following fair value hierarchy,\nwhich prioritizes valuation technique inputs used to measure fair value into three broad levels:\n• Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that we have the ability to access\nat the measurement date.\n• Level 2: Inputs (other than quoted prices included within Level 1) that are either directly or indirectly\nobservable for the asset or liability, including (i) quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active\nmarkets, (ii) quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, (iii) inputs other\nthan quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, and (iv) inputs that are derived from\nobservable market data by correlation or other means.\n• Level 3: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability including situations where there is little, if any,\nmarket activity for the asset or liability. Items categorized in Level 3 include the estimated fair values of\nintangible assets, contingent consideration, and goodwill acquired in a business combination.\nThe fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) and the lowest priority\nto unobservable inputs (Level 3). In some cases, the inputs used to measure fair value might fall into different levels\nof the fair value hierarchy. The lowest level input that is significant to a fair value measurement determines the\napplicable level in the fair value hierarchy. Assessing the significance of a particular input to a fair value\nmeasurement requires judgment, considering factors specific to the asset or liability.\nSoftware Development Costs\nWe capitalize costs incurred to purchase or develop software for internal use. Internal-use software development\ncosts are capitalized during the application development stage. These capitalized costs are reflected in intangible\nassets, net on the consolidated balance sheets and are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software. The\nuseful life of our internal-use software development costs is generally 1-6 years.\n42\nDefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nOur definite-lived intangible assets include various trademarks, service marks, and technical knowledge acquired in\nbusiness combinations (Note 4) or asset acquisition. We amortize our definite-lived intangible assets on a straight-\nline basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We evaluate the carrying value of our amortizable intangible\nassets for potential impairment when events and circumstances warrant such a review.\nAmortization is computed using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:\nIntellectual property 6 - 30 years\nCustomer relationships 14 years\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the consideration paid for the acquired businesses over the fair value of the\nindividual assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed. Goodwill at December 31, 2023 is expected to be tax\ndeductible in future periods. Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trademarks, trade names, and internal-use\nsoftware. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but instead are evaluated for impairment\nat least annually. We perform our annual assessment of impairment during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, and\nmore frequently if circumstances warrant.\nTo perform this assessment, we first consider qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that\nthe fair value of the reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds their carrying amount. If we\nconclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit and indefinite-lived assets does not\nexceed their carrying amount, we calculate the fair value for the reporting unit and indefinite-lived assets and\ncompare the amount to their carrying amount. If the fair value of a reporting unit and indefinite-lived asset exceeds\ntheir carrying amount, the reporting unit and indefinite-lived assets are not considered impaired. If the carrying\namount of the reporting unit and indefinite-lived assets exceeds their fair value, the reporting unit and indefinite-\nlived assets are considered to be impaired and the balance is reduced by the difference between the fair value and\ncarrying amount of the reporting unit and indefinite-lived assets.\nWe performed a qualitative assessment as of December 31, 2023 to determine whether it was more likely than not\nthat the fair value of the reporting unit and indefinite-lived assets was greater than the carrying value of the reporting\nunit and indefinite-lived assets. Based on these qualitative assessments, we determined that the fair value of the\nreporting unit and indefinite-lived assets was more likely than not greater than the carrying value of the reporting\nunit and indefinite-lived assets.\nEstimates and assumptions used to perform the impairment evaluation are inherently uncertain and can significantly\naffect the outcome of the analysis. The estimates and assumptions we use in the annual impairment assessment\nincluded market participant considerations and future forecasted operating results. Changes in operating results and\nother assumptions could materially affect these estimates. A considerable amount of management judgment and\nassumptions are required in performing the impairment tests.\n43\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill were as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nBalance, beginning of period $ 81,892 $ 85,727\nAdditions due to acquisitions — —\nDecreases due to acquisition adjustments (Note 4) — (3,835)\nBalance, end of period 81,892 81,892\nThe acquisition adjustments were recorded during the first quarter of 2022. The revisions were the result of the\nfinalization of our preliminary estimates and third party valuation models related to the acquisition of BASX (Note\n4) in 2021. The impact of such revisions on consolidated net income were not significant.\nContingent Consideration\nAs part of a business combination, we agreed to issue shares of the Company's common stock based on certain\nmilestones in accordance with the acquisition agreement. This contingent consideration is valued at fair value on the\nacquisition date and is included in additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheets.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe review long-lived assets for possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate, in\nmanagement’s judgment, that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured\nby a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows\nexpected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying\namount of the asset or asset group, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of\nthe asset or asset group exceeds its fair value.\nResearch and Development\nThe costs associated with research and development for the purpose of developing and improving new products are\nexpensed as incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 research and development costs\namounted to approximately $43.7 million, $46.8 million, and $16.6 million, respectively. The significant increase\nfor the year ended December 31, 2022 was related to the inclusion of a full year of operations of BASX (Note 4), as\nwell as our commitment to product performance and innovation.\nAdvertising\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in selling, general, and administrative expenses on our\nconsolidated statement of income. Advertising expense for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 was\napproximately $2.6 million, $2.4 million, and $1.6 million, respectively.\nShipping and Handling\nWe incur shipping and handling costs in the distribution of products sold that are recorded in cost of sales. Shipping\ncharges that are billed to the customer are recorded in revenues and as an expense in cost of sales. For the years\nended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 shipping and handling fees amounted to approximately $29.0 million,\n$24.4 million, and $14.4 million, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets\nand liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book carrying amounts\nand the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Excess tax benefits and deficiencies are reported as an income tax benefit\nor expense on the statement of income and are treated as discrete items to the income tax provision in the reporting\nperiod in which they occur. We establish accruals for unrecognized tax positions when it is more likely than not that\nour tax return positions may not be fully sustained. The Company records a valuation allowance for deferred tax\nassets when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized.\n44\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company recognizes expense for its share-based compensation based on the fair value of the awards that are\ngranted. The Company’s share-based compensation plans provide for the granting of stock options, restricted stock,\nand performance stock units (\"PSUs\"). In conjunction with the acquisition of BASX (Note 4), we awarded\nperformance awards to key employees (\"Key Employee Awards\") of BASX.\nThe fair values of stock options are estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation\nmodel. The fair value of the PSUs is estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo Model. The use of the\nBlack-Scholes-Merton option valuation model and the Monte Carlo Model requires the input of subjective\nassumptions such as: the expected volatility, the expected term of the grant, expected market performance, risk-free\nrate, and expected dividend yield for stock options. The fair value of restricted stock awards and Key Employee\nAwards is based on the fair market value of AAON common stock on the respective grant dates. The fair value of\nrestricted stock awards is reduced for the present value of dividends. The Key Employee Awards and PSUs do not\naccrue dividends.\nShare-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period of the related share-\nbased compensation award. Historically, stock options and restricted stock awards, granted to employees, vested at a\nrate of 20% per year. Restricted stock awards granted to directors historically vest over the shorter of directors'\nremaining elected term or one-third each year. Beginning March 2021, all new grants of stock options and restricted\nstock awards granted to employees, vest at a rate of 33.3% per year. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.\nHistorically, if the employee or director is retirement eligible (as defined by the Long Term Incentive Plans) or\nbecomes retirement eligible during service period of the related share-based compensation award, the service period\nis the lesser of 1) the grant date, if retirement eligible on grant date, or 2) the period between grant date and\nretirement eligible date. All share-based compensation awards granted on or after March 1, 2020 to retirement\neligible employees or directors contain a one-year employment requirement (minimum service period) or the entire\naward is forfeited. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.\nThe PSUs cliff vest at the end of their respective service period. Share-based compensation expense is recognized on\na straight-line basis over the service period of PSUs. The PSUs are subject to several service and market conditions,\nas defined by the PSU agreement, which allows the holder to retain a pro-rata amount of awards as a result of certain\ntermination conditions, retirement, change in common control, or death. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.\nThe Key Employee Awards cliff vest on December 31, 2023. Share-based compensation expense is recognized on a\nstraight-line basis over the service period of the Key Employee Awards when it is probable that the performance\nconditions will be satisfied. The Key Employee Awards are subject to several service and performance conditions,\nas defined by the Key Employee Award agreement, which allows the holder to retain an amount of the awards as a\nresult of certain termination conditions or change in common control. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.\nDerivative Instruments\nIn the course of normal operations, the Company occasionally enters into contracts such as forward priced physical\ncontracts for the purchase of raw materials that qualify for and are designated as normal purchase or normal sale\ncontracts. Such contracts are exempted from the fair value accounting requirements and are accounted for at the time\nproduct is purchased or sold under the related contract. The Company does not engage in speculative transactions,\nnor does the Company hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.\nRevenue Recognition\nDue to the highly customized nature of many of the Company’s products and each product not having an alternative\nuse to the Company without significant costs to the Company, the Company recognizes revenue over time as\nprogress is made toward satisfying the performance obligations of each contract. The Company has formal\ncancellation policies and generally does not accept returns on these units. As a result, many of the Company’s\nproducts do not have an alternative use and therefore, for these products we recognize revenue over the time it takes\nto produce the unit.\nContract costs include direct materials, direct labor, installation, freight and delivery, commissions and royalties.\nOther costs not related to contract performance, such as indirect labor and materials, small tools and supplies,\noperating expenses, field rework and back charges are charged to expense as incurred. Provisions for estimated\nlosses on contracts in progress are made in the period in which such losses are determined. Changes in job\nperformance, job conditions, and estimated profitability, including those arising from contract penalty provisions\nand final contract settlements, may result in revisions to costs and income, and are estimated and recognized by the\n45\nCompany throughout the life of the contract. The aggregate of costs incurred and income recognized on\nuncompleted contracts in excess of billings is shown as a contract asset within our consolidated balance sheets, and\nthe aggregate of billings on uncompleted contracts in excess of related costs incurred and income recognized is\nshown as a contract liability within our consolidated balance sheets.\nFor all other products that are part sales or standardized units, the Company recognizes revenue, presented net of\nsales tax, when it satisfies the performance obligation in its contracts. As the primary performance obligation in such\na contract is delivery of the requested manufactured equipment, we satisfy the performance obligation when the\ncontrol is passed to the customer, generally at time of shipment. Final sales prices are fixed based on purchase\norders.\nSales allowances and customer incentives are treated as reductions to sales and are provided for based on historical\nexperiences and current estimates.\nHistorically, sales of our products were moderately seasonal with the peak period being May-October of each year\ndue to timing of construction projects being directly related to warmer weather. However, in recent years, given the\nincreases in demand of our product and increases in our backlog, sales has become more constant throughout the\nyear.\nProduct Warranties\nA provision is made for the estimated cost of maintaining product warranties to customers at the time the product is\nsold based upon historical claims experience by product line. The Company records a liability and an expense for\nestimated future warranty claims based upon historical experience and management’s estimate of the level of future\nclaims. Changes in the estimated amounts recognized in prior years are recorded as an adjustment to the liability and\nexpense in the current year.\nThe Company also sells extended warranties on parts for various lengths of time ranging from six months to 10\nyears. Revenue for these separately priced warranties is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the\nseparately priced warranty period.\nRepresentatives and Third Party Products\nWe are responsible for billings and collections resulting from all sales transactions, including those initiated by our\nindependent manufacturer representatives (“Representatives”). Representatives are national companies that are in\nthe business of providing heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (“HVAC”) units and other related products and\nservices to customers. The end user customer orders a bundled group of products and services from the\nRepresentative and expects the Representative to fulfill the order. These other related products and services may\ninclude controls purchased from another manufacturer to operate the unit, start-up services, and curbs for supporting\nthe unit (“Third Party Products”). All are associated with the purchase of a HVAC unit but may be provided by the\nRepresentative or another third party. Only after the specifications are agreed to by the Representative and the\ncustomer, and the decision is made to use an AAON HVAC unit, will we receive notice of the order. We establish\nthe amount we must receive for our HVAC unit (“minimum sales price”), but do not control the total order price that\nis negotiated by the Representative with the end user customer. The Representatives submit the total order price to\nus for invoicing and collection. The total order price includes our minimum sales price and an additional amount\nwhich may include both the Representatives’ fee and amounts due for additional products and services required by\nthe customer. The Company is considered the principal for the equipment we design and manufacture and records\nthat revenue gross. The Company has no control over the Third Party Products to the end customer and the\nCompany is under no obligation related to the Third Party Products. Amounts related to Third Party Products are not\nrecognized as revenue but are recorded as a liability and are included in accrued liabilities on the consolidated\nbalance sheets.\nThe Representatives’ fee and Third Party Products amounts (“Due to Representatives”) are paid only after all\namounts associated with the order are collected from the customer. The amount of payments to our Representatives\nwas $59.2 million, $39.1 million, and $43.9 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021,\nrespectively.\n46\nInsurance Reserves\nUnder the Company’s insurance programs, coverage is obtained for significant liability limits as well as those risks\nrequired to be insured by law or contract. It is the policy of the Company to self-insure a portion of certain expected\nlosses related primarily to workers’ compensation and medical liability. Provisions for losses expected under these\nprograms are recorded based on the Company’s estimates of the aggregate liabilities for the claims incurred.\nLeases\nNew leases entered into by the Company are assessed at lease inception for proper lease classification. At\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, all of our leases are classified as operating leases.\nWe have entered into various short-term operating leases with an initial term of twelve months or less. These leases\nare not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the rent expense for\nthese short-term leases is not significant.\nAs our leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the\ninformation available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Our\nincremental borrowing rate represents the interest rate which we would pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease\npayments over a similar term in a similar economic environment.\nExpense related to these leases is recognized on straight-line basis over the lease term. Certain of our leases contain\nescalating lease payments based on predefined increases. Most leases contain options to renew or terminate. Right-\nof-use assets and lease liabilities reflect only the options which the Company is reasonably certain to exercise.\nThe Company’s leases generally require us to pay for insurance, taxes, utilities, and other operating costs. These\npayments are not included in the right-of-use asset or lease liability and are expensed as incurred.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent\nassets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during\nthe reporting period. Because these estimates and assumptions require significant judgment, actual results could\ndiffer from those estimates and could have a significant impact on our results of operations, financial position, and\ncash flows. We reevaluate our estimates and assumptions as needed, but at a minimum on a quarterly basis. The\nmost significant estimates include, but are not limited to, inventory valuation, inventory reserves, warranty accrual,\nworkers' compensation accrual, medical insurance accrual, income taxes, useful lives of property, plant, and\nequipment, estimated future use of leased property, share-based compensation, revenue percentage of completion\nand estimated costs to complete. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\n47\n3.

Business Combination\nOn November 18, 2021, the Company entered into a membership interest purchase agreement (the “MIPA\nAgreement”) to acquire of all of the issued and outstanding equity ownership of BASX, LLC, an Oregon limited\nliability company, doing business as BASX Solutions. We closed this transaction on December 10, 2021 for a\npurchase price of (i) $100.0 million payable in cash (not including working capital adjustments), and (ii) up to\n$80.0 million in the aggregate of contingent consideration payable in shares of the Company's stock, par value\n$0.004 per share (the \"Shares\").\nThe $80.0 million of contingent consideration payable consists of $78.0 million payable to the former owners of\nBASX, LLC and $2.0 million payable to key employees of BASX, LLC whom are now employed by the Company.\nThe potential future issuance of the Shares is contingent upon BASX meeting certain post-closing earn-out\nmilestones during each of 2021, 2022, and 2023 under the terms of the MIPA Agreement (Note 16). The Company\nfunded the acquisition cash portion of the purchase price and related transaction costs with cash on hand.\nAdditionally, as a condition to closing, the Company entered into a real estate purchase agreement with BASX\nProperties, LLC, an affiliate of BASX, LLC, to acquire the principal real property and improvements utilized by\nBASX for an additional $22.0 million, in cash, subject to customary closing conditions and adjustments. The\nCompany closed this real estate transaction on May 31, 2022, which terminated the related lease (Note 5).\nWe applied pushdown accounting, allowable under ASC 805 \"Business Combinations,\" to \"pushdown\" our stepped-\nup basis in the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to BASX's subsidiary financial statements. The decision to\napply pushdown accounting is irrevocable. We incurred $4.4 million in transaction fees related to the acquisition\nwhich are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses on our consolidated statement of income for the\nyear ended December 31, 2021.\nPro Forma Results of Operations (unaudited)\nThe operations of BASX have been included in our consolidated statements of income since the closing date on\nDecember 10, 2021. The following unaudited pro forma consolidated results of operations for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021 are presented as if the combination had been made on January 1, 2021 and reflects the three-for-\ntwo stock split effective August 16, 2023.\n(unaudited)\nYear ended December 31, 2021\n(in thousands, except per share data)\nRevenues $ 611,158\nNet income 63,491\nEarnings per share:\nBasic $ 0.80\nDilutive $ 0.78\nThese unaudited pro forma results include adjustments necessary in connection with the acquisition.\nThe unaudited consolidated pro forma financial information was prepared in accordance with GAAP and is not\nnecessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred if the acquisition had been completed on\nthe date indicated, nor is it indicative of the future operating results of the Company.\nThe unaudited pro forma results do not reflect events that either have occurred or may occur after the acquisition\ndate, including, but not limited to, the anticipated realization of operating synergies in subsequent periods.

In October 2022, the Parkville, Missouri lease was amended to expand our manufacturing and\noffice space from 51,000 square feet to 86,000 square feet. The amended lease will provide for 31,000 square feet of\nadditional manufacturing and engineering space and for 4,000 square feet of additional office space. The amended\nlease extends the lease term through December 31, 2032.\nThrough the acquisition of BASX (Note 4), we acquired various leases for plant/office space and equipment, which\nwere classified as operating leases. Through May 2022, BASX's manufacturing and office facility in Redmond,\nOregon was leased from a related party (Note 21). On May 31, 2022, we completed the real estate transaction\ndiscussed in Note 4 and the associated operating lease was terminated.\nIn November 2022, the Company entered into a lease arrangement for additional storage facilities in Tulsa,\nOklahoma to support our operations. The lease will add an additional 198,000 square feet to our operations. In\nJanuary 2024, we amended the lease for an additional 157,550 square feet for operations and parts distribution. The\namended lease term will expire November 30, 2029.\nWe also lease several properties near our Redmond location. In the aggregate, these leases contain approximately\n104,500 square feet of additional warehouse space. These leases have expiring terms from February 2025 to\nNovember 2033.\nIn July 2023, the Company entered into a lease agreement with a start date of September 1, 2023, for land and\napproximately 72,000 square feet of facilities in Redmond, Oregon to support our manufacturing operations.

Inventories\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out\n(“FIFO”) method. We establish an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories based on product line changes, the\nfeasibility of substituting parts and the need for supply and replacement parts.\nThe components of inventories and the related changes in the allowance for excess and obsolete inventories are as\nfollows:\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nRaw materials $ 211,259 $ 194,159\nWork in process 5,523 3,501\nFinished goods 2,910 5,806\n219,692 203,466\nLess: Allowance for excess and obsolete inventories (6,160) (4,527)\nTotal, net $ 213,532 $ 198,939\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nAllowance for excess and obsolete inventories: (in thousands)\nBalance, beginning of period $ 4,527 $ 1,787 $ 3,261\nProvisions for excess and obsolete inventories 5,480 2,852 629\nInventories written off (3,847) (112) (2,103)\nBalance, end of period $ 6,160 $ 4,527 $ 1,787\nWe continuously evaluate our inventory parts and write off inventory when no alternative use can be found. During\nthe third quarter of 2022, we made the decision to no longer produce our small packaged geothermal/water-source\nheat pump units consisting of the WH Series horizontal configuration and WV Series vertical configuration. As a\nresult, we have increased our provision for excess and obsolete inventory and written off certain related components\nand parts that cannot be used in other products or sold through our parts business.\n51\n8.

Warranties\nThe Company has product warranties with various terms from one year from the date of first use or 18 months for\nparts, data center cooling solutions, and cleanroom systems to 25 years for certain heat exchangers. The Company\nhas an obligation to replace parts if conditions under the warranty are met. A provision is made for estimated\nwarranty costs at the time the related products are sold based upon the warranty period, historical trends, new\nproducts, and any known identifiable warranty issues.\nChanges in the warranty accrual are as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nWarranty accrual: (in thousands)\nBalance, beginning of period $ 15,682 $ 13,769 $ 13,522\nPayments made (11,274) (6,584) (6,734)\nProvisions 16,165 8,497 6,351\nAssumed in business combination (Note 4) — — 630\nBalance, end of period $ 20,573 $ 15,682 $ 13,769\nWarranty expense: $ 16,165 $ 8,497 $ 6,351\n53\n11.

Revolving Credit Facility\nOn November 24, 2021, we amended our revolving credit facility to provide for maximum borrowings of\n$100.0 million, with an option to increase to $200.0 million. On May 27, 2022, we amended our $100.0 million\nAmended and Restated Loan Agreement dated November 24, 2021 (\"Revolver\"), to provide for maximum\nborrowings of $200.0 million. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had an outstanding balance\nunder the Revolver of $38.3 million and $71.0 million, respectively. We have two standby letters of credit totaling\n$2.3 million as of December 31, 2023 and one standby letter of credit totaling $0.8 million as of December 31,\n2022. Borrowings available under the Revolver at December 31, 2023, were $159.4 million. The Revolver expires\non May 27, 2027.\nAny outstanding loans under the Revolver bear interest at the daily compounded secured overnight financing rate\n(\"SOFR\") plus the applicable margin. Applicable margin, ranging from 1.25% - 1.75%, is determined quarterly\nbased on the Company's leverage ratio. The Company is also subject to letter of credit fees, ranging from 1.25% -\n1.75%, and a commitment fee, ranging from 0.10% - 0.20%. The applicable fee percentage is determined quarterly\nbased on the Company's leverage ratio. At December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, the weighted average interest rate of\nour Revolver was 6.3%, 3.0%, and 1.3%, respectively. Fees associated with the unused portion of the committed\namount are included in interest expense on our consolidated statements of income and were not material for the\nyears ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nIf SOFR cannot be determined pursuant to the definition, as defined by the Revolver agreement, any outstanding\neffected loans will be deemed to have been converted into alternative base rate (\"ABR\") loans. ABR loans would\nbear interest at a rate per annum equal to the highest of (a) the Prime Rate in effect on such day, (b) the Federal\nFunds Rate in effect on such day plus 0.50%, or (c) daily simple SOFR for a one-month tenor in effect on such day\nplus 1.00%.\n54\nAt December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with our financial covenants as defined by the Revolver. These\ncovenants included a financial covenant that we meet certain parameters related to our leverage ratio. At December\n31, 2023, our leverage ratio was 0.15 to 1.0, which meets the requirement of not being above 3 to 1.\n13. Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes consists of the following:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\n(in thousands)\nCurrent $ 52,058 $ 37,489 $ 6,755\nDeferred (6,527) (13,332) 3,669\nIncome tax provision $ 45,531 $ 24,157 $ 10,424\nThe provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory Federal income tax rate\nbefore the provision for income taxes.\nThe reconciliation of the Federal statutory income tax rate to the effective income tax rate is as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nFederal statutory rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 %\nState income taxes, net of Federal benefit 3.9 % 4.1 % 1.8 %\nChange in valuation allowance (1.4) % — % 1.0 %\nExcess tax benefits related to share-based compensation (Note 14) (4.0) % (2.4) % (7.8) %\nReturn to provision 0.2 % (0.3) % — %\nNon-deductible executive compensation 1.7 % — % — %\nResearch and development tax credits (1.2) % (2.1) % (1.1) %\nOther 0.2 % (0.9) % 0.2 %\nEffective tax rate 20.4 % 19.4 % 15.1 %\nOn May 21, 2021, the State of Oklahoma enacted House Bill 2960, effectively reducing the corporate income tax\nrate in Oklahoma from 6% to 4%. This resulted in a benefit of $0.8 million included in the table above under State\nincome taxes, net of Federal benefit, for the year ending December 31, 2021.\nWe have historically earned investment tax credits from the state of Oklahoma’s manufacturing property investment\nprogram. We use the flow-through method to account for investment tax credits earned on eligible tangible asset\nexpenditures. Under this method, the investment tax credits are recognized as a reduction to our Oklahoma income\ntax expense in the year they are used. As part of our expansion projects in Oklahoma, we identified a separate, more\nadvantageous Oklahoma credit program (not income tax related) which will cause us to discontinue our\naccumulation of credits for Oklahoma’s manufacturing property investment program after the 2022 tax year.\nThe Company had investment tax credit carryforwards with a valuation allowance reserved against them as we did\nnot have sufficient taxable income to utilize the carryforwards, in part because we generated more credit each year\nthan we were able to utilize. Because the Company will not generate additional excess credits after our 2022 tax\nyear, we will be able to use our credit carryforwards against future taxable income and the related valuation\nallowance was reversed resulting in a one-time benefit of $3.1 million to the income tax provision for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, we have investment tax credit carryforwards of approximately\n$3.1 million. These credits have estimated expirations from the year 2039 through 2043.\nIn accordance with the 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, under Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m), the tax deduction\nfor covered executives of public companies is limited to $1.0 million per individual. Because of the increase in our\nstock price and timing of executive stock option exercises this resulted in an increase to the income tax provision of\n$3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n55\nWe also earn research and development tax credits as defined under Section 41 of the Internal Revenue Code. To\nqualify for the research and development tax credits, we perform annual studies that identify, document, and support\neligible expenses related to qualified research and development activities. Eligible expenses include but are not\nlimited to supplies, materials, contractor expenses and internal employee wages.\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets\nand liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amount used for income tax purposes.\nThe significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nDeferred income tax assets (liabilities):\nAllowance for credit losses and inventory reserves $ 1,724 $ 1,337\nWarranty accrual 5,462 4,184\nOther accruals 3,989 4,814\nShare-based compensation 8,560 7,440\nResearch & development expenses 18,647 11,265\nOklahoma investment credit carryforward 2,306 3,115\nOther, net 1,673 2,339\n42,361 34,494\nValuation allowance — (3,115)\nNet deferred income tax assets 42,361 31,379\nProperty & equipment (54,495) (50,040)\nTotal deferred income tax liabilities (54,495) (50,040)\nNet deferred income tax liabilities $ (12,134) $ (18,661)\nIn accordance with the 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, under Internal Revenue Code Section 174, research and\ndevelopment expenses incurred after December 31, 2021 are required to be capitalized and amortized over 5 years.\nThe amortization requirements for tax purposes is a mid-year convention, meaning that the tax amortization is 10%\nin the year of acquisition, 20% in the following 4 years, and 10% in the final year.\nThe amount of income tax that we pay annually is dependent on various factors, including the timing of certain\ndeductions. These deductions can vary from year to year and, consequently, the amount of income taxes paid in\nfuture years will vary from the amounts paid in prior years.\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S., state and foreign income tax jurisdictions. We are subject to U.S. income tax\nexaminations for the tax years 2020 to present, and to non-U.S. income tax examinations for the tax years 2019 to\npresent. In addition, we are subject to state and local income tax examinations for tax years 2019 to present. The\nCompany continues to evaluate its need to file returns in various state jurisdictions. Any interest or penalties would\nbe recognized as a component of income tax expense.\n14. Share-Based Compensation\nAs discussed in Note 16, the Company declared a three-for-two stock split effective August 16, 2023. All share and\nper share information has been updated to reflect the effect of this stock split.\nOn May 22, 2007, our stockholders adopted a Long-Term Incentive Plan (as amended, “LTIP”) which provided an\nadditional 5.0 million shares that could be granted in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted\nstock awards, performance units, and performance awards. Under the LTIP, the exercise price of shares granted may\nnot be less than 100% of the fair market value at the date of the grant.\nOn May 24, 2016, our stockholders adopted the 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan (“2016 Plan”) which provides for\napproximately 13.4 million shares, comprised of 5.1 million new shares provided for under the 2016 Plan,\napproximately 0.6 million shares that were available for issuance under the previous LTIP that are now authorized\n56\nfor issuance under the 2016 Plan, approximately 3.9 million shares that were approved by the stockholders on May\n15, 2018, and an additional 3.8 million shares that were approved by the stockholders on May 12, 2020.\nUnder the 2016 Plan, shares can be granted in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock\nawards, performance awards, dividend equivalent rights, and other awards. Under the 2016 Plan, the exercise price\nof shares granted may not be less than 100% of the fair market value at the date of the grant. The 2016 Plan is\nadministered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors or such other committee of the Board of\nDirectors as is designated by the Board of Directors (the “Committee”). Membership on the Committee is limited to\nindependent directors. The Committee may delegate certain duties to one or more officers of the Company as\nprovided in the 2016 Plan.

Stockholders of record at the close of business on July 28, 2023 received one\nadditional share for every two shares they held as of that date on August 16, 2023 (ex-dividend date August 17,\n2023).

We estimated the fair value\nof contingent consideration related to these shares to be approximately $60.0 million, which is included in additional\npaid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheets.

In connection with the 2019 NMTC transaction, the Company received a\n$23.0 million NMTC allocation for the Project and secured low interest financing and the potential for future debt\nforgiveness related to the 2019 Project.\nUpon closing of the 2019 NMTC transaction, the Company provided an aggregate of approximately $15.9 million to\nthe 2019 Investor, in the form of a loan receivable, with a term of twenty-five years, bearing an interest rate of 1.0%.\nThis $15.9 million in proceeds plus capital contributed from the 2019 Investor was used to make an aggregate\n$22.5 million loan to a subsidiary of the Company. This financing arrangement is secured by equipment at the\nCompany's Longview, Texas facilities and a guarantee from the Company, including an unconditional guarantee of\nthe NMTCs.\nThis transaction also includes a put/call feature either of which can be exercised at the end of the seven-year\ncompliance period. The 2019 Investor may exercise its put option or the Company can exercise the call, both of\nwhich could serve to trigger forgiveness of a portion of the debt. The 2019 Investor's interest of $6.5 million is\nrecorded in New market tax credit obligation on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company incurred\napproximately $0.3 million of debt issuance costs related to the above transactions, which are being amortized over\nthe life of the transaction.\n2023 New Markets Tax Credit\nOn April 25, 2023, the Company entered into a transaction with a subsidiary of an unrelated third-party financial\ninstitution (the “2023 Investor”) and a certified Community Development Entity under a qualified New Markets Tax\nCredit (“2023 NMTC”) program pursuant to Section 45D of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, related\nto an investment in plant and equipment to facilitate the expansion of our Longview, Texas manufacturing\noperations (the “2023 Project”). In connection with the 2023 NMTC transaction, the Company received a\n$23.0 million NMTC allocation for the 2023 Project and secured low interest financing and the potential for future\ndebt forgiveness related to the expansion of its Longview, Texas facilities.\nUpon closing of the 2023 NMTC transaction, the Company provided an aggregate of approximately $16.7 million to\nthe Investor, in the form of a loan receivable, with a term of twenty-five years, bearing an interest rate of 1.0%. This\n$16.7 million in proceeds plus capital contributed from the 2023 Investor was used to make an aggregate\n$23.8 million loan to a subsidiary of the Company. This financing arrangement is secured by a guarantee from the\nCompany, including an unconditional guarantee of the NMTCs. The net proceeds from the closing of the 2023\nNMTC is included in restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheets required to be used for the 2023 Project.\nThis transaction also includes a put/call feature either of which can be exercised at the end of the seven-year\ncompliance period. The 2023 Investor may exercise its put option or the Company can exercise the call, both of\nwhich could serve to trigger forgiveness of a portion of the debt. The 2023 Investor's interest of $5.7 million is\nrecorded in New market tax credit obligation on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company incurred\napproximately $0.4 million of debt issuance costs related to the above transactions, which are being amortized over\nthe life of the transaction.\nThe 2019 Investor and the 2023 Investor are each subject to 100 percent recapture of the 2019 and 2023 NMTC,\nrespectively, it receives for a period of seven years, as provided in the Internal Revenue Code and applicable U.S.\nTreasury regulations in the event that the financing facility of the Borrower under the transaction (AAON Coil\nProducts, Inc.) becomes ineligible for NMTC treatment per the Internal Revenue Code requirements. The Company\nis required to be in compliance with various regulations and contractual provisions that apply to the 2019 NMTC\narrangements and 2023 NMTC arrangements, respectively. Noncompliance with applicable requirements could\nresult in the 2019 and/or 2023 Investor’s projected tax benefits not being realized and, therefore, require the\nCompany to indemnify the 2019 Investor and 2023 Investor for any loss or recapture of the 2019 NMTC and 2023\nNMTC, respectively, related to the financing until such time as the recapture provisions have expired under the\napplicable statute of limitations. The Company does not anticipate any credit recapture will be required in\nconnection with this financing arrangement.\n64\nThe 2019 Investor and 2023 Investor and its majority owned community development entity are considered VIEs\nand the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIEs. This conclusion was reached based on the following:\n• the ongoing activities of the VIEs, collecting and remitting interest and fees and NMTC compliance, were\nall considered in the initial design and are not expected to significantly affect performance throughout the\nlife of the VIE;\n• contractual arrangements obligate the Company to comply with NMTC rules and regulations and provide\nvarious other guarantees to the Investor and community development entity;\n• the 2019 Investor and 2023 Investor lacks a material interest in the underling economics of the project; and\n• the Company is obligated to absorb losses of the VIEs.\nBecause the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIEs, they have been included in the consolidated financial\nstatements. There are no other assets, liabilities or transaction in these VIEs outside of the financing transactions\nexecuted as part of the NMTC arrangement.\n2024 New Markets Tax Credit\nOn February 27, 2024, the Company entered into a transaction with a subsidiary of an unrelated third-party financial\ninstitution (the “2024 Investor”) and a certified Community Development Entity under a qualified New Markets Tax\nCredit (“2024 NMTC”) program pursuant to Section 45D of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, related\nto an investment in real estate to facilitate the current expansion of our Longview, Texas manufacturing operations\n(the “Project”). In connection with the 2024 NMTC transaction, the Company received a $15.5 million NMTC\nallocation for the Project and secured low interest financing and the potential for future debt forgiveness related to\nthe expansion of its Longview, Texas facilities.\nUpon closing of the 2024 NMTC transaction, the Company provided an aggregate of approximately $11.0 million to\nthe Investor, in the form of a loan receivable, with a term of twenty-five years, bearing an interest rate of 1.0%. This\n$11.0 million in proceeds plus capital contributed from the Investor was used to make an aggregate $16.0 million\nloan to a subsidiary of the Company. This financing arrangement is secured by a guarantee from the Company,\nincluding an unconditional guarantee of NMTCs.\nThis transaction also includes a put/call feature that either of which can be exercised at the end of the seven-year\ncompliance period. The Investor may exercise its put option or the Company can exercise the call, both of which\ncould serve to trigger forgiveness of a portion of the debt.\nThe 2024 Investor is subject to 100 percent recapture of the 2024 NMTC it receives for a period of seven years, as\nprovided in the Internal Revenue Code and applicable U.S. Treasury regulations in the event that the financing\nfacility of the Borrower under the transaction (AAON Coil Products, Inc.) becomes ineligible for NMTC treatment\nper the Internal Revenue Code requirements. The Company is required to be in compliance with various regulations\nand contractual provisions that apply to the 2024 NMTC arrangement. Noncompliance with applicable requirements\ncould result in the 2024 Investor’s projected tax benefits not being realized and, therefore, require the Company to\nindemnify the 2024 Investor for any loss or recapture of the 2024 NMTC related to the financing until such time as\nthe recapture provisions have expired under the applicable statute of limitations. The Company does not anticipate\nany credit recapture will be required in connection with this financing arrangement.\n18.

The\nFirst Amended Complaint asserts that the Company improperly terminated Plaintiffs and seeks damages alleged to\nbe no less than $48.6 million, plus fees and costs. The Company filed its Answer to First Amended Complaint on\nJanuary 31, 2023.\n65\nOn September 28, 2023, the parties attended a court ordered settlement conference and agreed to resolve the case for\n$7.5 million. A settlement agreement was entered into on October 25, 2023 and the case has been dismissed with\nprejudice. The settlement of $7.5 million has been included in selling, general and administrative expenses on our\nconsolidated statement of income. The final payment was made on October 26, 2023.\nOther Matters\nThe Company is involved from time to time in claims and lawsuits incidental to our business arising from various\nmatters, including alleged violations of contract, product liability, warranty, environmental, regulatory, personal\ninjury, intellectual property, employment, tax and other laws. We closely monitor these claims and legal actions and\nfrequently consult with our legal counsel to determine whether they may, when resolved, have a material adverse\neffect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows and we accrue and/or disclose loss contingencies\nas appropriate. We do not believe these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\nposition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe are occasionally party to short-term, cancellable and occasionally non-cancellable, fixed price contracts with\nmajor suppliers for the purchase of raw material and component parts. We expect to receive delivery of raw\nmaterials for use in our manufacturing operations. These contracts are not accounted for as derivative instruments\nbecause they meet the normal purchase and normal sales exemption. In 2023, the Company executed a five-year\npurchase commitment for refrigerants. In 2023, the Company made payments of $10.1 million on this contract.\nEstimated minimum future payments are $11.9 million, $9.1 million, $10.5 million, and $11.2 million for 2024,\n2025, 2026, and 2027, respectively. We had no other material contractual purchase obligations as of December 31,\n2023.\n19. New Accounting Pronouncements\nChanges to U.S. GAAP are established by the FASB in the form of accounting standards updates (“ASUs”) to the\nFASB’s Accounting Standards Codification. We consider the applicability and impact of all ASUs. ASUs not listed\nbelow were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on our\nconsolidated financial statements and notes thereto.\nIn October 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-06, Disclosure Improvements: Codification Amendments in Response\nto SEC's Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative. The new guidance is intended to update a variety of\ndisclosure requirements. The effective date for each amendment will be the date on with the SEC's removal of that\nrelated disclosure from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K becomes effective. Early adoption is prohibited. Upon\nadoption, this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements and related\ndisclosures.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280). The new guidance\nimproves reportable segment disclosures primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses\nand by requiring current annual disclosures to be provided in interim periods. The amendments in this ASU are\neffective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption, this ASU is not expected to have a material\nimpact on the Company's financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740). The new guidance is intended to\nenhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The amendments in this ASU are\neffective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Upon adoption, this ASU is not expected to have a\nmaterial impact on the Company's financial statements and related disclosures.\n66\n20. Earnings Per Share\nBasic net income per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of\ncommon stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share assumes the conversion of all potentially\ndilutive securities and is calculated by dividing net income by the sum of the weighted average number of shares of\ncommon stock outstanding plus all potentially dilutive securities. Dilutive common shares consist primarily of stock\noptions and restricted stock awards.\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:\n2023 2022 2021\nNumerator: (in thousands, except share and per share data)\nNet income $ 177,623 $ 100,376 $ 58,758\nDenominator:\nBasic weighted average shares3 81,156,114 79,582,480 78,606,298\nEffect of dilutive shares related to stock based compensation1, 3 1,972,380 1,264,175 1,952,547\nEffect of dilutive shares related contingent consideration2, 3 166,796 298,955 34,639\nDiluted weighted average shares3 83,295,290 81,145,610 80,593,484\nEarnings per share:\nBasic3 $ 2.19 $ 1.26 $ 0.75\nDilutive3 $ 2.13 $ 1.24 $ 0.73\nAnti-dilutive shares:\nShares3 314,108 908,221 456,045\n1 Dilutive shares related to stock options, restricted stock, PSUs and Key Employee Awards (Note 14)\n2 Dilutive shares related to contingent shares issued to former owners of BASX (Note 4)\n3 Reflects three-for-two stock split effective August 16, 2023.\n21.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures.\n(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated\nthe effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the\nExchange Act) as of December 31, 2023.\nBased upon the evaluation, our principal executive and principal financial officers have concluded that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures were effective at December 31, 2023 to ensure the information required to be\ndisclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our\nmanagement, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely\ndecisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods\nspecified in the rules and forms of the SEC.\n(b) Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial\nreporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial\nreporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial\nofficers, and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in\naccordance with U.S. GAAP.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.\nAlso, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become\ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\nIn making our assessment of internal control over financial reporting, management has used the criteria issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in the 2013 Internal Control—\nIntegrated Framework. Based on our assessment, our management concluded that the Company maintained\neffective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023.\nThe effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 has been\naudited by Grant Thornton LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is\nincluded in this Item 9A of this report on Form 10-K.\n(c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of\n2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial\nreporting.\n70\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nBoard of Directors and Stockholders\nAAON, Inc.\nOpinion on internal control over financial reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of AAON, Inc. (a Nevada corporation) and subsidiaries\n(the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated\nFramework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In our\nopinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2023, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by\nCOSO.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, and our report dated February 28, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial\nstatements.\nBasis for opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and\nfor its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting (“Management’s Report”). Our\nresponsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.\nWe are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the\nCompany in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting\nwas maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating\neffectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered\nnecessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable\nassurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance\nwith generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made\nonly in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable\nassurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s\nassets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.\nAlso, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become\ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\n/s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP\nTulsa, Oklahoma\nFebruary 28, 2024\n71\nItem 9B.

Our journey toward\nsustainability and resilience has been steady since the Company began.\nWe continue to evolve our approach to address critical challenges\nand persist in improving the transparency of our sustainability strategy.\nLeading the industry with superior energy-efficient equipment has\nalways been at the forefront of the Company. Just as important,\nis reducing our scope 1 and 2 emissions, advancing our inclusion\nand diversity efforts, and improving our corporate governance.\nAt AAON, we strive to be the best stewards of society and we made\nanother leap in our objective in 2023.\nAs the environment becomes more of a focus in global society due\nto climate change, the commercial HVAC industry is responsible for\ndeveloping more sustainable, energy-efficient products. In the U.S.,\ncommercial buildings consumed approximately 17% of total energy\nconsumption in 2022 and made up about 16% of carbon emissions,\nper the Energy Information Administration. Advancing technologies\nenable the industry to improve building operations and reduce energy\nconsumption and carbon emissions. AAON has been a leader in the\ndecarbonization objectives by producing the most energy-efficient\nequipment in the North American packaged rooftop market.\nMost of our direct competitors in this market manufacture basic\nequipment that is much less energy efficient.\nFROM THE CEO | 6\nAbout AAON Products Sales & Marketing Environment People & Culture Social Responsibility\nLeading up to January 1, 2023, at which time the Department of\nEnergy required all HVAC equipment to meet a higher minimum\nenergy efficiency standard, AAON was not required to alter any of its\ndesigns because all its equipment had met the standards for several\nyears. On the contrary, the regulation forced much of the rest of\nthe industry to make significant upgrades to their equipment as a\nsignificant percentage had not met the new standards.\nIn 2023, AAON went further by making significant investments\nand advancements with its heat pump technology. In our view,\nheat pumps are the likely solution to further progression in\ndecarbonizing buildings as they are fully electric and very energy\nefficient. Currently, no federal incentives or regulations are driving\nthe transition to this technology in the commercial HVAC industry;\nhowever, AAON believes it is responsible for leading in this effort.\nUntil recently, all heat pumps on the market were designed to\noperate down to only 25 to 30 degrees Fahrenheit, excluding the\ntechnology as a solution for most of North America. AAON released\nits newly branded heat pump called the Alpha Class, which is now\nthe only heat pump on the market today that is operable down to\nzero degrees Fahrenheit. Furthermore, the Company is in the middle\nof developing a heat pump capable of operating at much colder In addition to the achievements we have made with product development,\ntemperatures than zero degrees.

We expect to incur costs associated with\nthis transition related to the purchase of the new refrigerant as well as additional sensors and detectors on our\nHVAC systems. In addition, we expect to incur costs to our facilities, specifically costs to store and use the new\nrefrigerant in production; however, we do not expect these costs to be significant. Due to the increased flammability\nof the new refrigerant, the insurance industry may require higher premiums for companies once the conversion\nbegins. Furthermore, due to the expected increased demand of the newer refrigerants as well as the older\nhydrofluorocarbon refrigerants (as they are phased out), we expect to see increased manufacturing costs related to\npurchases of refrigerants and could see higher costs for future warranty claims. As with any significant regulatory\nchange, delays or other changes to implementation timing could also have a negative impact on our operations\nand profitability.\nAdditionally, regulations that reduce or eliminate the use of fossil fuels such as natural gas and propane may reduce\nor eliminate sales of gas fired equipment for which AAON holds a strong market position.

It consists of a compressor, a condenser coil, a fan, and controls,\nall housed in a single unit. Our condensing unit, the CF Series, is available\nfrom 2 to 60 tons.\nAs regulatory agencies increase the minimum standards to ensure progress in\nsustainability and energy efficiency, many of AAON’s products far exceed these\nstandards and are among the highest-efficiency products currently available.\nIn the period leading up to this point, a large part of the industry was\ncompelled to revamp the designs of a substantial portion of their product\nofferings. This led to an increase in manufacturing costs and prompted steep\nprice hikes. However, as AAON’s entire product range already complied with SB Series\nthe elevated standards, we were able to enforce more modest price increases\ncompared to the rest of the industry. We are confident that this will enable\nAAON to broaden our market penetration, thereby increasing the proportion of\nbuildings that benefit from our highly energy-efficient HVAC equipment.\nAAON products exhibit a wide range of performance characteristics, with\ncooling capacities spanning from 2 to 261 tons and heating capacities from\n7,200 to 4,500,000 British Thermal Units (BTUs). In a standard commercial\nbuilding setup, one ton of air conditioning is typically required for every\n300–400 square feet. Consequently, a 100,000 square foot building may\nnecessitate the use of multiple units. AAON’s packaged rooftop units, equipped\nwith two-stage compressors, are fine-tuned with high-efficiency evaporator\nand condenser coils and variable-speed fans. This results in an AHRI Certified\nperformance reaching up to 20.3 SEER (Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio) and CF Series V3 Series\n22.5 IEER (Integrated Energy Efficiency Ratio).\nThe AAON H3/V3 Series energy recovery wheel air handling units are\ndesigned to provide 100% outside air ventilation in an energy-efficient manner.\nThey achieve this by reclaiming energy that would typically be lost through\nbuilding exhaust.\nAAON PRODUCTS | 44\nAAbboouutt AAAAOONN PPrroodduuccttss SSaalleess && MMaarrkkeettiinngg EEnnvviirroonnmmeenntt PPeeooppllee && CCuullttuurree SSoocciiaall RReessppoonnssiibbiilliittyy\nThe energy recovery feature is offered in our RQ, RN, RZ, and SB semi-\ncustom units, as well as the H3, V3, and M2 air handling units.
