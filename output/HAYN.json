We will, without exception, adhere to the\nhighest standards to govern our business conduct for the good of our company,\nour employees, our communities and our customers. In addition, we believe\ndiversity makes us stronger, and that everyone should be treated with respect\nand dignity in an inclusive and diverse environment.\nAs far as innovation, Haynes excels at alloy and application development. We\nwill continue to strive to have a positive environmental impact on the markets\nwe serve through the development of alloys and applications that can and will\ncontinue to contribute to the worldwide efforts to reduce greenhouse gas\nemissions.\nIn addition to producing alloys that enable greener technologies, we are working\nwith several outside entities to develop technologies that will enable Haynes to\nproduce our alloys using less resources such as electricity, natural gas and\nwater.\nThis report will provide our stakeholders with the highlights of our sustainability\nefforts to date, along with our ambitions for the future.\nAs we celebrate our 112th year, we are proud of the important roles that our\nemployees and customers have and will continue to play in improving our\ncompany, our communities and the world we live in.\nSincerely,\nMichael Shor\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nHaynes International, Inc.\nHaynes International 2022032 S3u Ssutsataininaabbiilliittyy R Reepporot r |t 1 | 2\nTable of Contents\nOur Company 3\nAlloy Development 4\nAlloy Manufacturing 5\nManufacturing Facilities and Service Centers 6\nProcessing Capabilities 7\nOur Markets 8\nHealth, Safety, Environmental, and Quality Policy 9\nOur Commitment to Sustainability 10\nConservation and Sustainability Efforts 11\nCarbon and Climate 12\nCarbon and Climate Risks 13\nCarbon and Climate Opportunities 14\nGreenhouse Gas Emission Reduction Roadmap 15\nCarbon Intensity 16\nEmissions Data 17\nUsage Data 18\nWaste Management 19\nWater Conservation 20\nSafety and Health 21\nSafety and Health Data 22-23\nEmployee Gender Data 24\nEmployee Age and Ethnicity Data 25\nGovernance 26\nCommunity and Culture 27\nHaynes International 2022032 S3u Ssutsataininaabbiilliittyy R Reepporot r |t 2| 2\nOur Company\nHaynes is one of the world’s largest developer, manufacturer, and distributor of\nhigh‐performance nickel‐ and cobalt‐based alloys for use in high‐temperature\nand corrosion applications.\nOn July 4, 1894, Elwood Haynes drove one of the first gasoline‐powered\nautomobiles in Kokomo, Indiana. His aptly named automobile, “Pioneer,” was a\ntrue description of the tireless inventor himself. His metallurgical invention of\ncobalt‐based alloys is regarded by some to be more important than his\nautomobile invention. His passion to discover innovative solutions for everyday\napplications led to many other patents that revolutionized our lives and set the\nfoundation for our company’s many achievements.\nWhen Elwood Haynes drove his “Pioneer” down Pumpkinvine Pike, he set in motion\nan inventive spirit that led to the foundation of Haynes International, instilled our\ncommitment to alloy excellence, and inspired our Tradition of Alloy Innovation.\nOur history spans over a century of products, processes, and, most of all, people.\nFormed in Kokomo, Indiana in October 1912, the 112-year history of Haynes’\ncontinuous operation also captures the historic growth of many well-known\nnickel-and cobalt-based superalloy families. Our high‐performance alloys play\na critical role in aerospace, power generation, chemical processing,\npharmaceuticals, and many other exciting markets.\n1912 Haynes Stellite Works founded.\n1920 Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation bought\nHaynes Stellite Works.\n1970 Union Carbide sold the company to Cabot Corporation.\n1987 Haynes International, Inc. becomes an independent company.\n2007 Haynes International, Inc. becomes a public company.\nHaynes International 2023 Sustainability Report | 3\nAlloy Development\nAlloy development is at the very heart of what we do.\nWe currently maintain approximately 17 U.S. patents and applications, and\napproximately 227 foreign counterpart patents and applications targeted at\ncountries with significant or potential markets for our products. Since fiscal 2003,\nthe Company’s technical programs have yielded nine new proprietary alloys.\nThe alloys being commercialized saw significant further advancement in the\nprocess during fiscal 2021, 2022, and 2023.\nOur on-going development of patent-protected alloys positions us as one of\nthe industry leaders in research and development-driven products. We focus\ndirectly on customer demand and conduct long-term research to continually\ndevelop, manufacture, and distribute patent-protected HASTELLOY® and\nHAYNES® high-performance alloys.\nOur Research and Technology facilities are located at the Kokomo, Indiana\nheadquarters that consist of offices and laboratories. We have fully-equipped\ntesting laboratories that include: a mechanical test lab, a metallographic lab, an\nelectron microscopy lab, a corrosion lab, a high-temperature lab, and a welding\nlab. These facilities also contain a reduced scale, fully equipped melt shop\nand process lab.\nOur R&T staff consists of physical\nmetallurgists, high-temperature and\ncorrosion scientists, electrochemical\nscientists, mechanical metallurgists, welding\nengineers, and technicians. Many have\nengineering or science degrees, including\nmasters and doctoral degrees, with the\nmajority in the field of metallurgical\nengineering or materials science. We have\nthe worldwide technical and commercial\nservice capabilities to solve your application\nand fabrication issues.\nHaynes International 2023 Sustainability Report | 4\nAlloy Manufacturing\nHaynes International - synonymous with high-performance alloys.\nStarting with the first cobalt, chromium-tungsten metal cutting tools Elwood\nHaynes pioneered for Haynes Stellite Works in 1912, Haynes International has\nalways been a highly specialized, high-performance alloy producer. Mission-\ncritical applications, such as aerospace and chemical processing, demand\nstringent quality standards. We develop and manufacture high-performance,\nhigh-temperature and corrosion-resistant alloys that exceed some of the most\nrigorous specifications.\nOur high-performance products require a longer and more complex multi-stage\nmanufacturing process than commodity grade alloys or carbon steels. The\nalloying elements in high-performance alloys must be highly refined during\nmelting, and the manufacturing process must be tightly controlled to produce\nprecise chemical properties. The resulting alloyed material is more difficult to\nprocess because, by design, it is more resistant to deformation.\nHigh-performance alloys require a greater\nforce to be applied when hot or cold\nworking and are less susceptible to\nreduction or thinning when rolling or\nforging. This results in more cycles of rolling,\nannealing and pickling compared to a\nlower-performance alloy to achieve proper\ndimensions. Our alloys undergo several\ndistinct stages of melting, remelting,\nannealing, hot reduction, cold reduction,\npickling and testing before they achieve the\nrequired specifications.\nWe manufacture sophisticated alloys for demanding end-uses. We have the\nspecialized equipment and the technical expertise to market and manufacture\nthese complex alloys.\nHaynes International 2023 Sustainability Report | 5\nManufacturing Facilities and Service Centers\nWe have manufacturing facilities in Kokomo, Indiana;\nArcadia, Louisiana; and Hendersonville, North Carolina.\nThe Kokomo facility specializes in flat products; the\nArcadia facility specializes in tubular products; and\nthe Hendersonville facility specializes in wire and\nwelding products.
