Scroll through to the Hub Layout section and select how you want to view your account list and financial tools on the screen.\n\nWhat security features are part of the Hub?\n\nAnswer: Your online banking experience at huntington.com is backed by our strong commitment to security and privacy. Learn more at [huntington.com/Privacy-Security](https://www.huntington.com/Privacy-Security).\n\nDo The Hub and financial tools work with all my accounts? What if I have both personal and business accounts?\n\nAnswer: The type of accounts you have will determine which Hub tools are available to you. \n\nIf you have both personal and business accounts, all of your accounts will be listed under My Accounts. However, the financial tools available to you will change based on which username you used to log into huntington.com. Some financial tools are exclusive to personal or business accounts.\n\nHow do I choose which accounts I want The Hub tools to analyze? \n\nAnswer: At the bottom of The Hub, click the Manage Hub & Tool Views link. You can select which accounts are included in your financial tools by default. Select at least one of the available accounts for each tool.\n\n[Transactions and Categories](#E9D395AC87054441A0EDF39C181E108C)\n\nWhat is considered a transaction?\n\nAnswer: A transaction is any individual credit or debit in your Huntington checking, savings, money market, personal credit line or Voice Credit Card® accounts. Note, eligible accounts may vary for personal and business customers.\n\nIn the Spend Analysis Transaction Detail, what are tags?\n\nAnswer: Tags in the Transaction Detail window allow you to add a keyword or phrase to your transactions, to help you organize and track your finances. For example, you may choose to tag certain expenses as having been made on vacation or having an impact on your tax filings.\n\nHow do I download my transactions?\n\nAnswer: For personal accounts, click on the account to visit the Account Details page. There you’ll see an option to Download Account Transactions. For business accounts, The Hub’s Transactions tool has a download link. Your transactions can be downloaded into Quicken, QuickBooks and CSV formats.\n\nCan I upload transactions from other financial institutions?\n\nAnswer: Not at this time. Only transactions from your Huntington accounts are currently included in Transaction, Spend Analysis, Spend SetterSM, and Cash Flow ForecastSM. Look for this feature in future.\n\nWhat are categories and how are they determined?\n\nAnswer: Categories group together similar transactions to give you an accurate snapshot of where your money goes each month. For example, the category Dining: Coffee Shop would allow you to know just how much of your money went toward lattes. Yep, it’s a lot for us, too. Note, categories vary between personal and business accounts. \n\nEvery transaction is automatically assigned a category, initially from this default list. You can re-categorize a transaction anytime. Click on a transaction to bring up the Transaction Detail window. Then click Edit to open the Select Category window.\n\nHow do I add, edit or delete a category?\n\nAnswer: Your spending is organized into category families, such as Dining or Travel. \n\nTo add, edit or delete a category, click on a transaction to bring up the Transaction Detail window. Then click Edit to open the Select Category window. Open a category family to add, edit or delete categories. Up to 10 categories can be added to each family. The category family itself cannot be deleted or modified.\n\nAre the categories in my Spend Analysis the same as the Rewards Categories for my Voice Credit Card®?\n\nAnswer: No. Spend Analysis includes transactions from all of your eligible Huntington accounts and isn't tied to any rewards program. The rewards categories for your Voice Credit Card® are tied only to your Voice Credit Card spending.\n\nMy transaction is in the wrong category. How do I move it?\n\nAnswer: You can re-categorize a transaction anytime. Click on a transaction to bring up the Transaction Detail window. Then click Edit to open the Select Category window. \n\nAfter you change a category, you will be asked if you’d like to create a rule to automatically assign similar transactions or merchants to your preferred category in the future.\n\nWhat if I need a different category?\n\nAnswer: You can create up to 10 categories within each category family to better track your spending. For instance, a purchase at a gas station will be automatically assigned to the Transportation: Gas category. But if you bought groceries there, not gas, you could reassign that transaction to Groceries: Groceries. Say those groceries were snacks for a road trip. You can add a category within Groceries called Road Trip Snacks.\n\nCan I split a transaction into more than one category?\n\nAnswer: Yes! Let’s say you go to a gas station, and go inside to pay $30 in gas and $10 in snacks. That $40 transaction will automatically be categorized as Transportation: Gas. Click on a transaction to bring up the Transaction Detail window. Then click Edit to open the Split Transaction window.\n\nHow are cash and checks categorized?\n\nAnswer: In your transactions, cash deposits will be categorized within the Income family and cash withdrawals will be considered Financial Activity: Cash Withdrawal. Any check you write will be categorized Financial Activity: Check. To improve the accuracy of your financial tools, you can re-categorize these transactions. Click on the transaction to bring up the Transaction Detail window. Then click Edit to open the Select Category window. \n\nOr you can use a debit or credit card instead of cash or checks. Card transactions provide a clearer picture of your spending habits.\n\n[Spend Analysis](#FC7106CA803A434993AF284A2257FF9C)\n\nWhat is Spend Analysis?\n\nAnswer: Spend Analysis tracks how much you're spending, and exactly where you're spending it, in categories like groceries and entertainment. We'll analyze your expenses so you can easily see exactly where your money is going.\n\nWhich of my accounts are included in Spend Analysis?\n\nAnswer: For personal accounts, Spend Analysis includes transactions from your Huntington checking and credit card accounts. For business accounts, Spend Analysis includes transactions from your Huntington checking, money market, credit card and credit line accounts.\n\nHow do I get Spend Analysis?\n\nAnswer: Do you have a Huntington checking account? Then log into The Hub to turn Spend Analysis on.\n\nCan I add transactions from other credit cards or financial institutions to Spend Analysis?\n\nAnswer: We’re working on it. For now, only your Huntington accounts and credit cards are included.\n\nHow does Spend Analysis know how to categorize my spending?\n\nAnswer: When you make a purchase using your debit or credit card, Spend Analysis places that purchase in an existing category, such as Groceries, Education, Home and more. You can also create subcategories and split purchases between categories to help you keep a more detailed record of your spending habits.\n\nHow do I add, edit, or delete categories?\n\nAnswer: For your convenience, each transaction is automatically assigned to a category. To reassign a transaction, follow these easy steps: \n\n  * Click on a transaction from the line-item list. A Transaction Detail window will pop up. (Note: Pending transactions cannot be reassigned).\n  * Under Category, click Edit and select a new category.\n  * Answer Yes, Create Rule to always categorize this way, or No, Apply Once for one-time only.\n\n\n\nHow do I add a new transaction category? \n\nAnswer: To be more specific on how you track expenses, you can create new categories. For example, you can choose to track \"coffee shop\" spending separate from the main Restaurant category. Add up to 10 custom subcategories within a broader category family by following these easy steps: \n\n  * In Transaction Detail, under Category, click Edit.\n  * Click Add a category.\n  * Enter the new category name, then Save.\n\n\n\nHow do I split a transaction between categories?\n\nAnswer: Get a more accurate picture of your actual spending by splitting a single transaction into two or more spending categories. Follow these easy steps: \n\n  * In Transaction Detail, under Category, click Edit.\n  * Choose Edit next to Category, select Category.\n  * Enter Split Amount for each category.\n  * Need to split into more categories? Click Add a Split.\n  * Click Save.\n\n\n\nCan I hide a transaction from Spend Analysis and Spend Setter?\n\nAnswer: Yes, you can hide transactions so they aren’t included in the Spend Analysis or Spend Setter tools. Click on a transaction to bring up the Transaction Detail window, and check Hide this transaction from financial tools.\n\nHow do I see my spending for the previous month?\n\nAnswer: To see your spending for previous months, click the View Analysis button. On the larger Spend Analysis view, you can change the date range, dive into categories and more. You can also switch from pie chart to bar graph to table view and roll over visual charts to see amounts and percentages by category.\n\nWhat else can Spend Analysis do?\n\nAnswer: With Spend Analysis, you can see up to two years of spending and income history to better understand your habits. And, the Spend v. Income feature within Spend Analysis provides you with an easy-to-read, side-by-side comparison of money coming in and money going out. You can compare your cash flow for the past 12 months. All of this gives you the ability to make informed decisions about your money.\n\n[Spend Setter℠](#A471EA996DEB4D42A99AB2E2BD20D1FE)\n\nWhat is Spend Setter℠?\n\nAnswer: Spend Setter℠ lets you set budgets to track what you’ve spent and how much you have left to spend in a given month. You can view amount spent to date, amount left to spend, percentage of budget spent, and number of days left in the month. Spend Setter includes transactions from your Huntington checking and credit card accounts.\n\nHow are budgets set up? Can I change them?\n\nAnswer: If you don’t use the Spend Setter℠ tool within the first 60 days of having access, budgets will be created for your highest three spending categories based on your monthly averages. To edit these budgets, click View Budgets.\n\nHow do I create or edit a budget?\n\nAnswer: On The Hub, click View Budgets. \n\n  * To create a new budget, click Create a Budget at the bottom of the budgets list. First, select a Category and click Continue. On the next screen, enter a budget amount and click Save. You can create up to 10 budgets total.\n  * To edit a budget amount, roll over a budget to highlight, select Edit. In the budget window, click Edit next to the Monthly Budget Amount. Enter the new budget amount, then Save.\n\n\n\nIf you need to delete a budget, select Delete (with trashcan icon), Yes to delete, No to cancel.\n\nWhich of my accounts are included in Spend Setter?\n\nAnswer: Spend Setter℠ includes transactions from your Huntington checking and credit card accounts.\n\nHow often can I change my budgets?\n\nAnswer: You can change a budget as often as you like. Keep in mind that changes to the budget amount may affect the status of your budget.\n\nHow do I know if I’m close to or over budget?\n\nAnswer: The color of the budget bar will indicate if you are on track (green), off track (yellow) or already over budget (red). In the future, an alert will be available to tell you when your nearing or over your budget. You can also sign up to receive a Huntington Heads Up® by email, text, or push notification to let you know when you're nearing or over your budget.

Add patterns of your own for a closer look at what’s coming in and what’s going out.\n\nWhich of my accounts are included in Look Ahead?\n\nAnswer: For personal accounts, Look Ahead includes one Huntington checking account of your choosing. The default account is the one you use for Bill Pay, if applicable. For business accounts, Look Ahead includes checking, savings, money market, credit card and credit line accounts.\n\nCan I link Look Ahead to other calendars, like Outlook or Google Calendar?\n\nAnswer: Not at this time, but look for additional calendar functions in future.\n\nHow far forward and back can I see with Look Ahead?\n\nAnswer: Look Ahead displays up to two months of scheduled transactions and patterns from today’s date. The tool does not show you past transactions; visit your account details for those.\n\nWhat are scheduled transactions and patterns?\n\nAnswer: Look Ahead captures any transfer or bill payment you schedule. Not every repeat transaction is scheduled in Bill Pay. Add a pattern to show upcoming paydays and bills.\n\nHow do I add, edit or delete a scheduled transaction or pattern?\n\nAnswer: You can add a scheduled transaction by setting up a recurring transfer on the Transfers page or a recurring payment using Bill Pay.

It's designed to help you put money aside for an Emergency Fund and other specific Savings Goals.\n\nWhich of my accounts can have a Savings Goal? Is there a limit to how many I can set up?\n\nAnswer: You can add Savings Goals to all your Huntington personal savings and money market accounts. You can add up to ten Saving Goals and one Emergency Fund to each account.\n\nHow do I put money toward my Savings Goals?\n\nAnswer: Once you've created your goals, we'll assign money in your savings or money market account towards each goal depending on the goal amount and the date you want to reach it. To add money toward your goals, simply deposit money into your savings or money market account - or transfer from checking - and we'll automatically assign it toward your goals to keep you on track.\n\nCan I change the icon that goes with a goal?\n\nAnswer: Not at this time.\n\nCan I move money between my Savings Goals?\n\nAnswer: Since money is assigned to your Savings Goals based on due dates, you can change the amount of money in each goal by editing the due dates. Remember, money will always be assigned first to an Emergency Fund (if you’ve created one) and then the Savings Goal with the nearest due date.\n\nCan I see previous Savings Goals?\n\nAnswer: Once you’ve reached a Savings Goal (congratulations!), we recommend deleting it. At this time, you can’t view deleted Savings Goals.\n\nCan I set up automatic transfers to Savings Goals?\n\nAnswer: Yes! Setting up automatic transfers from your checking account to your savings or money market account is an easy way to help you reach your savings goals. Remember, you'll need to set up automatic transfers inside your checking account. Learn how at [huntington.com/Automatic-Savings](https://www.huntington.com/automatic-savings).\n\nDo Savings Goals earn interest?\n\nAnswer: You earn interest on the money in your savings or money market account, whether or not you have created a Savings Goal. The Savings Goal itself does not earn interest.\n\nHow do I add or change a Savings Goal?\n\nAnswer: You can add or change a Savings Goal as often as you like. To create a goal, click Add a Savings Goal, then give it a name, amount and due date. To edit a goal, click Edit next to an individual goal. Remember, changing the amount or due date will change how much and/or how often you need to deposit or transfer money to reach that goal.\n\nHow do I change a Savings Goal amount?\n\nAnswer: On the Savings Goal Getter page, click Edit next to a goal and type in a new amount.\n\nHow do I create or edit the name of a Savings Goal?\n\nAnswer: When you create a Savings Goal, you can give it a name, such as “Vacation” or “New Bike.” To change the name, go to the Savings Goal GetterSM page and click Edit next to the goal.\n\nHow do I delete a goal? \n\nAnswer: To delete a goal, click Edit next to the goal, then click Delete next to the trash can icon. Remember, if you delete a savings goal, your progress toward other goals for that account will adjust automatically.\n\nHow do I view all my Savings Goals?\n\nAnswer: To see all your goals, click the Manage Savings Goals button on The Hub main page.\n\nHow is it determined which goals are shown on the Savings Goal Getter page?\n\nAnswer: On the Savings Goal Getter℠ page, if you have created an Emergency Fund, that will be displayed first. Additional goals will be listed in the order of nearest due date, whether they are complete or in progress. If more than one goal has the same due date, they will be listed in the order of largest percent complete first. If more than one goal has the same due date and the same percent complete, they will be listed in order of the newest goal first.\n\nHow it is determined which goals are shown on The Hub home page?\n\nAnswer: On The Hub main page, you will see up to three goals in online banking, and one goal in the mobile app. If you have set up an Emergency Fund, that will be displayed first. Additional goals will be listed in the order of nearest due date. If more than one goal has the same due date, they will be listed in the order of largest percent complete first. If all goals have been reached, they will listed be in the order of most recently completed.\n\nHow many goals show on The Hub main page?\n\nAnswer: When you are logged into your account on huntington.com, up to three Savings Goals are shown on The Hub main page. When you log into the Huntington Mobile app, one goal will be listed. To see all your goals, click the Manage Savings Goals button.\n\nHow much money should I have in my Emergency Fund goal? \n\nAnswer: A good rule of thumb is to have at least 3 months of living expenses available for emergencies.\n\nCan I change the goals that are shown on The Hub main page?\n\nAnswer: While you can't change the rules that determine which goals show up on The Hub main page, you can change elements of a goal that would make it display there. For instance, if you set up an Emergency Fund, that will automatically display on The Hub main page in both online banking and the mobile app. If you change a goal's due date to be sooner than other, that goal will display next after the Emergency Fund.\n\nI have both a savings account and a money market account. How do I select an account to create a Savings Goal?\n\nAnswer: You can create up to ten Savings Goals for each savings and money market account you have. To create or view goals for a specific account, simply select it from the Select Account drop-down on the Savings Goal Getter page and click Apply.\n\nWhat happens to my Savings Goals if I overdraft my account?\n\nAnswer: If your savings account is used for overdraft protection, money is transferred from your savings account to your checking account to cover the overdraft. When money is withdrawn, for any reason, from the account linked to a Savings Goal, it reduces the amount saved towards your Savings Goal and may take you off-track. If you overdraft your account, you may incur Overdraft or Return Fees, whether or not your account is linked to a Savings Goal. Learn how you can avoid fees at huntington.com/Overdraft.\n\nWhat happens when I complete a Savings Goal?\n\nAnswer: Congratulations! Saving money can be tough but you did it! Once you complete a goal and are ready to use the money, you'll see Edit and Make a Transfer options. We recommend you transfer or withdraw the money from your savings or money market account to use for the goal. Then delete the goal so that other money in your account isn't assigned to the goal you just completed!\n\nWhat is the maximum amount I can have for a goal?\n\nAnswer: You can assign up to $1 million to each Savings Goal.\n\nI have a joint savings or money marketing account. How does that affect my Savings Goals in Savings Goal Getter?\n\nAnswer: Since every accountholder has their own login information for online banking, they each have the opportunity to use Savings Goal Getter and create their own Savings Goals for the account. Keep in mind, however, that when you log in, you’ll only see the Savings Goals that were created using your login information.\n\nCan I transfer money from an external account into a Savings Goal?\n\nAnswer: No. Money is assigned to your Savings Goals from the funds in your Huntington savings or money market account. If you want to assign more money to a Savings Goal, you'll first need to deposit additional money into Huntington savings or money market account, or transfer it from your Huntington checking account.\n\n[Money Scout℠](#6A211B1CD84044BE893CEB4D906F082D)\n\nIs there an enrollment fee for the Money Scout® tool? \n\nAnswer: Nope! There is no charge to enroll in Money Scout.\n\nHow often will Money Scout® move money to my savings account?\n\nAnswer: Money Scout will transfer small amounts from your checking account up to three times per week. Since Money Scout is personalized to you and your transaction patterns, some months you may not see any saving transfers. If your checking account was recently opened, Money Scout may require at least 4 months of account activity to understand your spending habits before Money Scout can start saving. To enroll in Money Scout, you must have Spend Analysis in The Hub active for the checking account you want to use for transfers. Spend Analysis is the chart that shows your spending for the current month by category.\n\nI’m a new Huntington checking customer. Can I enroll in Money Scout® today?\n\nAnswer: Yes, but it may just be a while until you see the prompt to activate Money Scout in your Account Detail page. And understand that if your checking account was recently opened, Money Scout may require at least four months of account activity to get to know your spending habits before it can start saving effectively. To enroll in Money Scout, you must have Spend Analysis in The Hub active for the checking account you want to use for transfers. Spend Analysis is the chart that shows your spending for the current month by category.\n\nWill Money Scout® ever overdraft my account?\n\nAnswer: Money Scout cannot predict all of your transactions when scheduling a transfer. Transfers will not be scheduled if your account balance falls below a pre-determined minimum balance threshold determined by us. You are responsible for ensuring your checking account has sufficient funds. In the event that your account balance falls below $0 and your account is overdrawn, you may be charged overdraft fees if you do not deposit enough funds to cover the transaction(s).\n\nDoes Money Scout® work with Overdraft Protection?\n\nAnswer: Yes! We recommend that you link your savings account to the checking account used with Money Scout for extra security. Money will be automatically transferred (if you have enough money in your linked account) to cover overdrafts and there is no transfer fee charged. Federal regulations limit the number of transfers that can be made from savings and money market accounts during a calendar month or statement cycle.\n\nCan I customize the amount Money Scout® moves?\n\nAnswer: Money Scout’s predictive technology understands your transaction patterns to find how much to save for you. If you would like to change the amount of or cancel a transfer, you have until midnight on the day it is scheduled to do so by navigating to Scheduled Transfers and following prompts within the Huntington Mobile app or your online banking profile. \n\nYou can also pause Money Scout, and unpause it whenever you're ready to start saving again.\n\nCan I pause Money Scout® transfers?\n\nAnswer: Yes. You can pause Money Scout transfers at any time within the Huntington Mobile app and online banking. You can choose to pause Money Scout for up to six months if you know you have an unusual withdrawal coming up, for example, a car repair or special anniversary trip. \n\nPausing and unpausing Money Scout is easy. From your savings or checking account detail page, access Money Scout, and click pause or unpause.\n\nHow is Money Scout® different from recurring transfers or round-ups?\n\nAnswer: Unlike recurring transfers, Money Scout doesn't require you to come up with an arbitrary amount to transfer every month. It looks for optimal times to save based on your unique financial situation and saves accordingly. While round-ups are popular, they are budgeting tools that only work by saving when you spend. Money Scout moves the money you would have spent in a discreet way into your savings account preemptively, so your spending is reduced automatically, and savings increased. Plus, Money Scout can help you reach your financial goals more quickly by saving meaningful amounts.\n\nAm I able to transfer my savings back to my source checking account?\n\nAnswer: Yes, you can access your savings as normal by transferring money from your savings account linked to Money Scout back to your checking account. You can do this within the Huntington Mobile app or in online banking. Keep in mind that federal regulations limit the number of transfers that can be made from savings accounts during a calendar month or statement cycle.\n\nHow are we doing?
