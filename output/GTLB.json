Refer to\nthe Forward-Looking Statements safe harbor below for information on the factors that could cause our actual\nresults to di\u0000er materially from these forward-looking statements.\nA reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP \u0000nancial measures has been provided in the \u0000nancial statement tables\nincluded in this press release. An explanation of these measures is also included below in Non-GAAP Financial\nMeasures. We have not provided the most directly comparable GAAP \u0000nancial guidance measures because certain\nitems are out of our control or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, a reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance\nfor operating income (loss) and net income (loss) per share to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available.\nConference Call Information\nGitLab will host a conference call today, September 3, 2024, at 1:30 p.m. (PT) / 4:30 p.m. (ET) to discuss its second\nquarter \u0000scal year 2025 \u0000nancial results and its guidance for the third quarter and \u0000scal year 2025. Interested\nparties may register for the call in advance by visiting https://bit.ly/3WxrJdE. A live webcast of this conference call\nwill be available on GitLab’s investor relations website (ir.gitlab.com), and a replay will also be archived on the\nwebsite for one year.\nAbout GitLab\nGitLab is the most comprehensive AI-powered DevSecOps platform for software innovation. GitLab enables\norganizations to increase developer productivity, improve operational e\u0000ciency, reduce security and compliance\nrisk, and accelerate digital transformation. More than 40 million registered users and more than 50% of the Fortune\n100 trust GitLab to ship better, more secure software faster.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nGitLab believes non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating its operating performance. GitLab uses this\nsupplemental information to evaluate its ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes.\nGitLab believes that non-GAAP \u0000nancial information, when taken collectively with its GAAP \u0000nancial information,\nmay be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past \u0000nancial performance.\nHowever, non-GAAP \u0000nancial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, has\n3\nlimitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for \u0000nancial\ninformation presented in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of non-GAAP \u0000nancial measures to the most\ndirectly comparable \u0000nancial results as determined in accordance with GAAP are included at the end of this press\nrelease following the accompanying \u0000nancial data. We de\u0000ne non-GAAP \u0000nancial measures as GAAP measures,\nexcluding certain items such as stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets,\nforeign exchange (gain) loss, equity method investment loss and impairment, acquisition related expenses, changes\nin the fair value of acquisition related contingent consideration, charitable donation of common stock, restructuring\ncharges, a non-recurring income tax adjustment related to bilateral advance pricing agreement (“BAPA”)\nnegotiations, and other expenses that the Company believes are not indicative of its ongoing operations. Shares\nused for net income per share on a non-GAAP basis include incremental dilutive shares related to restricted stock\nunits, options, and shares issuable under GitLab Inc.’s 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan that are anti-dilutive on\na GAAP basis. A reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to corresponding GAAP measures is not available\non a forward-looking basis without unreasonable e\u0000ort due to the uncertainty of expenses that may be incurred in\nthe future. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP \u0000nancial measures and the reconciliation of these\nnon-GAAP \u0000nancial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP \u0000nancial measures and not rely on any single\n\u0000nancial measure to evaluate our business.\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow\nAdjusted free cash \u0000ow is a non-GAAP \u0000nancial measure that we calculate as net cash provided by operating\nactivities less cash used for purchases of property and equipment, plus any non-recurring income tax payments\nrelated to BAPA. We believe that adjusted free cash \u0000ow is a useful indicator of liquidity that provides information\nto management and investors about the amount of cash generated from our operations that, after the investments\nin property and equipment and any non-recurring income tax payments related to BAPA, can be used for strategic\ninitiatives, including investing in our business, and strengthening our \u0000nancial position. One limitation of adjusted\nfree cash \u0000ow is that it does not re\u0000ect our future contractual commitments. Additionally, adjusted free cash \u0000ow\ndoes not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for a given period.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release and the accompanying earnings call contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of\nSection 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nAlthough we believe that the expectations re\u0000ected in the forward-looking statements contained in this release and\nthe accompanying earnings call are reasonable, they are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties,\nassumptions and other factors that may cause actual results or outcomes to be materially di\u0000erent from any future\nresults or outcomes expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. These risks, uncertainties,\n4\nassumptions, and other factors include, but are not limited to the following:\nour ability to e\u0000ectively manage our growth;\nour revenue growth rate in the future;\nour ability to achieve and sustain pro\u0000tability, our business, \u0000nancial condition, and operating results;\nsecurity and privacy breaches;\nintense competition in our markets and loss of market share to our competitors;\nour ability to respond to rapid technological changes;\nthe market for our services may not grow;\na decline in our customer renewals and expansions;\n\u0000uctuations in our operating results;\nour incorporation of arti\u0000cial intelligence features into our products;\nour transparency;\nour publicly available company Handbook;\ncustomers staying on our free self-managed or SaaS product o\u0000ering;\nour ability to accurately predict the long-term rate of customer subscription renewals or adoption, or the\nimpact of these renewals and adoption;\nour hiring model;\nthe e\u0000ects of ongoing armed con\u0000ict in di\u0000erent regions of the world on our business; and\ngeneral economic conditions (including changes in interest rates, in\u0000ation, uncertainty of the federal budget,\nincreased volatility in the capital markets and instability in the global banking sector) and slow or negative\ngrowth of our markets.\nFurther information on these and additional risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual\noutcomes and results to di\u0000er materially from those included in or contemplated by the forward-looking\nstatements contained in this release are included under the caption “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in the \u0000lings and\nreports we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any obligation to update or\nrelease any revisions to any forward-looking statement or to report any events or circumstances after the date of\nthis press release or to re\u0000ect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law.\nOperating Metrics\nAnnual Recurring Revenue (“ARR”): We de\u0000ne annual recurring revenue as the annual run-rate revenue of\nsubscription agreements, including our self-managed and SaaS o\u0000erings but excluding professional services, from\nall customers as measured on the last day of a given month. We calculate ARR by taking the monthly recurring\nrevenue (“MRR”) and multiplying it by 12. MRR for each month is calculated by aggregating, for all customers during\nthat month, monthly revenue from committed contractual amounts of subscriptions, including our self-managed\n5\nlicense, self-managed subscription, and SaaS subscription o\u0000erings but excluding professional services.\nDollar-Based Net Retention Rate: We calculate Dollar-Based Net Retention Rate as of a period end by starting with\nour customers as of the 12 months prior to such period end (“Prior Period ARR”). We then calculate the ARR from\nthese customers as of the current period end (“Current Period ARR”). The calculation of Current Period ARR includes\nany upsells, price adjustments, user growth within a customer, contraction, and attrition. We then divide the total\nCurrent Period ARR by the total Prior Period ARR to arrive at the Dollar-Based Net Retention Rate.\nGitLab Inc.\nCondensed Consolidated B alance Sheets\n(in thousands, except per share data)\n(unaudited)\nJuly 31, 2024(1) January 31, 2024(1)\nASSETS\nCURRENT ASSETS:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 438,616 $ 287,996\nShort-term investments 644,488 748,289\nAccounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $679 and $673 as of July 31,\n2024 and January 31, 2024, respectively 165,001 166,731\nDeferred contract acquisition costs, current 33,841 32,300\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 32,410 45,601\nTotal current assets 1,314,356 1,280,917\nProperty and equipment, net 2,899 2,954\nOperating lease right-of-use assets 482 405\nGoodwill 16,017 8,145\nIntangible assets, net 21,867 1,733\nDeferred contract acquisition costs, non-current 15,753 19,317\nOther non-current assets 4,888 4,390\nTOTAL ASSETS $ 1,376,262 $ 1,317,861\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nCURRENT LIABILITIES:\nAccounts payable $ 3,219 $ 1,738\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities 272,164 286,178\nAccrued compensation and bene\u0000ts 29,117 35,809\nDeferred revenue, current 362,348 338,348\nTotal current liabilities 666,848 662,073\nDeferred revenue, non-current 14,732 23,794\nOther non-current liabilities 6,678 14,060\nTOTAL LIABILITIES 688,258 699,927\nSTOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY:\nPreferred stock, $0.0000025 par value; 50,000 shares authorized as of July 31, 2024 and\nJanuary 31, 2024; no shares issued and outstanding as of July 31, 2024 and January 31, 2024 — —\nClass A Common stock, $0.0000025 par value; 1,500,000 shares authorized as of July 31, 2024\nand January 31, 2024; 136,462 and 114,670 shares issued and outstanding as of July 31, 2024\nand January 31, 2024, respectively — —\nClass B Common stock, $0.0000025 par value; 250,000 shares authorized as of July 31, 2024\nand January 31, 2024; 23,963 and 42,887 shares issued and outstanding as of July 31, 2024 and\nJanuary 31, 2024, respectively — —\nAdditional paid-in capital 1,833,786 1,718,661\nAccumulated de\u0000cit (1,191,517) (1,149,822)\nAccumulated other comprehensive income 570 2,335\nTotal GitLab stockholders’ equity 642,839 571,174\nNoncontrolling interests 45,165 46,760\nTOTAL STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY 688,004 617,934\nTOTAL LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY $ 1,376,262 $ 1,317,861\n__________\n(1) As of July 31, 2024 and January 31, 2024, the consolidated balance sheet includes assets of the consolidated\n6\nvariable interest entity, GitLab Information Technology (Hubei) Co., LTD (“JiHu”), of $45.0 million and $47.6 million,\nrespectively, and liabilities of $6.5 million and $6.1 million, respectively.

I will be standing by should you need assistance.\nAnd now, it is my pleasure to turn the conference over to Kelsey Turcotte. Kelsey, over to you.\nKelsey Turcotte\nGood afternoon. We appreciate you joining us for GitLab's second quarter fiscal year 2025 financial results\nconference call. GitLab's Co-Founder and CEO, Sid Sijbrandij; and GitLab's Chief Financial Officer, Brian Robins,\nwill provide commentary on the quarter and guidance for the fiscal year.\nBefore we begin, I'll cover the Safe Harbor statement. I would like to direct you to the cautionary statement\nregarding forward-looking statements on page 2 of our presentation and in our earnings release issued\nPage 1 of 15\nearlier today, which are both available under the Investor Relations section of our website. The presentation\nand earnings release include a discussion of certain risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that\ncould cause our results to differ from those expressed in any forward-looking statements within the meaning\nof the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. As is customary, the content of today's call and presentation\nwill be governed by this language.\nIn addition, during today's call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP\nfinancial measures exclude certain unusual or non-recurring items that management believes impact the\ncomparability of the periods referenced. Please refer to our earnings release and presentation materials for\nadditional information regarding these non-GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to the most\ndirectly comparable GAAP measure.\nI will now turn the call over to GitLab's Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Sid Sijbrandij.\nSytse Sid Sijbrandij\nThank you for joining us today. I'm excited to share our second quarter results with you and talk about our\nmarket-leading DevSecOps platform and its AI capabilities. We continue to deliver strong results that reflect\nour team's focus on customers, helping them realize faster time to value and customer-specific business\noutcomes.\nSecond quarter revenue increased 31% year-over-year to $183 million, driven by new logos like Delaware\nNorth and Guild Mortgage, as well as expansion by existing customers. Our non-GAAP operating margin also\nmeaningfully exceeded our expectations in the quarter, increasing over 1,300 basis points year-over-year to\n10%. This underscores our continued commitment to responsible growth.\nNow, more than ever, organizations need to deliver software faster to respond to intense competition and\naccelerate performance. This is what our DevSecOps platform is purpose built to do. We bring together\ndevelopers, security experts and operations teams to better collaborate, improve quality and prioritize\nsecurity, all while decreasing software delivery cycle times. And with AI integrated throughout the software\ndevelopment lifecycle, GitLab customers can take those gains even further.\nEnterprises are focusing on real results and real use cases for AI. You're looking beyond just cogeneration.\nThey are looking to integrate AI into all aspects of software development to deliver tangible results. This\nrequires a strategic approach that aligns AI solutions with business goals, provides measurable benefits and\nimproved security, and this is where GitLab excels.\nOur customers are excited about the meaningful productivity and security benefits of GitLab Duo, which has\ndemonstrated up to 90% reduction in time spent on toolchain operations, 50% faster lead time and 50%\nfaster vulnerability detection.\nThey are also excited about our ability to help them drive real business outcomes. For example, we recently\nheard from the State of Washington Public Disclosure Commission about GitLab Duo. They mentioned that\nGitLab Duo is improving their developer productivity and effectiveness, which is helping their teams focus\nmore on the substance of their work.\nAI is also resulting in larger deal sizes. Barclays purchased GitLab Duo seats this quarter, coupled with\nadditional ultimate licenses. They are rolling out GitLab Duo to thousands of developers so they can take\nadvantage of AI powered capabilities in the same platform where they're building and deploying their code.\nIt's exciting to see large enterprises like Barclays adopt AI as a natural step for simplifying toolchains and\nimproving their developer experience.\nPage 2 of 15\nF5, A multi-cloud application security and delivery company, is yet another customer who's adopting GitLab\nDuo after seeing value from Ultimate in driving improved developer experience and productivity. Developers\nwho participated in F5's pilot of GitLab Duo shared that our AI capabilities are easy to use and help them to\nbe more productive in their work. Now, F5 is rolling out GitLab Duo to all of the company's 2,000 developers.\nThe KeyBank team also wanted to improve developer productivity. So, they adopted GitLab Duo. Combined\nwith our DevSecOps platform, GitLab Duo is helping KeyBank developers resolve pipeline issues six times\nfaster. GitLab Duo is KeyBank's first approved AI technology due to our focus on transparency and privacy\nfirst. It's the combination of both our end-to-end platform and AI that's driving results for our customers.\nAccording to Gartner, by 2027, the number of platform engineering teams using AI to augment every phase\nof the SDLC will have increased from 5% to 40%. This is why we're very pleased with the outcomes of two of\nGartner's recent Magic Quadrants.\nFirst, GitLab was recently recognized as a leader in the first ever 2024 Gartner Magic Quadrant for AI Code\nAssistants. We believe this recognition highlights our commitment to delivering AI-powered capabilities that\naccelerate software delivery, enhance security and drive innovation for our customers.\nAnd for the second year in a row, GitLab was recognized as a leader in Gartner's 2024 Magic Quadrant for\nDevOps Platforms. We were positioned highest in both our ability to execute and our completeness of vision.\nOur market leadership comes from our integrated security and compliance capabilities, deployment flexibility\nand our unified data store. This provides end-to-end context across an organization's entire software\ndevelopment and deployment workflow.\nCustomers realize significant return on investment from adoption of our DevSecOps platform. Our new\nForrester study on the total economic impact of GitLab Ultimate found that organizations can achieve 482%\nreturn on investment over three years. That's a nearly 60-percentage point increase over the last time we\nconducted this study two years ago. These results are based on our continued focus on increasing developer\nproductivity, improving developer experience and accelerating feature delivery, improving security and\ntoolchain consolidation, toolchain consolidation and related benefits I mentioned frequently by our\ncustomers.\nIn fact, in our annual survey of more than 5,000 DevSecOps professionals, 62% reported that their teams use\nmore than five tools and 64% wanted to consolidate their toolchain to drive efficiencies. This presents a\ntremendous opportunity for us as a platform to allow customers to consolidate vendors and reduce total cost\nof ownership.\nOne of GitLab's strengths is our ability to help customers replace legacy point solutions. For example, by\nconsolidating on GitHub, Lockheed Martin managed to run CI pipeline builds 80 times faster, retired\nthousands of legacy CI servers and reduce the time spent on system maintenance by 90%. That shift resulted\nin a significant increase in efficiency and productivity for Lockheed Martin.\nAnother example is one of the world's leading innovators in materials science. They are using our Enterprise\nAgile Planning add-on in combination with GitLab Ultimate to centralize planning tools into a single platform\nand improve visibility across the business.\nOur customers also see security as a mission-critical need. Recent news cycles continue to increase\nawareness and urgency in the executive suites about the need to embed security at the earliest stages of\nsoftware development. GitLab Ultimate helps solve this by shifting security left in the process, seamlessly\ninstrumenting security checks and guardrails into the software development pipeline. This comprehensive\nPage 3 of 15\napproach not only earns the confidence of security leaders, but also dramatically enhances the developer\nexperience by eliminating context switching and post-deployment firefighting, developers maintained their\ncrucial state of flow. This results in faster, more secure code delivery.\nGitLab transforms security from a bottleneck into a strategic advantage in innovation and reliability. Security\nand compliance capabilities are at the heart of Ultimate and set us apart from the competition. Ultimate is a\nparticularly good fit for customers who require the enterprise-grade capabilities of our platform to meet\nconstant demands to move faster and produce more software. In the second quarter, 7 of our 10 largest\ndeals were Ultimate purchases, and 7 of our top 10 first order customers landed with Ultimate. At the end of\nQ2, Ultimate is now 47% of total ARR.\nFor example, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration upgraded from Premium to Ultimate this\nquarter for its enhanced security and compliance. They also purchased GitLab Duo to improve their\ndeveloper productivity.\nSecurity is an important factor when customers adopt GitLab Dedicated, our single-tenant SaaS offering that\nis completely managed by GitLab. This offering is unique in the market and is especially valuable to\ncompanies with highly complex security and compliance requirements and in regulated industries such as\nthe public sector and financial services.\nSnowflake recently migrated to GitLab Dedicated for source code management, CI and security for their\ncorporate environment. With GitLab Dedicated, Snowflake has the security of a single-tenant environment\nplus all the benefits of an end-to-end DevSecOps platform.\nWe're also excited to share that we have achieved the in-process designation for FedRAMP Moderate. GitLab\nDedicated for Government helps public sector agencies and customers in highly regulated industries meet\nstringent security and compliance requirements from the US government. We expect this designation to\nbuild upon the significant momentum we already have in the public sector.\nIn summary, Q2 was a good quarter and I'm proud of what we accomplished. I also want to thank the GitLab\nteam for everything you contributed to our ongoing success. Looking at the second half of fiscal 2025, I'm\nreally energized by our ability to continue to drive customer success and the opportunity we have with AI to\naccelerate business outcomes.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Brian.\nBrian G. Robins\nThank you, Sid, and thank you again for everyone joining us today. This quarter's results validates the value\nthat our customers get from our integrated platform. In today's cautious macroeconomic environment,\ntechnology needs to deliver quick time to value, while solving complex, impactful problems. That is what our\nAI-powered DevSecOps platform does. A great example is Intuitive Machines, which became the first US\nventure in 50 years to land spacecraft on the moon.\nIntegral to the success of the project was GitLab. Our end-to-end platform enabled dozens of developers\nwrite code, gain visibility, and collaborate on shared projects. The result was a 10x increase in release\ncadence, 99% reduction in downtime, and 20x decrease in pipeline execution time. Quoting one of the\nsoftware leads on the project, we absolutely could not have built a spacecraft in five years without GitLab. It\nhelped us make history.\nPage 4 of 15\nTurning to Q2 FY 2025 results exceeded our expectations as we delivered another quarter of greater-than-\n30% top line growth and significant year-over-year operating margin expansion. Second quarter revenue\nreached $182.6 million, an increase of 31% from Q2 of the prior year. We ended the quarter with dollar-based\nnet retention rate or DBNRR of 126%. Q2 DBNRR was driven by a combination of seat expansion at\napproximately 40%, increased customer yield at approximately 50%, and tier upgrades at approximately 10%.\nIn addition, all of our historical cohorts continue to steadily expand.\nWe now have 9,314 customers with ARR of at least $5,000, an increase of approximately 19% year-over-year,\nand contributed over 95% of total ARR in Q2. In particular, we monitor performance of our larger customer\ncohort of $100,000-plus in ARR which reached 1,076 this quarter, an increase of 33% year-over-year. In fact,\nmore than 65% of new dollars invested by this cohort was in Ultimate this quarter.\nA great example of customer success with these large customers is bol, one of the biggest online retailers in\nthe Netherlands. As bol's revenues grew, they needed to keep up with the strict and constantly changing\ncompliance regulations. With GitLab, bol can set up policies that automate compliance configurations and\nchecks, saving thousands of developer hours per month.\nThis quarter, total RPO grew 51% year-over-year to $747.9 million, while cRPO grew 42% year-over-year to\n$475 million. Non-GAAP gross margins were 91% for the quarter. SaaS now represents 28% of total revenue,\nin part a reflection of considerable traction we are getting with GitLab Dedicated. Year-over-year SaaS\nrevenue grew 46%. Given the continued high growth in SaaS, I am very happy with the team's attention to\noperating efficiencies, which continues to result in best-in-class non-GAAP gross margins.\nOnce again, we saw significant year-over-year improvement in operating leverage. Q2 non-GAAP operating\nincome was $18.2 million, compared to a loss of $4.3 million in the second quarter of last year. This quarter,\nwe dropped all of our revenue outperformance to the bottom line, which in combination with the team's\ncontinued focus on smart resource allocation, translated to non-GAAP operating margin of 10% compared to\nnegative 3.1% in the Q2 of last year. This once again demonstrates our commitment to responsible growth.\nCash from operating activities was $11.7 million in the second quarter, compared to $27.1 million in the prior-\nyear period. Adjusted free cash flow was $10.8 million in the second quarter of FY 2025, compared to $26.8\nmillion in the prior-year period. Q2 FY 2025 cash flow from operations and adjusted free cash flow reflect the\ntiming in payments for our Q1 global employee gathering made in Q2.\nNow, turning to guidance. For the third quarter of FY 2025, we expect total revenue of $187 million to $188\nmillion, representing a growth rate of 25% to 26% year-over-year. We expect a non-GAAP operating income of\n$19 million to $20 million, and we expect a non-GAAP net income per share of $0.15 to $0.16, assuming 168\nmillion weighted average diluted shares outstanding.\nFor the full-year FY 2025, we expect total revenue of $742 million to $744 million, representing growth rate of\napproximately 28% year-over-year. We expect a non-GAAP operating income of $55 million to $58 million, and\nwe expect a non-GAAP net income per share of $0.45 to $0.47, assuming 168 million weighted average\ndiluted shares outstanding.\nSeparately, I'd like to provide an update on JiHu, our China joint venture. In Q2 FY 2025, non-GAAP expenses\nrelated to JiHu were $3.3 million, compared to $4.8 million in Q2 of last year. Our goal remains to\ndeconsolidate JiHu. However, we cannot predict the likelihood or timing when this may potentially occur.\nThus, for FY 2025 modeling purposes, we forecast approximately $14 million of expenses related to JiHu,\ncompared with $18 million of last year.\nThank you all for joining this afternoon. We delivered a strong Q2 and I'm really pleased with how we are\npositioned as we head into the back-half of FY 2025. We appreciate your support and look forward to\nPage 5 of 15\nspeaking with many of you during the quarter.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Kelsey, who will moderate the Q&A.\nQUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION\nAnswer – Kelsey Turcotte: Great. Thank you very much. Appreciate everyone joining. We're going to start by\ntaking one question and one follow-up question. And our first participant is Joel Fishbein at Truist. Joel, go\nahead.\nAnalyst:Joel P. Fishbein\nQuestion – Joel P. Fishbein: Thanks, Kelsey, for the question and congrats on a strong quarter. Sid, love to\nget an update from you on how you're thinking about the go-to-market going forward. Obviously, had a\nchangeover in leadership there. And despite that, you had a very solid quarter. Just curious what you're\nlooking for in a new leader. And just a quick question for you, Brian, on a follow-up.\nAnswer – Sytse Sid Sijbrandij: Thanks for that, Joel. Yeah, Chris was doing a great job and would love to\ncontinue to have him here, but he found another opportunity. We've launched a search and we've been really\nimpressed with the quality and the quantity of candidates. And in the interim, we're really pleased with how\nsmoothly the team has transitioned to Ashley's leadership in her role as Chief Marketing & Strategy Officer.\nShe was already very in touch with both our customers and the sales leadership, but that enabled a smooth\ntransition which supported our raising guidance this quarter.\nQuestion – Joel P. Fishbein: Great. And, Brian, just a quick one for you. I mean, you outperformed very\nsignificantly in the operating margin line. I believe you're still going to prioritize growth over margins, but any\ncolor you could give us there would be really helpful. Thank you.\nAnswer – Brian G. Robins: Thanks, Joel. I appreciate that. Yeah, nothing's changed on that pre-IPO every\nquarter. Sid and I have said growth is the number one thing, but we'll do that responsibly and we continue to\nget increased operating leverage in the model with even growing greater than 30% year-over-year. So, happy\nwith the performance this quarter and happy with the beat and raise for the year.\nQuestion – Joel P. Fishbein: Great. Thank you.\nAnswer – Kelsey Turcotte: Great. Thanks, Joel. Next question goes to Ryan MacWilliams at Barclays. Ryan, go\nahead.\nAnalyst:Ryan MacWilliams\nQuestion – Ryan MacWilliams: Hey, thanks for taking the question. Just in terms of what you're seeing in the\nmacro right now, do you notice any differences between the second quarter and the first quarter? And how\nare you seeing developer hiring at this point? Thanks.\nAnswer – Brian G. Robins: Yeah, thanks for the question. There's really been no difference between the two\nquarters. It still remains a cautious spending environment out there. And so, we're enabling our teams to go\nout there and the pitches are more financially related. And we haven't seen really any changes in trends on\ndeveloper hiring either. And so, first order continues, remain really strong. And that's really the power of the\nPage 6 of 15\nplatform in the payback period that Sid talked about with the Forrester report and the ROI that our\ncustomers are receiving.\nAnswer – Kelsey Turcotte: Second question was around developer hiring.\nAnswer – Brian G. Robins: Yeah, developer hiring has been the same. No changes.\nQuestion – Ryan MacWilliams: Excellent. And then for Sid, there's been a lot of focus on coding assistance\naround generative AI. But as you're seeing the velocity of software development pick up, are you seeing more\ninterest from customers around non-coding tools, but as they utilize AI within their coding process, such as\nsecuring binaries or more security around their software development lifecycle? Would appreciate more color\nhere. Thanks, Sid.\nAnswer – Sytse Sid Sijbrandij: Yeah, thanks. And that's certainly how we see the market. The first market\nwas AI code creation. We're really glad that the last Gartner AI Assistant Magic Quadrant rates us as the only\nnon-hypercloud that's a leader in this space. The second phase is AI throughout the whole software lifecycle.\nAnd I think, for that, we're in a great spot with Duo Enterprise. And in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for\nDevOps that was released this morning, we're a leader with – and we have the highest score for both\nexecution and for vision. And I think that having the best and broadest platform enables us to win in this\ncategory.\nAnd beyond that, you'll have more autonomous AI, AI going from reactive to proactive. And I'm really excited\nabout what we're doing here. If you attended our GitLab 17 event, we showed GitLab Duo Workflow, an\nautonomous agent that can take more initiative of its own. That's where the puck is going and we're skating\ntowards it.\nQuestion – Ryan MacWilliams: Thanks for the color. Thanks, guys.\nAnswer – Kelsey Turcotte: Thanks, guys. Jason Ader next from William Blair. Jason, go ahead.\nAnalyst:Jason Ader\nQuestion – Jason Ader: Yeah, thank you. Can you hear me okay?\nAnswer – Kelsey Turcotte: Yeah.\nAnswer – Sytse Sid Sijbrandij: We can.\nQuestion – Jason Ader: Got you. All right. I guess there's a sense out there, Sid, that because of GitHub's\nfaster growth rate recently, that they're growing faster than you and taking share. I mean, I guess they are\ngrowing faster than you. But how do you think about the kind of share shift, if at all, in the market? Are you\njust both doing better than everybody else and that's the explanation? Or do you think GitHub could be\ntaking some market share?\nAnswer – Sytse Sid Sijbrandij: I think that customers are migrating to platforms and that's benefiting both\nof us. And I think we're early. You look at our revenue together, it's a small part of the $40-billion market. The\nsame time, there's the other thing is that they had a head start in AI co-creation. They purchased OpenAI and\nthey had a head start.\nPage 7 of 15\nToday, we're the only non-hypercloud that's a leader, according to Gartner. And that's because of two things,\nbecause you need a great model and you need a great context. We're vendor-agnostic. Today, we use the\nbest model on the market for co-generation, Anthropic Claude 3.5. And context-wise, we know more of what\na user is working on and what they've worked on in the past, because we got the broadest platform, we have\nthe most – more context and better context leads to better AI answers. So, together with that, we feel\ncomfortable in competing.\nQuestion – Jason Ader: Okay, great. And then, Brian, just a follow-up for you on net retention rate and DRR.\nIt was 126%, it's continuing to come down. Do you think we bottomed? Where do you see NRR maybe exiting\nthe year?\nAnswer – Brian G. Robins: Thanks for the question. We're happy with where we landed in the quarter. I don't\nsee anything with the dollar-based net retention rate. That's a concern for me, although our historical\ncohorts continue to steadily expand. The composition of our net dollar retention rate includes seats, which is\nan output for us.\nJust as a quick reminder, last year, we signed the largest deal in company history, which has been a tailwind\nfor us for seats over the year. And we don't view a change in the ratio as a reflection of any recent developer\nhiring trends. Since this is a big market, very low penetration, and we have lots of room in front of us for\ngrowth.\nQuestion – Jason Ader: Thank you.\nAnswer – Kelsey Turcotte: Great. Thanks for the question. Next question goes to Kash Rangan from\nGoldman Sachs. Kash, go ahead.\nAnalyst:Kash Rangan\nQuestion – Kash Rangan: Great. Thank you so much. Congrats on the big raise quarter. I hope you enjoyed\nyour summer. One for Sid, one for Brian. Sid, you talked about GitLab as being the unique company that it's\nnot a hyperscaler, you have these AI capabilities. Is that strength a key selling point in your end markets? I\nthink we can all safely agree that Duo just got going seven to eight months ago. It's still too early in the AI\nrace. So, how do you think that, given that we're early and you're off to a good start, that this hyperscaler\nneutral positioning actually does give you an advantage in the long run?\nAnd then one for you, Brian. I think you talked about a smaller percentage of the growth rate NER (25:47)\ncoming from price increases. Can you help us understand what is ahead for the company, especially as you\ngo through the motions of renewals from the other pricing tiers and the subsequent price increases that\ncould help your contribution to the growth to get even better? Thank you so much.\nAnswer – Sytse Sid Sijbrandij: Yeah, Kash, thank you for that question. Being hyperscaler-independent,\nbeing vendor-agnostic, it's good, but it's not enough. The key reasons we win against Microsoft GitHub are\nthat we have, first of all, the most comprehensive platform. When the platform can do more, our customers\ncan get a 10 times faster cycle time. The second reason is we have the best security. We allow our customers\nto shift security left, always do security, and proof that they've done it. And the third reason is that we really\nlisten to our customers. We're the only vendor with a single-tenant SaaS solution, GitLab Dedicated, that's\ngrowing really, really fast.\nAnd we're getting the acknowledgment that we're executing well. Today, leader in the MQ for DevOps. We're\nall the way to the top, all the way to the right, and that's enabling our customers to get the biggest return,\n482% ROI, according to Forrester. And the interesting thing is, that's 60% more than the previous study. So,\nPage 8 of 15\nthe benefits of being on the broadest platform are increasing. Our customers are better and better off over\ntime being on GitLab.\nAnswer – Brian G. Robins: Thanks, Sid. I'll touch on the price increase real quickly, Kash. And so, there's a\ncouple things to touch on there. One is, we do break out quarterly and the dollar-based net retention, what\nimpact is related to seats, price, which has also increased customer yield, as well as tier upgrades. And what I\nreally care about when I look at that is the positive unit economics are growing really nicely in the business. I\ntalked about this in the Q1 call and I'm happy with how we're doing there.\nAnd then going forward, we expect the price increase to continue to layer in over time, as we cycle through\nthe renewal portfolio. And so, we're partially there, but we'll see impacts throughout this year and next year\nrelated to that. And so, overall, I'm really pleased with the returns that we're seeing from the price increase\nand the consistently improving unit economics, which shows the value that the customers are getting from\nthe platform, and as part of the total economics study increasing as well.\nAnswer – Kelsey Turcotte: Great. Thank you. Next question comes from Karl Keirstead at UBS.\nAnalyst:Karl E. Keirstead\nQuestion – Karl E. Keirstead: Okay, great. Maybe on the AI side, Sid, those anecdotes about Barclays, F5, and\nKeyBank are pretty powerful. Maybe a two-parter for you. Are any of those customers, or maybe some of\nyour other early Duo wins, customers that were using GitHub Copilot and now that Duo has closed a lot of\nthose functionality gaps are moving off of Microsoft?\nAnd then I guess the second question, Sid, I could be wrong on this, but my understanding was that Duo, at\nleast initially, was quite rooted in Google's LLMs. And I'm wondering if this change, assuming it is, to\nAnthropic's Claude model, had a market improvement in the functionality of that cogen tool? Thank you.\nAnswer – Sytse Sid Sijbrandij: Yeah, thanks for that, Karl. Yeah. If you look at the customers evaluating Duo\nPro and Duo Enterprise, I think there's nearly zero customers that don't know that Copilot exist. And for most\nof these customers, they've had pockets of use and they do commonly a head-to-head comparison. So, we're\nwinning against Copilot.\nRegarding the best model for the task, we're still using some of Google's models, but for cogeneration, the\nmost kind of vivid application, right now the best model on the planet is Anthropic Claude 3.5. You look on\nthe Internet, that's consensus. We found the same in our testing and we can switch to that. We're not\nbeholden to using any hypercloud's product. We haven't bought an AI company or an AI foundational\nmodeling company, and being able to use the latest and greatest is a great advantage because it gives our\ncustomers better code.\nQuestion – Karl E. Keirstead: Okay, perfect. Thanks and congrats.\nAnswer – Sytse Sid Sijbrandij: Thanks.\nAnswer – Kelsey Turcotte: Great. Next question goes to Rob Owens at Piper Sandler. Rob, go ahead.\nAnalyst:Rob D. Owens\nPage 9 of 15\nQuestion – Rob D. Owens: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Brian, realizing there's a lot of puts and\ntakes around the revenue growth number, just with changes to your SSP, I guess I'll have two questions kind\nof masked in one. Number one, did that come in relative to your expectations and is there no change to the\nyear if we think about the headwind that you called out on last quarter?\nAnd I guess secondarily, looking at a lot of the leading indicators, RPO up quarter-over-quarter, cRPO up\nquarter-over-quarter. I think one of the best growth results you've seen in the last year. Can you speak to\nlarge deal activity right now, upsell versus new customer commitments and just what you guys are seeing on\nthat front? Thanks.\nAnswer – Brian G. Robins: Yeah, absolutely. Thanks for the question, Rob. When it – when you look at sort of\nthe SSP and, for everybody, that's just accounting on how it gets allocated, it doesn't impact the overall deal\nitself. We actually took a little bit of a hit this quarter related to SSP that we talked about on the last call. And\nso, that was assumed in the numbers.\nWe're doing well across the business. First order is doing well, expansion is doing well. We had the best\nquarter in churning contraction in the last eight quarters. And so, on prior calls, I said that I thought that\nsecond quarter we would have run through most of the contracts, and churn and contraction is better than in\neight quarters.\nThe other thing that we saw is we actually saw real strength in enterprise, greater than $100,000 customers\ngrowing over 30% year-over-year. And we saw a lot of expansions and lands in that area as well. And I think it\njust goes to some of the things that Sid said previously around time to value, positive business outcomes,\nROI, consolidating a toolchain onto a single platform, it just created a lot of benefit. And we're seeing the\npositives of that sort of show up in the model.\nQuestion – Rob D. Owens: Thank you.\nAnswer – Kelsey Turcotte: Great. Next question comes from Michael Turrin at Wells Fargo. Michael, go\nahead.\nAnalyst:Michael Turrin\nQuestion – Michael Turrin: Hey, great. Thanks, Kelsey. Appreciate you taking the questions here, team. I\nguess just to – I'll ask both parts upfront, but to some of the prior question, the leading indicators here all\nlook pretty good. And it's not something we're seeing a lot of across software, cRPO, billings, bookings up\nmore than 40%. Just hoping you can unpack that strength a bit more, if there's anything more onetime in\nnature for us to be mindful of in those metrics. And then, Brian, maybe walk us through the assumptions\nyou're embedding in forecast for the rest of the year on the back of that Q2 strength across macro, seats,\nsales execution or anything else worth mentioning for us. Thank you.\nAnswer – Brian G. Robins: Appreciate the two questions. On the forecast and how we're running the\nbusiness and the transition of actually taking over the Interim CRO role, there's really been no changes\nwhatsoever. And Ashley has been really plugged in to the entire sales force and visiting customers and\nworked really closely at Chris. So, we're happy about the minimal disruption there with Chris's departure.\nAll the metrics that you talked about, cRPO growing 42% year-over-year, short term calculated billings\ngrowing 40% year-over-year, Ultimate ARR now 47% of total ARR and was greater than 50% of bookings\nwithin the quarter, and that really coming from the enterprise base that we have. And so our deals are\ngetting larger, Ultimate adoptions increasing. Ultimate is good for us and our customers, and I think you see\nthat in the metrics itself. And then we also saw Dedicated. Dedicated grew roughly 150% year-over-year. SaaS\nPage 10 of 15\nwas great. And so we're just seeing strength sort of across the board from our customers who are adopting\nthe platform.\nQuestion – Michael Turrin: Nice job. Thank you. Appreciate it.\nAnswer – Kelsey Turcotte: Great. Yeah. We'll turn the questions over to Pinjalim Bora at JPMorgan.\nAnalyst:Pinjalim Bora\nQuestion – Pinjalim Bora: Oh, great. Hey. Congrats on the quarter. Thanks for taking the questions. I want to\nask you, Sid. Obviously, it seems like we are seeing some of the AI adoption. But any way to further quantify it\nin terms of maybe the portion of your customer base or users that are touching the product today, and what\nportion of the goods that is being written by the AI is being committed any further kind of quantitative\nmetrics?\nAnswer – Sytse Sid Sijbrandij: Yeah. Thanks for that. It's still early for us. You heard from Barclays, F5, Noah\n(35:33). But if you look at the quotes going on, not all of them have AI in it. And if they have AI, they typically\ndon't have AI for all the users of our customer yet. So, customers are early in this adoption cycle. We cater to\nthe enterprise. They are relatively slower to adopt this and more considerate.\nIt's really important that we listen well to these customers. For example, we are accelerating our work on\noffline models because our customers are requesting that. We see a giant opportunity for AI throughout the\nlife. So our GitLab Ultimate customers, for them, we think that Duo Enterprise is a really, really good value\nproposition and that's a big focus of ours.\nQuestion – Pinjalim Bora: Yeah, understood. One follow-up for Brian. Brian, what portion of the contracts\nfrom existing customers at this point are completely through kind of the first phase of your pricing change of\nexisting customers, the 19 to 24? Is it fair to assume that it's largely complete by this point? And in the second\nphase of the rollout, which I believe started in end of April, if I'm not wrong, did it have any impact in billings\nRPO performance this quarter?\nAnswer – Brian G. Robins: Yeah. So on the price increase impact overall, remember we weren't allowing\npeople to early renew. And so it really up when their renewal comes up and they would go 19 to 24, then 24\nto 29, and then new customers would go straight to 29. And so I think it's really important that the price\nincrease will continue to layer in over time as we cycle through the renewal portfolio. And so I expect next\nyear to continue to see the benefit of that, and it really points to the unit economics improving based on what\nwe're delivering to our customers.\nQuestion – Pinjalim Bora: Got it. Thank you.\nAnswer – Kelsey Turcotte: Great. So from now until the end, we're going to go to just one question so we\ncan get as many people on the phone as possible. And with that, I'll turn it over to Gregg Moskowitz at\nMizuho.\nAnalyst:Gregg Moskowitz\nQuestion – Gregg Moskowitz: Okay, great. Thank you, Kelsey, and congrats on a very good performance. I\nwanted to follow-up on Ultimate because the percentage of ARR continues to expand nicely. And Sid, you\ncalled out some very good success among your largest customers. Despite the much higher price point that\nPage 11 of 15\nexist for Ultimate as compared with Premium, what I'm curious about is if you're finding that you're landing\nmore frequently with Ultimate versus where – what you were seeing 6 to 12 months ago? Thanks.\nAnswer – Sytse Sid Sijbrandij: Thanks for that. We're certainly changing our approach to leading with\nUltimate when we approach a new customer, because the more comprehensiveness is driving so much value,\nbecause this integrated security is driving so much value, we've started to lead with Ultimate. Just talked\nabout the return, like the 482% return, that is for GitLab Ultimate. So maybe counterintuitively, our most\nexpensive product is the one you get the biggest return on because the return is not coming so much from\npaying us less, but it's about deprecating all those existing point solutions.\nWe talked about Lockheed Martin being able to deprecate our legacy CI vendor. It's even not just on software,\nnot just on cycle time, not just on efficiency, even on hardware costs. So, being able to consolidate is the big\nwinner and Ultimate is – can replace the most point solutions and that's why we're leading with it.\nQuestion – Gregg Moskowitz: Great. Thank you.\nAnswer – Kelsey Turcotte: Great. Our next question comes from Matt Hedberg at RBC. Matt, go ahead.\nAnalyst:Matthew Hedberg\nQuestion – Matthew Hedberg: Great. Thanks, Kelsey. I'll offer my congrats as well. I guess for either of you,\nregarding GenAI, assuming (39:36) you guys are increasingly fitting into that work stream for a customer\nwhen they're thinking through their own GenAI adoption, I'm just sort of curious, like when you're having\nconversations with customers, how important is GenAI? Because I think we've all been sort of like – it's the\nfirst and last question I think everybody asks. But how – when you're talking to the customers, how important\nis that in their software development lifecycle right now? And I guess is there a – how do they see GitLab\nfitting into that kind of that ecosystem that they're all developing?\nAnswer – Sytse Sid Sijbrandij: Yeah. It's really important to our customers with a bunch of caveats why\nthey're not – all of them are rushing to implement it to 100% of their users. First of all, they want it secure.\nSecond of all, they want it to work for the people who are working on existing applications. A lot of the demos\nyou see out there, they're for new applications. Most developers in enterprises are working on giant existing\napplications. So, making that work well is really important. We got a project internally called DaVinci to make\nAI work even better for those existing applications. That's super, super important.\nIt has to meet all the security requirements that the customer has and they want to see an actual return. And\nmost of the time, that return comes not when it's just for the coding, but when it's throughout. So, those are\nthe considerations we run into. They want vendors who can deliver on that. They have a great vision going\nforward, but they're not jumping in to 100% of the people for just a coding solution today.\nQuestion – Matthew Hedberg: Got it. Thanks, Sid.\nAnswer – Kelsey Turcotte: Great. Next question goes to Zach Schneider at R.W. Baird. You there, Zach?\nOperator\nZach, you can now unmute on your phone. If you'd go ahead and unmute for us, you have that capability.\nAnswer – Kelsey Turcotte: Okay. So we'll go on to Mike from Needham. Mike, go ahead.\nPage 12 of 15\nAnalyst:Mike Cikos\nQuestion – Mike Cikos: Hey, team. Thank you for getting me on. Can you hear me all right?\nAnswer – Sytse Sid Sijbrandij: We can.\nQuestion – Mike Cikos: Terrific. I just wanted to circle up and appreciate you guys continuing to give us the\ncomposition of the DBNRR. If I could just focus on the seats contributing about 40% this quarter. Wanted to\nget a sense first how that compared versus your internal expectations. And then secondly, can you help us\nthink about – like, is the sales force indexing more potentially toward pricing given the changes to the\ndifferent packages you have out there in the market, or any other color there as well to help us get a better\nsense of how the DBNRR flows from one quarter to the next? Thank you.\nAnswer – Sytse Sid Sijbrandij: Yeah. Absolutely. Thanks for the question. The dollar-based net retention with\nthe seat fluctuation based on the largest deal that we had last year, we knew that was going to be different\nthis quarter than previous quarters. It's also an output. And so, as we go in and solution sell, we're trying to\nfigure out what the best solution is for the customer and then we'll land there. The fact that we're landing\nlarger and landing more on Ultimate, that's going to – that's good news and will have an impact on dollar-\nbased net retention rate. But there's nothing that I saw within the quarter that caused any concerns as it\nrelates specifically to seats as that component of the dollar-based net retention rate.\nQuestion – Mike Cikos: Thank you very much.\nAnswer – Kelsey Turcotte: Great. Next question goes to Peter Weed at Bernstein. Peter, go ahead.\nAnalyst:Peter Weed\nQuestion – Peter Weed: Thank you very much, and congrats on the continued momentum. I think if I'm\ndoing my back of the envelope properly, it looks like you are anticipating a nice acceleration in quarter four\nimplied in the numbers. How should we think about that acceleration relative to what appears to be a little bit\nof a deceleration in your guidance for quarter three?\nAnswer – Brian G. Robins: Thanks, Peter. As always, appreciate the question. When I'd look back at sort of\nlast year and looked at when we reported Q2 and what we guide for Q3 and Q4, they're somewhat similar.\nAnd so, I didn't see any sort of sequential or year-over-year changes that jumped out to me to be surprising.\nFourth quarter historically has always been the strongest quarter in the company. Q2 and Q3 have relatively\nbeen the same, and Q1 seasonally has been a little weak. We continue to guide to strong top line growth\nrates and improving non-GAAP operating margins.\nThe thing I personally like about the business model is we have a lot of visibility heading into any given\nquarter given the ratable nature of the business. And as we continue to scale, we're seeing efficiencies at\nscale in the business, which is great as well. And so I'm pleased with the guidance we've provided this\nafternoon for the third quarter and for the full year.\nQuestion – Peter Weed: Thank you.\nAnswer – Kelsey Turcotte: Great. Next question goes to George McGreehan at Bank of America. George, go\nahead.\nPage 13 of 15\nAnalyst:George McGreehan\nQuestion – George McGreehan: Hey. Can you guys hear me all right?\nAnswer – Sytse Sid Sijbrandij: We can.\nQuestion – George McGreehan: All right. Hey, Sid, Brian. Appreciate you guys taking the question. It's\nGeorge McGreehan on for Koji Ikeda. I wanted to say congrats on Duo Enterprise going GA. The list of\nfeatures highlighted on the press release were very impressive. And I kind of wanted to dig in more\nspecifically about how you're selling the product to the installed base. Can you talk a bit about the strategy\nthere and in terms of any changes to sales incentives? Just to kind of get a sense of how to think about\npotential adoption rates over the next several quarters.\nAnswer – Sytse Sid Sijbrandij: Yeah. Thanks for that. The main audience for Duo Enterprise is existing GitLab\nUltimate customers. And Ultimate is typically are larger companies and they are served by our sales force. So,\nit's a direct motion. Ultimate is also our fastest growing SKU. Like if you think about it, if you look at the\ncohort of $100,000-plus, two-thirds of the net new ARR went into Ultimate. So, that's growing and we want to\nbuild this Duo Enterprise growth on top of that.\nAnd we're talking to the customer because there's lots of considerations implementing it. That's, for example,\nwhy we're working on an offline version. That's why we have tons of features to control who's using it and\nwhen they are using it. And we're selling it because of the improvement in productivity, not just for coding,\nnot just for devs, but also for their security people and their operations people.\nAnswer – Kelsey Turcotte: Great, thanks. We have time for two more questions. I'll go to Nick Altmann at\nScotiabank. Nick, go ahead.\nAnalyst:Nick Altmann\nQuestion – Nick Altmann: Thanks, guys. Just a quick one for me. Last quarter, you guys talked about Duo\ngoing to be sort of a bigger needle-mover next year. You guys did rattle off a handful of marquee wins. And\nso I guess when you think about the second half pipeline as you sort of get more customers on Duo, have\nmore referenceable logos, what are you sort of anticipating from the second half of the year in terms of Duo\ncontribution versus, say, a quarter ago? Thanks.\nAnswer – Brian G. Robins: Yeah. Thanks for the question. I'll answer it directly and I'll give some more\ncontext on sort of how I think about it. So, we really expect AI to start contributing to the model in FY 2026\nand beyond. First, from just a practical perspective, there was sort of a big media hype cycle and people are\njust partially adopting it now. So I think right now, we're starting to see customers trying to figure out how to\nimplement AI safely and compliantly within their organizations. And we're starting to see that with what we\ngave you from a reference perspective.\nAnd also just from a mechanics perspective, and I know you know this, but it makes sense to say it, is from a\nnew product perspective, for it to have an impact at a company that's $700 million plus in run rate revenue\ngrowing 30%, it's just going to take a little while to sort of build that. From the AI contribution in 2Q, I will say\nthat we're three times our planned number. So, we did a lot better than what we expected internally. And so\nfrom a model perspective long term, I just view this as good news because this is going to be a long-term\ngrowth driver for the business.\nQuestion – Nick Altmann: Thanks, Brian.\nPage 14 of 15\nAnswer – Kelsey Turcotte: Great. Last call for our question is coming from Kingsley Crane at Canaccord.\nKingsley, go ahead.\nAnalyst:Kingsley Crane\nQuestion – Kingsley Crane: Great. Hello?\nAnswer – Kelsey Turcotte: Please go on.\nQuestion – Kingsley Crane: Great. It sounds like you've had some nice wall-to-wall Duo deployments with a\ncouple banks and F5. Should we continue to think about high user penetration but a smaller total number of\ncustomers or are you seeing some green shoots in terms of some bottoms-up adoption with Duo? Thanks.\nAnswer – Sytse Sid Sijbrandij: We're seeing some bottoms-up adoption as well. I think if you look across our\nentire customer base, the more common scenario is that they buy Duo for part of their users. And for various\nreasons, they don't – they're not yet ready to put all the users in it. We think that will come over time. The\nreturns are there that add some more common scenario. Of course, we also have these great customers that\ndo it wall to wall immediately. And if we if we meet all the requirements, we can do that and it's – that has our\npreference, but the partial scenario is more common.\nQuestion – Kingsley Crane: Great. Thanks for the color.\nSo, this concludes our second quarter call. Thank you very much for joining us and we look forward to seeing\nmany of you over the coming quarter. Have a great evening.\nCopyright © 2024 FactSet Research Systems Inc. All rights reserved.\nPage 15 of 15"

We believe that adjusted free cash flow is a useful indicator of liquidity that provides\ninformation to management and investors about the amount of cash generated from our operations that, after\nthe investments in property and equipment and any non-recurring income tax payments related to BAPA, can\nbe used for strategic initiatives, including investing in our business, and strengthening our financial position.\nOne limitation of adjusted free cash flow is that it does not reflect our future contractual commitments.\nAdditionally, adjusted free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for a\ngiven period.\nGitLab Inc.\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\n(in thousands)\n(unaudited)\nJuly 31, 2024 April 30, 2024 January 31, 2024 October 31, 2023 July 31, 2023 April 30, 2023 January 31, 2023 October 31, 2022\nASSETS\nCURRENT ASSETS:\nCash and cash equivalents .............................................................................. $ 438,616 $ 420,322 $ 287,996 $ 285,309 $ 273,225 $ 315,933 $ 295,402 $ 372,169\nShort-term investments..................................................................................... 644,488 641,173 748,289 704,325 713,058 621,706 641,249 555,583\nAccounts receivable, net................................................................................... 165,001 135,195 166,731 135,614 105,815 126,079 130,479 97,580\nDeferred contract acquisition costs, current .................................................. 33,841 31,034 32,300 27,196 25,069 25,093 26,505 23,599\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets.................................................. 32,410 35,319 45,601 29,892 26,053 26,409 24,327 20,454\nTotal current assets ........................................................................................... 1,314,356 1,263,043 1,280,917 1,182,336 1,143,220 1,115,220 1,117,962 1,069,385\nProperty and equipment, net............................................................................ 2,899 2,820 2,954 3,690 4,080 4,936 5,797 5,560\nOperating lease right-of-use assets................................................................ 482 543 405 533 673 1,300 998 —\nGoodwill............................................................................................................... 16,017 16,070 8,145 15,104 14,743 15,014 15,628 14,240\nIntangible assets, net......................................................................................... 21,867 16,637 1,733 8,145 8,145 8,145 8,145 8,145\nDeferred contract acquisition costs, non-current .......................................... 15,753 17,738 19,317 2,254 2,774 3,321 3,901 4,484\nEquity method investment ................................................................................ — — — 9,634 10,574 11,735 12,682 13,624\nOther non-current assets.................................................................................. 4,888 4,776 4,390 5,200 4,860 4,437 4,087 4,803\nTOTAL ASSETS ................................................................................................ $ 1,376,262 $ 1,321,627 $ 1,317,861 $ 1,226,896 $ 1,189,069 $ 1,164,108 $ 1,169,200 $ 1,120,241\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nCURRENT LIABILITIES:\nAccounts payable............................................................................................... $ 3,219 $ 3,230 $ 1,738 $ 5,023 $ 4,165 $ 3,029 $ 5,184 $ 6,233\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities.............................................. 272,164 306,734 286,178 269,980 24,643 28,885 25,954 23,753\nAccrued compensation and benefits............................................................... 29,117 22,743 35,809 23,272 23,504 15,716 20,776 16,716\nDeferred revenue, current................................................................................. 362,348 341,830 338,348 287,647 268,883 263,423 254,382 217,777\nTotal current liabilities........................................................................................ 666,848 674,537 662,073 585,922 321,195 311,053 306,296 264,479\nDeferred revenue, non-current......................................................................... 14,732 15,267 23,794 23,016 25,860 28,043 28,355 28,946\nOther non-current liabilities............................................................................... 6,678 17,465 14,060 24,776 10,774 9,411 9,824 12,125\nTOTAL LIABILITIES .......................................................................................... 688,258 707,269 699,927 633,714 357,829 348,507 344,475 305,550\nSTOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY:\nAdditional paid-in capital................................................................................... 1,833,786 1,768,947 1,718,661 1,658,375 1,610,072 1,542,603 1,497,373 1,453,349\nAccumulated deficit............................................................................................

          "content": "Investor\nPresentation\nSecond Quarter Fiscal Year 2025\nThis presentation contains “forward-looking statementsˮ within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements\nof historical fact are forward-looking statements. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our future operating results and financial position, anticipated future expenses\nand investments, expectations relating to certain of our key financial and operating metrics, our business strategy and plans, market growth, our market position and potential market opportunities,\nand our objectives for future operations. The words “believe,ˮ “may,ˮ “will,ˮ “estimate,ˮ “potential,ˮ “continue,ˮ “anticipate,ˮ “intend,ˮ “expect,ˮ “could,ˮ “would,ˮ “project,ˮ “plan,ˮ “target,ˮ “expect,ˮ and\nsimilar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on managementʼs expectations, assumptions, and projections based on information\navailable at the time the statements were made. Our future financial condition and results of operations, as well as any forward-looking statements, are subject to change due to inherent risks and\nuncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. Important factors that could cause our actual results, performance and achievements, or industry results to differ materially from estimates or\nprojections contained in or implied by our forward-looking statements include the following: our revenue growth rate in the future; our ability to achieve and sustain profitability, our business, financial\ncondition, and operating results; security and privacy breaches; our intense competition and loss of market share to our competitors; the market for our services may not grow; a decline in our\ncustomer renewals and expansions; our transparency; our publicly available company Handbook; customers staying on our open-source or free SaaS product offering; fluctuations in our operating\nresults; our ability to manage our growth effectively; our ability to respond to rapid technological changes; our incorporation of artificial intelligence features into our products; our ability to accurately\npredict the long-term rate of customer subscription renewals or adoption, or the impact of these renewals and adoption; and our hiring model. We do not undertake any obligation to update or release\nany revisions to any forward-looking statement or to report any events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law.\nThis presentation also contains estimates and other statistical data made by independent parties and by GitLab relating to market size and growth and other industry data. Such data involves a\nnumber of assumptions and limitations, and you are cautioned not to give undue weight to such estimates. GitLab has not independently verified the statistical and other industry data generated by\nindependent parties and contained in this presentation and, accordingly, it cannot guarantee their accuracy or completeness. In addition, projections, assumptions and estimates of its future\nperformance and the future performance of the markets in which GitLab competes are necessarily subject to a high degree of uncertainty and risk due to a variety of factors. These and other factors\ncould cause results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the estimates made by the independent parties and by GitLab.\nThis presentation includes certain financial measures not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\"), which are used by management as a\nsupplemental measure, have certain limitations, and should not be construed as alternatives to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP measures as defined by us\nmay not be comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies. Our presentation of such measures, which may include adjustments to exclude unusual or non-recurring items,\nshould not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by other unusual or non-recurring items. A reconciliation is provided in the Appendix to the most directly comparable\nfinancial measure stated in accordance with GAAP.\nFor further information with respect to GitLab, we refer you to our most recent Annual Report on Form 10K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10Q filed with the SEC. In addition, we are subject to the\ninformation and reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and, accordingly file periodic reports, current reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC. These\nperiodic reports, current reports, proxy statements and other information are available for review at the SECʼs website at http://www.sec.gov.\n© 2024 GitLab Inc.\nGitLab at a glance\n6%\n$730M 31% 10%\nQ2 FY25 Non-GAAP Adj.\nRun-Rate Revenue1 YoY Run-Rate Revenue Growth1 Q2 FY25 Non-GAAP Operating Margin1\nFree Cash Flow Margin1\n126% 9,314 1,076 1\nDollar-Based Net Retention Rate1 Base Customers1 $100K ARR Customers1 Platform\nNote: Figures as of the three months ended July 31, 2024 Q2 FY25) unless otherwise noted.\n1 Definitions and reconciliations with most directly comparable GAAP figure can be found in the Appendix.\n© 2024 GitLab Inc.\nEvery organization must be\ngreat at developing, securing,\n& deploying software.\n© 2024 GitLab Inc.\nThe Solution\nA comprehensive\nDevSecOps platform\n© 2024 GitLab Inc.\n55%\nThe only AI solution that\nsupports developers at every boost in deployment\nvelocity\nstage of their workflow\n90%\nMost comprehensive AI-powered\nDevSecOps platform available\nreduction in time spent\non toolchain operations\nAI across the SDLC benefits everyone\nfrom developers to security specialists\nand operations teams\n50%\nThe combination of both our platform\nand AI drives results for customers\nfaster vulnerability\ndetection\n© 2024 GitLab Inc.\nGitLab recognized as a Leader\n®\n2024 Gartner\n™\nMagic Quadrant for\nAccording to Gartner, Leaders demonstrate\na deep understanding of market needs and\ncontinuously innovate by integrating\nadvanced AI models and expanding their\nfeature sets to stay ahead of industry trends.\nSource: Gartner, Magic Quadrant for AI Code Assistants, Arun Batchu, Haritha Khandabattu, Philip Walsh, Matt Brasier, August 2024 |GARTNER is a registered trademark and service mark of Gartner, Inc. and/or its affiliates in the U.S. and internationally, and MAGIC QUADRANT is a\nregistered trademark of Gartner, Inc. and/or its affiliates and are used herein with permission.

Reseller or distributor channel partners are not counted as customers. In cases\nwhere customers subscribe to The One DevOps Platform through our channel partners, each end customer is counted separately.\nBase Customers: Customers generating $5,000 or more in ARR.\nMonthly Recurring Revenue (“MRRˮ): Aggregate monthly revenue for all customers during that month from committed contractual\namounts of subscriptions, including self-managed and SaaS offerings but excluding professional services.\nAnnual Recurring Revenue (“ARRˮ): Monthly recurring revenue multiplied by 12.\nCurrent Period ARR Includes any upsells, price adjustments, user growth within a customer, contraction, and attrition.\nDollar-Based Net Retention: The percentage change in ARR derived from the customer base at a point in time. Calculated as of a\nperiod end by starting with customers as of 12 months prior to such period end (“Prior Period ARRˮ). Then ARR for the same\ncustomers is calculated as of the current period end (“Current Period ARRˮ). Then divide the total Current Period ARR by the total\nPrior Period ARR to arrive at the Dollar-Based Net Retention Rate.\nRun-Rate Revenue: The sum of the most recent three months of revenue at the end of each quarter multiplied by 4.\n© 2024 GitLab Inc."
