(NASDAQ: PESI)** (the “Company”) today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and provided a business update.\n\nMark Duff, President and CEO of the Company, commented, “During the third quarter, we continued to experience temporary weakness, partly due to ongoing delays in service starts and waste shipments. Additionally, our Florida facility was impacted by Hurricane Helene, resulting in extended power outages and required repairs, which have since been completed. In light of the headwinds we faced in 2024, we reduced expenses and streamlined operations outside of R&D, which should result in improved profitability going forward. Moreover, performance within our Services Segment and across our treatment plants has steadily improved in the latter part of the quarter, which we anticipate should continue into Q4. In addition, an agency of the federal government recently announced that we were part of a winning team awarded a service project over a 10-year period. While we cannot provide specifics at this time, we plan to provide specifics about this award as soon as practical.”\n\n“Last week, we announced the successful startup of our first commercial Perma-FAS system for PFAS (Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances) destruction at our Florida facility. We are extremely pleased with the performance of this unit, and feedback from existing and prospective customers has been highly encouraging. We have already secured approximately 6,000 gallons of AFFF (Aqueous Film Forming Foam) liquids and anticipate receiving an additional 20,000 gallons in the coming months. We are also working to expand this technology into additional applications, including Granular Activated Carbon (GAC), biosolids, and soils.”\n\n“Finally, we look forward to providing critical services to the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Hanford tank remediation mission, including the treatment of effluent following the commissioning of the Direct Feed Low-Activity Waste (DFLAW) facility, which is currently anticipated to begin in the summer of 2025. We believe these programs will represent opportunities for Perma-Fix over the coming years.”\n\nThe Company also notes that its net loss for the third quarter of 2024 included a non-cash tax expense recorded in the amount of approximately $6.4 million as the Company provided for a full valuation allowance against its U.S deferred tax assets.\n\n**Financial Results** Revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was $16.8 million versus $21.9 million for the same period last year. Revenue for the Treatment Segment decreased to approximately $9.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from $10.8 million for the corresponding period of 2023. The decrease was attributed to a number of factors which included: waste shipments that were expected in the third quarter of 2024 were unexpectedly pushed into the fourth quarter of 2024 by certain customers; waste shipment delays by certain customers and reduced revenue production due to temporary shutdown of our Florida facility from the impact of Hurricane Helene; and delay in revenue projection due to equipment breakdowns in certain of our facilities which required replacement or repair. All the equipment is now back in service. The acceleration in investment of our PFAS technology, which included the installation of our first full scale commercial system, continues to require significant management and operation support which contributed to revenue production delays. Revenue for the Services Segment decreased to approximately $7.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from $11.1 million for the corresponding period of 2023. The decrease in revenue in the Services Segment was attributed partly to the temporary demobilization of a project that was mandated by the customer due to Hurricane Helene. Additionally, the decrease in revenue in the Services Segment was due, in part to the completion of two large projects in late 2023 which were not replaced by new projects with similar value. These two completed projects together generated significant amount of revenue in the third quarter of 2023 when they were in full operational status.\n\nGross profit for the third quarter of 2024 was $1.3 million versus $4.5 million for the third quarter of 2023. The overall decrease in gross profit was primarily attributed to lower revenue generated in both segments as discussed above. Overall gross margin for the third quarter of 2024 was approximately 7.9% versus 20.8% for the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to decreases in revenue in both segments, overall lower margin projects and the impact of our fixed cost structure.\n\nOperating loss was approximately $2.6 million in the third quarter of 2024 versus operating income of $496,000 for the third quarter of 2023. Net loss for the third quarter of 2024 was approximately $9.0 million or ($0.57) per basic share as compared to net income of approximately $341,000 for the third quarter of 2023 or $0.03 per basic share. As noted above, net loss for the third quarter of 2024 included a non-cash tax expense recorded in the amount of approximately $6.4 million as the Company provided for a full valuation allowance against its U.S deferred tax assets.\n\nThe Company reported EBITDA of ($2.1) million from continuing operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as compared to EBITDA of $1.2 million from continuing operations for the same period of 2023. The Company defines EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”), and should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, earnings as an indicator of operating performance or cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. The Company believes the presentation of EBITDA is relevant and useful by enhancing the readers’ ability to understand the Company’s operating performance. The Company’s management utilizes EBITDA as a mean to measure performance. The Company’s measurement of EBITDA may not be comparable to similar titled measures reported by other companies. The table below reconciles EBITDA, a non-GAAP measures, to GAAP numbers for (loss) income from continuing operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023.\n\n(Unaudited) | (Unaudited)  \n---|---  \nThree Months Ended | Nine Months Ended  \nSeptember 30, | September 30,  \n(In thousands) |  2024  |  2023  |  2024  |  2023   \n(Loss) income from continuing operations | $ | (8,806 | ) | $ | 246 | $ | (16,049 | ) | $ | 448  \nAdjustments:  \nDepreciation & amortization | 433 | 686 | 1,295 | 2,124  \nInterest income | (292 | ) | (146 | ) | (679 | ) | (445 | )  \nInterest expense | 121 | 89 | 346 | 189  \nInterest expense - financing fees | 18 | 36 | 47 | 80  \nIncome tax expense | 6,417 | 254 | 4,300 | 482  \nEBITDA | $ | (2,109 | ) | $ | 1,165 | $ | (10,740 | ) | $ | 2,878  \n  \nThe tables below present certain unaudited financial information for the business segments, which excludes allocation of corporate expenses.\n\nThree Months Ended | Nine Months Ended  \n---|---  \nSeptember 30, 2024 | September 30, 2024  \n(Unaudited) | (Unaudited)  \n(In thousands) | Treatment | Services | Treatment | Services  \nNet revenues | $ | 9,064 | $ | 7,748 | $ | 26,116 | $ | 18,299  \nGross profit (loss) | 410 | 924 | (839 | ) | 247  \nSegment loss | (4,902 | ) | (2,294 | ) | (7,416 | ) | (3,713 | )  \nThree Months Ended | Nine Months Ended  \n---|---  \nSeptember 30, 2023 | September 30, 2023  \n(Unaudited) | (Unaudited)  \n(In thousands) | Treatment | Services | Treatment | Services  \nNet revenues | $ | 10,795 | $ | 11,082 | $ | 33,223 | $ | 33,793  \nGross profit | 1,494 | 3,055 | 5,237 | 6,837  \nSegment profit | 1,014 | 1,120 | 2,619 | 2,933  \n  \n**Conference Call**\n\nPerma-Fix will host a conference call at 11:00 a.m. ET on Wednesday, November 13, 2024.

(NASDAQ: PESI) (the “Company”) today announced financial results for the third\nquarter ended September 30, 2024, and provided a business update.\nMark Duff, President and CEO of the Company, commented, “During the third quarter, we\ncontinued to experience temporary weakness, partly due to ongoing delays in service starts\nand waste shipments. Additionally, our Florida facility was impacted by Hurricane Helene,\nresulting in extended power outages and required repairs, which have since been\ncompleted. In light of the headwinds we faced in 2024, we reduced expenses and\nstreamlined operations outside of R&D, which should result in improved profitability going\nforward. Moreover, performance within our Services Segment and across our treatment\nplants has steadily improved in the latter part of the quarter, which we anticipate should\ncontinue into Q4. In addition, an agency of the federal government recently announced that\nwe were part of a winning team awarded a service project over a 10-year period. While we\ncannot provide specifics at this time, we plan to provide specifics about this award as soon\nas practical.”\n“Last week, we announced the successful startup of our first commercial Perma-FAS system\nfor PFAS (Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances) destruction at our Florida facility. We are\nextremely pleased with the performance of this unit, and feedback from existing and\nprospective customers has been highly encouraging. We have already secured\napproximately 6,000 gallons of AFFF (Aqueous Film Forming Foam) liquids and anticipate\nreceiving an additional 20,000 gallons in the coming months. We are also working to expand\nthis technology into additional applications, including Granular Activated Carbon (GAC),\nbiosolids, and soils.”\n“Finally, we look forward to providing critical services to the U.S. Department of Energy’s\n(DOE) Hanford tank remediation mission, including the treatment of effluent following the\ncommissioning of the Direct Feed Low-Activity Waste (DFLAW) facility, which is currently\nanticipated to begin in the summer of 2025. We believe these programs will represent\nopportunities for Perma-Fix over the coming years.”\nThe Company also notes that its net loss for the third quarter of 2024 included a non-cash\ntax expense recorded in the amount of approximately $6.4 million as the Company provided\nfor a full valuation allowance against its U.S deferred tax assets.\nFinancial Results\nRevenue for the third quarter of 2024 was $16.8 million versus $21.9 million for the same\nperiod last year. Revenue for the Treatment Segment decreased to approximately $9.1\nmillion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from $10.8 million for the\ncorresponding period of 2023. The decrease was attributed to a number of factors which\nincluded: waste shipments that were expected in the third quarter of 2024 were\nunexpectedly pushed into the fourth quarter of 2024 by certain customers; waste shipment\ndelays by certain customers and reduced revenue production due to temporary shutdown of\nour Florida facility from the impact of Hurricane Helene; and delay in revenue projection due\nto equipment breakdowns in certain of our facilities which required replacement or repair. All\nthe equipment is now back in service. The acceleration in investment of our PFAS\ntechnology, which included the installation of our first full scale commercial system,\ncontinues to require significant management and operation support which contributed to\nrevenue production delays. Revenue for the Services Segment decreased to approximately\n$7.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from $11.1 million for the\ncorresponding period of 2023. The decrease in revenue in the Services Segment was\nattributed partly to the temporary demobilization of a project that was mandated by the\ncustomer due to Hurricane Helene. Additionally, the decrease in revenue in the Services\nSegment was due, in part to the completion of two large projects in late 2023 which were not\nreplaced by new projects with similar value. These two completed projects together\ngenerated significant amount of revenue in the third quarter of 2023 when they were in full\noperational status.\nGross profit for the third quarter of 2024 was $1.3 million versus $4.5 million for the third\nquarter of 2023. The overall decrease in gross profit was primarily attributed to lower\nrevenue generated in both segments as discussed above. Overall gross margin for the third\nquarter of 2024 was approximately 7.9% versus 20.8% for the third quarter of 2023 primarily\ndue to decreases in revenue in both segments, overall lower margin projects and the impact\nof our fixed cost structure.\nOperating loss was approximately $2.6 million in the third quarter of 2024 versus operating\nincome of $496,000 for the third quarter of 2023. Net loss for the third quarter of 2024 was\napproximately $9.0 million or ($0.57) per basic share as compared to net income of\napproximately $341,000 for the third quarter of 2023 or $0.03 per basic share. As noted\nabove, net loss for the third quarter of 2024 included a non-cash tax expense recorded in\nthe amount of approximately $6.4 million as the Company provided for a full valuation\nallowance against its U.S deferred tax assets.\nThe Company reported EBITDA of ($2.1) million from continuing operations for the quarter\nended September 30, 2024, as compared to EBITDA of $1.2 million from continuing\noperations for the same period of 2023. The Company defines EBITDA as earnings before\ninterest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is not a measure of performance\ncalculated in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States\nof America (“GAAP”), and should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for,\nearnings as an indicator of operating performance or cash flows from operating activities as\na measure of liquidity. The Company believes the presentation of EBITDA is relevant and\nuseful by enhancing the readers’ ability to understand the Company’s operating\nperformance. The Company’s management utilizes EBITDA as a mean to measure\nperformance. The Company’s measurement of EBITDA may not be comparable to similar\ntitled measures reported by other companies. The table below reconciles EBITDA, a non-\nGAAP measures, to GAAP numbers for (loss) income from continuing operations for the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023.\n(Unaudited) (Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\n(Loss) income from continuing\noperations $ (8,806) $ 246 $ (16,049) $ 448\nAdjustments:\nDepreciation & amortization 433 686 1,295 2,124\nInterest income (292) (146) (679) (445)\nInterest expense 121 89 346 189\nInterest expense - financing fees 18 36 47 80\nIncome tax expense 6,417 254 4,300 482\nEBITDA $ (2,109) $ 1,165 $ (10,740) $ 2,878\nThe tables below present certain unaudited financial information for the business segments,\nwhich excludes allocation of corporate expenses.\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2024\n(Unaudited) (Unaudited)\n(In thousands) Treatment Services Treatment Services\nNet revenues $ 9,064 $ 7,748 $ 26,116 $ 18,299\nGross profit (loss) 410 924 (839) 247\nSegment loss (4,902) (2,294) (7,416) (3,713)\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 September 30, 2023\n(Unaudited) (Unaudited)\n(In thousands) Treatment Services Treatment Services\nNet revenues $ 10,795 $ 11,082 $ 33,223 $ 33,793\nGross profit 1,494 3,055 5,237 6,837\nSegment profit 1,014 1,120 2,619 2,933\nConference Call\nPerma-Fix will host a conference call at 11:00 a.m. ET on Wednesday, November 13, 2024.\nThe call will be available on the Company’s website at https://ir.perma-fix.com/conference-\ncalls, or by calling 888-506-0062 for U.S. callers or +1 973-528-0011 for international callers,\nand by entering access code: 271776.

2024\n(Unaudited)\n1. Basis of Presentation\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared by the Company (which may be referred to as we, us or our), without an audit, pursuant to\nthe rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”). Certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements\nprepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules\nand regulations, although the Company believes the disclosures which are made are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. Further, the condensed\nconsolidated financial statements reflect, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the\nfinancial position and results of operations as of and for the periods indicated. The results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, are not necessarily\nindicative of results to be expected for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024.\nThese condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company’s\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nReclassification\nCertain amounts in the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the prior period have been reclassified to conform with current presentation. The reclassifications\nhad no effect on the condensed consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and stockholders’ equity.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nOur accounting policies are as set forth in the notes to the December 31, 2023, consolidated financial statements referred to above.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards – Not Yet Adopted\nIn August 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-05, “Business Combinations—Joint Venture\nFormations (Subtopic 805-60): Recognition and Initial Measurement.” ASU 2023-05 applies to the formation of a “joint venture” or a “corporate joint venture” and requires a\njoint venture to initially measure all contributions received upon its formation at fair value. The guidance does not impact accounting by the venturers. The new guidance is\napplicable to joint venture entities with a formation date on or after January 1, 2025, on a prospective basis. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on its\nconsolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures,” which expands reportable segment\ndisclosure requirements by requiring disclosures of significant reportable segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) and\nincluded within each reported measure of a segment’s profit or loss. The ASU also requires disclosure of the title and position of the individual identified as the CODM and an\nexplanation of how the CODM uses the reported measures of a segment’s profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. Additionally,\nASU 2023-07 requires all segment profit or loss and assets disclosures to be provided on an annual and interim basis. The amendments in this ASU are required to be adopted\nfor fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted, and should be\napplied on a retrospective basis. ASU 2023-07 will be effective for the Company’s financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024. This ASU will not have impact\non the Company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations. The Company is evaluating the impact to the related segment reporting disclosures.\n8\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures,” which modifies the rules on income tax\ndisclosures to require entities to disclose (1) specific categories in the rate reconciliation, (2) the income or loss from continuing operations before income tax expense or\nbenefit (separated between domestic and foreign) and (3) income tax expense or benefit from continuing operations (separated by federal, state and foreign). ASU 2023-09 also\nrequires entities to disclose their income tax payments to international, federal, state and local jurisdictions, among other changes. The guidance is effective for annual periods\nbeginning after December 15, 2024. ASU 2023-09 should be applied on a prospective basis, but retrospective application is permitted. This ASU will not have impact on the\nCompany’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations. The Company is evaluating the impact to its income taxes reporting disclosures.\n3. Revenue\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nIn general, the Company’s business segmentation is aligned according to the nature and economic characteristics of our services and provides meaningful disaggregation of\neach business segment’s results of operations. The nature of the Company’s performance obligations within our Treatment and Services Segments result in the recognition of\nour revenue primarily over time. The following tables present further disaggregation of our revenues by different categories for our Services and Treatment Segments:\nRevenue by Contract Type\n(In thousands) Three Months Ended Three Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nTreatment Services Total Treatment Services Total\nFixed price $ 9,064 $ 6,396 $ 15,460 $ 10,795 $ 10,188 $ 20,983\nTime and materials — 1,352 1,352 — 894 894\nTotal $ 9,064 $ 7,748 $ 16,812 $ 10,795 $ 11,082 $ 21,877\nRevenue by Contract Type\n(In thousands) Nine Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nTreatment Services Total Treatment Services Total\nFixed price $ 26,116 $ 15,405 $ 41,521 $ 33,223 $ 29,995 $ 63,218\nTime and materials — 2,894 2,894 — 3,798 3,798\nTotal $ 26,116 $ 18,299 $ 44,415 $ 33,223 $ 33,793 $ 67,016\n9\nRevenue by generator\n(In thousands) Three Months Ended Three Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nTreatment Services Total Treatment Services Total\nDomestic government $ 6,578 $ 7,346 $ 13,924 $ 7,095 $ 8,444 $ 15,539\nDomestic commercial 2,229 312 2,541 3,450 2,170 5,620\nForeign government — 65 65 250 445 695\nForeign commercial 257 25 282 — 23 23\nTotal $ 9,064 $ 7,748 $ 16,812 $ 10,795 $ 11,082 $ 21,877\nRevenue by generator\n(In thousands) Nine Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nTreatment Services Total Treatment Services Total\nDomestic government $ 18,997 $ 17,129 $ 36,126 $ 24,160 $ 29,603 $ 53,763\nDomestic commercial 6,045 867 6,912 7,925 3,509 11,434\nForeign government 1 232 233 1,002 615 1,617\nForeign commercial 1,073 71 1,144 136 66 202\nTotal $ 26,116 $ 18,299 $ 44,415 $ 33,223 $ 33,793 $ 67,016\nContract Balances\nThe timing of revenue recognition and billings can result in unbilled receivables (contract assets) or deferred revenue (contract liabilities). The following table represents\nchanges in our contract asset and contract liabilities balances for the periods noted: The reduction in deferred revenue from December 31, 2023, to September 30, 2024, was\nprimarily due to the substantial completion of a waste treatment project for a certain customer in which a prepayment was made to the Company by the customer in 2023.\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 Change ($) Change (%)\nContract assets\nUnbilled receivables - current $ 7,277 $ 8,432 $ (1,155) -14%\nContract liabilities\nDeferred revenue $ 5,398 $ 6,815 $ (1,417) -20.8%\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n(In thousands) 2023 2022 Change ($) Change (%)\nContract assets\nUnbilled receivables - current $ 9,336 $ 6,062 $ 3,274 54.0%\nContract liabilities\nDeferred revenue $ 7,765 $ 4,813 $ 2,952 61.3%\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized revenue of $677,000 and $5,596,000, respectively, related to untreated waste that was in\nthe Company’s control as of the beginning of the year. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized revenue of $842,000 and\n$6,289,000, respectively, related to untreated waste that was in the Company’s control as of the beginning of the year. All revenue recognized in each period related to\nperformance obligations satisfied within the respective period.\nAccounts Receivable\nThe following table represents changes in accounts receivable, net of credit losses, for the periods noted:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 Change ($) Change (%)\nAccounts Receivable (net) $ 8,741 $ 9,722 $ (981) -10.1%\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2023 2022 Change ($) Change (%)\nAccounts Receivable (net) $ 15,342 $ 9,364 $ 5,978 63.8%\nThe decrease from December 31, 2023, to September 30, 2024, was primarily due to reduced billing from decreased revenues. The decrease in accounts receivable was also\nattributed to the collection by May 2024 of outstanding accounts receivable for work performed for a certain Canadian project for which a settlement agreement was reached,\nwith collection subject to meeting certain conditions/terms. (see “Note 11 - Perma-Fix Canada Inc. (“PF Canada”)”) for a discussion on the collection of the receivables).\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nThe Company applies the practical expedient in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606-10-50-14 and does not disclose information about remaining performance\nobligations that have original expected durations of one year or less.\nWithin our Services Segment, there are service contracts which provide that the Company has a right to consideration from a customer in an amount that corresponds directly\nwith the value to the customer of our performance completed to date. For those contracts, the Company has utilized the practical expedient in ASC 606-10-55-18, which allows\nthe Company to recognize revenue in the amount for which we have the right to invoice; accordingly, the Company does not disclose the value of remaining performance\nobligations for those contracts.\nThe Company’s contracts and subcontracts relating to activities at governmental sites generally allow for termination for convenience at any time at the government’s option\nwithout payment of a substantial penalty. The Company does not disclose remaining performance obligations on these contracts.\n10\n4. Leases\nAt the inception of an arrangement, the Company determines if an arrangement is, or contains, a lease based on facts and circumstances present in that arrangement. Lease\nclassifications, recognition, and measurement are then determined at the lease commencement date.\nThe Company’s operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and operating lease liabilities include primarily leases for office and warehouse spaces used to conduct our\nbusiness. The Company’s operating leases also previously included the lease of a building with land where its Oak Ridge Environmental Waste Operations (“EWOC”) facility\nconducts its waste treatment operations. In July 2024, the Company completed the purchase of the EWOC property under the lease purchase option (see “Note 8 – Long Term\nDebt” for a discussion of the purchase of this property by the Company). Finance leases consist primarily of processing equipment and vehicles/trucks used by our facilities’\noperations.\nThe components of lease cost for the Company’s leases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 were as follows (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nOperating Leases:\nLease cost $ 129 $ 157 $ 420 $ 470\nFinance Leases:\nAmortization of ROU assets 65 39 196 115\nInterest on lease liability 20 9 63 22\n85 48 259 137\nShort-term lease rent expense 1 — 3 1\nTotal lease cost $ 215 $ 205 $ 682 $ 608\nThe weighted average remaining lease term and the weighted average discount rate for operating and finance leases at September 30, 2024, were:\nOperating Leases Finance Leases\nWeighted average remaining lease terms (years) 4.9 3.9\nWeighted average discount rate 7.7% 9.0%\nThe weighted average remaining lease term and the weighted average discount rate for operating and finance leases at September 30, 2023, were:\nOperating Leases Finance Leases\nWeighted average remaining lease terms (years) 5.7 3.2\nWeighted average discount rate 7.5% 7.0%\n11\nThe following table reconciles the undiscounted cash flows for the operating and finance leases at September 30, 2024, to the operating and finance lease liabilities recorded on\nthe balance sheet (in thousands):\nOperating Leases Finance Leases\n2024 $ 108 $ 91\n2025 486 345\n2026 479 192\n2027 447 157\n2028 343 134\n2029 and thereafter 407 102\nTotal undiscounted lease payments 2,270 1,021\nLess: Imputed interest (429) (172)\nPresent value of lease payments $ 1,841 $ 849\nCurrent portion of operating lease obligations $ 320 $ —\nLong-term operating lease obligations, less current portion $ 1,521 $ —\nCurrent portion of finance lease obligations $ — $ 285\nLong-term finance lease obligations, less current portion $ — $ 564\nSupplemental cash flow and other information related to our leases were as follows for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease\nliabilities:\nOperating cash flow used in operating leases $ 119 $ 145 $ 415 $ 435\nOperating cash flow used in finance leases $ 20 $ 9 $ 63 $ 22\nFinancing cash flow used in finance leases $ 72 $ 54 $ 218 $ 135\nROU assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations for:\nFinance liabilities $ — $ 154 $ — $ 311\nOperating liabilities $ — 484 $ 497 $ 484\nReduction to ROU assets resulting from purchase of\nunderlying asset:\nOperating liabilities 404 — 404 —\nThe reduction in ROU resulted from the purchase of the Company’s property as discussed above (see “Note 8 – Long Term Debt” for a discussion of this purchase).\n12\n5.

Capital Stock, Stock Plans and Stock-Based Compensation\nThe Company has certain stock option plans under which it may award incentive stock options (“ISOs”) and/or non-qualified stock options (“NQSOs”) to employees, officers,\noutside directors, and outside consultants.\nOn January 18, 2024, the Company granted ISOs to certain employees under the 2017 Stock Option Plan (“2017 Plan”), for the purchase of up to an aggregate of 45,000 shares\nof the Company’s common stock, par value $.001 (the “Common Stock”). Each ISO granted is for a contractual term of six years with one-fifth vesting annually over a five-\nyear period. The exercise price of the ISO is $7.75 per share, which was equal to the fair market value of the Company’s Common Stock on the date of grant.\nOn July 18, 2024, the Company granted ISOs to certain employees under the 2017 Stock Option Plan, for the purchase of up to an aggregate of 35,500 shares of the Company’s\nCommon Stock. Each ISO granted is for a contractual term of six years with one-fifth vesting annually over a five-year period. The exercise price of the ISO is $10.05 per\nshare, which was equal to the fair market value of the Company’s Common Stock on the date of grant.\nOn July 18, 2024, the Company issued a NQSO to each of the Company’s seven reelected outside (non-management) directors for the purchase, under the Company’s 2003\nOutside Directors Stock Plan (the “2003 Plan”), of up to 10,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock.

Such services capability includes: project\ninvestigation; radiological engineering; partial and total plant D&D; facility decontamination, dismantling, demolition, and planning; site restoration;\nlogistics; transportation; and emergency response; and\n- A company owned equipment calibration and maintenance laboratory that services, maintains, calibrates, and sources (i.e., rental) health physics, IH and customized\nnuclear, environmental, and occupational safety and health (“NEOSH”) instrumentation.\nOur reporting segments exclude our corporate headquarters and our discontinued operations (see “Note 10 – Discontinued Operations”) which do not generate revenues.\nThe table below presents certain financial information of our operating segments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 (in thousands).\n20\nSegment Reporting for the Quarter Ended September 30, 2024\nConsolidated\nTreatment Services Segments Total Corporate (1) Total\nRevenue from external customers $ 9,064 $ 7,748 $ 16,812 $ — $ 16,812\nIntercompany revenues 13 23 36 — —\nGross profit 410 924 1,334 — 1,334\nResearch and development 205 34 239 64 303\nInterest income 6 — 6 286 292\nInterest expense (37) (3) (40) (81) (121)\nInterest expense-financing fees — — — (18) (18)\nDepreciation and amortization 370 44 414 19 433\nSegment loss (4,902) (2,294) (7,196) (1,610) (8,806)(4)\nExpenditures for segment assets 1,203 180 1,383 — 1,383(2)\nSegment Reporting for the Quarter Ended September 30, 2023\nConsolidated\nTreatment Services Segments Total Corporate (1) Total\nRevenue from external customers $ 10,795 $ 11,082 $ 21,877 $ — $ 21,877\nIntercompany revenues 4 88 92 — —\nGross profit 1,494 3,055 4,549 — 4,549\nResearch and development 102 1 103 17 120\nInterest income — — — 146 146\nInterest expense (23) (1) (24) (65) (89)\nInterest expense-financing fees — — — (36) (36)\nDepreciation and amortization 584 88 672 14 686\nSegment income (loss) 1,014 1,120 2,134 (1,888) 246\nExpenditures for segment assets 333 7 340 — 340(3)\nSegment Reporting for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nConsolidated\nTreatment Services Segments Total Corporate (1) Total\nRevenue from external customers $ 26,116 $ 18,299 $ 44,415 $ — $ 44,415\nIntercompany revenues 67 52 119 — —\nGross (loss) profit (839) 247 (592) — (592)\nResearch and development 609 87 696 176 872\nInterest income 7 — 7 672 679\nInterest expense (107) (4) (111) (235) (346)\nInterest expense-financing fees — — — (47) (47)\nDepreciation and amortization 1,104 133 1,237 58 1,295\nSegment loss (7,416) (3,713) (11,129) (4,920) (16,049)(4)\nExpenditures for segment assets 1,820 404 2,224 — 2,224(2)\nSegment Reporting for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nConsolidated\nTreatment Services Segments Total Corporate (1) Total\nRevenue from external customers $ 33,223 $ 33,793 $ 67,016 $ — $ 67,016\nIntercompany revenues 234 124 358 — —\nGross profit 5,237 6,837 12,074 — 12,074\nResearch and development 260 11 271 69 340\nInterest income — — — 445 445\nInterest expense (68) (2) (70) (119) (189)\nInterest expense-financing fees — — — (80) (80)\nDepreciation and amortization 1,745 337 2,082 42 2,124\nSegment income (loss) 2,619 2,933 5,552 (5,104) 448\nExpenditures for segment assets 1,376 10 1,386 — 1,386(3)\n(1) Amounts reflect the activity for corporate headquarters not included in the segment information.\n(2) Net of financed amount of $361,000 and $406,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.\n(3) Net of financed amount of $152,000 and $309,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\n(4) Includes tax expense recorded in the amount of approximately $6,417,000 in the third quarter of 2024 in connection with a full valuation allowance against the Company’s\nU.S. deferred tax assets (see “Note 13 – Income Taxes” below for a discussion of this tax expense).\n21\n13. Income Taxes\nThe Company uses an estimated annual effective tax rate, which is based on expected annual income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various\njurisdictions in which the Company operates, to determine its quarterly provision for income taxes.\nThe Company records valuation allowances against its net deferred tax assets to the extent it determines it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized in the\nfuture. The Company regularly evaluates the probability that its deferred tax assets will be realized and determines whether valuation allowances or adjustments thereto are\nneeded. This determination involves judgement and the use of estimates and assumptions, including expectations of future taxable income and tax planning strategies. The\nCompany applies judgment to consider the relative impact of negative and positive evidence, and the weight given to negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the\nextent to which such evidence can be objectively verified. Based on the Company’s evaluation of all available positive and negative evidence, and with greater weight placed\non the objectively verifiable evidence which included the Company’s substantial losses incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company determined,\nat the end of the third quarter, that it is more likely than not that the Company’s net U.S. deferred tax assets will not be realized. As a result, the Company provided a full\nvaluation allowance against its U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets resulting in a recorded income tax expense in the amount of approximately $6,417,000. The Company\ncontinues to maintain a valuation allowance against foreign tax attributes that may not be realized.\nThe Company had income tax expenses of $6,417,000 and $4,300,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and income tax expenses of\n$254,000 and $482,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, for our continuing operations. The Company’s effective tax rates were\napproximately 268.6% and 36.6% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 50.8% and 51.8% for the three and nine months ended September\n30, 2023, respectively. The Company’s effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, were primarily impacted by the full valuation allowance on\nits deferred assets as discussed above.\n14. Sale of Common Stock\nOn May 21, 2024, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”) with certain institutional and retail investors (the\n“Purchasers”), pursuant to which the Company sold and issued, in a registered direct offering, an aggregate of 2,051,282 shares of the Company’s Common Stock, at a\nnegotiated purchase price per share of $9.75 (the “Shares”), for aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of approximately $20,000,000, before deducting fees payable to the\nplacement agents and other estimated offering expenses payable by the Company (the “Offering”). The net proceeds from the Offering is to fund (i) continued R&D and\nbusiness development relating to the Company’s patent-pending process for the destruction of PFAS (Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances), as well as the cost of installing at\nleast one commercial treatment unit; (ii) ongoing facility capital expenditures and maintenance costs; and (iii) general corporate and working capital purposes.\nThe Shares were offered and sold by the Company pursuant to the Company’s “shelf” registration statement on Form S-3 and prospectus supplement relating thereto.\nCraig-Hallum Capital Group LLC (“Craig-Hallum”) and Wellington Shields & Co. LLC (“Wellington Shields”) (Wellington Shields and Craig-Hallum together are known as\nthe “Placement Agents”) served as the exclusive placement agents in connection with the Offering. The Company paid the Placement Agents a total cash fee of 6.00% of the\naggregate gross proceeds in the Offering, which totaled approximately $1,200,000. The Company also reimbursed the Placement Agents certain expenses in connection with\nthe Offering in an aggregate amount of approximately $80,000. As additional compensation to the Placement Agents in connection with the Offering, the Company also issued\nto the Placement Agents and two (2) of their members designees, warrants (the “Placement Agents’ Warrants”) to purchase an aggregate of 61,538 shares of Common Stock\n(the “Warrant Shares”), with the aggregate number of Warrant Shares that may be acquired under the Placement Agents’ Warrants equal to 3.0% of the number of Shares sold in\nthe registered direct offering, at an exercise price per share equal to $12.19, which is equal to approximately 125% of the price per share of the Shares sold in the Offering.\nNeither the Placement Agents’ Warrants nor the Warrant Shares have been registered under the Registration Statement or otherwise. The Placement Agents’ Warrants have a\nterm of five years, are exercisable at any time and from time to time, in whole or in part, during the four and one-half (4 ½) year period commencing 180 days from the last date\nof closing of the Offering which was May 24, 2024, and are exercisable via “cashless exercise” in certain circumstances. The aggregate fair value of the “Placement Agents’\nWarrants” was determined to be approximately $331,000 using the Black-Scholes pricing model with the following assumptions: 58.78% volatility, risk free interest rate of\n4.53%, an expected life of five years and no dividend. The aggregate fair market value of the Placement Agent’s Warrants was recorded as an offset to gross proceeds of the\nOffering and an increase to additional-paid-in capital.\nAfter deducting costs incurred of approximately $1,544,000 (exclusive of the aggregate fair market value of the Placement Agents’ Warrants as discussed above) which were\nrecorded as a deduction to equity in connection with the Offering, net cash proceeds to the Company totaled approximately $18,456,000. The Company has paid approximately\n$1,505,000 of the $1,544,000 costs incurred in connection with the Offering.\n22\n15. Subsequent Events\nThe Company evaluated subsequent events and transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date through November 13, 2024, the date that these condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements were available to be issued. Based upon this review, the Company did not identify any subsequent events that would have required adjustment or disclosure\nin the condensed consolidated financial statements other than the below:\nCredit Facility\nOn November 12, 2024, the Company entered into an amendment to its Loan Agreement, as amended, with its lender which provided the following, among other things:\n● removes the quarterly FCCR testing requirement for the third quarter of 2024;\n● reinstates the quarterly FCCR testing requirement starting in the fourth quarter of 2024 and revises the methodology to be used in calculating the FCCR as follows\n(with no change to the minimum 1.15:1 ratio requirement): FCCR for the fourth quarter is to be determined based on financial results for the three-months period\nending December 31, 2024; FCCR for the first quarter of 2025 is to be determined based on financial results for the six-months period ending March 31, 2025; FCCR\nfor the second quarter of 2025 is to be determined based on financial results for the nine-months period ending June 30, 2025; and FCCR for the third quarter of 2025\nand each fiscal quarter thereafter is to be determined based on financial results for a trailing twelve-months period ending basis;\n● extends the required maintenance of a daily minimum of $3,000,000 in Liquidity from the ending date of June 29, 2025 (and including) to September 29, 2025 (and\nincluding); and\n● in the event the Company is able to achieve its minimum quarterly FCCR requirement utilizing its financial results based on a trailing twelve-months period starting\nwith the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the maintenance of a daily minimum Liquidity requirement of $3,000,000 as discussed above will be removed. Any\nsubsequent fiscal quarter testing of the FCCR will revert back to a trailing twelve-months period method.\nIn connection with the amendment, the Company paid its lender a fee of $12,500.\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nForward-looking Statements\nCertain statements contained within this report may be deemed “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the “Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995”. All\nstatements in this report other than a statement of historical fact are forward-looking statements that are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors,\nwhich could cause actual results and performance of the Company to differ materially from such statements. The words “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “will,” and\nsimilar expressions identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements contained herein relate to, among other things,\n● demand for our services;\n● reductions in the level of government funding in future years;\n● accelerated investments;\n● base business is positioned for improvement in 2025;\n● results of operations improvement in 2025;\n● advancement of initiatives to be more fully realized in 2025;\n● reducing operating costs and non-essential expenditures;\n● ability to meet loan agreement quarterly financial covenant requirements;\n23\n● government shutdown or Continuing Resolution (“CR”) impact;\n● cash flow requirements;\n● sufficient Liquidity to fund operations for the next twelve months;\n● revenue under the Italian project;\n● manner in which the applicable government will be required to spend funding to remediate various sites;\n● successful on international bids;\n● funding of operating and capital expenditures from cash from operations, Liquidity under our Credit Facility, and/or financing;\n● our PFAS technology process will exceed current treatment options available;\n● receipt of an additional 20,000 AFFF liquid;\n● advancement of our PFAS technology by mid-2025;\n● strategy for our System;\n● funding of remediation expenditures for sites from funds generated internally;\n● compliance with environmental regulations;\n● positioning for procurements from DOE and other government agencies;\n● potential effect of being a potentially responsible party (“PRP”); and\n● potential violations of environmental laws and attendant remediation at our facilities.\nWhile the Company believes the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance such expectations will prove to be correct.\nThere are a variety of factors which could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those described in this report, including, but not limited to:\n● general economic conditions;\n● contract bids, including international markets;\n● material reduction in revenues;\n● inability to meet PNC covenant requirements;\n● inability to collect in a timely manner a material amount of receivables;\n● increased competitive pressures;\n● inability to maintain and obtain required permits and approvals to conduct operations;\n● inability to develop new and existing technologies in the conduct of operations;\n● inability to maintain and obtain closure and operating insurance requirements;\n● inability to retain or renew certain required permits;\n● discovery of additional contamination or expanded contamination at any of the sites or facilities leased or owned by us or our subsidiaries which would result in a\nmaterial increase in remediation expenditures;\n● delays at our third-party disposal site can extend collection of our receivables greater than twelve months;\n● refusal of third-party disposal sites to accept our waste;\n● changes in federal, state and local laws and regulations, especially environmental laws and regulations, or in interpretation of such;\n● inability of the federal government to adopt a budget in a timely manner or additional CRs;\n● requirements to obtain permits for treatment, storage and disposal (TSD) activities or licensing requirements to handle low level radioactive materials are limited or\nlessened;\n● management retention and development;\n● financial valuation of intangible assets is substantially more/less than expected;\n● the need to use internally generated funds for purposes not presently anticipated;\n● shutdown of the federal government;\n24\n● change in government priorities;\n● inability of the Company to maintain the listing of its Common Stock on the Nasdaq;\n● terminations of contracts with government agencies or subcontracts involving government agencies or reduction in amount of waste delivered to the Company under\nthe contracts or subcontracts;\n● failure of partner to perform its requirements in connection with the Italian project;\n● changes in the scope of work relating to existing contracts;\n● occurrence of an event similar to COVID-19 having adverse effects on the U.S. and world economics;\n● renegotiation of contracts involving government agencies;\n● disposal expense accrual could prove to be inadequate in the event the waste requires re-treatment;\n● inability to raise capital on commercially reasonable terms;\n● inability to increase profitable revenue;\n● economic uncertainties;\n● non-acceptance of our new technology;\n● adjustments to our valuation allowance;\n● new governmental regulations; and\n● risk factors and other factors set forth in “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” contained in the Company’s 2023 Form 10-K and the “Forward-\nLooking Statements” contained in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”) for the first and second\nquarters of 2024 and this third quarter 2024 10-Q.\nOverview\nOur third quarter financial results were impacted by continued acceleration of our investments and a number of unexpected events/factors which included the following:\n● certain waste shipments that were expected to occur in the third quarter of 2024 were pushed into the fourth quarter of 2024 by certain government related customers;\n● unexpected equipment breakdowns that occurred in the latter part of June and during the third quarter of 2024 which required replacement or repair in certain of our\nTreatment Segment facilities delayed revenue production. All of the equipment is now back in service;\n● weather conditions caused by Hurricane Helene resulted in waste shipment delays by certain customers at our Florida facility and temporary demobilization of a\nServices Segment project mandated by the customer. This project resumed in early October. Additionally, Hurricane Helene caused a temporary shutdown of our\nFlorida facility for approximately one week which impacted revenue production;\n● continued acceleration in investment of our new PFAS (Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) technology which requires significant management and operation support,\nincluding the installation of our first full scale commercial system in treating PFAS. This system installation also caused production delays (see “Known Trends and\nUncertainties – New Processing Technology” within this MD&A for a discussion of this technology); and\n● the completion of two large projects in the Services Segment in late 2023 were not replaced by new projects of similar value. Together, these two large projects had\ngenerated significant amount of revenue in the third quarter of 2023 when they were in full operational status.\nIn addition to the aforementioned factors, we continue to experience delays in procurements and contract awards from government clients in the first nine months of 2024.\nAlthough we are disappointed with our 2024 financial results for the first nine months of 2024, we believe our base business is positioned for improvement in 2025 and that our\nresults of operations should improve in 2025. As previously disclosed, we continue to advance a variety of additional initiatives that are expected to be more fully realized in\n2025. These initiatives include, among other things, positioning ourselves for large and mid-size procurements within the U.S. Department of Energy (“DOE”) and U.S. Navy\nand waste treatment in support of DOE’s Hanford closure strategy, continued investments in our facilities and capabilities to allow for broader waste treatment (including\nPFAS), and continued expansion of our waste treatment offerings within the international and commercial markets.\n25\nAs a result of the aforementioned events and factors, our overall revenue decreased by $5,065,000 or 23.2% to $16,812,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024,\nfrom $21,877,000 for the corresponding period of 2023. We saw decreases in both segments where Treatment Segment revenue decreased by $1,731,000 to $9,064,000 or\n16.0% from $10,795,000 and Services Segment revenue decreased by $3,334,000 or 30.1% to $7,748,000 from $11,082,000. Gross profit for the third quarter of 2024 was\napproximately $1,334,000 as compared to gross profit of $4,549,000 for the corresponding period of 2023, reflecting a decrease in gross profit of approximately $3,215,000 or\n70.7%, primarily due to decreased revenue in both segments. Selling, General and Administrative (“SG&A”) expenses decreased by $301,000 or 7.7% for the three months\nended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period of 2023.\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, we provided a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets (see a discussion of this valuation allowance and the impact to our\nfinancial statements in “Results of Operations – Income Taxes” below).\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, overall revenue decreased by $22,601,000 or 33.7% to $44,415,000 from $67,016,000 for the corresponding period of 2023\nwhere we saw decrease in revenue in both segments. Treatment Segment revenue decreased by $7,107,000 to $26,116,000 or 21.4% from $33,223,000 and Services Segment\nrevenue decreased by $15,494,000 or 45.8% to $18,299,000 from $33,793,000. The decrease in revenue within the Treatment Segment was attributed to factors which included\namong other things, delays in waste shipments by certain customers due to poor weather conditions and earlier Continuing Resolution (“CR”) impacts, temporary outages at our\nthree primary facilities for equipment replacement and repairs, program enhancement and testing to support permit expansion and broader market penetration, weather impacts\nat certain of our treatment facilities resulting in temporary shutdown which limited revenue production and accelerated investment in R&D on our new technology to treat\nPFAS. Overall lower averaged price from waste mix within the Treatment Segment also contributed to revenue decrease. The decrease in revenue in the Services Segment was\ndue to slower mobilization and delays in certain projects from the earlier impact of CR and poor weather conditions. Additionally, the decrease in revenue in the Services\nSegment was also attributed to the completion of two large projects in late 2023 which were not replaced by new projects of similar value. Together, these two large projects\nhad generated a significant amount of revenues in the first nine months of 2023 when they were in full operational status. Total gross profit for the nine months ended 2024\ndecreased $12,666,000 or 104.9% due to decreased revenue generated in both segments. SG&A expenses decreased $338,000 or 3.1% for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024, as compared to the corresponding period of 2023.\nBusiness Environment\nOur Treatment and Services Segments’ business continues to be heavily dependent on services that we provide to U.S governmental clients, primarily as subcontractors for\nothers who are prime contractors to government entities or directly as the prime contractor. We believe demand for our services will continue to be subject to fluctuations due to\na variety of factors beyond our control, including, without limitation, the economic conditions, the manner in which the applicable government will be required to spend\nfunding to remediate various sites and potential future federal budget issues. In addition, our governmental contracts and subcontracts relating to activities at governmental sites\nin the United States are generally subject to termination for convenience at any time at the government’s option. Our Italian contract under our partnership may be terminated\nby the Contracting Authority under certain conditions as set forth in the contract. Significant reductions in the level of governmental funding or specifically mandated levels for\ndifferent programs that are important to our business could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe continue to aggressively bid on various contracts, including potential contracts within the international markets.\n26\nResults of Operations\nThe reporting of financial results and pertinent discussions are tailored to our two reportable segments: The Treatment Segment and Services Segment.\nSummary – Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024, and 2023\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\nConsolidated (amounts in thousands) 2024 % 2023 % 2024 % 2023 %\nNet revenues $ 16,812 100.0 $ 21,877 100.0 $ 44,415 100.0 $ 67,016 100.0\nCost of goods sold 15,478 92.1 17,328 79.2 45,007 101.3 54,942 82.0\nGross profit (loss) 1,334 7.9 4,549 20.8 (592) (1.3) 12,074 18.0\nSelling, general and administrative 3,632 21.6 3,933 18.0 10,631 23.9 10,969 16.4\nResearch and development 303 1.8 120 .5 872 2.0 340 .5\nLoss on disposal of property and equipment — — — — 1 — — —\n(Loss) income from operations (2,601) (15.5) 496 2.3 (12,096) (27.2) 765 1.1\nInterest income 292 1.7 146 .7 679 1.5 445 .7\nInterest expense (121) (.7) (89) (.4) (346) (.8) (189) (.3)\nInterest expense-financing fees (18) (.1) (36) (.2) (47) (.1) (80) (.1)\nOther 59 .4 (17) (.01) 61 .1 (11) —\n(Loss) income from continuing operations\nbefore taxes (2,389) (14.2) 500 2.3 (11,749) (26.5) 930 1.4\nIncome tax expense 6,417 38.2 254 1.2 4,300 9.6 482 .7\n(Loss) income from continuing operations, net\nof taxes $ (8,806) (52.4) $ 246 1.1 $ (16,049) (36.1) $ 448 .7\nRevenues\nConsolidated revenues decreased $5,065,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, as follows:\n(In thousands) 2024 % Revenue 2023 % Revenue Change % Change\nTreatment\nGovernment waste $ 5,794 34.5 $ 6,692 30.6 $ (898) (13.4)\nHazardous/non-hazardous (1) 1,199 7.1 1,389 6.3 (190) (13.7)\nOther nuclear waste 2,071 12.3 2,714 12.4 (643) (23.7)\nTotal 9,064 53.9 10,795 49.3 (1,731) (16.0)\nServices\nNuclear services 6,433 38.3 9,996 45.7 (3,563) (35.6)\nTechnical services 1,315 7.8 1,086 5.0 229 21.1\nTotal 7,748 46.1 11,082 50.7 (3,334) (30.1)\nTotal $ 16,812 100.0 $ 21,877 100.0 $ (5,065) (23.2)\n(1) Includes wastes generated by government clients of $784,000 and $653,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and the corresponding period of 2023,\nrespectively.\nTreatment Segment revenue decreased by $1,731,000 or 16.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, over the same period in 2023. The overall decrease in revenue\nin the Treatment Segment was primarily due to lower waste volume as discussed in the “Overview” above. Services Segment revenue decreased by approximately $3,334,000\nor 30.1%. The decrease in revenue in the Services Segment was due to reasons as discussed in the “Overview” above.

Treatment Segment’s variable costs decreased by\napproximately $931,000 primarily due to overall lower transportation, disposal and lab costs. Treatment Segment’s overall fixed costs were higher by approximately $284,000\nresulting from the following: salaries and payroll related expenses were higher by approximately $528,000 due to higher headcount; maintenance expenses were higher by\napproximately $136,000 due to unexpected breakdowns of certain equipment which required repair/replacement as discussed in the “Overview” previously; travel expenses\nwere lower by approximately $22,000; depreciation expenses were lower by approximately $213,000 due to fully depreciated asset retirement obligations (“AROs”) that\noccurred in the third quarter of 2023 in connection with our EWOC facility; regulatory expenses were lower by approximately $41,000; and general expenses were lower by\n$104,000 in various categories. Services Segment cost of goods sold decreased $1,203,000 or 15.0% primarily due to lower revenue. The decrease in cost of goods sold was\nprimarily due to overall lower salaries/payroll related, outside services, and travel costs totaling approximately $1,379,000; lower depreciation expenses of approximately\n$44,000; lower general expenses of approximately $110,000 in various categories; and overall higher material and supplies, regulatory, disposal and lab expenses totaling\napproximately $330,000.

Services Segment gross profit decreased by $2,131,000 or 69.8% primarily due to decreased revenue as discussed in\nthe “Overview” above. The decrease in gross margin in the Services Segment from 27.6% to 11.9% was attributed to overall lower margin projects as the two large projects\ncompleted in late 2023 were higher margin projects.

In the prior year quarter, approximately $178,000 in estimated accrued\nincentive expenses were recorded in connection with the Company’s management incentive plans (“MIPs”) and other employees’ bonus plans. Treatment Segment SG&A\nexpenses were higher primarily due to higher salaries and payroll related expenses of approximately $139,000 which were offset by lower outside services expenses of $20,000\nfrom fewer consulting matters and lower general expenses of $74,000 in various categories. The decrease in Services Segment SG&A was primarily due to the following:\nsalaries and payroll related expenses were lower by approximately $65,000; outside services expenses were lower by approximately $69,000 due to fewer consulting/legal\nmatters; and overall general expenses were lower by approximately $29,000 in various categories.

Administrative SG&A expenses in the third quarter of 2023 included estimated incentives recorded in the amount of approximately $178,000 in connection\nwith the Company’s management incentive plans (“MIPs”) and other employees’ bonus plans. Such incentives were not recorded in the first nine months of 2024; outside\nservices expenses were lower by approximately $40,000 from fewer consulting/legal matters; and overall general and maintenance expenses were higher by approximately\n$71,000. Treatment Segment SG&A expenses were higher primarily due to higher salaries and payroll related expenses of approximately $332,000 which were offset by overall\nlower travel, outside services and general expenses totaling approximately $179,000. The decrease in Services Segment SG&A was primarily due to lower outside services\nexpenses of approximately $116,000 from fewer consulting and legal matters, lower salaries and payroll related expenses of approximately $203,000 and lower general\nexpenses of $25,000 in various categories. Included in SG&A expenses is depreciation and amortization expenses of $77,000 and $61,000 for the nine months ended September\n30, 2024, and 2023, respectively.\n30\nR&D\nR&D expenses increased by $183,000 and $532,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding period of 2023\nprimarily due to expenses incurred in connection with our new PFAS technology.\nInterest Income\nInterest income increased by approximately $146,000 and $234,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding\nperiod of 2023. The higher interest income for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the corresponding quarter of 2023 was primarily due to interest income earned from our\nmoney market deposit account (“MMDA”) that we maintained with our lender starting in late 2023.\nThe increase in interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period of 2023 was primarily due to higher interest income\nearned from our finite risk sinking fund from higher interest rates that took effect starting in April 2023. Additionally, the increase in interest income resulted from interest\nincome earned from our MMDA that we maintained with our lender starting in late 2023. The overall increase in interest income from the above was reduced by interest\nincome received in March of 2023 of approximately $60,000 in connection with the Employee Retention Credit refund that we received.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased by approximately $32,000 and $157,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding\nperiod of 2023. The increase for each of the periods above was attributed primarily to interest incurred on the $2,500,000 term loan dated July 31, 2023, under our credit facility\nand the promissory note that we entered into on July 24, 2024, for the purchase of our EWOC facility. The higher interest expense was also from more finance leases.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use an estimated annual effective tax rate, which is based on expected annual income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions\nin which we operate, to determine our quarterly provision for income taxes.\nWe record valuation allowances against our net deferred tax assets to the extent we determine it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized in the future. We\nregularly evaluate the probability that our deferred tax assets will be realized and determines whether valuation allowances or adjustments thereto are needed. This\ndetermination involves judgement and the use of estimates and assumptions, including expectations of future taxable income and tax planning strategies. We apply judgment to\nconsider the relative impact of negative and positive evidence, and the weight given to negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which such evidence\ncan be objectively verified. Based on our evaluation of all available positive and negative evidence, and with greater weight placed on the objectively verifiable evidence which\nincluded our substantial losses incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we determined, at the end of the third quarter, that it is more likely than not that our\nnet U.S. deferred tax assets will not be realized. As a result, we provided a full valuation allowance against our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets resulting in a recorded\nincome tax expense in the amount of approximately $6,417,000. We continue to maintain a valuation allowance against foreign tax attributes that may not be realized.\nWe had income tax expenses of $6,417,000 and $4,300,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and income tax expenses of $254,000 and\n$482,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, for our continuing operations. Our effective tax rates were approximately 268.6% and 36.6%\nfor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 50.8% and 51.8% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Our\neffective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, were primarily impacted by the full valuation allowance on our deferred assets as discussed above.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur cash flow requirements during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were primarily financed by our operations and Liquidity (defined as borrowing availability\nunder the revolving credit plus cash in our MMDA maintained with our lender) under our Credit Facility. Our cash included net proceeds received from the sale of 2,051,282\nshares our Common Stock to certain institutional and retail investors in May 2024 (see “Financing Activities” below for a discussion of this direct offering, including the\nplanned usage of the proceeds). Our cash flow requirements for the next twelve months will consist primarily of general working capital needs, scheduled principal payments\non our debt obligations, remediation projects, R&D on our PFAS technology and capital expenditures which include our PFAS technology (see “Known Trends and\nUncertainties – New Processing Technology” within this MD&A for a discussion of this technology). We plan to fund these requirements from our operations and Liquidity\nunder our Credit Facility. Our ability to utilize our Credit Facility from our lender is subject to meeting our quarterly financial covenant requirements, among other things. We\nare continually reviewing operating costs and reviewing the possibility of further reducing operating costs and non-essential expenditures to bring them in line with revenue\nlevels. At September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowing under our revolving credit and our Liquidity under our Credit Facility was approximately $13,984,000. We\nbelieve that our cash flows from operations and our Liquidity should be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months. Although we believe we should be\nprofitable in 2025, if we continue to incur losses, such may cause a reduction in our Liquidity.\n31\nThe following table reflects the cash flow activities during the first nine months of 2024\n(In thousands)\nCash used in operating activities of continuing operations $ (10,971)\nCash used in operating activities of discontinued operations (468)\nCash used in investing activities of continuing operations (2,800)\nCash used in investing activities of discontinued operations (49)\nCash provided by financing activities of continuing operations 17,805\nEffect of exchange rate changes in cash 1\nIncrease in cash and finite risk sinking fund (restricted cash) $ 3,518\nAs of September 30, 2024, we were in a positive cash position with no revolving credit balance. At September 30, 2024, we had cash on hand of approximately $10,567,000.\nOperating Activities\nAccounts receivable, net of credit losses, totaled $8,741,000 as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of $981,000 from the December 31, 2023, balance of $9,722,000. The\ndecrease was attributed to reduced billing from decreased revenues which were negatively impacted by a number of events as previously discussed (See “Overview” within this\nMD&A). Our accounts receivable was also reduced by the collection in May 2024 of outstanding accounts receivable for work performed for a certain Canadian project for\nwhich a settlement agreement was reached, with collection subject to meeting certain conditions/terms precedent (see “Perma-Fix Canada Inc. (“PF Canada”)”) below for a\ndiscussion on the collection of the receivables).\nAccounts payable totaled $7,675,000 as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of $1,907,000 from the December 31, 2023, balance of $9,582,000. The decrease in accounts\npayable was attributed to our overall reduced operations as discussed previously. Additionally, our accounts payable are impacted by the timing of payments as we are\ncontinually managing payment terms with our vendors to maximize our cash position throughout our segments.\nWe had working capital of $9,424,000 (which included working capital of our discontinued operations) as of September 30, 2024, as compared to working capital of\n$4,613,000 as of December 31, 2023. The improvement in our in our working capital was primarily due to the increase in our cash from the sale of our Common Stock (see\n“Financing Activities” below for a discussion of this direct offering, including the planned usage of the proceeds) which was offset by the significant losses incurred from our\nresults of operations attributed to the various factors as previously discussed.\nInvesting Activities\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our purchases of capital equipment totaled approximately $2,630,000, of which $406,000 was subject to financing, with the\nremaining funded from cash from operations, cash from the equity raise that we completed in May 2024 and our Credit Facility. We budgeted approximately $2,000,000 for\n2024 capital expenditures for our Treatment and Services Segments to maintain operations and regulatory compliance requirements and support revenue growth. Our capital\nexpenditures for 2024 also included additional expenditures made to support our PFAS initiatives from cash from our equity raise completed in May 2024. Certain of our 2024\nbudgeted projects may either be delayed until later years or deferred altogether. We plan to fund our capital expenditures from cash from operations, Liquidity under our Credit\nFacility and/or financing. The initiation and timing of projects are also determined by financing alternatives or funds available for such capital projects.\nOn July 24, 2024, the Company purchased the property which its EWOC facility operates on pursuant to a Purchase and Sales Agreement for a purchase price of $425,000. In\nconnection with this transaction, we paid $63,750 in cash and financed the remaining $361,250 of the purchase price with a bank (“see Financing Activities” below for a\ndiscussion of the Note and its terms).\n32\nFinancing Activities\nWe entered into a Second Amended and Restated Revolving Credit, Term Loan and Security Agreement, dated May 8, 2020, which has since been amended from time to time,\nwith PNC National Association (“PNC” and “lender”), acting as agent and lender (the “Loan Agreement”). The Loan Agreement provides us with the following credit facility\nwith a maturity date of May 15, 2027 (the “Credit Facility): (a) up to $12,500,000 revolving credit (“revolving credit”), which borrowing capacity is subject to eligible\nreceivables (as defined) and reduced by outstanding standby letters of credit ($3,950,000 as of September 30, 2024) and borrowing reductions that our lender may impose from\ntime to time ($750,000 as of September 30, 2024); (b) a term loan (“Term Loan 1”) of approximately $1,742,000, requiring monthly installments of $35,547 (Term Loan 1 was\npaid off by us in June 2024); (c) a term loan (“Term Loan 2”) of $2,500,000, requiring monthly installments of $41,667; and (d) a capital expenditure line (“Capital Line”) of\nup to $1,000,000 with advances on the line, subject to certain limitations, permitted for up to twelve months starting May 4, 2021 (the “Borrowing Period”). Amounts advanced\nunder the Capital Line at the end of the Borrowing Period totaled approximately $524,000, requiring monthly installments of principal of approximately $8,700 plus interest,\ncommencing June 1, 2022.\nPursuant to our Loan Agreement, payments of annual interest rates are as follows: (i) interest due on the revolving credit is at prime (8.00% at September 30, 2024) plus 2% or\nSOFR (as defined in the Loan Agreement, as amended) plus 3.00% plus an SOFR Adjustment applicable for an interest period selected by us; (ii) interest due on each Term\nLoan 1 and the Capital Line was/is at prime plus 2.50% or SOFR plus 3.50% plus an SOFR Adjustment applicable for an interest period selected by us; and (iii) interest due on\nTerm Loan 2 is at prime plus 3% or SOFR plus 4.00% plus an SOFR Adjustment applicable for an interest period selected by us. SOFR Adjustment rates of 0.10% and 0.15%\nare applicable for a one-month interest period and three-month period, respectively, that may be selected by us.\nWe agreed to pay PNC 0.5% of the total financing if we pay off our obligations under our Loan Agreement to our lender after July 31, 2024, to and including July 31, 2025. No\nearly termination fee shall apply if we pays off our obligations under Loan Agreement after July 31, 2025.\nOn May 8, 2024, we entered into an amendment to our Loan Agreement with our lender which provided the following, among other things:\n● removed the quarterly FCCR testing requirement for the first and second quarters of 2024;\n● reinstated the quarterly FCCR testing requirement starting in the third quarter of 2024 and revised the methodology to be used in calculating the FCCR as follows\n(with no change to the minimum 1.15:1 ratio requirement): FCCR for the third quarter is to be determined based on financial results for the three-months period\nending September 30, 2024; FCCR for the fourth quarter is to be determined based on financial results for the six-months period ending December 31, 2024; FCCR for\nthe first quarter of 2025 is to be determined based on financial results for the nine-months period ending March 31, 2025; and FCCR for the second quarter of 2025\nand each fiscal quarter thereafter is to be determined based on financial results for a trailing twelve-months period ending basis;\n● required maintenance of a daily minimum of $2,250,000 in Liquidity under our Credit Facility through June 29, 2024, (which was met by us) and a minimum of daily\n$3,000,000 in Liquidity starting June 30, 2024, through June 29, 2025 (which we have met to date); and\n● in the event we are able to achieve the minimum quarterly FCCR requirement utilizing our financial results based on a trailing twelve-months period starting with the\nquarter ending June 30, 2024 (which we have not been able to achieve as of September 30, 2024), the maintenance of a daily minimum Liquidity requirement of\n$3,000,000 as discussed above will be removed. Any subsequent fiscal quarter testing of the FCCR will revert back to a trailing twelve-months period method.\nIn connection with the amendment, we paid our lender a fee of $25,000 which is being amortized over the remaining term of the Loan Agreement as interest expense-financing\nfees.\n33\nOn November 12, 2024, we entered into an amendment to our Loan Agreement, as amended, with our lender which provided the following, among other things:\n● removes the quarterly FCCR testing requirement for the third quarter of 2024;\n● reinstates the quarterly FCCR testing requirement starting in the fourth quarter of 2024 and revises the methodology to be used in calculating the FCCR as follows\n(with no change to the minimum 1.15:1 ratio requirement): FCCR for the fourth quarter is to be determined based on financial results for the three-months period\nending December 31, 2024; FCCR for the first quarter of 2025 is to be determined based on financial results for the six-months period ending March 31, 2025; FCCR\nfor the second quarter of 2025 is to be determined based on financial results for the nine-months period ending June 30, 2025; and FCCR for the third quarter of 2025\nand each fiscal quarter thereafter is to be determined based on financial results for a trailing twelve-months period ending basis;\n● extends the required maintenance of a daily minimum of $3,000,000 in Liquidity from the ending date of June 29, 2025 (and including) to September 29, 2025 (and\nincluding); and\n● in the event the we are able to achieve our minimum quarterly FCCR requirement utilizing our financial results based on a trailing twelve-months period starting with\nthe quarter ended September 30, 2024, the maintenance of a daily minimum Liquidity requirement of $3,000,000 as discussed above will be removed. Any subsequent\nfiscal quarter testing of the FCCR will revert back to a trailing twelve-months period method.\nIn connection with the amendment, we paid our lender a fee of $12,500.\nOur Credit Facility under our Loan Agreement with PNC contains certain financial covenants, along with customary representations and warranties. A breach of any of these\nfinancial covenants, unless waived by PNC, could result in a default under our Credit Facility allowing our lender to immediately require the repayment of all outstanding debt\nunder our Credit Facility and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. We were not required to perform testing of our FCCR requirement for the first and second\nquarters of 2024 pursuant to the amendment dated May 8, 2024, to our Loan Agreement as discussed above. We were also not required to perform testing of our FCCR\nrequirement for the third quarter of 2024 pursuant to the amendment dated November 12, 2024, to our Loan Agreement, as amended, as discussed above. Otherwise, we met all\nof our other financial covenant requirements in each of the first three quarters of 2024. We expect to meet our quarterly financial covenant requirements for the next twelve\nmonths.\nOn May 21, 2024, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”) with certain institutional and retail investors (the “Purchasers”),\npursuant to which we sold and issued, in a registered direct offering, an aggregate of 2,051,282 shares of the Company’s Common Stock, at a negotiated purchase price per\nshare of $9.75 (the “Shares”), for aggregate gross proceeds to us of approximately $20,000,000, before deducting fees payable to the placement agents and other estimated\noffering expenses payable by the Company (the “Offering”). The net proceeds from the Offering is to fund (i) continued R&D and business development relating to the\nCompany’s patent-pending process for the destruction of PFAS, as well as the cost of installing at least one commercial treatment unit; (ii) ongoing facility capital expenditures\nand maintenance costs; and (iii) general corporate and working capital purposes.\nThe Shares were offered and sold by us pursuant to the our “shelf” registration statement on Form S-3 and prospectus supplement relating thereto.\n34\nCraig-Hallum Capital Group LLC (“Craig-Hallum”) and Wellington Shields & Co. LLC (“Wellington Shields”) (Wellington Shields and Craig-Hallum together are known as\nthe “Placement Agents”) served as the exclusive placement agents in connection with the Offering. We paid the Placement Agents a total cash fee of 6.00% of the aggregate\ngross proceeds in the Offering, which totaled approximately $1,200,000. We also reimbursed the Placement Agents certain expenses in connection with the Offering in an\naggregate amount of approximately $80,000. As additional compensation to the Placement Agents in connection with the Offering, we also issued to the Placement Agents and\ntwo (2) of their members designees, warrants (the “Placement Agents’ Warrants”) to purchase an aggregate of 61,538 shares of Common Stock (the “Warrant Shares”), with the\naggregate number of Warrant Shares that may be acquired under the Placement Agents’ Warrants equal to 3.0% of the number of Shares sold in the registered direct offering, at\nan exercise price per share equal to $12.19, which is equal to approximately 125% of the price per share of the Shares sold in the Offering. Neither the Placement Agents’\nWarrants nor the Warrant Shares have been registered under the Registration Statement or otherwise. The Placement Agents’ Warrants have a term of five years, are exercisable\nat any time and from time to time, in whole or in part, during the four and one-half (4 ½) year period commencing 180 days from the last date of closing of the Offering which\nwas May 24, 2024, and are exercisable via “cashless exercise” in certain circumstances. The aggregate fair value of the “Placement Agents’ Warrants” was determined to be\napproximately $331,000 using the Black-Scholes pricing model with the following assumptions: 58.78% volatility, risk free interest rate of 4.53%, an expected life of five years\nand no dividend. The aggregate fair market value of the Placement Agent’s Warrants was recorded as an offset to gross proceeds of the Offering and an increase to additional-\npaid-in capital.\nAfter deducting costs incurred of approximately $1,544,000 (exclusive of the aggregate fair market value of the Placement Agents’ Warrants as discussed above) which were\nrecorded as a deduction to equity in connection with the Offering, net cash proceeds to us totaled approximately $18,456,000. We have paid approximately $1,505,000 of the\n$1,544,000 costs incurred in connection with the Offering.\nOn July 24, 2024, We purchased the property which our EWOC facility operates on pursuant to a Purchase and Sales Agreement dated April 30, 2024, for a purchase price of\n$425,000. We paid $63,750 in cash and entered into a promissory note dated July 24, 2024, in an amount of $361,250 with a bank (the “lender”) for the remaining balance of\nthe purchase price, with a maturity date in twenty years or July 24, 2044 (the “Note”). For the first five years starting August 24, 2024, monthly payments under the Note will\nconsists of approximately $3,100 which include an annual fixed interest rate of 8.10%. Monthly payments under the Note will then be adjusted at the end of years five, ten and\nfifteen, with interest calculated based on the weekly average five-year US Treasury Securities Rate plus 3.0%. Under no circumstances will the variable interest rate on the Note\nbe less than 4.0% per annum or more than (except in the case of default) the lesser of 20.5% per annum or the maximum rate allowed by applicable law. We agreed to pay the\nlender 3.0% of the total outstanding principal balance under the Note in the event we pays off our obligations during the first year of the Note. The prepayment penalty rate will\nbe reduced by 1.0% at each subsequent annual anniversary of the Note. No prepayment penalty will apply in the event we pay off the Note on the fourth anniversary of the Note\nor thereafter. The property was previously accounted for under our operating leases.\nPerma-Fix Canada Inc. (“PF Canada”)\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, PF Canada received a Notice of Termination (“NOT”) from Canadian Nuclear Laboratories, LTD. (“CNL”) on a Task Order Agreement\n(“TOA”) that PF Canada entered into with CNL in May 2019 for remediation work within Ontario, Canada (“Agreement”). The NOT was received after work under the TOA\nwas substantially completed and work under the TOA has since been completed. CNL may terminate the TOA at any time for convenience. At year-end 2023, PF Canada had\napproximately $2,389,000 in outstanding receivables due from CNL as a result of work performed under the TOA. A settlement agreement was reached between PF Canada and\nCNL on the payment of the aforementioned amount by CNL, subject to certain conditions/terms precedents being met. PF Canada received a partial payment from CNL of the\noutstanding receivables during the first quarter of 2024. In May 2024, PF Canada received the remaining approximately $1,612,000 in outstanding receivables from CNL. As a\nresult of the aforementioned payments received from CNL, no outstanding receivables remain under the TOA from CNL.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nFrom time to time, we are required to post standby letters of credit and various bonds to support contractual obligations to customers and other obligations, including facility\nclosures. At September 30, 2024, the total amount of standby letters of credit outstanding totaled approximately $3,950,000 and the total amount of bonds outstanding totaled\napproximately $20,568,000. We also provide closure and post-closure requirements through a financial assurance policy for certain of our Treatment Segment facilities through\nAIG. At September 30, 2024, the closure and post-closure requirements for these facilities were approximately $23,379,000.\n35\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThere were no significant changes in our accounting policies or critical accounting estimates that are discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee “Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” for the recent accounting pronouncement that will\nbe adopted in future periods.\nKnown Trends and Uncertainties\nSignificant Customers. The contracts that we are a party to with others as subcontractors to the U.S government or directly with the U.S government generally provide that the\ngovernment may terminate the contract at any time for convenience at the government’s option. Our inability to continue under existing contracts that we have with U.S.\ngovernment authorities (directly or indirectly as a subcontractor) or significant reductions in the level of governmental funding in any given year could have a material adverse\nimpact on our operations and financial condition. We performed services relating to waste generated by U.S government clients, either directly as a prime contractor or\nindirectly for others as a subcontractor to U.S. government entities, representing approximately $11,749,000 or 69.9% and $31,748,000 or 71.5% of our total revenues\ngenerated during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to 14,923,000 or 68.2% and $52,270,000 or 78.0% of our total revenues\ngenerated during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Our partnership’s Italian contract may be terminated by the Contracting Authority under\ncertain conditions as set forth in the contract. The scope of work to be performed in the initial phases of the Italian contract will be performed predominately by our JV partner.\nRevenue generated by the Company under the initial phases of the Italian contract will be limited to project management support through 2025 and is not material to date. The\nCompany expects to generate an increase in revenue under the Italian contract starting in 2026 when the waste treatment phases begin.\nPotential U.S Government Shutdown. As discussed above, a significant portion of our revenue is generated through contracts entered into indirectly as subcontractors for others\nwho are prime contractors or directly as the prime contractor to U.S. government authorities. In September 2024, a CR was enacted by Congress to avoid a U.S. government\nshutdown and provide temporary funding for government operations through December 20, 2024. If Congress in unable to enact FY 2025 appropriation bills by the deadline of\nDecember 20, 2024, or extend the CR, the U.S. government could enter into shutdown. In the past, even with the enactment of a CR by Congress, there were instances in which\ncertain of our government clients delayed procurement, waste shipments and project starts due to uncertain budget projections. The full impact of any government shutdown or\nfurther CR is uncertain and could negatively impact our financial results by delays in procurement actions, contract awards, waste shipments and/or project starts.\nNew Processing Technology. We have completed the fabrication, installation, commissioning and startup of our first full scale commercial Perma-FAS system (“System”) for\nPFAS (commonly known as “forever chemicals”) destruction at our Perma-Fix Florida, Inc. facility. Our System and patent-pending technology successfully processed\ncommercial PFAS-containing waste materials. There are limited current treatment options for these materials, and we expect that our process will exceed any of these methods.\nSome of the sizable markets for PFAS include AFFF (aqueous film-forming foam) firefighting foams, both expired concentrate and flushing liquids, contaminated liquids from\nPFAS systems, and other water-based separation products from a variety of industrial systems. We have already secured approximately 6,000 gallons of AFFF liquids to support\nongoing operations and demonstration, and we believe that we will receive an additional 20,000 gallons in the coming months.\n36\nOur strategy for our System includes continued treatment of PFAS liquids over the coming months and targeting engineering refinements to support larger-scale Systems. By\nmid-2025, we expect to advance this technology into pilot-scale applications for soil, biosolids, and filter media, broadening the reach of our System’s destruction capabilities.\nEnvironmental Contingencies\nWe are engaged in the waste management services segment of the pollution control industry. As a participant in the on-site treatment, storage and disposal market and the off-\nsite treatment and services market, we are subject to rigorous federal, state and local regulations. These regulations mandate strict compliance and therefore are a cost and\nconcern to us. Because of their integral role in providing quality environmental services, we make every reasonable attempt to maintain complete compliance with these\nregulations; however, even with a diligent commitment, we, along with many of our competitors, may be required to pay fines for violations or investigate and potentially\nremediate our waste management facilities.\nWe routinely use third party disposal companies, who ultimately destroy, or secure landfill residual materials generated at our facilities or at a client’s site. In the past, numerous\nthird-party disposal sites have improperly managed waste and consequently require remedial action; consequently, any party utilizing these sites may be liable for some or all of\nthe remedial costs. Despite our aggressive compliance and auditing procedures for disposal of wastes, we could further be notified, in the future, that we are a PRP at a remedial\naction site, which could have a material adverse effect.\nWe have three environmental remediation projects, all within our discontinued operations, which principally entail the removal/remediation of contaminated soil, and, in most\ncases, the remediation of surrounding ground water. We expect to fund the expenses to remediate these sites from funds generated from operations. As of September 30, 2024,\nwe had total accrued environmental remediation liabilities of $767,000, a decrease of approximately $78,000 from the December 31, 2023, balance of $845,000. The decrease\nrepresents payments for remediation projects. At September 30, 2024, $1,000 of the total accrued environmental liabilities was recorded as current.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks\nNot required for smaller reporting companies.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\n(a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities\nand Exchange Commission and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management. As of the end of the period covered by this report,\nwe carried out an evaluation with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer. Based on this recent assessment, our\nPrincipal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-\n15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) were not effective as of September 30, 2024, due to the material weakness in internal control over\nfinancial reporting described below.\nMaterial Weakness\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a\nmaterial misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In the period ended September 30, 2024,\nmanagement identified a material weakness related to the precision level needed in order to properly evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on our U.S.\ndeferred tax assets. This material weakness resulted in an income tax valuation adjustment recorded during the quarter. The necessary level of precision was not\napplied when evaluating the need for a valuation allowance. The error was corrected by management in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of\nSeptember 30, 2024, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The material weakness noted did not result in a material misstatement in our\npreviously issued financial statements, nor in the financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nManagement’s Plan to Remediate the Material Weakness\nOur management is committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment. As it relates to the material weakness identified, we have enhanced our\nmanagement and precision level of review control activities in order to evaluate the income tax valuation allowance in subsequent reporting periods. In addition, if\ndeemed necessary, we will retain a third-party specialist to review management’s valuation allowance conclusions.\n(b) Changes in internal control over financial reporting.\nOther than the identification of the material weakness and the related remediation plan described above, there have been no changes in our internal control over\nfinancial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially\naffected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n37\nPART II – OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nThere are no material legal proceedings pending against us and/or our subsidiaries not previously reported by us in Item 3 of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,\n2023. Additionally, there has been no other material change in legal proceedings previously disclosed by us in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nThere is no other material change from the risk factors previously disclosed in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended\nMarch 31, 2024, except as follows:\nThe following additional Risk Factor under “Risks Relating to our Business and Operations” is as follows:\nWe have sustained losses during 2024.\nThe Company sustained substantial losses during the first nine months of 2024. We believe that our results of operations should substantially improve in 2025. If, however, we\nfail to become profitable on an annualized basis in the foreseeable future, this could have a material adverse effect on our operations, credit facility, liquidity and potential\ngrowth.\nThe following additional Risk Factor under “General Risk Factors” is as follows:\nFailure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or failure to remediate a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and stock price.\nMaintaining effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and is important in helping to prevent financial fraud. If\nwe are unable to maintain adequate internal controls, our business and operating results could be harmed. We are required to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of Sarbanes\nOxley and the related rules of the Commission, which require, among other things, management to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nIn the period ended September 30, 2024, management identified a material weakness related to the precision level needed in order to properly evaluate the need for a valuation\nallowance on its U.S. deferred tax assets. This material weakness resulted in an income tax valuation adjustment recorded during the quarter. The necessary level of precision\nwas not applied when evaluating the need for a valuation allowance. The error was corrected by management in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of\nSeptember 30, 2024, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The material weakness noted did not result in a material misstatement in our previously\nissued financial statements, nor in the financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We have implemented a plan to remediate this material weakness.\nIf we are unable to maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting and/or remediate any material weakness identified, there is a reasonable possibility that a\nmisstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected in a timely manner. If we cannot produce reliable financial reports, investors could\nlose confidence in our reported financial information, the market price of our Common Stock could decline significantly, and our business, financial condition, and reputation\ncould be harmed.\nItem 6.

(NASDAQ: PESI)** (the “Company”) today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and provided a business update.\n\nMark Duff, President and CEO of the Company, commented, “During the third quarter, we continued to experience temporary weakness, partly due to ongoing delays in service starts and waste shipments. Additionally, our Florida facility was impacted by Hurricane Helene, resulting in extended power outages and required repairs, which have since been completed. In light of the headwinds we faced in 2024, we reduced expenses and streamlined operations outside of R&D, which should result in improved profitability going forward. Moreover, performance within our Services Segment and across our treatment plants has steadily improved in the latter part of the quarter, which we anticipate should continue into Q4. In addition, an agency of the federal government recently announced that we were part of a winning team awarded a service project over a 10-year period. While we cannot provide specifics at this time, we plan to provide specifics about this award as soon as practical.”\n\n“Last week, we announced the successful startup of our first commercial Perma-FAS system for PFAS (Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances) destruction at our Florida facility. We are extremely pleased with the performance of this unit, and feedback from existing and prospective customers has been highly encouraging. We have already secured approximately 6,000 gallons of AFFF (Aqueous Film Forming Foam) liquids and anticipate receiving an additional 20,000 gallons in the coming months. We are also working to expand this technology into additional applications, including Granular Activated Carbon (GAC), biosolids, and soils.”\n\n“Finally, we look forward to providing critical services to the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Hanford tank remediation mission, including the treatment of effluent following the commissioning of the Direct Feed Low-Activity Waste (DFLAW) facility, which is currently anticipated to begin in the summer of 2025. We believe these programs will represent opportunities for Perma-Fix over the coming years.”\n\nThe Company also notes that its net loss for the third quarter of 2024 included a non-cash tax expense recorded in the amount of approximately $6.4 million as the Company provided for a full valuation allowance against its U.S deferred tax assets.\n\n**Financial Results** Revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was $16.8 million versus $21.9 million for the same period last year. Revenue for the Treatment Segment decreased to approximately $9.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from $10.8 million for the corresponding period of 2023. The decrease was attributed to a number of factors which included: waste shipments that were expected in the third quarter of 2024 were unexpectedly pushed into the fourth quarter of 2024 by certain customers; waste shipment delays by certain customers and reduced revenue production due to temporary shutdown of our Florida facility from the impact of Hurricane Helene; and delay in revenue projection due to equipment breakdowns in certain of our facilities which required replacement or repair. All the equipment is now back in service. The acceleration in investment of our PFAS technology, which included the installation of our first full scale commercial system, continues to require significant management and operation support which contributed to revenue production delays. Revenue for the Services Segment decreased to approximately $7.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from $11.1 million for the corresponding period of 2023. The decrease in revenue in the Services Segment was attributed partly to the temporary demobilization of a project that was mandated by the customer due to Hurricane Helene. Additionally, the decrease in revenue in the Services Segment was due, in part to the completion of two large projects in late 2023 which were not replaced by new projects with similar value. These two completed projects together generated significant amount of revenue in the third quarter of 2023 when they were in full operational status.\n\nGross profit for the third quarter of 2024 was $1.3 million versus $4.5 million for the third quarter of 2023. The overall decrease in gross profit was primarily attributed to lower revenue generated in both segments as discussed above. Overall gross margin for the third quarter of 2024 was approximately 7.9% versus 20.8% for the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to decreases in revenue in both segments, overall lower margin projects and the impact of our fixed cost structure.\n\nOperating loss was approximately $2.6 million in the third quarter of 2024 versus operating income of $496,000 for the third quarter of 2023. Net loss for the third quarter of 2024 was approximately $9.0 million or ($0.57) per basic share as compared to net income of approximately $341,000 for the third quarter of 2023 or $0.03 per basic share. As noted above, net loss for the third quarter of 2024 included a non-cash tax expense recorded in the amount of approximately $6.4 million as the Company provided for a full valuation allowance against its U.S deferred tax assets.\n\nThe Company reported EBITDA of ($2.1) million from continuing operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as compared to EBITDA of $1.2 million from continuing operations for the same period of 2023. The Company defines EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”), and should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, earnings as an indicator of operating performance or cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. The Company believes the presentation of EBITDA is relevant and useful by enhancing the readers’ ability to understand the Company’s operating performance. The Company’s management utilizes EBITDA as a mean to measure performance. The Company’s measurement of EBITDA may not be comparable to similar titled measures reported by other companies. The table below reconciles EBITDA, a non-GAAP measures, to GAAP numbers for (loss) income from continuing operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023.\n\n(Unaudited) | (Unaudited)  \n---|---  \nThree Months Ended | Nine Months Ended  \nSeptember 30, | September 30,  \n(In thousands) |  2024  |  2023  |  2024  |  2023   \n(Loss) income from continuing operations | $ | (8,806 | ) | $ | 246 | $ | (16,049 | ) | $ | 448  \nAdjustments:  \nDepreciation & amortization | 433 | 686 | 1,295 | 2,124  \nInterest income | (292 | ) | (146 | ) | (679 | ) | (445 | )  \nInterest expense | 121 | 89 | 346 | 189  \nInterest expense - financing fees | 18 | 36 | 47 | 80  \nIncome tax expense | 6,417 | 254 | 4,300 | 482  \nEBITDA | $ | (2,109 | ) | $ | 1,165 | $ | (10,740 | ) | $ | 2,878  \n  \nThe tables below present certain unaudited financial information for the business segments, which excludes allocation of corporate expenses.\n\nThree Months Ended | Nine Months Ended  \n---|---  \nSeptember 30, 2024 | September 30, 2024  \n(Unaudited) | (Unaudited)  \n(In thousands) | Treatment | Services | Treatment | Services  \nNet revenues | $ | 9,064 | $ | 7,748 | $ | 26,116 | $ | 18,299  \nGross profit (loss) | 410 | 924 | (839 | ) | 247  \nSegment loss | (4,902 | ) | (2,294 | ) | (7,416 | ) | (3,713 | )  \nThree Months Ended | Nine Months Ended  \n---|---  \nSeptember 30, 2023 | September 30, 2023  \n(Unaudited) | (Unaudited)  \n(In thousands) | Treatment | Services | Treatment | Services  \nNet revenues | $ | 10,795 | $ | 11,082 | $ | 33,223 | $ | 33,793  \nGross profit | 1,494 | 3,055 | 5,237 | 6,837  \nSegment profit | 1,014 | 1,120 | 2,619 | 2,933  \n  \n**Conference Call**\n\nPerma-Fix will host a conference call at 11:00 a.m. ET on Wednesday, November 13, 2024.

ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES, INC.**\n\n**Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\n**September 30, 2024**\n\n**(Unaudited)**\n\n**1.** **Basis of Presentation**\n\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared by the Company (which may be referred to as we, us or our), without an audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”). Certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although the Company believes the disclosures which are made are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. Further, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position and results of operations as of and for the periods indicated. The results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024.\n\nThese condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our wholly-owned subsidiaries.\n\n**Reclassification**\n\nCertain amounts in the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the prior period have been reclassified to conform with current presentation. The reclassifications had no effect on the condensed consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and stockholders’ equity.\n\n**2.** **Summary of Significant Accounting Policies**\n\nOur accounting policies are as set forth in the notes to the December 31, 2023, consolidated financial statements referred to above.\n\n**Recently Issued Accounting Standards – Not Yet Adopted**\n\nIn August 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-05, “Business Combinations—Joint Venture Formations (Subtopic 805-60): Recognition and Initial Measurement.” ASU 2023-05 applies to the formation of a “joint venture” or a “corporate joint venture” and requires a joint venture to initially measure all contributions received upon its formation at fair value. The guidance does not impact accounting by the venturers. The new guidance is applicable to joint venture entities with a formation date on or after January 1, 2025, on a prospective basis. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures,” which expands reportable segment disclosure requirements by requiring disclosures of significant reportable segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) and included within each reported measure of a segment’s profit or loss. The ASU also requires disclosure of the title and position of the individual identified as the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measures of a segment’s profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. Additionally, ASU 2023-07 requires all segment profit or loss and assets disclosures to be provided on an annual and interim basis. The amendments in this ASU are required to be adopted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted, and should be applied on a retrospective basis. ASU 2023-07 will be effective for the Company’s financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024. This ASU will not have impact on the Company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations. The Company is evaluating the impact to the related segment reporting disclosures.\n\n8  \n---  \n  \nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures,” which modifies the rules on income tax disclosures to require entities to disclose (1) specific categories in the rate reconciliation, (2) the income or loss from continuing operations before income tax expense or benefit (separated between domestic and foreign) and (3) income tax expense or benefit from continuing operations (separated by federal, state and foreign). ASU 2023-09 also requires entities to disclose their income tax payments to international, federal, state and local jurisdictions, among other changes. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. ASU 2023-09 should be applied on a prospective basis, but retrospective application is permitted. This ASU will not have impact on the Company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations. The Company is evaluating the impact to its income taxes reporting disclosures.\n\n**3.** **Revenue**\n\n**Disaggregation of Revenue**\n\nIn general, the Company’s business segmentation is aligned according to the nature and economic characteristics of our services and provides meaningful disaggregation of each business segment’s results of operations. The nature of the Company’s performance obligations within our Treatment and Services Segments result in the recognition of our revenue primarily over time. The following tables present further disaggregation of our revenues by different categories for our Services and Treatment Segments:\n\nSchedule of Disaggregation of Revenue\n\nRevenue by Contract Type  \n---  \n(In thousands) | Three Months Ended | Three Months Ended  \nSeptember 30, 2024 | September 30, 2023  \nTreatment | Services | Total | Treatment | Services | Total  \nFixed price | $| 9,064 | $| 6,396 | $| 15,460 | $| 10,795 | $| 10,188 | $| 20,983  \nTime and materials | — | 1,352 | 1,352 | — | 894 | 894  \nTotal | $| 9,064 | $| 7,748 | $| 16,812 | $| 10,795 | $| 11,082 | $| 21,877  \nRevenue by Contract Type  \n---  \n(In thousands) | Nine Months Ended | Nine Months Ended  \nSeptember 30, 2024 | September 30, 2023  \nTreatment | Services | Total | Treatment | Services | Total  \nFixed price | $| 26,116 | $| 15,405 | $| 41,521 | $| 33,223 | $| 29,995 | $| 63,218  \nTime and materials | — | 2,894 | 2,894 | — | 3,798 | 3,798  \nTotal | $| 26,116 | $| 18,299 | $| 44,415 | $| 33,223 | $| 33,793 | $| 67,016  \n  \n9  \n---  \n  \nRevenue by generator  \n---  \n(In thousands) | Three Months Ended | Three Months Ended  \nSeptember 30, 2024 | September 30, 2023  \nTreatment | Services | Total | Treatment | Services | Total  \nDomestic government | $| 6,578 | $| 7,346 | $| 13,924 | $| 7,095 | $| 8,444 | $| 15,539  \nDomestic commercial | 2,229 | 312 | 2,541 | 3,450 | 2,170 | 5,620  \nForeign government | — | 65 | 65 | 250 | 445 | 695  \nForeign commercial | 257 | 25 | 282 | — | 23 | 23  \nTotal | $| 9,064 | $| 7,748 | $| 16,812 | $| 10,795 | $| 11,082 | $| 21,877  \nRevenue by generator  \n---  \n(In thousands) | Nine Months Ended | Nine Months Ended  \nSeptember 30, 2024 | September 30, 2023  \nTreatment | Services | Total | Treatment | Services | Total  \nDomestic government | $| 18,997 | $| 17,129 | $| 36,126 | $| 24,160 | $| 29,603 | $| 53,763  \nDomestic commercial | 6,045 | 867 | 6,912 | 7,925 | 3,509 | 11,434  \nForeign government | 1 | 232 | 233 | 1,002 | 615 | 1,617  \nForeign commercial | 1,073 | 71 | 1,144 | 136 | 66 | 202  \nTotal | $| 26,116 | $| 18,299 | $| 44,415 | $| 33,223 | $| 33,793 | $| 67,016  \n  \n**Contract Balances**\n\nThe timing of revenue recognition and billings can result in unbilled receivables (contract assets) or deferred revenue (contract liabilities). The following table represents changes in our contract asset and contract liabilities balances for the periods noted: The reduction in deferred revenue from December 31, 2023, to September 30, 2024, was primarily due to the substantial completion of a waste treatment project for a certain customer in which a prepayment was made to the Company by the customer in 2023.\n\nSchedule of Contract Balances\n\n(In thousands) | September 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023 | Change ($) | Change (%)  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nContract assets  \nUnbilled receivables - current | $| 7,277 | $| 8,432 | $| (1,155| ) | -14| %  \nContract liabilities  \nDeferred revenue | $| 5,398 | $| 6,815 | $| (1,417| ) | -20.8| %  \n(In thousands) | September 30, 2023 | December 31, 2022 | Change ($) | Change (%)  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nContract assets  \nUnbilled receivables - current | $| 9,336 | $| 6,062 | $| 3,274 | 54.0| %  \nContract liabilities  \nDeferred revenue | $| 7,765 | $| 4,813 | $| 2,952 | 61.3| %  \n  \nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized revenue of $677,000 and $5,596,000, respectively, related to untreated waste that was in the Company’s control as of the beginning of the year. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized revenue of $842,000 and $6,289,000, respectively, related to untreated waste that was in the Company’s control as of the beginning of the year. All revenue recognized in each period related to performance obligations satisfied within the respective period.\n\n**Accounts Receivable**\n\nThe following table represents changes in accounts receivable, net of credit losses, for the periods noted:\n\nSchedule of Changes in Accounts Receivable, Net of Credit Losses\n\n(In thousands) | September 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023 | Change ($) | Change (%)  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nAccounts Receivable (net) | $| 8,741 | $| 9,722 | $| (981| ) | -10.1| %  \nSeptember 30, 2023 | December 31, 2022 | Change ($) | Change (%)  \n---|---|---|---  \nAccounts Receivable (net) | $| 15,342 | $| 9,364 | $| 5,978 | 63.8| %  \n  \nThe decrease from December 31, 2023, to September 30, 2024, was primarily due to reduced billing from decreased revenues. The decrease in accounts receivable was also attributed to the collection by May 2024 of outstanding accounts receivable for work performed for a certain Canadian project for which a settlement agreement was reached, with collection subject to meeting certain conditions/terms. (see “Note 11 - Perma-Fix Canada Inc. (“PF Canada”)”) for a discussion on the collection of the receivables).\n\n**Remaining Performance Obligations**\n\nThe Company applies the practical expedient in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606-10-50-14 and does not disclose information about remaining performance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less.\n\nWithin our Services Segment, there are service contracts which provide that the Company has a right to consideration from a customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of our performance completed to date. For those contracts, the Company has utilized the practical expedient in ASC 606-10-55-18, which allows the Company to recognize revenue in the amount for which we have the right to invoice; accordingly, the Company does not disclose the value of remaining performance obligations for those contracts.\n\nThe Company’s contracts and subcontracts relating to activities at governmental sites generally allow for termination for convenience at any time at the government’s option without payment of a substantial penalty. The Company does not disclose remaining performance obligations on these contracts.\n\n10  \n---  \n  \n**4.** **Leases**\n\nAt the inception of an arrangement, the Company determines if an arrangement is, or contains, a lease based on facts and circumstances present in that arrangement. Lease classifications, recognition, and measurement are then determined at the lease commencement date.\n\nThe Company’s operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and operating lease liabilities include primarily leases for office and warehouse spaces used to conduct our business. The Company’s operating leases also previously included the lease of a building with land where its Oak Ridge Environmental Waste Operations (“EWOC”) facility conducts its waste treatment operations. In July 2024, the Company completed the purchase of the EWOC property under the lease purchase option (see “Note 8 – Long Term Debt” for a discussion of the purchase of this property by the Company). Finance leases consist primarily of processing equipment and vehicles/trucks used by our facilities’ operations.\n\nThe components of lease cost for the Company’s leases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 were as follows (in thousands):\n\nSchedule of Components of Lease Cost\n\nThree Months Ended | Nine Months Ended  \n---|---  \nSeptember 30, | September 30,  \n2024

Diluted (loss) income per share is based on the weighted-average number of outstanding common shares plus the weighted-average number of potential outstanding common shares. In periods where they are anti-dilutive, such amounts are excluded from the calculations of dilutive earnings per share. The following table reconciles the (loss) income and average share amounts used to compute both basic and diluted (loss) income per share:\n\nSchedule of Earnings Per Share\n\n2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \n---|---|---|---  \nThree Months Ended | Nine Months Ended  \n(Amounts in Thousands, Except for Per Share Amounts) | September 30, (Unaudited) | September 30, (Unaudited)  \n2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \n(Loss) income per common share from continuing operations  \n(Loss) income from continuing operations, net of taxes | $| (8,806| ) | $| 246 | $| (16,049| ) | $| 448  \nBasic (loss) income per share | $| (.56| ) | $| .02 | $| (1.09| ) | $| .03  \nDiluted (loss) income per share | $| (.56| ) | $| .02 | $| (1.09| ) | $| .03  \n(Loss) income per common share from discontinued operations, net of taxes  \n(Loss) income from discontinued operations, net of taxes | $| (173| ) | $| 95 | $| (441| ) | $| (44| )  \nBasic (loss) income per share | $| (.01| ) | $| .01 | $| (.03| ) | $| —  \nDiluted loss per share | $| (.01| ) | $| — | $| (.03| ) | $| —  \nNet (loss) income per common share  \nNet (loss) income | $| (8,979| ) | $| 341 | $| (16,490| ) | $| 404  \nBasic (loss) income per share | $| (.57| ) | $| .03 | $| (1.12| ) | $| .03  \nDiluted (loss) income per share | $| (.57| ) | $| .02 | $| (1.12| ) | $| .03  \nWeighted average shares outstanding:  \nBasic weighted average shares outstanding | 15,803 | 13,568 | 14,695 | 13,468  \nAdd: dilutive effect of stock options | — | 370 | — | 244  \nAdd: dilutive effect of warrants | — | 41 | — | 37  \nDiluted weighted average shares outstanding | 15,803 | 13,979 | 14,695 | 13,749  \nPotential shares excluded from above weighted average share calculations due to their anti-dilutive effect include:  \nStock options | — | — | 70 | 70  \nWarrant | 62 | — | 62 | —  \n  \n15  \n---  \n  \n**8.** **Long Term Debt**\n\nLong-term debt consists of the following:\n\nSchedule of Long Term Debt\n\n(Amounts in Thousands) | September 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023  \n---|---|---  \n**Revolving Credit** facility dated May 8, 2020, borrowings based upon eligible accounts receivable, subject to monthly borrowing base calculation, balance due on May 15, 2027.

Any subsequent fiscal quarter testing of the FCCR will revert back to a trailing twelve-months period method.  \n  \nIn connection with the amendment, the Company paid its lender a fee of $25,000 which is being amortized over the remaining term of the Loan Agreement as interest expense-financing fees.\n\nAt September 30, 2024, the Company had no outstanding borrowing under its revolving credit and its Liquidity under the Credit Facility was approximately $13,984,000.\n\nThe Company’s Credit Facility under its Loan Agreement with PNC contains certain financial covenants, along with customary representations and warranties. A breach of any of these financial covenants, unless waived by PNC, could result in a default under our Credit Facility allowing our lender to immediately require the repayment of all outstanding debt under our Credit Facility and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. The Company was not required to perform testing of its FCCR requirement for the first and second quarters of 2024 pursuant to the amendment dated May 8, 2024, to the Company’s Loan Agreement as discussed above. The Company was also not required to perform testing of its FCCR for the third quarter of 2024 pursuant to an amendment dated November 12, 2024, to the Company’s Loan Agreement, as amended (See “Note 15 – Subsequent Events – Credit Facility” for a discussion of this amendment which removed the testing requirement of the FCCR for the third quarter of 2024, among other things). Otherwise, the Company met all of its other financial covenant requirements in each of the first three quarters of 2024.\n\n17  \n---  \n  \nOn July 24, 2024, the Company purchased the property which its EWOC facility operates on pursuant to a Purchase and Sales Agreement dated April 30, 2024, for a purchase price of $425,000.

Under no circumstances will the variable interest rates on the Note be less than 4.0% per annum or more than (except in the case of default) the lesser of 20.5% per annum or the maximum rate allowed by applicable law. The Company agreed to pay the lender 3.0% of the total outstanding principal balance under the Note in the event the Company pays off its obligations during the first year of the Note. The prepayment penalty rate will be reduced by 1.0% at each subsequent annual anniversary of the Note. No prepayment penalty will apply in the event the Company pays off the Note on the fourth anniversary of the Note or thereafter. The property was previously accounted for under the Company’s operating leases.\n\n**9.** **Commitments and Contingencies**\n\n**Hazardous Waste**\n\nIn connection with our waste management services, the Company processes hazardous, non-hazardous, low-level radioactive and mixed (containing both hazardous and low-level radioactive) waste, which the Company transports to its own, or other, facilities for destruction or disposal.

The Company’s CODM generally does not utilize total asset in allocating resources to its operating segments.\n\nOur reporting segments are defined below:\n\nTREATMENT SEGMENT, which includes:\n\n-| nuclear, low-level radioactive, mixed waste (containing both hazardous and low-level radioactive constituents), hazardous and non-hazardous waste treatment, processing and disposal services primarily through four uniquely licensed and permitted treatment and storage facilities; and  \n---|---  \n-| Research and Development (“R&D”) activities to identify, develop and implement innovative waste processing techniques for problematic waste streams.  \n  \nSERVICES SEGMENT, which includes:\n\n-| Technical services, which include:  \n---|---  \n○| professional radiological measurement and site survey of large government and commercial installations using advanced methods, technology and engineering;  \n---|---  \n○| integrated Occupational Safety and Health services including industrial hygiene (“IH”) assessments; hazardous materials surveys, e.g., exposure monitoring; lead and asbestos management/abatement oversight; indoor air quality evaluations; health risk and exposure assessments; health & safety plan/program development, compliance auditing and training services; and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) citation assistance;  \n○| global technical services providing consulting, engineering, project management, waste management, environmental, and decontamination and decommissioning field, technical, and management personnel and services to commercial and government customers; and  \n○| on-site waste management services to commercial and governmental customers.  \n-| Nuclear services, which include:  \n---|---  \n○| technology-based services including engineering, decontamination and decommissioning (“D&D”), specialty services and construction, logistics, transportation, processing and disposal;  \n---|---  \n○| remediation of nuclear licensed and federal facilities and the remediation cleanup of nuclear legacy sites. Such services capability includes: project investigation; radiological engineering; partial and total plant D&D; facility decontamination, dismantling, demolition, and planning; site restoration; logistics; transportation; and emergency response; and  \n-| A company owned equipment calibration and maintenance laboratory that services, maintains, calibrates, and sources (i.e., rental) health physics, IH and customized nuclear, environmental, and occupational safety and health (“NEOSH”) instrumentation.  \n---|---  \n  \nOur reporting segments exclude our corporate headquarters and our discontinued operations (see “Note 10 – Discontinued Operations”) which do not generate revenues.\n\nThe table below presents certain financial information of our operating segments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 (in thousands).\n\n20  \n---  \n  \nSchedule of Segment Reporting Information\n\n**Segment Reporting for the Quarter Ended September 30, 2024**\n\n(1)

\n---|---  \n(3)| Net of financed amount of $152,000 and $309,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.  \n---|---  \n(4) | Includes tax expense recorded in the amount of approximately $6,417,000 in the third quarter of 2024 in connection with a full valuation allowance against the Company’s U.S. deferred tax assets (see “Note 13 – Income Taxes” below for a discussion of this tax expense).  \n---|---  \n  \n21  \n---  \n  \n**13.** **Income Taxes**\n\nThe Company uses an estimated annual effective tax rate, which is based on expected annual income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates, to determine its quarterly provision for income taxes.\n\nThe Company records valuation allowances against its net deferred tax assets to the extent it determines it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized in the future. The Company regularly evaluates the probability that its deferred tax assets will be realized and determines whether valuation allowances or adjustments thereto are needed. This determination involves judgement and the use of estimates and assumptions, including expectations of future taxable income and tax planning strategies. The Company applies judgment to consider the relative impact of negative and positive evidence, and the weight given to negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which such evidence can be objectively verified. Based on the Company’s evaluation of all available positive and negative evidence, and with greater weight placed on the objectively verifiable evidence which included the Company’s substantial losses incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company determined, at the end of the third quarter, that it is more likely than not that the Company’s net U.S. deferred tax assets will not be realized. As a result, the Company provided a full valuation allowance against its U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets resulting in a recorded income tax expense in the amount of approximately $6,417,000. The Company continues to maintain a valuation allowance against foreign tax attributes that may not be realized. \n\nThe Company had income tax expenses of $6,417,000 and $4,300,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and income tax expenses of $254,000 and $482,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, for our continuing operations. The Company’s effective tax rates were approximately 268.6% and 36.6% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 50.8% and 51.8% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The Company’s effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, were primarily impacted by the full valuation allowance on its deferred assets as discussed above.\n\n**14.** **Sale of Common Stock**\n\nOn May 21, 2024, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”) with certain institutional and retail investors (the “Purchasers”), pursuant to which the Company sold and issued, in a registered direct offering, an aggregate of 2,051,282 shares of the Company’s Common Stock, at a negotiated purchase price per share of $9.75 (the “Shares”), for aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of approximately $20,000,000, before deducting fees payable to the placement agents and other estimated offering expenses payable by the Company (the “Offering”). The net proceeds from the Offering is to fund (i) continued R&D and business development relating to the Company’s patent-pending process for the destruction of PFAS (Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances), as well as the cost of installing at least one commercial treatment unit; (ii) ongoing facility capital expenditures and maintenance costs; and (iii) general corporate and working capital purposes.\n\nThe Shares were offered and sold by the Company pursuant to the Company’s “shelf” registration statement on Form S-3 and prospectus supplement relating thereto.\n\nCraig-Hallum Capital Group LLC (“Craig-Hallum”) and Wellington Shields & Co. LLC (“Wellington Shields”) (Wellington Shields and Craig-Hallum together are known as the “Placement Agents”) served as the exclusive placement agents in connection with the Offering. The Company paid the Placement Agents a total cash fee of 6.00% of the aggregate gross proceeds in the Offering, which totaled approximately $1,200,000. The Company also reimbursed the Placement Agents certain expenses in connection with the Offering in an aggregate amount of approximately $80,000. As additional compensation to the Placement Agents in connection with the Offering, the Company also issued to the Placement Agents and two (2) of their members designees, warrants (the “Placement Agents’ Warrants”) to purchase an aggregate of 61,538 shares of Common Stock (the “Warrant Shares”), with the aggregate number of Warrant Shares that may be acquired under the Placement Agents’ Warrants equal to 3.0% of the number of Shares sold in the registered direct offering, at an exercise price per share equal to $12.19, which is equal to approximately 125% of the price per share of the Shares sold in the Offering. Neither the Placement Agents’ Warrants nor the Warrant Shares have been registered under the Registration Statement or otherwise. The Placement Agents’ Warrants have a term of five years, are exercisable at any time and from time to time, in whole or in part, during the four and one-half (4 ½) year period commencing 180 days from the last date of closing of the Offering which was May 24, 2024, and are exercisable via “cashless exercise” in certain circumstances. The aggregate fair value of the “Placement Agents’ Warrants” was determined to be approximately $331,000 using the Black-Scholes pricing model with the following assumptions: 58.78% volatility, risk free interest rate of 4.53%, an expected life of five years and no dividend. The aggregate fair market value of the Placement Agent’s Warrants was recorded as an offset to gross proceeds of the Offering and an increase to additional-paid-in capital.\n\nAfter deducting costs incurred of approximately $1,544,000 (exclusive of the aggregate fair market value of the Placement Agents’ Warrants as discussed above) which were recorded as a deduction to equity in connection with the Offering, net cash proceeds to the Company totaled approximately $18,456,000. The Company has paid approximately $1,505,000 of the $1,544,000 costs incurred in connection with the Offering.\n\n22  \n---  \n  \n**15.** **Subsequent Events**\n\nThe Company evaluated subsequent events and transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date through November 13, 2024, the date that these condensed consolidated financial statements were available to be issued. Based upon this review, the Company did not identify any subsequent events that would have required adjustment or disclosure in the condensed consolidated financial statements other than the below:\n\n_Credit Facility_\n\nOn November 12, 2024, the Company entered into an amendment to its Loan Agreement, as amended, with its lender which provided the following, among other things:\n\n●| removes the quarterly FCCR testing requirement for the third quarter of 2024;  \n---|---  \n●| reinstates the quarterly FCCR testing requirement starting in the fourth quarter of 2024 and revises the methodology to be used in calculating the FCCR as follows (with no change to the minimum 1.15:1 ratio requirement): FCCR for the fourth quarter is to be determined based on financial results for the three-months period ending December 31, 2024; FCCR for the first quarter of 2025 is to be determined based on financial results for the six-months period ending March 31, 2025; FCCR for the second quarter of 2025 is to be determined based on financial results for the nine-months period ending June 30, 2025; and FCCR for the third quarter of 2025 and each fiscal quarter thereafter is to be determined based on financial results for a trailing twelve-months period ending basis;  \n●| extends the required maintenance of a daily minimum of $3,000,000 in Liquidity from the ending date of June 29, 2025 (and including) to September 29, 2025 (and including); and  \n●| in the event the Company is able to achieve its minimum quarterly FCCR requirement utilizing its financial results based on a trailing twelve-months period starting with the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the maintenance of a daily minimum Liquidity requirement of $3,000,000 as discussed above will be removed. Any subsequent fiscal quarter testing of the FCCR will revert back to a trailing twelve-months period method.  \n  \nIn connection with the amendment, the Company paid its lender a fee of $12,500.\n\n**Item 2.** | **Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations**  \n---|---  \n  \n**Forward-looking Statements**\n\nCertain statements contained within this report may be deemed “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the “Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995”. All statements in this report other than a statement of historical fact are forward-looking statements that are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which could cause actual results and performance of the Company to differ materially from such statements. The words “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “will,” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements contained herein relate to, among other things,\n\n● | demand for our services;  \n---|---  \n● | reductions in the level of government funding in future years;   \n● | accelerated investments;  \n● | base business is positioned for improvement in 2025;  \n● | results of operations improvement in 2025;  \n● | advancement of initiatives to be more fully realized in 2025;   \n● | reducing operating costs and non-essential expenditures;  \n● | ability to meet loan agreement quarterly financial covenant requirements;  \n  \n23  \n---  \n  \n● | government shutdown or Continuing Resolution (“CR”) impact;  \n---|---  \n● | cash flow requirements;  \n● | sufficient Liquidity to fund operations for the next twelve months;  \n● | revenue under the Italian project;  \n● | manner in which the applicable government will be required to spend funding to remediate various sites;  \n● | successful on international bids;  \n● | funding of operating and capital expenditures from cash from operations, Liquidity under our Credit Facility, and/or financing;  \n● | our PFAS technology process will exceed current treatment options available;  \n● | receipt of an additional 20,000 AFFF liquid;  \n● | advancement of our PFAS technology by mid-2025;  \n● | strategy for our System;  \n● | funding of remediation expenditures for sites from funds generated internally;  \n● | compliance with environmental regulations;   \n● | positioning for procurements from DOE and other government agencies;  \n● | potential effect of being a potentially responsible party (“PRP”); and   \n● | potential violations of environmental laws and attendant remediation at our facilities.  \n  \nWhile the Company believes the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance such expectations will prove to be correct. There are a variety of factors which could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those described in this report, including, but not limited to:\n\n● | general economic conditions;  \n---|---  \n● | contract bids, including international markets;  \n● | material reduction in revenues;  \n● | inability to meet PNC covenant requirements;  \n● | inability to collect in a timely manner a material amount of receivables;   \n● | increased competitive pressures;   \n● | inability to maintain and obtain required permits and approvals to conduct operations;   \n●  | inability to develop new and existing technologies in the conduct of operations;  \n● | inability to maintain and obtain closure and operating insurance requirements;  \n● | inability to retain or renew certain required permits;  \n● | discovery of additional contamination or expanded contamination at any of the sites or facilities leased or owned by us or our subsidiaries which would result in a material increase in remediation expenditures;  \n● | delays at our third-party disposal site can extend collection of our receivables greater than twelve months;  \n● | refusal of third-party disposal sites to accept our waste;  \n● | changes in federal, state and local laws and regulations, especially environmental laws and regulations, or in interpretation of such;  \n● | inability of the federal government to adopt a budget in a timely manner or additional CRs;  \n● | requirements to obtain permits for treatment, storage and disposal (TSD) activities or licensing requirements to handle low level radioactive materials are limited or lessened;  \n● | management retention and development;  \n● | financial valuation of intangible assets is substantially more/less than expected;  \n● | the need to use internally generated funds for purposes not presently anticipated;  \n● | shutdown of the federal government;  \n  \n24  \n---  \n  \n● | change in government priorities;  \n---|---  \n● | inability of the Company to maintain the listing of its Common Stock on the Nasdaq;  \n● | terminations of contracts with government agencies or subcontracts involving government agencies or reduction in amount of waste delivered to the Company under the contracts or subcontracts;   \n● | failure of partner to perform its requirements in connection with the Italian project;  \n● | changes in the scope of work relating to existing contracts;  \n● | occurrence of an event similar to COVID-19 having adverse effects on the U.S. and world economics;  \n● | renegotiation of contracts involving government agencies;  \n● | disposal expense accrual could prove to be inadequate in the event the waste requires re-treatment;   \n● | inability to raise capital on commercially reasonable terms;  \n● | inability to increase profitable revenue;   \n● | economic uncertainties;  \n● | non-acceptance of our new technology;  \n● | adjustments to our valuation allowance;  \n● | new governmental regulations; and  \n● | risk factors and other factors set forth in “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” contained in the Company’s 2023 Form 10-K and the “Forward-Looking Statements” contained in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”) for the first and second quarters of 2024 and this third quarter 2024 10-Q.  \n  \n**Overview**\n\nOur third quarter financial results were impacted by continued acceleration of our investments and a number of unexpected events/factors which included the following:\n\n●| certain waste shipments that were expected to occur in the third quarter of 2024 were pushed into the fourth quarter of 2024 by certain government related customers;  \n---|---  \n●| unexpected equipment breakdowns that occurred in the latter part of June and during the third quarter of 2024 which required replacement or repair in certain of our Treatment Segment facilities delayed revenue production. All of the equipment is now back in service;  \n●| weather conditions caused by Hurricane Helene resulted in waste shipment delays by certain customers at our Florida facility and temporary demobilization of a Services Segment project mandated by the customer. This project resumed in early October. Additionally, Hurricane Helene caused a temporary shutdown of our Florida facility for approximately one week which impacted revenue production;  \n●| continued acceleration in investment of our new PFAS (Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) technology which requires significant management and operation support, including the installation of our first full scale commercial system in treating PFAS. This system installation also caused production delays (see “Known Trends and Uncertainties – New Processing Technology” within this MD&A for a discussion of this technology); and  \n●| the completion of two large projects in the Services Segment in late 2023 were not replaced by new projects of similar value. Together, these two large projects had generated significant amount of revenue in the third quarter of 2023 when they were in full operational status.  \n  \nIn addition to the aforementioned factors, we continue to experience delays in procurements and contract awards from government clients in the first nine months of 2024. Although we are disappointed with our 2024 financial results for the first nine months of 2024, we believe our base business is positioned for improvement in 2025 and that our results of operations should improve in 2025. As previously disclosed, we continue to advance a variety of additional initiatives that are expected to be more fully realized in 2025. These initiatives include, among other things, positioning ourselves for large and mid-size procurements within the U.S. Department of Energy (“DOE”) and U.S. Navy and waste treatment in support of DOE’s Hanford closure strategy, continued investments in our facilities and capabilities to allow for broader waste treatment (including PFAS), and continued expansion of our waste treatment offerings within the international and commercial markets.\n\n25  \n---  \n  \nAs a result of the aforementioned events and factors, our overall revenue decreased by $5,065,000 or 23.2% to $16,812,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from $21,877,000 for the corresponding period of 2023. We saw decreases in both segments where Treatment Segment revenue decreased by $1,731,000 to $9,064,000 or 16.0% from $10,795,000 and Services Segment revenue decreased by $3,334,000 or 30.1% to $7,748,000 from $11,082,000. Gross profit for the third quarter of 2024 was approximately $1,334,000 as compared to gross profit of $4,549,000 for the corresponding period of 2023, reflecting a decrease in gross profit of approximately $3,215,000 or 70.7%, primarily due to decreased revenue in both segments. Selling, General and Administrative (“SG&A”) expenses decreased by $301,000 or 7.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period of 2023.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, we provided a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets (see a discussion of this valuation allowance and the impact to our financial statements in “Results of Operations – Income Taxes” below).\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, overall revenue decreased by $22,601,000 or 33.7% to $44,415,000 from $67,016,000 for the corresponding period of 2023 where we saw decrease in revenue in both segments. Treatment Segment revenue decreased by $7,107,000 to $26,116,000 or 21.4% from $33,223,000 and Services Segment revenue decreased by $15,494,000 or 45.8% to $18,299,000 from $33,793,000. The decrease in revenue within the Treatment Segment was attributed to factors which included among other things, delays in waste shipments by certain customers due to poor weather conditions and earlier Continuing Resolution (“CR”) impacts, temporary outages at our three primary facilities for equipment replacement and repairs, program enhancement and testing to support permit expansion and broader market penetration, weather impacts at certain of our treatment facilities resulting in temporary shutdown which limited revenue production and accelerated investment in R&D on our new technology to treat PFAS. Overall lower averaged price from waste mix within the Treatment Segment also contributed to revenue decrease. The decrease in revenue in the Services Segment was due to slower mobilization and delays in certain projects from the earlier impact of CR and poor weather conditions. Additionally, the decrease in revenue in the Services Segment was also attributed to the completion of two large projects in late 2023 which were not replaced by new projects of similar value. Together, these two large projects had generated a significant amount of revenues in the first nine months of 2023 when they were in full operational status. Total gross profit for the nine months ended 2024 decreased $12,666,000 or 104.9% due to decreased revenue generated in both segments. SG&A expenses decreased $338,000 or 3.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period of 2023.\n\n**Business Environment**\n\nOur Treatment and Services Segments’ business continues to be heavily dependent on services that we provide to U.S governmental clients, primarily as subcontractors for others who are prime contractors to government entities or directly as the prime contractor. We believe demand for our services will continue to be subject to fluctuations due to a variety of factors beyond our control, including, without limitation, the economic conditions, the manner in which the applicable government will be required to spend funding to remediate various sites and potential future federal budget issues. In addition, our governmental contracts and subcontracts relating to activities at governmental sites in the United States are generally subject to termination for convenience at any time at the government’s option. Our Italian contract under our partnership may be terminated by the Contracting Authority under certain conditions as set forth in the contract.

Treatment Segment’s variable costs decreased by approximately $931,000 primarily due to overall lower transportation, disposal and lab costs. Treatment Segment’s overall fixed costs were higher by approximately $284,000 resulting from the following: salaries and payroll related expenses were higher by approximately $528,000 due to higher headcount; maintenance expenses were higher by approximately $136,000 due to unexpected breakdowns of certain equipment which required repair/replacement as discussed in the “Overview” previously; travel expenses were lower by approximately $22,000; depreciation expenses were lower by approximately $213,000 due to fully depreciated asset retirement obligations (“AROs”) that occurred in the third quarter of 2023 in connection with our EWOC facility; regulatory expenses were lower by approximately $41,000; and general expenses were lower by $104,000 in various categories. Services Segment cost of goods sold decreased $1,203,000 or 15.0% primarily due to lower revenue. The decrease in cost of goods sold was primarily due to overall lower salaries/payroll related, outside services, and travel costs totaling approximately $1,379,000; lower depreciation expenses of approximately $44,000; lower general expenses of approximately $110,000 in various categories; and overall higher material and supplies, regulatory, disposal and lab expenses totaling approximately $330,000.

Services Segment gross profit decreased by $2,131,000 or 69.8% primarily due to decreased revenue as discussed in the “Overview” above. The decrease in gross margin in the Services Segment from 27.6% to 11.9% was attributed to overall lower margin projects as the two large projects completed in late 2023 were higher margin projects. Our overall Services Segment gross margin is impacted by our current projects which are competitively bid on and will therefore, have varying margin structures.\n\nGross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased $12,666,000 over the same period in 2023, as follows:\n\n% | %  \n---|---  \n(In thousands) | 2024 | Revenue | 2023 | Revenue | Change  \nTreatment | $| (839| ) | (3.2| ) | $| 5,237 | 15.8 | $| (6,076| )  \nServices | 247 | 1.3 | 6,837 | 20.2 | (6,590| )  \nTotal | $| (592| ) | (1.3| ) | $| 12,074 | 18.0 | $| (12,666| )  \n  \n29  \n---  \n  \nTreatment Segment gross profit decreased by $6,076,000 or approximately 116.0% and gross margin decreased to (3.2)% from 15.8% primarily due to lower revenue from lower waste volume, overall lower averaged price from waste mix and the impact of our fixed costs structure. Services Segment gross profit decreased by $6,590,000 or 96.4% primarily due to decreased revenue as discussed in the “Overview” above. The decrease in gross margin from 20.2% to 1.3% was attributed to overall lower margin projects as the two large projects completed in late 2023 were higher margin projects. Our overall Services Segment gross margin is impacted by our current projects which are competitively bid on and will therefore, have varying margin structures.\n\n_SG &A_\n\nSG&A expenses decreased $301,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period for 2023, as follows:\n\n(In thousands) | 2024 | % Revenue | 2023 | % Revenue | Change  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nAdministrative | $| 1,733 | — | $| 1,916 | — | $| (183| )  \nTreatment | 1,084 | 12.0 | 1,039 | 9.6 | 45  \nServices | 815 | 10.5 | 978 | 8.8 | (163| )  \nTotal | $| 3,632 | 21.6 | $| 3,933 | 18.0 | $| (301| )  \n  \nThe decrease in Administrative SG&A expenses was primarily due to lower accrued incentives expenses. In the prior year quarter, approximately $178,000 in estimated accrued incentive expenses were recorded in connection with the Company’s management incentive plans (“MIPs”) and other employees’ bonus plans. Treatment Segment SG&A expenses were higher primarily due to higher salaries and payroll related expenses of approximately $139,000 which were offset by lower outside services expenses of $20,000 from fewer consulting matters and lower general expenses of $74,000 in various categories. The decrease in Services Segment SG&A was primarily due to the following: salaries and payroll related expenses were lower by approximately $65,000; outside services expenses were lower by approximately $69,000 due to fewer consulting/legal matters; and overall general expenses were lower by approximately $29,000 in various categories. Included in SG&A expenses is depreciation and amortization expenses of $25,000 and $20,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively.\n\nSG&A expenses decreased $338,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period for 2023, as follows:\n\n(In thousands) | 2024 | % Revenue | 2023 | % Revenue | Change  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nAdministrative | $| 5,134 | — | $| 5,281 | — | $| (147| )  \nTreatment | 3,224 | 12.3 | 3,071 | 9.2 | 153  \nServices | 2,273 | 12.4 | 2,617 | 7.7 | (344| )  \nTotal | $| 10,631 | 23.9 | $| 10,969 | 16.4 | $| (338| )  \n  \nAdministrative SG&A expenses were lower primarily due to the following: payroll-related expenses were lower by approximately $178,000 primarily due to lower accrued incentive expenses. Administrative SG&A expenses in the third quarter of 2023 included estimated incentives recorded in the amount of approximately $178,000 in connection with the Company’s management incentive plans (“MIPs”) and other employees’ bonus plans. Such incentives were not recorded in the first nine months of 2024; outside services expenses were lower by approximately $40,000 from fewer consulting/legal matters; and overall general and maintenance expenses were higher by approximately $71,000. Treatment Segment SG&A expenses were higher primarily due to higher salaries and payroll related expenses of approximately $332,000 which were offset by overall lower travel, outside services and general expenses totaling approximately $179,000. The decrease in Services Segment SG&A was primarily due to lower outside services expenses of approximately $116,000 from fewer consulting and legal matters, lower salaries and payroll related expenses of approximately $203,000 and lower general expenses of $25,000 in various categories. Included in SG&A expenses is depreciation and amortization expenses of $77,000 and $61,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively.\n\n30  \n---  \n  \n_R &D_\n\nR&D expenses increased by $183,000 and $532,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding period of 2023 primarily due to expenses incurred in connection with our new PFAS technology.\n\n_Interest Income_\n\nInterest income increased by approximately $146,000 and $234,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding period of 2023. The higher interest income for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the corresponding quarter of 2023 was primarily due to interest income earned from our money market deposit account (“MMDA”) that we maintained with our lender starting in late 2023.\n\nThe increase in interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period of 2023 was primarily due to higher interest income earned from our finite risk sinking fund from higher interest rates that took effect starting in April 2023. Additionally, the increase in interest income resulted from interest income earned from our MMDA that we maintained with our lender starting in late 2023. The overall increase in interest income from the above was reduced by interest income received in March of 2023 of approximately $60,000 in connection with the Employee Retention Credit refund that we received.\n\n_Interest Expense_\n\nInterest expense increased by approximately $32,000 and $157,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding period of 2023. The increase for each of the periods above was attributed primarily to interest incurred on the $2,500,000 term loan dated July 31, 2023, under our credit facility and the promissory note that we entered into on July 24, 2024, for the purchase of our EWOC facility. The higher interest expense was also from more finance leases.\n\n_Income Taxes_\n\nWe use an estimated annual effective tax rate, which is based on expected annual income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate, to determine our quarterly provision for income taxes.\n\nWe record valuation allowances against our net deferred tax assets to the extent we determine it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized in the future. We regularly evaluate the probability that our deferred tax assets will be realized and determines whether valuation allowances or adjustments thereto are needed. This determination involves judgement and the use of estimates and assumptions, including expectations of future taxable income and tax planning strategies. We apply judgment to consider the relative impact of negative and positive evidence, and the weight given to negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which such evidence can be objectively verified. Based on our evaluation of all available positive and negative evidence, and with greater weight placed on the objectively verifiable evidence which included our substantial losses incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we determined, at the end of the third quarter, that it is more likely than not that our net U.S. deferred tax assets will not be realized. As a result, we provided a full valuation allowance against our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets resulting in a recorded income tax expense in the amount of approximately $6,417,000. We continue to maintain a valuation allowance against foreign tax attributes that may not be realized. \n\nWe had income tax expenses of $6,417,000 and $4,300,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and income tax expenses of $254,000 and $482,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, for our continuing operations. Our effective tax rates were approximately 268.6% and 36.6% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 50.8% and 51.8% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Our effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, were primarily impacted by the full valuation allowance on our deferred assets as discussed above.\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nOur cash flow requirements during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were primarily financed by our operations and Liquidity (defined as borrowing availability under the revolving credit plus cash in our MMDA maintained with our lender) under our Credit Facility. Our cash included net proceeds received from the sale of 2,051,282 shares our Common Stock to certain institutional and retail investors in May 2024 (see “Financing Activities” below for a discussion of this direct offering, including the planned usage of the proceeds). Our cash flow requirements for the next twelve months will consist primarily of general working capital needs, scheduled principal payments on our debt obligations, remediation projects, R&D on our PFAS technology and capital expenditures which include our PFAS technology (see “Known Trends and Uncertainties – New Processing Technology” within this MD&A for a discussion of this technology). We plan to fund these requirements from our operations and Liquidity under our Credit Facility. Our ability to utilize our Credit Facility from our lender is subject to meeting our quarterly financial covenant requirements, among other things. We are continually reviewing operating costs and reviewing the possibility of further reducing operating costs and non-essential expenditures to bring them in line with revenue levels. At September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowing under our revolving credit and our Liquidity under our Credit Facility was approximately $13,984,000. We believe that our cash flows from operations and our Liquidity should be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months. Although we believe we should be profitable in 2025, if we continue to incur losses, such may cause a reduction in our Liquidity.\n\n31  \n---  \n  \nThe following table reflects the cash flow activities during the first nine months of 2024\n\n(In thousands)  \n---  \nCash used in operating activities of continuing operations | $| (10,971| )  \nCash used in operating activities of discontinued operations | (468| )  \nCash used in investing activities of continuing operations | (2,800| )  \nCash used in investing activities of discontinued operations | (49| )  \nCash provided by financing activities of continuing operations | 17,805  \nEffect of exchange rate changes in cash | 1  \nIncrease in cash and finite risk sinking fund (restricted cash) | $| 3,518  \n  \nAs of September 30, 2024, we were in a positive cash position with no revolving credit balance. At September 30, 2024, we had cash on hand of approximately $10,567,000.\n\n_Operating Activities_\n\nAccounts receivable, net of credit losses, totaled $8,741,000 as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of $981,000 from the December 31, 2023, balance of $9,722,000. The decrease was attributed to reduced billing from decreased revenues which were negatively impacted by a number of events as previously discussed (See “Overview” within this MD&A). Our accounts receivable was also reduced by the collection in May 2024 of outstanding accounts receivable for work performed for a certain Canadian project for which a settlement agreement was reached, with collection subject to meeting certain conditions/terms precedent (see “Perma-Fix Canada Inc. (“PF Canada”)”) below for a discussion on the collection of the receivables).\n\nAccounts payable totaled $7,675,000 as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of $1,907,000 from the December 31, 2023, balance of $9,582,000. The decrease in accounts payable was attributed to our overall reduced operations as discussed previously. Additionally, our accounts payable are impacted by the timing of payments as we are continually managing payment terms with our vendors to maximize our cash position throughout our segments.\n\nWe had working capital of $9,424,000 (which included working capital of our discontinued operations) as of September 30, 2024, as compared to working capital of $4,613,000 as of December 31, 2023. The improvement in our in our working capital was primarily due to the increase in our cash from the sale of our Common Stock (see “Financing Activities” below for a discussion of this direct offering, including the planned usage of the proceeds) which was offset by the significant losses incurred from our results of operations attributed to the various factors as previously discussed.\n\n_Investing Activities_\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our purchases of capital equipment totaled approximately $2,630,000, of which $406,000 was subject to financing, with the remaining funded from cash from operations, cash from the equity raise that we completed in May 2024 and our Credit Facility. We budgeted approximately $2,000,000 for 2024 capital expenditures for our Treatment and Services Segments to maintain operations and regulatory compliance requirements and support revenue growth. Our capital expenditures for 2024 also included additional expenditures made to support our PFAS initiatives from cash from our equity raise completed in May 2024. Certain of our 2024 budgeted projects may either be delayed until later years or deferred altogether. We plan to fund our capital expenditures from cash from operations, Liquidity under our Credit Facility and/or financing. The initiation and timing of projects are also determined by financing alternatives or funds available for such capital projects.\n\nOn July 24, 2024, the Company purchased the property which its EWOC facility operates on pursuant to a Purchase and Sales Agreement for a purchase price of $425,000. In connection with this transaction, we paid $63,750 in cash and financed the remaining $361,250 of the purchase price with a bank (“see Financing Activities” below for a discussion of the Note and its terms).\n\n32  \n---  \n  \n_Financing Activities_\n\nWe entered into a Second Amended and Restated Revolving Credit, Term Loan and Security Agreement, dated May 8, 2020, which has since been amended from time to time, with PNC National Association (“PNC” and “lender”), acting as agent and lender (the “Loan Agreement”). The Loan Agreement provides us with the following credit facility with a maturity date of May 15, 2027 (the “Credit Facility): (a) up to $12,500,000 revolving credit (“revolving credit”), which borrowing capacity is subject to eligible receivables (as defined) and reduced by outstanding standby letters of credit ($3,950,000 as of September 30, 2024) and borrowing reductions that our lender may impose from time to time ($750,000 as of September 30, 2024); (b) a term loan (“Term Loan 1”) of approximately $1,742,000, requiring monthly installments of $35,547 (Term Loan 1 was paid off by us in June 2024); (c) a term loan (“Term Loan 2”) of $2,500,000, requiring monthly installments of $41,667; and (d) a capital expenditure line (“Capital Line”) of up to $1,000,000 with advances on the line, subject to certain limitations, permitted for up to twelve months starting May 4, 2021 (the “Borrowing Period”). Amounts advanced under the Capital Line at the end of the Borrowing Period totaled approximately $524,000, requiring monthly installments of principal of approximately $8,700 plus interest, commencing June 1, 2022.\n\nPursuant to our Loan Agreement, payments of annual interest rates are as follows: (i) interest due on the revolving credit is at prime (8.00% at September 30, 2024) plus 2% or SOFR (as defined in the Loan Agreement, as amended) plus 3.00% plus an SOFR Adjustment applicable for an interest period selected by us; (ii) interest due on each Term Loan 1 and the Capital Line was/is at prime plus 2.50% or SOFR plus 3.50% plus an SOFR Adjustment applicable for an interest period selected by us; and (iii) interest due on Term Loan 2 is at prime plus 3% or SOFR plus 4.00% plus an SOFR Adjustment applicable for an interest period selected by us. SOFR Adjustment rates of 0.10% and 0.15% are applicable for a one-month interest period and three-month period, respectively, that may be selected by us.\n\nWe agreed to pay PNC 0.5% of the total financing if we pay off our obligations under our Loan Agreement to our lender after July 31, 2024, to and including July 31, 2025. No early termination fee shall apply if we pays off our obligations under Loan Agreement after July 31, 2025.\n\nOn May 8, 2024, we entered into an amendment to our Loan Agreement with our lender which provided the following, among other things:\n\n●| removed the quarterly FCCR testing requirement for the first and second quarters of 2024;  \n---|---  \n●| reinstated the quarterly FCCR testing requirement starting in the third quarter of 2024 and revised the methodology to be used in calculating the FCCR as follows (with no change to the minimum 1.15:1 ratio requirement): FCCR for the third quarter is to be determined based on financial results for the three-months period ending September 30, 2024; FCCR for the fourth quarter is to be determined based on financial results for the six-months period ending December 31, 2024; FCCR for the first quarter of 2025 is to be determined based on financial results for the nine-months period ending March 31, 2025; and FCCR for the second quarter of 2025 and each fiscal quarter thereafter is to be determined based on financial results for a trailing twelve-months period ending basis;  \n●| required maintenance of a daily minimum of $2,250,000 in Liquidity under our Credit Facility through June 29, 2024, (which was met by us) and a minimum of daily $3,000,000 in Liquidity starting June 30, 2024, through June 29, 2025 (which we have met to date); and  \n●| in the event we are able to achieve the minimum quarterly FCCR requirement utilizing our financial results based on a trailing twelve-months period starting with the quarter ending June 30, 2024 (which we have not been able to achieve as of September 30, 2024), the maintenance of a daily minimum Liquidity requirement of $3,000,000 as discussed above will be removed. Any subsequent fiscal quarter testing of the FCCR will revert back to a trailing twelve-months period method.  \n  \nIn connection with the amendment, we paid our lender a fee of $25,000 which is being amortized over the remaining term of the Loan Agreement as interest expense-financing fees.\n\n33  \n---  \n  \nOn November 12, 2024, we entered into an amendment to our Loan Agreement, as amended, with our lender which provided the following, among other things:\n\n●| removes the quarterly FCCR testing requirement for the third quarter of 2024;  \n---|---  \n●| reinstates the quarterly FCCR testing requirement starting in the fourth quarter of 2024 and revises the methodology to be used in calculating the FCCR as follows (with no change to the minimum 1.15:1 ratio requirement): FCCR for the fourth quarter is to be determined based on financial results for the three-months period ending December 31, 2024; FCCR for the first quarter of 2025 is to be determined based on financial results for the six-months period ending March 31, 2025; FCCR for the second quarter of 2025 is to be determined based on financial results for the nine-months period ending June 30, 2025; and FCCR for the third quarter of 2025 and each fiscal quarter thereafter is to be determined based on financial results for a trailing twelve-months period ending basis;  \n●| extends the required maintenance of a daily minimum of $3,000,000 in Liquidity from the ending date of June 29, 2025 (and including) to September 29, 2025 (and including); and  \n●| in the event the we are able to achieve our minimum quarterly FCCR requirement utilizing our financial results based on a trailing twelve-months period starting with the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the maintenance of a daily minimum Liquidity requirement of $3,000,000 as discussed above will be removed. Any subsequent fiscal quarter testing of the FCCR will revert back to a trailing twelve-months period method.  \n  \nIn connection with the amendment, we paid our lender a fee of $12,500.\n\nOur Credit Facility under our Loan Agreement with PNC contains certain financial covenants, along with customary representations and warranties. A breach of any of these financial covenants, unless waived by PNC, could result in a default under our Credit Facility allowing our lender to immediately require the repayment of all outstanding debt under our Credit Facility and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. We were not required to perform testing of our FCCR requirement for the first and second quarters of 2024 pursuant to the amendment dated May 8, 2024, to our Loan Agreement as discussed above. We were also not required to perform testing of our FCCR requirement for the third quarter of 2024 pursuant to the amendment dated November 12, 2024, to our Loan Agreement, as amended, as discussed above. Otherwise, we met all of our other financial covenant requirements in each of the first three quarters of 2024. We expect to meet our quarterly financial covenant requirements for the next twelve months.\n\nOn May 21, 2024, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”) with certain institutional and retail investors (the “Purchasers”), pursuant to which we sold and issued, in a registered direct offering, an aggregate of 2,051,282 shares of the Company’s Common Stock, at a negotiated purchase price per share of $9.75 (the “Shares”), for aggregate gross proceeds to us of approximately $20,000,000, before deducting fees payable to the placement agents and other estimated offering expenses payable by the Company (the “Offering”). The net proceeds from the Offering is to fund (i) continued R&D and business development relating to the Company’s patent-pending process for the destruction of PFAS, as well as the cost of installing at least one commercial treatment unit; (ii) ongoing facility capital expenditures and maintenance costs; and (iii) general corporate and working capital purposes.\n\nThe Shares were offered and sold by us pursuant to the our “shelf” registration statement on Form S-3 and prospectus supplement relating thereto.\n\n34  \n---  \n  \nCraig-Hallum Capital Group LLC (“Craig-Hallum”) and Wellington Shields & Co. LLC (“Wellington Shields”) (Wellington Shields and Craig-Hallum together are known as the “Placement Agents”) served as the exclusive placement agents in connection with the Offering. We paid the Placement Agents a total cash fee of 6.00% of the aggregate gross proceeds in the Offering, which totaled approximately $1,200,000. We also reimbursed the Placement Agents certain expenses in connection with the Offering in an aggregate amount of approximately $80,000. As additional compensation to the Placement Agents in connection with the Offering, we also issued to the Placement Agents and two (2) of their members designees, warrants (the “Placement Agents’ Warrants”) to purchase an aggregate of 61,538 shares of Common Stock (the “Warrant Shares”), with the aggregate number of Warrant Shares that may be acquired under the Placement Agents’ Warrants equal to 3.0% of the number of Shares sold in the registered direct offering, at an exercise price per share equal to $12.19, which is equal to approximately 125% of the price per share of the Shares sold in the Offering. Neither the Placement Agents’ Warrants nor the Warrant Shares have been registered under the Registration Statement or otherwise. The Placement Agents’ Warrants have a term of five years, are exercisable at any time and from time to time, in whole or in part, during the four and one-half (4 ½) year period commencing 180 days from the last date of closing of the Offering which was May 24, 2024, and are exercisable via “cashless exercise” in certain circumstances. The aggregate fair value of the “Placement Agents’ Warrants” was determined to be approximately $331,000 using the Black-Scholes pricing model with the following assumptions: 58.78% volatility, risk free interest rate of 4.53%, an expected life of five years and no dividend. The aggregate fair market value of the Placement Agent’s Warrants was recorded as an offset to gross proceeds of the Offering and an increase to additional-paid-in capital.\n\nAfter deducting costs incurred of approximately $1,544,000 (exclusive of the aggregate fair market value of the Placement Agents’ Warrants as discussed above) which were recorded as a deduction to equity in connection with the Offering, net cash proceeds to us totaled approximately $18,456,000. We have paid approximately $1,505,000 of the $1,544,000 costs incurred in connection with the Offering.\n\nOn July 24, 2024, We purchased the property which our EWOC facility operates on pursuant to a Purchase and Sales Agreement dated April 30, 2024, for a purchase price of $425,000. We paid $63,750 in cash and entered into a promissory note dated July 24, 2024, in an amount of $361,250 with a bank (the “lender”) for the remaining balance of the purchase price, with a maturity date in twenty years or July 24, 2044 (the “Note”). For the first five years starting August 24, 2024, monthly payments under the Note will consists of approximately $3,100 which include an annual fixed interest rate of 8.10%. Monthly payments under the Note will then be adjusted at the end of years five, ten and fifteen, with interest calculated based on the weekly average five-year US Treasury Securities Rate plus 3.0%. Under no circumstances will the variable interest rate on the Note be less than 4.0% per annum or more than (except in the case of default) the lesser of 20.5% per annum or the maximum rate allowed by applicable law. We agreed to pay the lender 3.0% of the total outstanding principal balance under the Note in the event we pays off our obligations during the first year of the Note. The prepayment penalty rate will be reduced by 1.0% at each subsequent annual anniversary of the Note. No prepayment penalty will apply in the event we pay off the Note on the fourth anniversary of the Note or thereafter. The property was previously accounted for under our operating leases.\n\n**Perma-Fix Canada Inc. (“PF Canada”)**\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, PF Canada received a Notice of Termination (“NOT”) from Canadian Nuclear Laboratories, LTD. (“CNL”) on a Task Order Agreement (“TOA”) that PF Canada entered into with CNL in May 2019 for remediation work within Ontario, Canada (“Agreement”). The NOT was received after work under the TOA was substantially completed and work under the TOA has since been completed. CNL may terminate the TOA at any time for convenience. At year-end 2023, PF Canada had approximately $2,389,000 in outstanding receivables due from CNL as a result of work performed under the TOA. A settlement agreement was reached between PF Canada and CNL on the payment of the aforementioned amount by CNL, subject to certain conditions/terms precedents being met. PF Canada received a partial payment from CNL of the outstanding receivables during the first quarter of 2024. In May 2024, PF Canada received the remaining approximately $1,612,000 in outstanding receivables from CNL. As a result of the aforementioned payments received from CNL, no outstanding receivables remain under the TOA from CNL.\n\n**Off Balance Sheet Arrangements**\n\nFrom time to time, we are required to post standby letters of credit and various bonds to support contractual obligations to customers and other obligations, including facility closures. At September 30, 2024, the total amount of standby letters of credit outstanding totaled approximately $3,950,000 and the total amount of bonds outstanding totaled approximately $20,568,000. We also provide closure and post-closure requirements through a financial assurance policy for certain of our Treatment Segment facilities through AIG. At September 30, 2024, the closure and post-closure requirements for these facilities were approximately $23,379,000.\n\n35  \n---  \n  \n**Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates**\n\nThere were no significant changes in our accounting policies or critical accounting estimates that are discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n**Recent Accounting Pronouncements**\n\nSee “Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” for the recent accounting pronouncement that will be adopted in future periods.\n\n**Known Trends and Uncertainties**\n\n_Significant Customers_. The contracts that we are a party to with others as subcontractors to the U.S government or directly with the U.S government generally provide that the government may terminate the contract at any time for convenience at the government’s option. Our inability to continue under existing contracts that we have with U.S. government authorities (directly or indirectly as a subcontractor) or significant reductions in the level of governmental funding in any given year could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial condition. We performed services relating to waste generated by U.S government clients, either directly as a prime contractor or indirectly for others as a subcontractor to U.S. government entities, representing approximately $11,749,000 or 69.9% and $31,748,000 or 71.5% of our total revenues generated during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to 14,923,000 or 68.2% and $52,270,000 or 78.0% of our total revenues generated during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Our partnership’s Italian contract may be terminated by the Contracting Authority under certain conditions as set forth in the contract. The scope of work to be performed in the initial phases of the Italian contract will be performed predominately by our JV partner. Revenue generated by the Company under the initial phases of the Italian contract will be limited to project management support through 2025 and is not material to date. The Company expects to generate an increase in revenue under the Italian contract starting in 2026 when the waste treatment phases begin.\n\n_Potential U.S Government Shutdown._ As discussed above, a significant portion of our revenue is generated through contracts entered into indirectly as subcontractors for others who are prime contractors or directly as the prime contractor to U.S. government authorities. In September 2024, a CR was enacted by Congress to avoid a U.S. government shutdown and provide temporary funding for government operations through December 20, 2024. If Congress in unable to enact FY 2025 appropriation bills by the deadline of December 20, 2024, or extend the CR, the U.S. government could enter into shutdown. In the past, even with the enactment of a CR by Congress, there were instances in which certain of our government clients delayed procurement, waste shipments and project starts due to uncertain budget projections. The full impact of any government shutdown or further CR is uncertain and could negatively impact our financial results by delays in procurement actions, contract awards, waste shipments and/or project starts.\n\n_New Processing Technology._ We have completed the fabrication, installation, commissioning and startup of our first full scale commercial Perma-FAS system (“System”) for PFAS (commonly known as “forever chemicals”) destruction at our Perma-Fix Florida, Inc. facility. Our System and patent-pending technology successfully processed commercial PFAS-containing waste materials. There are limited current treatment options for these materials, and we expect that our process will exceed any of these methods. Some of the sizable markets for PFAS include AFFF (aqueous film-forming foam) firefighting foams, both expired concentrate and flushing liquids, contaminated liquids from PFAS systems, and other water-based separation products from a variety of industrial systems. We have already secured approximately 6,000 gallons of AFFF liquids to support ongoing operations and demonstration, and we believe that we will receive an additional 20,000 gallons in the coming months. \n\n36  \n---  \n  \nOur strategy for our System includes continued treatment of PFAS liquids over the coming months and targeting engineering refinements to support larger-scale Systems. By mid-2025, we expect to advance this technology into pilot-scale applications for soil, biosolids, and filter media, broadening the reach of our System’s destruction capabilities. \n\n**Environmental Contingencies**\n\nWe are engaged in the waste management services segment of the pollution control industry. As a participant in the on-site treatment, storage and disposal market and the off-site treatment and services market, we are subject to rigorous federal, state and local regulations. These regulations mandate strict compliance and therefore are a cost and concern to us. Because of their integral role in providing quality environmental services, we make every reasonable attempt to maintain complete compliance with these regulations; however, even with a diligent commitment, we, along with many of our competitors, may be required to pay fines for violations or investigate and potentially remediate our waste management facilities.\n\nWe routinely use third party disposal companies, who ultimately destroy, or secure landfill residual materials generated at our facilities or at a client’s site. In the past, numerous third-party disposal sites have improperly managed waste and consequently require remedial action; consequently, any party utilizing these sites may be liable for some or all of the remedial costs. Despite our aggressive compliance and auditing procedures for disposal of wastes, we could further be notified, in the future, that we are a PRP at a remedial action site, which could have a material adverse effect.\n\nWe have three environmental remediation projects, all within our discontinued operations, which principally entail the removal/remediation of contaminated soil, and, in most cases, the remediation of surrounding ground water. We expect to fund the expenses to remediate these sites from funds generated from operations. As of September 30, 2024, we had total accrued environmental remediation liabilities of $767,000, a decrease of approximately $78,000 from the December 31, 2023, balance of $845,000. The decrease represents payments for remediation projects. At September 30, 2024, $1,000 of the total accrued environmental liabilities was recorded as current.\n\n**Item 3.** | **Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks**  \n---|---  \n  \nNot required for smaller reporting companies.\n\n**Item 4.** | **Controls and Procedures**  \n---|---  \n(a) | _Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures._  \nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management. As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer. Based on this recent assessment, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) were not effective as of September 30, 2024, due to the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described below. _Material Weakness_ A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In the period ended September 30, 2024, management identified a material weakness related to the precision level needed in order to properly evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets. This material weakness resulted in an income tax valuation adjustment recorded during the quarter. The necessary level of precision was not applied when evaluating the need for a valuation allowance. The error was corrected by management in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of September 30, 2024, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The material weakness noted did not result in a material misstatement in our previously issued financial statements, nor in the financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. _Management’s Plan to Remediate the Material Weakness_ Our management is committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment. As it relates to the material weakness identified, we have enhanced our management and precision level of review control activities in order to evaluate the income tax valuation allowance in subsequent reporting periods. In addition, if deemed necessary, we will retain a third-party specialist to review management’s valuation allowance conclusions.  \n(b)  | _Changes in internal control over financial reporting._  \nOther than the identification of the material weakness and the related remediation plan described above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  \n  \n37  \n---  \n  \n**PART II – OTHER INFORMATION**\n\n**Item 1.** | **Legal Proceedings**  \n---|---  \n  \nThere are no material legal proceedings pending against us and/or our subsidiaries not previously reported by us in Item 3 of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Additionally, there has been no other material change in legal proceedings previously disclosed by us in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n**Item 1A.** | **Risk Factors**  \n---|---  \n  \nThere is no other material change from the risk factors previously disclosed in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, except as follows:\n\nThe following additional Risk Factor under “Risks Relating to our Business and Operations” is as follows:\n\n**We have sustained losses during 2024.**\n\nThe Company sustained substantial losses during the first nine months of 2024. We believe that our results of operations should substantially improve in 2025. If, however, we fail to become profitable on an annualized basis in the foreseeable future, this could have a material adverse effect on our operations, credit facility, liquidity and potential growth.\n\nThe following additional Risk Factor under “General Risk Factors” is as follows:\n\n**Failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or failure to remediate a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and stock price.**\n\nMaintaining effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and is important in helping to prevent financial fraud. If we are unable to maintain adequate internal controls, our business and operating results could be harmed. We are required to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of Sarbanes Oxley and the related rules of the Commission, which require, among other things, management to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\n\nIn the period ended September 30, 2024, management identified a material weakness related to the precision level needed in order to properly evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on its U.S. deferred tax assets. This material weakness resulted in an income tax valuation adjustment recorded during the quarter. The necessary level of precision was not applied when evaluating the need for a valuation allowance. The error was corrected by management in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of September 30, 2024, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The material weakness noted did not result in a material misstatement in our previously issued financial statements, nor in the financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We have implemented a plan to remediate this material weakness.\n\nIf we are unable to maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting and/or remediate any material weakness identified, there is a reasonable possibility that a misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected in a timely manner. If we cannot produce reliable financial reports, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, the market price of our Common Stock could decline significantly, and our business, financial condition, and reputation could be harmed.\n\n**Item 6.** | **Exhibits**  \n---|---  \n(a) | **Exhibits**  \n4.1 | [Revised Second Amended and Restated Revolving Credit, Term Loan and Security Agreement referenced as Annex A in the Fifth Amendment, as incorporated by reference from Exhibit 4.2 to the Company’s Form 8-K filed on August 29, 2022.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/891532/000149315222024259/ex4-2.htm)  \n---|---  \n4.2 | [Eighth Amendment to Second Amended and Restated Revolving Credit, Term Loan and Security Agreement dated May 8, 2024, between Perma-Fix Environmental Services, Inc. and PNC Bank, National Association, as incorporated by reference from Exhibit 4.1 to the Company Form 10-Q for the first quarter 2024, filed on May 9, 2024.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/891532/000149315224018390/ex4-1.htm)  \n4.3 | [Ninth Amendment to Second Amended and Restated Revolving Credit, Term Loan and Security Agreement, dated November 12, 2024, between Perma-Fix Environmental Services, Inc. and PNC Bank, National Association](ex4-3.htm)  \n31.1 | [Certification by Mark Duff, Chief Executive Officer of the Company pursuant to Rule 13a-14(a) or 15d-14(a).](ex31-1.htm)  \n31.2 | [Certification by Ben Naccarato, Chief Financial Officer of the Company pursuant to Rule 13a-14(a) or 15d-14(a).](ex31-2.htm)  \n32.1 | [Certification by Mark Duff, Chief Executive Officer of the Company furnished pursuant to 18 U.S.C.

BUSINESS\nCompany Overview and Principal Products and Services\nPerma-Fix Environmental Services, Inc. (the Company, which may be referred to as we, us, or our), a\nDelaware corporation incorporated in December 1990, is an environmental and environmental technology\nknow-how company.\nThe principal element of our business strategy consists of upgrading our facilities within our Treatment\nSegment to increase efficiency and modernize and expand treatment capabilities to meet the changing\nmarkets associated with the waste management industry. Within our Services Segment, we continue to\nincrease competitive procurement effectiveness and broaden the market penetration within both the\ncommercial and government sectors. We continue to increase our focus on expansion into both commercial\nand international markets (see “Foreign Revenue and Initiatives” below for further discussion of a recently\nwon foreign contract) to supplement government spending in the United States of America (“USA”), from\nwhich a significant portion of our revenue is derived. This includes new services, new customers and\nincreased market share in our current markets.\nWe experienced significant improvement in our 2023 financial results as the lingering effects of COVID-19\nbegan to subside starting in the early part of 2022. Our Treatment Segment continued to see steady\nimprovements in waste receipts from certain customers who had previously delayed waste shipments due, in\npart, from the impact of COVID-19. Within our Services Segment, certain projects which were\ndelayed/curtailed in the first part of 2022 due, in part, from the lingering effects of the COVID-19, achieved\nfull operational status and improved productivity in 2023 which positively impacted revenue. Revenues\nfrom both of our Segments were also positively impacted from contracts won in 2023 as procurement and\nplanning on behalf of our government clients continued to progress as the lingering effects of COVID-19\npandemic subsided.\nHeading into 2024, we expect to see overall continue steady improvements in waste receipts and increases\nin project work from certain existing contracts, contracts won in 2023, and bids submitted in both segments\nthat are awaiting awards. However, due to our operations which is subject to seasonal factor, we generally\nexperience lower revenue in the first quarter due to overall reduced activities by our customers from the\nusual slowdown in operations due, in part, from returning from the holiday periods and poorer weather\nconditions. Additionally, due to Congress’s inability to timely approve FY 2024 budget and the extension of\nthe continuing resolution, certain of our government related customers have informed us that waste\nshipments will likely be delayed. Although we expect to see overall improvements in revenue in 2024 as\ndisclosed above, if Congress is unable to enact the full FY 2024 appropriation bills or further extend the\ncontinuing resolutions to fund government spending by the late March deadline, the U.S. government will\nenter into a partial shutdown. The full impact of any additional continued resolution beyond March or a\npartial government shutdown is uncertain. If a partial government shutdown were to occur and were to\ncontinue an extended period, our financial results of operations could be negatively impacted by delays in\nprocurement actions, waste shipments and project delays on newly awarded projects (See “Item 7.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – for a full\ndiscussion of the Company’s results of operations for 2023).\nSegment Information and Foreign and Domestic Operations and Sales\nFor 2023, we have two reportable segments. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board\n(“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 280, “Segment Reporting”, we define an operating\nsegment as:\n a business activity from which we may earn revenue and incur expenses;\n whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker “(CODM”) to\nmake decisions about resources to be allocated and assess its performance; and\n for which discrete financial information is available.\n1\nTREATMENT SEGMENT reporting includes:\n- nuclear, low-level radioactive, mixed (waste containing both hazardous and low-level radioactive\nwaste), hazardous and non-hazardous waste treatment, processing and disposal services primarily\nthrough four uniquely licensed (Nuclear Regulatory Commission or state equivalent) and permitted\n(U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) or state equivalent) treatment and storage facilities\nas follow: Perma-Fix of Florida, Inc. (“PFF”), Diversified Scientific Services, Inc., (“DSSI”),\nPerma-Fix Northwest Richland, Inc. (“PFNWR”) and Oak Ridge Environmental Waste Operations\nCenter (“EWOC”); and\n- Research & Development (“R&D”) activities to identify, develop and implement innovative waste\nprocessing techniques for problematic waste streams.\nFor 2023, the Treatment Segment accounted for $43,477,000, or 48.5%, of total revenue, as compared to\n$33,358,000, or 47.2%, of total revenue for 2022. See “Dependence Upon a Single or Few Customers” for\nfurther details and a discussion as to our Segments’ contracts with government clients (domestic) or with\nothers as a subcontractor to government clients.\nSERVICES SEGMENT, which includes:\n- Technical services, which include:\no professional radiological measurement and site survey of large government and commercial\ninstallations using advanced methods, technology and engineering;\no health physics services including health physicists, radiological engineers, nuclear\nengineers and health physics technicians support to government and private radioactive\nmaterials licensees;\no integrated Occupational Safety and Health services including industrial hygiene (“IH”)\nassessments; hazardous materials surveys, e.g., exposure monitoring; lead and asbestos\nmanagement/abatement oversight; indoor air quality evaluations; health risk and exposure\nassessments; health & safety plan/program development, compliance auditing and training\nservices; and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) citation assistance;\no global technical services providing consulting, engineering (civil, nuclear, mechanical,\nchemical, radiological and environmental), project management, waste management,\nenvironmental, and decontamination and decommissioning (“D&D”) field, technical, and\nmanagement personnel and services to commercial and government customers; and\no waste management services to commercial and governmental customers.\n- Nuclear services, which include:\no D&D of government and commercial facilities impacted with radioactive material and\nhazardous constituents including engineering, technology applications, specialty services,\nlogistics, transportation, processing and disposal; and\no license termination support of radioactive material licensed and federal facilities over the\nentire cycle of the termination process: project management, planning, characterization,\nwaste stream identification and delineation, remediation/demolition, final status survey,\ncompliance demonstration, reporting, transportation, disposal and emergency response.\n- A company owned equipment calibration and maintenance laboratory that services, maintains,\ncalibrates, and sources (i.e., rental) health physics, IH and customized nuclear, environmental, and\noccupational safety and health (“NEOSH”) instrumentation.\nFor 2023, the Services Segment accounted for $46,258,000, or 51.5%, of total revenue, as compared to\n$37,241,000, or 52.8%, of total revenue for 2022. See “Dependence Upon a Single or Few Customers” for\nfurther details and a discussion as to our Segments’ contracts with government clients (domestic) or with\nothers as a subcontractor to government clients.\nOur Treatment and Services Segments provide services primarily to research institutions, commercial\ncompanies, public utilities, and governmental entities, including the U.S. Department of Energy (“DOE”)\nand U.S. Department of Defense (“DOD”). The distribution channels for our services are through direct\nsales to customers or via intermediaries.\n2\nOur corporate office is located at 8302 Dunwoody Place, Suite 250, Atlanta, Georgia 30350.\nForeign Revenue and Initiative\nAs noted previously, we continue to increase our focus on expansion into international markets.\nOn December 18, 2023, the joint venture (“JV”) where we and Campoverde Srl (“JV partner”) each owns\n50% of the partnership, was awarded a multi-year contract valued up to approximately EUR 50 million by\nthe European Commission (the “Contracting Authority”) for the treatment of radioactive waste from the\nJoint Research Center in Ispra, Italy. Work under this JV has not started as of December 31, 2023. The\nscope of work to be performed in the initial phases of this contract will be performed predominately by our\nJV partner. Revenue generated by us under the initial phases will be limited to project management support\nthrough 2025. We expect to generate an increase in revenue under this contract starting in 2026 when the\nwaste treatment phases begin. The Contracting Authority may terminate the contract under certain\nconditions as set forth in the contract.\nDuring March 2022, we signed a non-binding joint venture term sheet addressing plans to partner with\nSpringfields Fuels Limited (“SFL”), an affiliate of Westinghouse Electric Company LLC, to develop and\nmanage a nuclear waste-materials treatment facility (the “Facility”) in the United Kingdom. The Facility is\nfor the purpose of expanding the partners’ waste treatment capabilities for the European nuclear market. It is\nexpected that upon finalization of a partnership agreement, SFL will have an ownership interest of fifty-five\n(55) percent and our interest will be forty-five (45) percent. The finalization, form and capitalization of this\nunpopulated partnership is subject to numerous conditions, including but not limited to, completion and\nexecution of a definitive agreement and facility design, granting of required regulatory, lender or permitting\napprovals and updated cost and profitability analysis based on current and forecast future economic\nconditions. Upon finalization of this venture, we will be required to make an investment in this venture. The\namount of our investment, the period of which it is to be made and the method of funding are to be\ndetermined.\nOur consolidated revenue for 2023 and 2022 included approximately $2,066,000, or 2.3%, and $1,226,000,\nor 1.7%, respectively, from foreign customers.\nSeasonal Factors of our Business\nOur operations are generally subject to seasonal factors. See “Risk Factors – Risks Related to our Business\nand Operations – Our operations are subject to seasonal factors, which causes our revenues to fluctuate” for\na discussion of our seasonal factors.\nPermits and Licenses\nWaste management service companies are subject to extensive, evolving and increasingly stringent federal,\nstate, and local environmental laws and regulations. Such federal, state and local environmental laws and\nregulations govern our activities regarding the treatment, storage, processing, disposal and transportation of\nhazardous, non-hazardous and radioactive wastes, and require us to obtain and maintain permits, licenses\nand/or approvals in order to conduct our waste activities. We are dependent on our permits and licenses\ndiscussed below in order to operate our businesses. Failure to obtain and maintain our permits or approvals\nwould have a material adverse effect on us, our operations, and financial condition. The permits and licenses\nhave terms ranging from one to ten years, and provide that we maintain a reasonable level of compliance,\nrenew with minimal effort, and cost. We believe that these permit and license requirements represent a\npotential barrier to entry for possible competitors.\nPFF, located in Gainesville, Florida, operates its hazardous, mixed and low-level radioactive waste activities\nunder a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) Part B permit, Toxic Substances Control Act\n(“TSCA”) authorization, Restricted RX Drug Distributor-Destruction license, biomedical, and a radioactive\nmaterials license issued by the State of Florida. Co-regulated TSCA Polychlorinated Biphenyl (“PCB”)\nwastes are also managed for PCB under EPA Approval.\nDSSI, located in Kingston, Tennessee, conducts mixed and low-level radioactive waste storage and\ntreatment activities under RCRA Part B permits and a radioactive materials license issued by the State of\n3\nTennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, Division of radiological health. Co-regulated\nTSCA PCB wastes are also managed for PCB destruction under EPA Approval.\nPFNWR, located in Richland, Washington, operates a low-level radioactive waste processing facility as\nwell as a mixed waste processing facility. Radioactive material processing is authorized under radioactive\nmaterials licenses issued by the State of Washington and mixed waste processing is additionally authorized\nunder a RCRA Part B permit. Co-regulated TSCA PCB wastes are also managed for PCB under EPA\nApproval.\nEWOC, located in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, operates a low-level radioactive waste material processing\nfacility. Radioactive material processing is authorized under radioactive material licenses issued by the State\nof Tennessee Department of Environmental and Conservation, Division of radiological health.\nThe combination of RCRA Part B hazardous waste permits, TSCA authorizations, and radioactive material\nlicenses held by us and our subsidiaries comprising our Treatment Segment is very difficult to obtain for a\nsingle facility and make this Segment unique.\nWe believe that the permitting and licensing requirements, and the cost to obtain such permits, are barriers\nto the entry of hazardous waste and radioactive and mixed waste activities as presently operated by our\nwaste treatment subsidiaries. If the permit requirements for hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal\n(“TSD”) activities and/or the licensing requirements for the handling of low-level radioactive matters are\neliminated or if such licenses or permits were made less rigorous to obtain, we believe such would allow\ncompanies to enter into these markets and provide greater competition.\nNumber of Employees\nAt December 31, 2023, we employed approximately 297 employees, of whom 288 are full-time employees\nand 9 are part-time/temporary employees. None of our current employees are unionized.\nThe Company entered into a Project Labor Agreement (“PLA”) dated June 21, 2023, with UA Plumbers &\nSteamfitters Local 598. The goal of this partnership is to supply our PFNWR facility with the organized\nlabor force needed to take on the challenges of providing a supplement treatment alternative to include\nconcrete-like grout for Hanford's Low Activity Tank Waste if and when the DOE grants a contract to\nPFNWR to treat the Low Activity Tank Waste. This supplemental capability would support DOE’s\nglassifying process provided by the Hanford Vitrification Plant for safe transport and disposal off-site.\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”)\nWe have a ESG subcommittee under our Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee to provide\nguidance on ESG management. Our executive team is responsible for the continuing development of our\nESG strategic roadmap with support from management from key functional areas. The key areas of focus\nunder our ESG initiatives continue to be health and safety, environmental performance, DEI (diversity,\nequality and inclusion), talent retention and development, corporate governance and climate-forward service\ndevelopment that support our customers’ transition to low carbon economy. Our executive team is involved\nin policy planning and coordination of corporate-wide ESG efforts. See our website at https://www.perma-\nfix.com/esg.aspx for some highlights of our ESG initiatives as well as our policies under our ESG as we\ncontinue to improve our ESG initiatives. The information on our website is not part of, or incorporated by\nreference in this Form 10-K.\nDependence Upon a Single or Few Customers\nOur Treatment and Services Segments have significant relationships with the U.S. governmental authorities.\nA significant amount of our revenues from our Treatment and Services Segments are generated indirectly as\nsubcontractors for others who are prime contractors to government authorities, particularly the DOE and\nDOD, or directly as the prime contractor to government authorities. The contracts that we are a party to with\nothers as subcontractors to the U.S federal government or directly with the U.S federal government\ngenerally provide that the government may terminate the contract at any time for convenience at the\ngovernment’s option. Our inability to continue under existing contracts that we have with U.S government\n4\nauthorities (directly or indirectly as a subcontractor) or significant reductions in the level of governmental\nfunding in any given year could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial condition.\nWe performed services relating to waste generated by government clients (domestic), either indirectly for\nothers as a subcontractor to government entities or directly as a prime contractor to government entities,\nrepresenting approximately $70,642,000 or 78.7%, of our total revenue during 2023, as compared to\n$59,658,000, or 84.5%, of our total revenue during 2022.\nOur revenues are project/event based where the completion of one contract with a specific customer may be\nreplaced by another contract with a different customer from year to year.\nCompetitive Conditions\nThe Treatment Segment’s largest competitor is EnergySolutions which operates treatment facilities in Oak\nRidge, TN and Erwin, TN and treatment/disposal facilities for low level radioactive waste in Clive, UT and\nBarnwell, SC. Waste Control Specialists, which has licensed treatment/disposal capabilities for low level\nradioactive waste in Andrews, TX, is also a competitor in the treatment market with increasing market\nshare. These two competitors also provide us with options for disposal of our treated nuclear waste. The\nTreatment Segment treats and disposes of DOE generated waste largely at DOE owned sites. Our Treatment\nSegment currently solicits business primarily on a North America basis with both government and\ncommercial clients; however, we continue to focus on emerging international markets for additional work.\nOur Services Segment is engaged in highly competitive businesses in which a number of our government\ncontracts and some of our commercial contracts are awarded through competitive bidding processes. The\nextent of such competition varies according to the industries and markets in which our customers operate as\nwell as the geographic areas in which we operate. The degree and type of competition we face is also often\ninfluenced by the project specification being bid on and the different specialty skill sets of each bidder for\nwhich our Services Segment competes, especially projects subject to the governmental bid process. We also\nhave the ability to prime federal government small business procurements (small business set asides).\nBased on past experience, we believe that large businesses are more willing to team with small businesses in\norder to be part of these often-substantial procurements. There are a number of qualified small businesses in\nour market that will provide intense competition that may provide a challenge to our ability to maintain\nstrong growth rates and acceptable profit margins. For international business there are additional\ncompetitors, many from within the country the work is to be performed, making winning work in foreign\ncountries more challenging. If our Services Segment is unable to meet these competitive challenges, it could\nlose market share and experience an overall reduction in its profits.\nCertain Environmental Expenditures and Potential Environmental Liabilities\nEnvironmental Liabilities\nWe have three remediation projects, which are currently in progress relating to our Perma-Fix of Dayton,\nInc. (“PFD”), Perma-Fix of Memphis, Inc. (“PFM”), and Perma-Fix South Georgia, Inc. (“PFSG”)\nsubsidiaries, which are all included within our discontinued operations. These remediation projects\nprincipally entail the removal/remediation of contaminated soil and, in most cases, the remediation of\nsurrounding ground water. These remediation activities are closely reviewed and monitored by the\napplicable state regulators.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had total accrued environmental remediation liabilities of $845,000, a\ndecrease of $16,000 from the December 31, 2022, balance of $861,000. The decrease represents payments\nfor remediation projects. As of December 31, 2023, $61,000 of the total accrued environmental liabilities\nwas recorded as current.\nThe nature of our business exposes us to significant cost to comply with governmental environmental laws,\nrules and regulations and risk of liability for damages. Such potential liability could involve, for example,\nclaims for cleanup costs, personal injury or damage to the environment in cases where we are held\nresponsible for the release of hazardous materials; claims of employees, customers or third parties for\npersonal injury or property damage occurring in the course of our operations; and claims alleging\nnegligence or professional errors or omissions in the planning or performance of our services. In addition,\n5\nwe could be deemed a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) for the costs of required cleanup of properties,\nwhich may be contaminated by hazardous substances generated or transported by us to a site we selected,\nincluding properties owned or leased by us. We could also be subject to fines and civil penalties in\nconnection with violations of regulatory requirements.\nR&D\nInnovation and technical know-how by our operations is very important to the success of our business. Our\ngoal is to discover, develop and bring to market innovative ways to process waste that address unmet\nenvironmental needs. We conduct research internally, and also through collaborations with other third\nparties. The majority of our research activities are performed as we receive new and unique waste to treat.\nOur competitors also devote resources to R&D and many such competitors have greater resources at their\ndisposal than we do. R&D totaled $561,000 and $336,000 for 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nGovernmental Regulation\nEnvironmental companies, such as us, and their customers are subject to extensive and evolving\nenvironmental laws and regulations by a number of federal, state and local environmental, safety and health\nagencies, the principal of which being the EPA. These laws and regulations largely contribute to the demand\nfor our services. Although our customers remain responsible by law for their environmental problems, we\nmust also comply with the requirements of those laws applicable to our services. We cannot predict the\nextent to which our operations may be affected by future enforcement policies as applied to existing laws or\nby the enactment of new environmental laws and regulations. Moreover, any predictions regarding possible\nliability are further complicated by the fact that under current environmental laws we could be jointly and\nseverally liable for certain activities of third parties over whom we have little or no control. Although we\nbelieve that we are currently in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we could be\nsubject to fines, penalties or other liabilities or could be adversely affected by existing or subsequently\nenacted laws or regulations. The principal environmental laws affecting our customers and us are briefly\ndiscussed below.\nThe Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended (“RCRA”)\nRCRA and its associated regulations establish a strict and comprehensive permitting and regulatory program\napplicable to companies, such as us, that treat, store or dispose of hazardous waste. The EPA has\npromulgated regulations under RCRA for new and existing treatment, storage and disposal facilities\nincluding incinerators, storage and treatment tanks, storage containers, storage and treatment surface\nimpoundments, waste piles and landfills. Every facility that treats, stores or disposes of hazardous waste\nmust obtain a RCRA permit or must obtain interim status from the EPA, or a state agency, which has been\nauthorized by the EPA to administer its program, and must comply with certain operating, financial\nresponsibility and closure requirements.\nThe Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA,”\nalso referred to as the “Superfund Act”)\nCERCLA governs the cleanup of sites at which hazardous substances are located or at which hazardous\nsubstances have been released or are threatened to be released into the environment. CERCLA authorizes\nthe EPA to compel responsible parties to clean up sites and provides for punitive damages for\nnoncompliance. CERCLA imposes joint and several liabilities for the costs of clean up and damages to\nnatural resources.\nHealth and Safety Regulations\nThe operation of our environmental activities is subject to the requirements of the OSHA and comparable\nstate laws. Regulations promulgated under OSHA by the Department of Labor require employers of persons\nin the transportation and environmental industries, including independent contractors, to implement hazard\ncommunications, work practices and personnel protection programs in order to protect employees from\nequipment safety hazards and exposure to hazardous chemicals.\nAtomic Energy Act\nThe Atomic Energy Act of 1954 governs the safe handling and use of Source, Special Nuclear and\nByproduct materials in the U.S. and its territories. This act authorized the Atomic Energy Commission (now\n6\nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission “USNRC”) to enter into “Agreements with states to carry out those\nregulatory functions in those respective states except for Nuclear Power Plants and federal facilities like the\nVA hospitals and the DOE operations.” The State of Florida Department of Health (with the USNRC\noversight), Office of Radiation Control, regulates the licensing and radiological program of the PFF facility;\nthe State of Tennessee (with the USNRC oversight), Tennessee Division of Radiological Health, regulates\nlicensing and the radiological program of the DSSI facility and the EWOC facility; and the State of\nWashington (with the USNRC oversight) Department of Health, regulates licensing and the radiological\noperations of the PFNWR facility.\nOther Laws\nOur activities are subject to other federal environmental protection and similar laws, including, without\nlimitation, the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act and the\nTSCA. Many states have also adopted laws for the protection of the environment which may affect us,\nincluding laws governing the generation, handling, transportation and disposition of hazardous substances\nand laws governing the investigation and cleanup of, and liability for, contaminated sites. Some of these\nstate provisions are broader and more stringent than existing federal law and regulations. Our failure to\nconform our services to the requirements of any of these other applicable federal or state laws could subject\nus to substantial liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on us, our operations and financial\ncondition. In addition to various federal, state and local environmental regulations, our hazardous waste\ntransportation activities are regulated by the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Interstate Commerce\nCommission and transportation regulatory bodies in the states in which we operate. We cannot predict the\nextent to which we may be affected by any law or rule that may be enacted or enforced in the future, or any\nnew or different interpretations of existing laws or rules.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following are certain risk factors that could affect our business, financial performance, and results of\noperations. These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward-looking\nstatements contained in this Form 10-K, as the forward-looking statements are based on current\nexpectations, and actual results and conditions could differ materially from the current expectations.\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk, and before making an investment decision, you\nshould carefully consider these risk factors as well as other information we include or incorporate by\nreference in the other reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”).\nRisks Relating to our Business and Operations\nFailure to maintain our financial assurance coverage that we are required to have in order to operate\nour permitted treatment, storage and disposal facilities could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe maintain finite risk insurance policies and bonding mechanisms which provide financial assurance to\nthe applicable states for our permitted facilities in the event of unforeseen closure of those facilities. We are\nrequired to provide and to maintain financial assurance that guarantees to the state that in the event of\nclosure, our permitted facilities will be closed in accordance with the regulations. In the event that we are\nunable to obtain or maintain our financial assurance coverage for any reason, this could materially impact\nour operations and our permits which we are required to have in order to operate our treatment, storage, and\ndisposal facilities.\nIf we cannot maintain adequate insurance coverage, we will be unable to continue certain operations.\nOur business exposes us to various risks, including claims for causing damage to property and injuries to\npersons that may involve allegations of negligence or professional errors or omissions in the performance of\nour services. Such claims could be substantial. We believe that our insurance coverage is presently adequate\nand similar to, or greater than, the coverage maintained by other companies in the industry of our size. If\nwe are unable to obtain adequate or required insurance coverage in the future, or if our insurance is not\navailable at affordable rates, we would violate our permit conditions and other requirements of the\nenvironmental laws, rules, and regulations under which we operate. Such violations would render us unable\nto continue certain of our operations. These events would have a material adverse effect on our financial\ncondition.\n7\nThe inability to maintain existing government contracts or win new government contracts over an\nextended period could have a material adverse effect on our operations and adversely affect our\nfuture revenues.\nA material amount of our Treatment and Services Segments’ revenues are generated through various\ngovernment contracts or subcontracts. Most of our government contracts or our subcontracts granted under\ngovernment contracts are awarded through a regulated competitive bidding process. Some government\ncontracts are awarded to multiple competitors, which increase overall competition and pricing pressure and\nmay require us to make sustained post-award efforts to realize revenues under these government contracts.\nContracts with, or subcontracts involving, the U.S federal government are generally terminable for\nconvenience at any time at the option of the governmental agency. The multi-year contract that was awarded\nto us and our JV partner, Campoverde Srl, by the European Commission (the “Contracting Authority”) on\nDecember 18, 2023, for the treatment of radioactive waste from the Joint Research Center in Ispra, Italy as\ndiscussed previously may be terminated by the Contracting Authority under certain conditions as set forth in\nthe contract. If we fail to maintain or replace these relationships, or if a material contract is terminated or\nrenegotiated in a manner that is materially adverse to us, our revenues and future operations could be\nmaterially adversely affected.\nOur existing and future customers may reduce or halt their spending on hazardous waste and nuclear\nservices with outside vendors, including us.\nA variety of factors may cause our existing or future customers (including government clients) to reduce or\nhalt their spending on hazardous waste and nuclear services from outside vendors, including us. These\nfactors include, but are not limited to:\n accidents, terrorism, natural disasters or other incidents occurring at nuclear facilities or involving\nshipments of nuclear materials;\n failure of government to approve necessary budgets, or to reduce the amount of the budget\nnecessary, to fund remediation sites, including DOE and DOD sites;\n government shut-downs;\n civic opposition to or changes in government policies regarding nuclear operations;\n a reduction in demand for nuclear generating capacity; or\n failure to perform under existing contracts, directly or indirectly, with the government.\nThese events could result in or cause government clients to terminate or cancel existing contracts involving\nus to treat, store or dispose of contaminated waste and/or to perform remediation projects, at one or more of\ngovernment sites. These events also could adversely affect us to the extent that they result in the reduction\nor elimination of contractual requirements, lower demand for nuclear services, burdensome regulation,\ndisruptions of shipments or production, increased operational costs or difficulties or increased liability for\nactual or threatened property damage or personal injury.\nEconomic downturns, reductions in government funding or other events beyond our control could\nhave a material negative impact on our businesses.\nDemand for our services has been, and we expect that demand will continue to be, subject to significant\nfluctuations due to a variety of factors beyond our control, including, without limitation, economic\nconditions, reductions in the budget for spending to remediate federal sites due to numerous reasons\nincluding, without limitation, the substantial deficits that the federal government has and is continuing to\nincur. During economic downturns, large budget deficits that the federal government and many states are\nexperiencing, and other events beyond our control, including, but not limited to the impact from public\nhealth events (such as COVID-19), the ability of private and government entities to spend on waste services,\nincluding nuclear services, may decline significantly. Our operations depend, in large part, upon\ngovernmental funding (for example, the annual budget of the DOE) or specifically mandated levels for\ndifferent programs that are important to our business could have a material adverse impact on our business,\nfinancial position, results of operations and cash flow.\nThe loss of one or a few customers could have an adverse effect on us.\nOne or a few governmental customers or governmental related customers have in the past, and may in the\n8\nfuture, account for a significant portion of our revenue in any one year or over a period of several\nconsecutive years. Because customers generally contract with us for specific projects, we may lose these\nsignificant customers from year to year as their projects with us are completed. Our inability to replace the\nbusiness with other similar significant projects could have an adverse effect on our business and results of\noperations.\nWe are a holding company and depend, in large part, on receiving funds from our subsidiaries to\nfund our indebtedness.\nBecause we are a holding company and operations are conducted through our subsidiaries, our ability to\nmeet our obligations depends, in large part, on the operating performance and cash flows of our subsidiaries.\nOur Treatment Segment has limited end disposal sites to utilize to dispose of its waste which could\nsignificantly impact our results of operations.\nOur Treatment Segment has limited options available for disposal of our nuclear waste. Currently, there are\nonly four commercial disposal sites for our low-level radioactive waste and six commercial disposal sites\nfor our very low-level activity waste we receive from non-governmental sites, allowing us to take advantage\nof the pricing competition between these sites. If one or more of these commercial disposal sites ceases to\naccept waste or closes for any reason or refuses to accept the waste of our Treatment Segment, for any\nreason, we would have limited remaining site to dispose of our nuclear waste. With limited end disposal\nsite to dispose of our waste, we could be subject to significantly increased costs which could negatively\nimpact our results of operations.\nDirect and indirect macroeconomic impacts resulting from natural disasters, public health events\nand/or world conflicts in various regions could continue to and may in the future negatively impact\nour business and results of operations.\nPublic health threats and outbreaks such as COVID-19 and natural disasters such as hurricanes and severe\nweather conditions have previously negatively impacted our results of operations. The direct impacts of\nthese such events resulted in delayed waste shipments from certain of our customers and delays in\nprocurement, contract awards and planning on behalf of our government clients which negatively impacted\nour revenue. Residual and lingering macroeconomic effects from these such events could again in the future\nimpact supply chain, workforce availability, and/or increased costs which could have a downward effect on\nour business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, world conflicts currently occurring\nin various regions may lead to similar macroeconomic effects which could have a downward effect on our\nbusiness, financial conditions and results of operations. We may attempt to increase our sales prices in order\nto maintain satisfactory margin; however, competitive pressures in our industry may have the effect of\ninhibiting our ability to reflect these increased costs in the prices of our services that we provide to our\ncustomers and therefore reduce our profitability.\nOur operations are subject to seasonal factors, which cause our revenues to fluctuate.\nWe have historically experienced reduced revenues and losses during the first and fourth quarters of our\nfiscal years due to a seasonal slowdown in operations from poor weather conditions, overall reduced\nactivities during these periods resulting from holiday periods, and finalization of government budgets during\nthe fourth quarter of each year. During our second and third fiscal quarters there has historically been an\nincrease in revenues and operating profits. If we do not continue to have increased revenues and profitability\nduring the second and third fiscal quarters, this could have a material adverse effect on our results of\noperations and liquidity.\nWe are engaged in highly competitive businesses and typically must bid against other competitors to\nobtain major contracts.\nWe are engaged in highly competitive business in which most of our government contracts and some of our\ncommercial contracts are awarded through competitive bidding processes. We compete with national,\nregional firms and some international firms with nuclear and/or hazardous waste services practices, as well\nas small or local contractors. Some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do,\nwhich can give them a competitive advantage. In addition, even if we are qualified to work on a new\ngovernment contract, we might not be awarded the contract because of existing government policies\ndesigned to protect certain types of businesses and under-represented minority contractors. Although we\n9\nbelieve we have the ability to certify and bid government contract as a small business, there are a number of\nqualified small businesses in our market that will provide intense competition. For international business,\nwhich we continue to focus on, there are additional competitors, many from within the country the work is\nto be performed, making winning work in foreign countries more challenging. Competition places\ndownward pressure on our contract prices and profit margins. If we are unable to meet these competitive\nchallenges, we could lose market share and experience on overall reduction in our profits.\nWe bear the risk of cost overruns in fixed-price contracts. We may experience reduced profits or, in\nsome cases, losses under these contracts if costs increase above our estimates.\nOur revenues may be earned under contracts that are fixed-price or maximum price in nature. Fixed-price\ncontracts expose us to a number of risks not inherent in cost-reimbursable contracts. Under fixed price and\nguaranteed maximum-price contracts, contract prices are established in part on cost and scheduling\nestimates which are based on a number of assumptions, including assumptions about future economic\nconditions, prices and availability of labor, equipment and materials, and other exigencies. If these estimates\nprove inaccurate, or if circumstances change such as unanticipated technical problems, difficulties in\nobtaining permits or approvals, changes in laws or labor conditions, supply chain interruptions, weather\ndelays, cost of raw materials, our suppliers’ or subcontractors’ inability to perform, and/or other events\nbeyond our control, such as the impact of public health events, cost overruns may occur and we could\nexperience reduced profits or, in some cases, a loss for that project. Errors or ambiguities as to contract\nspecifications can also lead to cost-overruns.\nAdequate bonding is necessary for us to win certain types of new work and support facility closure\nrequirements.\nWe are often required to provide performance bonds to customers under certain of our contracts, primarily\nwithin our Services Segment. These surety instruments indemnify the customer if we fail to perform our\nobligations under the contract. If a bond is required for a particular project and we are unable to obtain it\ndue to insufficient liquidity or other reasons, we may not be able to pursue that project. In addition, we\nprovide bonds to support financial assurance in the event of facility closure pursuant to state requirements.\nWe currently have a bonding facility but, the issuance of bonds under that facility is at the surety’s sole\ndiscretion. Moreover, due to events that affect the insurance and bonding markets generally, bonding may\nbe more difficult to obtain in the future or may only be available at significant additional cost. There can be\nno assurance that bonds will continue to be available to us on reasonable terms. Our inability to obtain\nadequate bonding and, as a result, to bid on new work could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nIf we cannot maintain our governmental permits or cannot obtain required permits, we may not be\nable to continue or expand our operations.\nWe are a nuclear services and waste management company. Our business is subject to extensive, evolving,\nand increasingly stringent federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations. Such federal, state,\nand local environmental laws and regulations govern our activities regarding the treatment, storage,\nrecycling, disposal, and transportation of hazardous and non-hazardous waste and low-level radioactive\nwaste. We must obtain and maintain permits or licenses to conduct these activities in compliance with such\nlaws and regulations. Failure to obtain and maintain the required permits or licenses would have a material\nadverse effect on our operations and financial condition. If any of our facilities are unable to maintain\ncurrently held permits or licenses or obtain any additional permits or licenses which may be required to\nconduct its operations, we may not be able to continue those operations at these facilities, which could have\na material adverse effect on us.\nRisks Related to Laws and Regulations\nAs a government contractor, we are subject to extensive government regulation, and our failure to\ncomply with applicable regulations could subject us to penalties that may restrict our ability to\nconduct our business.\nOur governmental contracts or subcontracts relating to DOE and DOD sites, are a significant part of our\nbusiness. Allowable costs under U.S. government contracts are subject to audit by the U.S. government. If\nthese audits result in determinations that costs claimed as reimbursable are not allowed costs or were not\n10\nallocated in accordance with applicable regulations, we could be required to reimburse the U.S. government\nfor amounts previously received.\nGovernmental contracts or subcontracts involving governmental facilities are often subject to specific\nprocurement regulations, contract provisions and a variety of other requirements relating to the formation,\nadministration, performance and accounting of these contracts. Many of these contracts include express or\nimplied certifications of compliance with applicable regulations and contractual provisions. If we fail to\ncomply with any regulations, requirements or statutes, our existing governmental contracts or subcontracts\ninvolving governmental facilities could be terminated or we could be suspended from government\ncontracting or subcontracting. If one or more of our governmental contracts or subcontracts are terminated\nfor any reason, or if we are suspended or debarred from government work, we could suffer a significant\nreduction in expected revenues and profits. Furthermore, as a result of our governmental contracts or\nsubcontracts involving governmental facilities, claims for civil or criminal fraud may be brought by the\ngovernment or violations of these regulations, requirements or statutes.\nChanges in environmental regulations and enforcement policies could subject us to additional liability\nand adversely affect our ability to continue certain operations.\nWe cannot predict the extent to which our operations may be affected by future governmental enforcement\npolicies as applied to existing environmental laws, by changes to current environmental laws and\nregulations, or by the enactment of new environmental laws and regulations. Any predictions regarding\npossible liability under such laws are complicated further by current environmental laws which provide that\nwe could be liable, jointly and severally, for certain activities of third parties over whom we have limited or\nno control.\nOur businesses subject us to substantial potential environmental liability.\nOur business of rendering services in connection with management of waste, including certain types of\nhazardous waste, low-level radioactive waste, and mixed waste (waste containing both hazardous and low-\nlevel radioactive waste), subjects us to risks of liability for damages. Such liability could involve, without\nlimitation:\n claims for clean-up costs, personal injury or damage to the environment in cases in which we are\nheld responsible for the release of hazardous or radioactive materials;\n claims of employees, customers, or third parties for personal injury or property damage occurring in\nthe course of our operations; and\n claims alleging negligence or professional errors or omissions in the planning or performance of our\nservices.\nOur operations are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations. We have in the past, and could\nin the future, be subject to substantial fines, penalties, and sanctions for violations of environmental laws\nand substantial expenditures as a responsible party for the cost of remediating any property which may be\ncontaminated by hazardous substances generated by us and disposed at such property, or transported by us\nto a site selected by us, including properties we own or lease.\nAs our operations expand, we may be subject to increased litigation, which could have a negative\nimpact on our future financial results.\nOur operations are highly regulated and we are subject to numerous laws and regulations regarding\nprocedures for waste treatment, storage, recycling, transportation, and disposal activities, all of which may\nprovide the basis for litigation against us. In recent years, the waste treatment industry has experienced a\nsignificant increase in so-called “toxic-tort” litigation as those injured by contamination seek to recover for\npersonal injuries or property damage. We believe that, as our operations and activities expand, there will be\na similar increase in the potential for litigation alleging that we have violated environmental laws or\nregulations or are responsible for contamination or pollution caused by our normal operations, negligence or\nother misconduct, or for accidents, which occur in the course of our business activities. Such litigation, if\nsignificant and not adequately insured against, could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability\nto fund our operations. Protracted litigation would likely cause us to spend significant amounts of our time,\n11\neffort, and money. This could prevent our management from focusing on our operations and expansion.\nIf environmental regulation or enforcement is relaxed, the demand for our services could decrease.\nThe demand for our services is substantially dependent upon the public's concern with, and the continuation\nand proliferation of, the laws and regulations governing the treatment, storage, recycling, and disposal of\nhazardous, non-hazardous, and low-level radioactive waste. A decrease in the level of public concern, the\nrepeal or modification of these laws, or any significant relaxation of regulations relating to the treatment,\nstorage, recycling, and disposal of hazardous waste and low-level radioactive waste could significantly\nreduce the demand for our services and could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial\ncondition. We are not aware of any current federal or state government or agency efforts in which a\nmoratorium or limitation has been, or will be, placed upon the creation of new hazardous or radioactive\nwaste regulations that would have a material adverse effect on us; however, no assurance can be made that\nsuch a moratorium or limitation will not be implemented in the future.\nWe and our customers operate in a politically sensitive environment, and the public perception of\nnuclear power and radioactive materials can affect our customers and us.\nWe and our customers operate in a politically sensitive environment. Opposition by third parties to\nparticular projects can limit the handling and disposal of radioactive materials. Adverse public reaction to\ndevelopments in the disposal of radioactive materials, including any high-profile incident involving the\ndischarge of radioactive materials, could directly affect our customers and indirectly affect our business.\nAdverse public reaction also could lead to increased regulation or outright prohibition, limitations on the\nactivities of our customers, more onerous operating requirements or other conditions that could have a\nmaterial adverse impact on our customers’ and our business.\nThe elimination or any modification of the Price-Anderson Acts indemnification authority could have\nadverse consequences for our business.\nThe Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, or the AEA, comprehensively regulates the manufacture, use,\nand storage of radioactive materials. The Price-Anderson Act (“PAA”) supports the nuclear services\nindustry by offering broad indemnification to DOE contractors for liabilities arising out of nuclear incidents\nat DOE nuclear facilities. That indemnification protects DOE prime contractor, but also similar companies\nthat work under contract or subcontract for a DOE prime contract or transporting radioactive material to or\nfrom a site. The indemnification authority of the DOE under the PAA was extended through 2025 by the\nEnergy Policy Act of 2005.\nUnder certain conditions, the PAA’s indemnification provisions may not apply to our processing of\nradioactive waste at governmental facilities, and may not apply to liabilities that we might incur while\nperforming services as a contractor for the DOE and the nuclear energy industry. If an incident or\nevacuation is not covered under PAA indemnification, we could be held liable for damages, regardless of\nfault, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. If such\nindemnification authority is not applicable in the future, our business could be adversely affected if the\nowners and operators of new facilities fail to retain our services in the absence of commercial adequate\ninsurance and indemnification.\nRisks Relating to our Financial Performance and Position and Need for Financing\nIf any of our permits, other intangible assets, and tangible assets becomes impaired, we may be\nrequired to record significant charges to earnings.\nUnder accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”), we review our\nintangible and tangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying\nvalue may not be recoverable. Our permits are tested for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be\nconsidered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our permit, other intangible\nassets, and tangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in stock price and market capitalization,\nreduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in our industry. We may be required, in the\nfuture, to record impairment charges in our financial statements, in which any impairment of our permit,\nother intangible assets and tangible assets is determined. Such impairment charges could negatively impact\n12\nour results of operations.\nBreach of any of the covenants in our credit facility could result in a default, triggering repayment of\noutstanding debt under the credit facility and the termination of our credit facility.\nOur credit facility with our bank contains financial covenants. A breach of any of these covenants could\nresult in a default under our credit facility triggering our lender to immediately require the repayment of all\noutstanding debt under our credit facility and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. We were\nnot required to perform testing of our fixed charge coverage ratio (“FCCR”) in the first quarter of 2023 but\notherwise met all of our other financial covenant requirements. We met all of our covenant requirements in\neach of the remaining quarters of 2023. In the past, when we failed to meet our minimum FCCR\nrequirement in certain instances, our lender has either waived these instances of non-compliance or provided\ncertain amendments to our FCCR requirements which enabled us to meet our quarterly FCCR requirements.\nAlso, our lender has in the past waived our FCCR testing requirement in certain quarters. If we fail to meet\nany of our financial covenants going forward, including the minimum quarterly FCCR requirement, and our\nlender does not waive the non-compliance or revise our covenant requirement so that we are in compliance,\nour lender could accelerate the payment of our borrowings under our credit facility and terminate our credit\nfacility. In such event, we may not have sufficient liquidity to repay our debt under our credit facility and\nother indebtedness and/or operate our business.\nInability to borrow under our credit facility could adversely affect our operations.\nThe maximum we can borrow under the revolving part of our credit facility is based on a percentage of the\namount of our eligible receivables outstanding at any one time reduced by outstanding standby letters of\ncredit and any borrowing reduction that our lender has or may impose from time to time. As of December\n31, 2023, we had no borrowing under the revolving part of our credit facility and borrowing availability of\nup to an additional $10,622,000, which included our cash (deposited with our lender) and was based on our\neligible receivables and was net of approximately $3,950,000 in outstanding standby letters of credit and a\n$750,000 indefinite reduction in borrowing availability that our lender imposed. A lack of positive operating\nresults could have material adverse consequences on our ability to operate our business. Our ability to make\nprincipal and interest payments, to refinance indebtedness, and borrow under our credit facility will depend\non both our and our subsidiaries' future operating performance and cash flow. Prevailing economic\nconditions, interest rate levels, and financial, competitive, business, and other factors affect us. Many of\nthese factors are beyond our control.\nIf our financial and operating activities are limited, it could adversely affect our ability to\nincur additional debt to fund future needs.\nWe could, among other things, be:\n required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to the payment of principal and\ninterest, thereby reducing the funds available for operations and future business opportunities;\n make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations;\n limit our ability to borrow additional money if needed for other purposes, including working\ncapital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or\nother purposes, on satisfactory terms or at all;\n limit our ability to adjust to changing economic, business and competitive conditions;\n place us at a competitive disadvantage with competitors who may have less indebtedness or\ngreater access to financing;\n make us more vulnerable to an increase in interest rates, a downturn in our operating\nperformance or a decline in general economic conditions; and\n make us more susceptible to changes in credit ratings, which could impact our ability to obtain\nfinancing in the future and increase the cost of such financing.\nAny of the foregoing could adversely impact our operating results, financial condition, and liquidity. Our\nability to continue our operations depends on our ability to generate profitable operations or complete equity\nor debt financings to increase our capital.\nWe may be unable to utilize loss carryforwards in the future.\nWe have approximately $19,450,000 and $72,859,000 in net operating loss carryforwards for federal and\n13\nstate income tax purposes, respectively and expires in various amounts starting in 2023 if not used against\nfuture federal and state income tax liabilities, respectively. All of our federal net operating loss\ncarryforwards were generated after December 31, 2017 and thus do not expire. Our net loss carryforwards\nare subject to various limitations. Our ability to use the net loss carryforwards depends on whether we are\nable to generate sufficient income in the future years. Further, our net loss carryforwards have not been\naudited or approved by the Internal Revenue Service.\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock\nIssuance of substantial amounts of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Common\nStock”) could depress our stock price or dilute the percentage ownership of our Common\nStockholders.\nAny sales of substantial amounts of our Common Stock in the public market could cause an adverse effect\non the market price of our Common Stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of\nadditional equity securities. The issuance of our Common Stock will result in the dilution in the percentage\nmembership interest of our stockholders and the dilution in ownership value. As of December 31, 2023, we\nhad 13,646,559 shares of Common Stock outstanding. In addition, as of December 31, 2023, we had\noutstanding options to purchase 994,500 shares of our Common Stock at exercise prices ranging from $3.15\nto $9.81 per share and an outstanding warrant to purchase 30,000 shares of our Common Stock at exercise\nprice of $3.51 per share. Future sales of the shares issuable could also depress the market price of our\nCommon Stock.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our Common Stock in the foreseeable future.\nSince our inception, we have not paid cash dividends on our Common Stock, and we do not anticipate\npaying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Our credit facility prohibits us from paying cash\ndividends on our Common Stock without prior approval from our lender.\nThe price of our Common Stock may fluctuate significantly, which may make it difficult for our\nstockholders to resell our Common Stock when a stockholder wants or at prices a stockholder finds\nattractive.\nThe price of our Common Stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market constantly fluctuates. We expect that the\nmarket price of our Common Stock will continue to fluctuate. This may make it difficult for our\nstockholders to resell the Common Stock when a stockholder wants or at prices a stockholder finds\nattractive.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nLoss of certain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur success depends on the contributions of our key management, environmental and engineering\npersonnel. Our future success depends on our ability to retain and expand our staff of qualified personnel,\nincluding environmental specialists and technicians, sales personnel, and engineers. Without qualified\npersonnel, we may incur delays in rendering our services or be unable to render certain services. We cannot\nbe certain that we will be successful in our efforts to attract and retain qualified personnel as their\navailability is limited due to the demand for hazardous waste management services and the highly\ncompetitive nature of the hazardous waste management industry. We do not maintain key person insurance\non any of our employees, officers, or directors.\nWe may not be successful in winning new business mandates from our government, commercial or\ninternational customers.\nWe must be successful in winning mandates from our government, commercial and international customers\nto replace revenues from projects that we have completed or that are nearing completion and to increase our\nrevenues. Our business and operating results can be adversely affected by the size and timing of a single\nmaterial contract.\nOur failure to maintain our safety record could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur safety record is critical to our reputation. In addition, many of our government and commercial\n14\ncustomers require that we maintain certain specified safety record guidelines to be eligible to bid for\ncontracts with these customers. Furthermore, contract terms may provide for automatic termination in the\nevent that our safety record fails to adhere to agreed-upon guidelines during performance of the contract.\nAs a result, our failure to maintain our safety record could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nSystems failures, interruptions or breaches of security and other cybersecurity risks could have an\nadverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to certain operational risks to our information systems. Because of efforts on the part of\ncomputer hackers and cyberterrorists to breach data security of companies, we face risk associated with\npotential failures to adequately protect critical corporate, customer and employee data. As part of our\nbusiness, we develop and retain confidential data about us and our customers, including the U.S.\ngovernment. We also rely on the services of a variety of vendors to meet our data processing and\ncommunications needs.\nDespite our implemented security measures and established policies, we cannot be certain that all of our\nsystems are entirely free from vulnerability to attack or other technological difficulties or failures or failures\non the part of our employees to follow our established security measures and policies. Information security\nrisks have increased significantly. Our technologies, systems, and networks may become the target of cyber-\nattacks, computer viruses, malicious code, or information security breaches that could result in the\nunauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of our or our customers’\nconfidential, proprietary and other information and the disruption of our business operations. A security\nbreach could adversely impact our customer relationships, reputation and operations, result in violations of\napplicable privacy and other laws and/or financial loss to us or to our customers or to our employees, and\nsimilar litigation exposure. While we maintain a system of internal controls and procedures, any breach,\nattack, or failure as discussed above could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations or liquidity.\nThere is also an increasing attention on the importance of cybersecurity relating to infrastructure. This\ncreates the potential for future developments in regulations relating to cybersecurity that may adversely\nimpact us, our customers and how we offer our services to our customers.\nClimate change could negatively impact the Company’s operations and financial condition.\nClimate change may present both immediate and long-term risks to the Company and our customers and\nthese risks may increase over time. Climate risks can arise from both physical risks (those risks related to\nthe physical effects of climate change) and transition risks (risks related to governmental regulatory\nrequirements, legal technology, market and reputational changes from a transition to a low carbon\neconomy). Climate change could have a material, adverse effect on environmental companies like ours that\nare involved in the treatment, disposal and other services related to hazardous waste, radioactive waste\nand/or mixed (waste that contain both hazardous and radioactive) waste by changing or restricting how we\nperform our services or what services we can perform or taking action that materially increases our costs to\ndo business in order to regulate or reduce climate change.\nWe believe our proprietary technology is important to us.\nWe believe that it is important that we maintain our proprietary technologies. There can be no assurance that\nour steps to protect our proprietary technologies will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of these\ntechnologies by third parties. Such misappropriation could adversely effect on our operations and financial\ncondition. Changes to current environmental laws and regulations also could limit the use of our proprietary\ntechnology.\nFailure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or failure to remediate a\nmaterial weakness in internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on\nour business, operating results, and stock price.\nMaintaining effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to produce reliable\nfinancial reports and is important in helping to prevent financial fraud. If we are unable to maintain\nadequate internal controls, our business and operating results could be harmed. We are required to satisfy\n15\nthe requirements of Section 404 of Sarbanes Oxley and the related rules of the Commission, which require,\namong other things, management to assess annually the effectiveness of our internal control over financial\nreporting. If we are unable to maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting, there is a\nreasonable possibility that a misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented\nor detected in a timely manner. If we cannot produce reliable financial reports, investors could lose\nconfidence in our reported financial information, the market price of our Common Stock could decline\nsignificantly, and our business, financial condition, and reputation could be harmed.\nDelaware law, certain of our charter provisions, our stock option plans, outstanding warrants and\nour Preferred Stock may inhibit a change of control under circumstances that could give you an\nopportunity to realize a premium over prevailing market prices.\nWe are a Delaware corporation governed by the General Corporation Law of Delaware, an anti-takeover\nlaw. In general, Section 203 prohibits a Delaware public corporation from engaging in a “business\ncombination” with an “interested stockholder” for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in\nwhich the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a\nprescribed manner. As a result of Section 203, potential acquirers may be discouraged from attempting to\neffect acquisition transactions with us, thereby possibly depriving our security holders of certain\nopportunities to sell, or otherwise dispose of, such securities at above-market prices pursuant to such\ntransactions. Further, certain of our option plans provide for the immediate acceleration of, and removal of\nrestrictions from, options and other awards under such plans upon a “change of control” (as defined in the\nrespective plans). Such provisions may also have the result of discouraging acquisition of us.\nAt December 31, 2023, out of 30,000,000 shares of our Common Stock authorized, we had 13,646,559\nshares of common stock outstanding and 7,642 shares of treasury stock. In addition, at December 31, 2023,\nwe had outstanding options to purchase 994,500 shares of our common stock at exercise prices ranging from\n$3.15 to $9.81 per share, and an outstanding warrant to purchase 30,000 shares of our Common Stock at an\nexercise price of $3.51 per share. Assuming the issuance of the Common Stock underlying such options and\nwarrant, at December 31, 2023, we had available for future issuance 15,321,299 shares of authorized and\nunissued Common Stock, and 2,000,000 shares of our preferred stock. Future sales of authorized and\nunissued shares could be used by our management to make it more difficult for, and thereby discourage, an\nattempt to acquire control of us.\nThird party expectations relating to ESG factors may impose additional costs and expose us and our\nclients to new risks.\nThere is an increasing focus from certain investors and certain of our customers, and other stakeholders\nconcerning corporate responsibility, specifically related to ESG factors. Some investors may use these\nfactors to guide their investment strategies and, in some cases, may choose not to invest in us, or otherwise\ndo business with us, if they believe our policies relating to corporate responsibility are inadequate or do not\nalign with theirs. Third party providers of corporate responsibility ratings and reports on companies have\nincreased in number, resulting in varied standards. In addition, the criteria by which companies’ corporate\nresponsibility practices are assessed are evolving, which could result in greater expectations of us and cause\nus to undertake costly initiatives to satisfy such new criteria. Alternatively, if we elect not to or are unable to\nsatisfy such new criteria or do not meet the criteria of a specific third-party provider, some investors may\nconclude that our policies with respect to corporate responsibility are inadequate. We may face reputational\ndamage in the event that our corporate responsibility procedures or standards do not meet the standards set\nby various constituencies. If we fail to satisfy the expectations of investors, our customers and other\nstakeholders or our initiatives are not executed as planned, our reputation and financial results could be\nadversely affected and our revenues, results of operations and ability to grow our business may be\nnegatively impacted.

CYBERSECURITY\nCybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\nThe Company recognizes the importance of identifying, assessing, and managing risks associated with\ncybersecurity threats. The Company’s cybersecurity program utilizes components of the National Institute\nof Standards and Technology (“NIST”) Cybersecurity Framework. Key components of our cybersecurity\nprogram include governance, risk management, access and authentication controls, change management,\naudit and assessment, awareness and training, contingency planning, recovery, media handling, incident\nresponse, personnel and physical security, and communication integrity.\nOur program is embedded into Information Technology (“IT”) and Information System (“IS”) operations\nacross the business with a focus on awareness, transparency, minimizing business impacts, and reducing\nenterprise risk, including strategic, compliance, legal and financial risk. The Company has policies and\nprocedures in place to ensure compliance with its cybersecurity program and cybersecurity controls. Our\nprogram relies on a philosophy of continuous improvement by using periodic self-assessments, 3rd party\nassessments, and customer/agency audits to determine cyber control presence, applicability, and\neffectiveness. Our program is customized with additional controls that address financial systems risk,\nnuclear quality assurance, Sarbanes Oxley, European Union cyber and data protection requirements, and\nsupply chain risks.\nOur risk management process addresses confidentiality, availability, and integrity and includes evaluating\ninformation systems specific threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood, and potential impact. Impact thresholds,\nwhich are reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors (the “Board”) and senior management, are used\nto define incident escalation paths from IT operations to management, the Audit Committee and the Board.\nThis process is used to identify, manage, and communicate material risks to the business. Additional cyber\nincident reporting requirements are in place to comply with customers and regulatory agency requirements.\nAutomated threat and vulnerability management systems are in place and updated per industry standards\nand best practices. Our IT team further manages risk by evaluating external providers of threat,\nvulnerability, and risk mitigation information. This information is used to proactively implement new\nmethods or controls for reducing risk associated with a particular emerging threat or vulnerability.\nThe Company’s cybersecurity program is managed by the Vice President (“VP”) of IS, who has been\nemployed by the Company for 20 years and has over 35 years of total experience in information systems.\nThe VP of IS has an extensive career in software development and infrastructure management including\nworking with Fortune 500 companies in his prior positions. The VP of information system is a participant\nin the overall Company strategic process and has aligned the program to best service the strategic objectives\nof the business.\nCybersecurity Governance\nThe Company’s Audit Committee has oversight responsibility for risks and incidents relating to\ncybersecurity threats. Our senior management is responsible for the day-to-day management of the material\nrisks we face. Our VP Of Information System is scheduled to report to the CFO on a weekly basis and the\nAudit Committee on a quarterly basis on cybersecurity matters to include updates on cybersecurity threat\nmanagement, strategy processes, system updates and cybersecurity risks activities, including but not limited\nto any recent cybersecurity incidents and related responses. Our Board is also engaged in discussion with\nsenior management and the Audit Committee at least on a quarterly basis on cybersecurity matters to\ndiscuss any updates to our cybersecurity risk management and strategy program. Each member of our Board\nhas a working knowledge and/or experience with cybersecurity, IT strategy and IT risk assessment.\nIn the past 2 years, the Company does not believe that it has experienced any material cybersecurity\nincidents, nor any material costs related to immaterial cyber incidents. Although we have a comprehensive\nprocess for the prevention of material cybersecurity incidents as discussed, we cannot provide assurance that\nour results of operations and financial condition and business strategy will not be materially impacted from\ncybersecurity risks in the future.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCertain statements contained within this “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\nand Results of Operations” (“MD&A”) may be deemed “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of\nSection 27A of the Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (collectively,\nthe “Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995”). See “Special Note regarding Forward-Looking\nStatements” contained in this report.\nManagement's discussion and analysis is based, among other things, our audited consolidated financial\nstatements and includes our accounts and the accounts of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Our 2022\nconsolidated financial statements also included the accounts of a variable interest entity (“VIE”) for which\nwe were the primary beneficiary. During the fourth quarter of 2022, project work under this VIE was\ncompleted.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial\nstatements and the notes thereto included in Item 8 of this report.\nOverview\nWe experienced significant improvement in our 2023 financial results as the lingering effects of COVID-19\nbegan to subside starting in the early part of 2022. Our Treatment Segment continued to see steady\nimprovements in waste receipts from certain customers who had previously delayed waste shipments due, in\npart, from the impact of COVID-19. Within our Services Segment, certain projects which were\ndelayed/curtailed in first part of 2022 due, in part, from the lingering effects of the COVID-19, achieved full\noperational status and improved productivity in 2023 which positively impacted revenue. Revenue from\nboth of our Segments were also positively impacted from contracts won in 2023 as procurement and\nplanning on behalf of our government clients continued to progress as the lingering effects of COVID-19\npandemic subsided.\n19\nRevenue increased by $19,136,000 or 27.1% to $89,735,000 for the twelve-months ended December 31,\n2023, from $70,599,000 for the corresponding period of 2022. We saw increases in both Segments where\nTreatment Segment revenue increased by $10,119,000 or 30.3% to $43,477,000 from $33,358,000 and\nServices Segment revenue increased by $9,017,000 or 24.2% to $46,258,000 from $37,241,000. The\nincrease in revenue in the Treatment Segment was primarily due to overall higher waste volume which was\noffset by lower averaged price from waste mix. The increase in revenue in the Services Segment was\nprimarily due to achievement of full operational status and improved productivity on certain projects which\nhad been delayed/curtailed in 2022 due, in part, from the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTotal gross profit for 2023 increased $6,760,000 or 70.4% due to increased revenue. Selling, General, and\nAdministrative (“SG&A”) expenses increased $323,000 or 2.2% for the twelve-months ended December 31,\n2023, as compared to the corresponding period of 2022.\nIn March 2023, we received the Employee Retention Credit (“ERC”) of $1,975,000 that we applied for\nduring the third quarter of 2022 as permitted under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Securities\nAct, as amended (the “CARES Act”). In addition to the $1,975,000, we also received approximately\n$60,000 in interest (recorded within “Interest Income” on our Consolidated Statements of Operations).\nWe believe we have sufficient liquidity on hand to continue business operations during the next twelve\nmonths. See a discussion of our liquidity overview within this MD&A – “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”\nHeading into 2024, we expect to see overall continue steady improvements in waste receipts and increases\nin project work from certain existing contracts, contracts won in 2023, and bids submitted in both segments\nthat are awaiting awards. However, due to our operations which is subject to seasonal factor, we generally\nexperience lower revenue in the first quarter due to overall reduced activities by our customers from the\nusual slowdown in operations due, in part, from returning from the holiday periods and poorer weather\nconditions. Additionally, due to Congress’s inability to timely approve FY 2024 budget and the extension of\nthe continuing resolution, certain of our government related customers have informed us that waste\nshipments will likely be delayed. Although we expect to see overall improvements in revenue in 2024 as\ndisclosed above, if Congress is unable to enact the full FY 2024 appropriation bills or further extend the\ncontinuing resolutions to fund government spending by the late March deadline, the U.S. government will\nenter into a partial shutdown. The full impact of any additional continued resolution beyond March or a\npartial government shutdown is uncertain. If a partial government shutdown were to occur and were to\ncontinue an extended period, our financial results of operations could be negatively impacted by delays in\nprocurement actions, waste shipments and project delays on newly awarded projects.\nBusiness Environment\nOur Treatment and Services Segments’ business continues to be heavily dependent on services that we\nprovide to governmental clients, primarily as subcontractors for others who are prime contractors to\ngovernment entities or directly as the prime contractor. We believe demand for our services will continue to\nbe subject to fluctuations due to a variety of factors beyond our control, including, without limitation, the\neconomic conditions and the manner in which the applicable government will be required to spend funding\nto remediate various sites and a potential partial government shutdown. In addition, our governmental\ncontracts and subcontracts relating to activities at governmental sites in the United States are generally\nsubject to termination for convenience at any time at the government’s option. Significant reductions in the\nlevel of governmental funding or specifically mandated levels for different programs that are important to\nour business could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations,\nand cash flows.\nWe are continually reviewing methods to raise additional capital to supplement our liquidity requirements,\nwhen needed, and reducing our operating costs. We continue to aggressively bid on various contracts,\nincluding potential contracts within the international markets. On December 18, 2023, the JV where we and\nCampoverde Srl (“JV partner”) each owns 50% of the partnership, was awarded a multi-year contract\nvalued up to approximately EUR 50 million by the European Commission (the “Contracting Authority”) for\nthe treatment of radioactive waste from the Joint Research Center in Ispra, Italy. Work under this JV has not\nstarted as of December 31, 2023. The scope of work to be performed in the initial phases of this contract\nwill be performed predominately by our JV partner. Revenue generated by us under the initial phases will\n20\nbe limited to project management support through 2025. We expect to generate an increase in revenue under\nthis contract starting in 2026 when the waste treatment phases begin. The Contracting Authority may\nterminate the contract under certain conditions as set forth in the contract. Once activities commence under\nthis JV, we will consolidate the operations of this JV into our financial statements.\nResults of Operations\nThe reporting of financial results and pertinent discussions are tailored to our two reportable segments: The\nTreatment Segment and Services Segment.\nSummary - Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\nBelow are the results of continuing operations for years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022 (amounts in\nthousands):\n(Consolidated) 2023 % 2022 %\nNet revenues $ 8 9,735 100.0 $ 70,599 100.0\nCost of goods sold 7 3,366 81.8 6 0,990 8 6.4\nGross profit 1 6,369 18.2 9 ,609 13.6\nSelling, general and administrative 1 4,975 16.7 1 4,652 2 0.8\nResearch and development 5 61 .6 3 36 .4\nLoss on disposal of property and equipment 7 7 .1 1 8 \nIncome (loss) from operations 7 56 .8 (5,397) ( 7.6)\nInterest income 6 06 .7 9 9 .1\nInterest expense ( 323) (.4) ( 175) (.3)\nInterest expense – financing fees ( 93) (.1) ( 61) (.1)\nOther (expense) income ( 11)  1 ,945 2 .8\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations before taxes 9 35 1.0 (3,589) ( 5.1)\nIncome tax expense (benefit) 1 7  ( 378) (.6)\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations\n$ 9 18 1.0 $ (3,211) ( 4.5)\nRevenue\nConsolidated revenues increased $19,136,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the year\nended December 31, 2022, as follows:\n% % %\n(In thousands) 2023 Revenue 2022 Revenue Change Change\nTreatment\nGovernment waste $ 2 9,506 3 2.9 $ 21,946 3 1.1 $ 7 ,560 34.4\nHazardous/non-hazardous (1) 6,260 7 .0 5,062 7 .1 1,198 23.7\nOther nuclear waste 7,711 8 .6 6,350 9 .0 1,361 21.4\nTotal 43,477 48.5 33,358 47.2 1 0,119 30.3\nServices\nNuclear 43,121 48.0 35,952 5 0.9 7,169 19.9\nTechnical 3,137 3 .5 1,289 1 .9 1,848 143.4\nTotal 46,258 5 1.5 37,241 5 2.8 9,017 24.2\nTotal $ 8 9,735 1 00.0 $ 70,599 1 00.0 $ 1 9,136 27.1\n1) Includes wastes generated by government clients of $2,943,000 and $2,380,000 for the twelve months ended\nDecember 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nTreatment Segment revenue increased by $10,119,000 or 30.3% for the twelve-months ended December 31,\n2023 over the same period in 2022. The overall increase was primarily due to higher waste volume offset by\nlower averaged price from waste mix. As previously disclosed, starting in the latter part of the second\nquarter of 2022, our Treatment Segment began to see steady improvements in waste receipts from certain\ncustomers who had previously delayed waste shipments due, in part, from the lingering effects of COVID-\n21\n19. Services Segment revenue increased by approximately $9,017,000 or 24.2%. primarily due to\nachievement of full operational status and improved productivity on certain projects which had been\ndelayed/curtailed in the early part of 2022 due, in part, from the lingering effects of the COVID-19\npandemic. Our Services Segment revenues are project-based; as such, the scope, duration, and completion\nof each project vary. As a result, our Services Segment revenues are subject to differences relating to timing\nand project value. Revenues from both of our segments were also positively impacted from contracts won in\n2023.\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold increased $12,376,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year\nended December 31, 2022, as follows:\n% %\n(In thousands) 2023 Revenue 2022 Revenue Change\nTreatment $ 36,601 84.2 $ 28,115 84.3 $ 8,486\nServices 36,765 79.5 32,875 88.3 $ 3 ,890\nTotal $ 73,366 81.8 $ 60,990 86.4 $ 1 2,376\nCost of goods sold for the Treatment Segment increased by approximately $8,486,000 or 30.2%. Treatment\nSegment’s variable costs increased by approximately $6,189,000 primarily due to higher material and\nsupplies, disposal, lab, outside services costs and higher employee incentives. Treatment Segment’s overall\nfixed costs were higher by approximately $2,297,000 resulting from the following: salaries and payroll\nrelated expenses were higher by approximately $1,483,000 due to higher headcount; depreciation expenses\nwere higher by approximately $393,000 due to depreciation for asset retirement obligations in connection\nwith our EWOC facility; general expenses were higher by approximately $279,000 primarily due to higher\nutility costs; maintenance costs were higher by approximately $235,000; travel expenses were higher by\napproximately $90,000; and regulatory expenses were lower by approximately $183,000. Services Segment\ncost of goods sold increased $3,890,000 or 11.8% due to higher revenue. The overall increase in cost of\ngoods sold was primarily due to the following: aggregated higher salaries/payroll related, outside services,\nand travel costs totaling approximately $4,356,000; higher depreciation expenses of $63,000; lower material\nand supplies, lab, regulatory and disposal expenses totaling approximately $444,000; and lower general\nexpenses by approximately $85,000 in various categories. Included within cost of goods sold is depreciation\nand amortization expense of $2,484,000 and $2,027,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022,\nand 2021, respectively.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $6,760,000 higher than 2022 as follows:\n% %\n(In thousands) 2023 Revenue 2022 Revenue Change\nTreatment $ 6,876 15.8 $ 5,243 15.7 $ 1,633\nServices 9,493 20.5 4,366 11.7 $ 5 ,127\nTotal $ 16,369 18.2 $ 9,609 13.6 $ 6 ,760\nTreatment Segment gross profit increased by $1,633,000 or 31.1% primarily due to higher revenue as\ndiscussed previously. Despite the slight increase in gross margin, Treatment Segment gross margin was\nnegatively impacted by higher variable costs from waste mix and the impact of overall increase in fixed\ncosts. Services Segment gross profit increased by $5,127,000 or 117.4% and gross margin increased from\n11.7% to 20.5% primarily due to higher revenue and improved margin projects. Our overall Services\nSegment gross margin is impacted by our current projects which are competitively bid and therefore have\nvarying margin structures.\nSG&A\nSG&A expenses increased $323,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the\ncorresponding period for 2022 as follows:\n22\n% %\n(In thousands) 2023 Revenue 2022 Revenue Change\nAdministrative $ 7 ,230  $ 6 ,882  $ 3 48\nTreatment 4,249 9 .8 4,419 13.2 ( 170)\nServices 3,496 7 .6 3,351 9.0 1 45\nTotal $ 1 4,975 1 6.7 $ 14,652 2 0.8 $ 3 23\nAdministrative SG&A expenses were higher primarily due to the following: payroll-related expenses were\nhigher by approximately $660,000 primarily due to higher accrued employee incentives (including our\nmanagement incentive plans (“MIPs”)) and higher 401(k) matching expenses as payroll expenses in 2022\nincluded more forfeitures of 401(k) plan matching funds contributed by us for former employees who failed\nto meet the 401(k) plan vesting requirements; outside services expenses were lower by approximately\n$256,000 as a result of fewer audit/consulting matters; and general expenses were lower by approximately\n$56,000 in various categories. Treatment Segment SG&A expenses were lower primarily due to the\nfollowing: outside services expenses were lower by approximately $110,000 due to fewer consulting\nmatters; salaries and payroll related expenses were lower by approximately $212,000; travel expenses were\nlower by approximately $24,000; and general expenses were higher by approximately $176,000 in various\ncategories. The increase in SG&A expenses within our Services Segment was primarily due to the\nfollowing: salaries/payroll-related expenses were higher by approximately $92,000 due to more\nadministrative support functions required as the result of higher revenue; travel expenses were higher by\napproximately $43,000; credit losses on accounts receivable were higher by approximately $59,000, as in\nthe first quarter of 2022 our Services Segment collected on certain accounts that were previously deemed to\nbe uncollectible; outside services expenses were lower by approximately $41,000 due to fewer consulting\nmatters; and general expenses were lower slightly by $8,000. Included in SG&A expenses is depreciation\nand amortization expense of $84,000 and $82,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and\n2022, respectively.\nInterest Income\nInterest income increased by approximately $507,000 for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2023,\nrespectively, as compared to the corresponding period of 2022 primarily due to higher interest earned from\nthe finite risk sinking fund. Interest income for 2023 also included approximately $60,000 received in\nMarch 2023 under the ERC program under the CARES Act.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased by approximately $148,000 for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2023, as\ncompared to the corresponding period of 2022 due to interest incurred on the new $2,500,000 term loan\ndated July 31, 2023, under our credit facility. Interest expense was also higher in 2023 from higher interest\nrate on our term loan dated May 8, 2020, which was offset by the declining term loan balance. Additionally,\nthe increase in interest expense in 2023 was also the result of interest incurred from advances made in May\nof 2022 from the capital line under our credit facility.\nIncome Taxes\nWe had income tax expense of $17,000 and income tax benefit of $378,000 for continuing operations for\nthe twelve-months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our effective tax rates were\napproximately 1.8% and 10.5% for the twelve- month ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nOur effective tax rates for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2023, and 2022 were impacted by non-\ndeductible expenses and state taxes.\nBacklog\nOur Treatment Segment maintains a backlog of stored waste, which represents waste that has not been\nprocessed. The backlog is principally a result of the timing and complexity of the waste being brought into\nthe facilities and the selling price per container. As of December 31, 2023, our Treatment Segment had a\nbacklog of approximately $8,702,000, as compared to approximately $9,156,000 as of December 31, 2022.\nAdditionally, the time it takes to process waste from the time it arrives may increase due to the types and\n23\ncomplexities of the waste we are currently receiving. We typically process our backlog during periods of\nlow waste receipts, which historically has been in the first or fourth quarters.\nDiscontinued Operations and Environmental Contingencies\nOur discontinued operations consist of all our subsidiaries included in our Industrial Segment which\nencompasses subsidiaries divested in 2011 and earlier, as well as three previously closed locations.\nOur discontinued operations had no revenue for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nWe incurred net losses of $433,000 (net of tax benefit of $117,000) and $605,000 (net of tax benefit of\n$199,000) for our discontinued operations for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2023, and 2022,\nrespectively. In 2022, we incurred additional costs in connection with management of administrative and\nregulatory matters related to our remediation projects. We have three environmental remediation projects,\nall within our discontinued operations, which principally entail the removal/remediation of contaminated\nsoil, and, in most cases, the remediation of surrounding ground water.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur cash flow requirements during the twelve-months ended December 31, 2023, were primarily financed\nby our operations, cash on hand (which included the ERC, along with interest, that we received in March\n2023 and proceeds from a new term loan dated July 31, 2023, in the amount of $2,500,000 provided to us\nunder an amendment to our existing credit facility), and credit facility availability. Our cash flow\nrequirements for the next twelve months will consist primarily of general working capital needs, scheduled\nprincipal payments on our debt obligations, remediation projects, and planned capital expenditures. We plan\nto fund these requirements from our operations, credit facility availability, cash on hand and collections of\nunpaid receivables (See “Known Trends and Uncertainties – Perma-Fix Canada, Inc. (“PF Canada”)” for a\ndiscussion of unpaid receivables due to our Perma-Fix Canada, Inc. subsidiary from a certain customer in\nwhich a settlement agreement has been reached, subject to meeting certain conditions/terms precedent and a\npartial payment received in January 2024). Our ability to utilize our credit facility from our lender is subject\nto meeting our quarterly financial covenant requirements, among other things. We continue to explore all\nsources of increasing our capital and/or liquidity and to improve our revenue and working capital, including,\nbut not limited to entering into equity transactions. There are no assurances that we will be successful in\nincreasing our liquidity through our efforts. We are continually reviewing operating costs and reviewing the\npossibility of further reducing operating costs and non-essential expenditures to bring them in line with\nrevenue levels, when necessary. As of December 31, 2023, our borrowing availability under our revolving\npart of our credit facility was approximately $10,622,000, which included our cash (deposited with our\nlender) and was based on our eligible receivables and was net of approximately $3,950,000 in outstanding\nstandby letters of credit and a $750,000 indefinite reduction in borrowing availability that our lender\nimposed pursuant to the July 31, 2023 amendment of our Loan Agreement. We believe that our cash flows\nfrom operations, our available liquidity from our credit facility, and our cash on hand should be sufficient to\nfund our operations for the next twelve months.\nThe following table reflects the cash flow activity for the year ended December 31, 2023, and the\ncorresponding period of 2022:\n(In thousands) 2023 2022\nCash provided by operating activities of continuing operations $ 6 ,745 $ 1 64\nCash used in operating activities of discontinued operations ( 597) ( 717)\nCash used in investing activities of continuing operations ( 1,714) ( 997)\nCash provided by (used in) financing activities of continuing operations 1 ,696 ( 921)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash 8 ( 4)\nIncrease (decrease) in cash and finite risk sinking fund (restricted cash) $ 6 ,138 $ ( 2,475)\nAs of December 31, 2023, we were in a positive cash position with no revolving credit balance. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, we had cash on hand of approximately $7,500,000.\n24\nOperating Activities\nAccounts receivable, net of credit losses, totaled $9,722,000 as of December 31, 2023, an increase of\n$358,000 from the December 31, 2022, balance of $9,364,000. The increase was attributed to increased\nrevenue, timing of invoicing, and our accounts receivable collection. Our contracts with our customers are\nsubject to various payment terms and conditions. Our accounts receivable at December 31, 2023, included\ninvoices for work performed for a certain Canadian project that remained outstanding which a settlement\nagreement has been reached, subject to meeting certain conditions/terms precedent (See discussion under\n“Known Trends and Uncertainties - Perma-Fix Canada Inc. (“PF Canada”)” below for a discussion of the\naccounts receivable and a partial payment made by the customer on January 22, 2024).\nPrepaid and other assets totaled $3,738,000 as of December 31, 2023, a decrease of $1,667,000 from the\nDecember 31, 2022, balance of $5,405,000. The decrease was primarily due to receipt of the ERC of\n$1,975,000 in March 2023 that we applied for during the third quarter of 2022.\nAccounts payable totaled $9,582,000 as of December 31, 2023, a decrease of $743,000 from the December\n31, 2022, balance of $10,325,000. Our accounts payable are impacted by the timing of payments as we are\ncontinually managing payment terms with our vendors to maximize our cash position throughout our\nsegments.\nAccrued expenses totaled $6,560,000 as of December 31, 2023, an increase of $1,967,000 from the\nDecember 31, 2022, balance of $4,593,000. The increase was primarily due to higher employee incentive\nand commission accruals totaling approximately $1,346,000. Our employee incentive accruals included an\naggregate of approximately $750,000 recorded under our 2023 Management Incentive Plans (“MIPs”) for\nour executives.\nWe had working capital of $4,613,000 (which included working capital of our discontinued operations) as\nof December 31, 2023, as compared to working capital of $818,000 as of December 31, 2022. The\nimprovement in our working capital was primarily due to increases in our cash and unbilled receivables\nfrom improved operations. In 2023, our cash was also increased from the receipt of the ERC in March 2023\nand the additional Term Loan 2 dated July 31, 2023, that we entered into with our lender under our Loan\nAgreement (see a discussion of the Term Loan 2 below under “Financing Activities). The overall\nimprovement in our working capital was offset by the increases in our accrued expenses and deferred\nrevenues.\nSee discussion of a multi-year contract valued up to approximately EUR 50 million awarded to us and our\nJV partner by the European Commission on December 18, 2023, for the treatment of radioactive waste from\nthe Joint Research Center in Ispra, Italy under “Business Environment” within this MD&A.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring 2023, our purchases of capital equipment totaled approximately $2,498,000, of which $784,000 was\nsubject to financing, with the remaining funded from cash from operations and our credit facility. We have\nbudgeted approximately $2,000,000 for 2024 capital expenditures primarily for our Treatment and Services\nSegments to maintain operations and regulatory compliance requirements and support revenue growth.\nCertain of these budgeted projects may either be delayed until later years or deferred altogether. We plan to\nfund our capital expenditures from cash from operations, collections of unpaid receivables, borrowing\navailability under our credit facility and/or financing. The initiation and timing of projects are also\ndetermined by financing alternatives or funds available for such capital projects.\nDuring March 2022, we signed a non-binding joint venture term sheet addressing plans to partner with\nSpringfields Fuels Limited (“SFL”), an affiliate of Westinghouse Electric Company LLC, to develop and\nmanage a nuclear waste-materials treatment facility (the “Facility”) in the United Kingdom. The Facility is\nfor the purpose of expanding the partners’ waste treatment capabilities for the European nuclear market. It is\nexpected that upon finalization of a partnership agreement, SFL will have an ownership interest of fifty-five\n(55) percent and our interest will be forty-five (45) percent. The finalization, form and capitalization of this\nunpopulated partnership is subject to numerous conditions, including but not limited to, completion and\nexecution of a definitive agreement and facility design, granting of required regulatory, lender or permitting\n25\napprovals and updated cost and profitability analysis based on current and forecast future economic\nconditions. Upon finalization of this venture, we will be required to make an investment in this venture. The\namount of our investment, the period of which it is to be made and the method of funding are to be\ndetermined.\nFinancing Activities\nWe entered into a Second Amended and Restated Revolving Credit, Term Loan and Security Agreement,\ndated May 8, 2020 (“Loan Agreement”), with PNC National Association (“PNC” and “lender”), acting as\nagent and lender. The Loan Agreement, as amended (including the two amendments that we entered into\nwith our lender in 2023 described below), provides us with the following credit facility with a maturity date\nof May 15, 2027: (a) up to $12,500,000 revolving credit (“revolving credit”), with the maximum that we can\nborrow under the revolving credit based on a percentage of eligible receivables (as defined) at any one time\nreduced by outstanding standby letters of credit and borrowing reductions that our lender may impose from\ntime to time; (b) a term loan (“Term Loan 1”) dated May 8, 2020, of approximately $1,742,000, requiring\nmonthly installments of $35,547; (c) a term loan (“Term Loan 2”) of $2,500,000 dated July 31, 2023,\nrequiring monthly installments of $41,667; and (d) a capital expenditure line (“Capital Line”) of up to\n$1,000,000 with advances on the line, subject to certain limitations, permitted for up to twelve months\nstarting May 4, 2021 (the “Borrowing Period”), with interest only payable on advances during the\nBorrowing Period. Amounts advanced under the Capital Line at the end of the Borrowing Period totaled\napproximately $524,000, requiring monthly installments of principal of approximately $8,700 plus interest,\ncommencing June 1, 2022.\nOn March 21, 2023, we entered into an amendment to our Loan Agreement, as amended, with our lender\nwhich provided, among other things, the following:\n removed the quarterly fixed charge coverage ratio (“FCCR”) testing requirement for the fourth\nquarter of 2022 and removed the FCCR testing requirement for the first quarter of 2023;\n reduced the maximum revolving credit line under the credit facility from $18,000,000 to\n$12,500,000;\n reinstated the quarterly FCCR testing requirement starting in the second quarter of 2023 using a\ntrailing twelve-months period (with no change to the minimum 1.15:1 ratio requirement for each\nquarter); and\n required maintenance of a minimum of $3,000,000 in borrowing availability under the revolving\ncredit until the minimum FCCR requirement for the quarter ended June 30, 2023 has been met and\ncertified to the lender (we met our FCCR requirement in the second quarter of 2023 which was\ncertified to our lender and therefore, this requirement is no longer applicable under our Loan\nAgreement, as amended).\nIn connection with the March 2023 amendment, we paid our lender a fee of $25,000 which is being\namortized over the remaining term of the Loan Agreement, as amended, as interest expense-financing fees.\nOn July 31, 2023, we entered into a further amendment of the Loan Agreement, as amended, with our\nlender which provided, among other things, the following:\n extended the maturity date of the Loan Agreement, as amended, to May 15, 2027, from May 15,\n2024;\n an additional term loan (“Term Loan 2”) to us in the amount of $2,500,000, requiring monthly\ninstallments of approximately $41,667. The annual rate of interest due on Term Loan 2 is at prime\n(8.50% at December 31, 2023) plus 3.00% or Secured Overnight Finance Rate (“SOFR”) (as\ndefined in the Loan Agreement, as amended) plus 4.00% plus an SOFR Adjustment applicable for\nan interest period selected by us. A SOFR Adjustment rate of 0.10% and 0.15% is applicable for a\none-month interest period and three-month period, respectively, that may be selected by us;\n removed the minimum Tangible Adjusted Net Worth (as defined in the Loan Agreement, as\namended) covenant requirement;\n placed an indefinite reduction in borrowing availability of $750,000; and\n allows for up to $2,500,000 in capital expenditure made in fiscal year 2023 and thereafter to be\n26\ntreated as financed capital expenditure in the Company’s quarterly FCCR covenant calculation\nrequirement.\nAt maturity of the Loan Agreement, as amended, any unpaid principal balance plus interest, if any, will\nbecome due.\nPursuant to the amendment dated July 31, 2023, we have agreed to pay PNC 1.0% of the total financing\nunder the Loan Agreement, as amended, in the event we pay off our obligations on or before July 31, 2024,\nand 0.5% of the total financing if we pay off our obligations after July 31, 2024, to and including July 31,\n2025. No early termination fee shall apply if we pay off our obligations under the amended Loan Agreement\nafter July 31, 2025.\nIn connection with amendment dated July 31, 2023, we paid our lender a fee of $100,000 which is being\namortized over the remaining term of the Loan Agreement, as amended, as interest expense-financing fees.\nPursuant to the Loan Agreement, as amended, the annual rate of interest due on the revolving credit is at\nprime plus 2% or SOFR plus 3.00% plus an SOFR Adjustment applicable for an interest period selected by\nus. The annual rate of interest due on Term Loan 1 and the Capital line is at prime plus 2.50% or SOFR plus\n3.50% plus an SOFR Adjustment applicable for an interest period selected by us. SOFR Adjustment rates of\n0.10% and 0.15% are applicable for a one-month interest period and three-month period, respectively, that\nmay be selected by us. See payment of annual rate of interest due on Term Loan 2 under the amendment\ndated July 31, 2023, as discussed above.\nOur credit facility under our Loan Agreement, as amended, contains certain financial covenants, along with\ncustomary representations and warranties. A breach of any of these financial covenants, unless waived by\nour lender, could result in a default under our credit facility allowing our lender to immediately require the\nrepayment of all outstanding debt under our credit facility and terminate all commitments to extend further\ncredit. We were not required to perform testing of the FCCR requirement in the first quarter of 2023\npursuant to the March 21, 2023, amendment as discussed above. We otherwise met all of our other financial\ncovenant requirements. We met all of our covenant requirements in each of the second to fourth quarters of\n2023 and we expect to meet our covenant requirements in the next twelve months.\nOn May 19, 2023, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the U.S Securities and Exchange\nCommission (the “Commission”), which was declared effective by the Commission on June 1, 2023. The\nshelf registration statement gives us the ability to sell up to 2,500,000 shares of our Common Stock from\ntime to time and through one or more methods of distribution, subject to market conditions and our capital\nneeds at that time. The terms of any offering under the registration statement will be established at the time\nof the offering and be set forth in an accompanying prospectus or prospectus supplement relating to the\noffering. At this time, we do not have any immediate plans or current commitments to issue shares under the\nregistration statement. This is not an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be a sale\nof securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to\nregistration or qualification under the securities laws of such state or jurisdiction.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nFrom time to time, we are required to post standby letters of credit and various bonds to support contractual\nobligations to customers and other obligations, including facility closures. At December 31, 2023, the total\namount of standby letters of credit outstanding totaled approximately $3,950,000 and the total amount of\nbonds outstanding totaled approximately $36,674,000. We also provide closure and post-closure\nrequirements through a financial assurance policy for certain of our Treatment Segment facilities through\nAmerican International Group, Inc. (“AIG”). At December 31, 2023, the closure and post-closure\nrequirements for these facilities were approximately $22,461,000.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared based upon the selection and application of US GAAP,\nwhich may require us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect amounts reported in our\nfinancial statements and accompanying notes. The accounting policies below are those we believe affect the\n27\nmore significant estimates and judgments used in preparation of our financial statements. Our other\naccounting policies are described in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements of this\nForm 10-K (see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements – Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”):\nRevenues. Our revenues are generated from our two segments, Treatment and Services. Certain contracts\nwithin our Services Segment are generated from long-term fixed price contracts. Under fixed price\ncontracts, the objective of the project is not attained unless all scope items within the contract are completed\nand all of the services promised within fixed fee contracts constitute a single performance obligation.\nTransaction price is estimated based upon the estimated cost to complete the overall project. Revenue from\nfixed price contracts is recognized over time primarily using the input method. For the input method,\nrevenue is recognized based on costs incurred on the project relative to the total estimated costs of the\nproject.\nOur contracts generally do not give rise to variable consideration. However, from time to time, we may\nsubmit requests for equitable adjustments under certain of our government contracts for price or other\nmodifications that are determined to be variable consideration. We estimate the amount of variable\nconsideration to include in the estimated transaction price based on historical experience with government\ncontracts, anticipated performance and management’s best judgment at the time and to the extent it is\nprobable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty\nassociated with the variable consideration is resolved. These estimates are re-assessed each reporting period\nas required.\nIntangible Assets. Intangible assets consist primarily of the recognized value of the permits required to\noperate our business. We continually monitor the propriety of the carrying amount of our permits to\ndetermine whether current events and circumstances warrant adjustments to the carrying value.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment annually as of October\n1, or when events or changes in the business environment indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.\nIf the fair value of the asset is less than the carrying amount, we perform a quantitative test to determine the\nfair value. The impairment loss, if any, is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its\nfair value. Significant judgments are inherent in these analyses and include assumptions for, among other\nfactors, forecasted revenue, gross margin, growth rate, operating income, timing of expected future cash\nflows, and the determination of appropriate long-term discount rates.\nImpairment testing of our permits related to our Treatment reporting unit as of October 1, 2023, and 2022\nresulted in no impairment charges.\nIntangible assets that have definite useful lives are amortized using the straight-line method over the\nestimated useful lives (with the exception of customer relationships which are amortized using an\naccelerated method) and are excluded from our annual intangible asset valuation review as of October 1.\nIntangible assets with definite useful lives are also tested for impairment whenever events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that the asset’s carrying value may not be recoverable.\nOur future cash flow assumptions and conclusions with respect to asset impairments could be impacted by\nchanges arising from (i) a sustained period of economic and industrial slowdowns (ii) inability to scale our\noperations and implement cost reduction efforts during reduced demand and/or (iii) a significant decline in\nour share price for a sustained period of time. These factors, among others, could significantly impact the\nimpairment analysis and may result in future asset impairment charges that, if incurred, could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We believe that the assumptions\nand estimates utilized for the reporting periods are appropriate based on the information available to\nmanagement.\nAccrued Closure Costs and Asset Retirement Obligations (“ARO”). Accrued closure costs represent our\nestimated environmental liability to clean up our facilities as required by our permits, in the event of\nclosure. ASC 410, “Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations” requires that the discounted fair\n28\nvalue of a liability for an ARO be recognized in the period in which it is incurred with the associated ARO\ncapitalized as part of the carrying cost of the asset. The recognition of an ARO requires that management\nmake numerous estimates, assumptions and judgments regarding such factors as estimated probabilities,\ntiming of settlements, material and service costs, current technology, laws and regulations, and credit\nadjusted risk-free rate to be used. We develop estimates for the cost of these activities based on our\nevaluation of site-specific facts and circumstances, such as the existence of structures and other\nimprovements that would need to be dismantled and the length of the post-closure period as determined by\nthe applicable regulatory agency, among other things. Included in our cost estimates are our interpretation of\ncurrent regulatory requirements and any proposed regulatory changes. These cost estimates may change in\nthe future due to various circumstances including, but not limited to, permit modifications, changes in\nlegislation or regulations, technological changes and results of environmental studies. Our cost estimates are\ncalculated using internal sources as well as input from third-party experts. This estimate is inflated, using an\ninflation rate, to the expected time at which the closure will occur, and then discounted back, using a credit\nadjusted risk free rate, to the present value. ARO’s are included within buildings as part of property and\nequipment and are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the property. In periods subsequent to initial\nmeasurement of the ARO, we must recognize period-to-period changes in the liability resulting from the\npassage of time and revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted\ncash flow. Increases in the ARO liability due to passage of time impact net income as accretion expense and\nare included in cost of goods sold in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Changes in the estimated\nfuture cash flows costs underlying the obligations (resulting from changes or expansion at the facilities)\nrequire adjustment to the ARO liability calculated and are capitalized and charged as depreciation expense,\nin accordance with our depreciation policy.\nIncome Taxes. The provision for income tax is determined in accordance with ASC 740, “Income Taxes.”\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our\nincome taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We record this amount as a provision or\nbenefit for taxes. This process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure, including assessing the\nrisks associated with tax audits, and assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of\nitems for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nWe regularly review deferred tax assets by jurisdiction to assess their potential realization and establish a\nvaluation allowance for portions of such assets that we believe will not be realized. In performing this\nreview, we make estimates and assumptions regarding projected future taxable income, the expected timing\nof the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies. A\nchange in these assumptions could cause an increase or decrease to the valuation allowance which could\nmaterially impact our results of operations.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” – Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements” – Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for the recent accounting\npronouncements that will be adopted in future periods.\nKnown Trends and Uncertainties\nEconomic Conditions. Our business continues to be heavily dependent on services that we provide to\ngovernmental clients (domestic), primarily as subcontractors for others who are prime contractors to\ngovernment authorities (particularly the DOE and DOD) or directly as the prime contractor. We believe\ndemand for our services will continue to be subject to fluctuations due to a variety of factors beyond our\ncontrol, including without limitation, the economic conditions and the manner in which the government\nentity will be required to spend funding to remediate various sites. In addition, our U.S. governmental\ncontracts and subcontracts relating to activities at governmental sites are generally subject to termination for\nconvenience at any time at the option of the government. Significant reductions in the level of governmental\nfunding or specifically mandated levels for different programs that are important to our business could have\na material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nSignificant Customers. Our Treatment and Services Segments have significant relationships with the U.S\ngovernmental authorities through contracts entered into indirectly as subcontractors for others who are\n29\nprime contractors or directly as the prime contractor to government authorities. Our inability to continue\nunder existing contracts that we have with the U.S government (directly or indirectly as a subcontractor) or\nsignificant reductions in the level of governmental funding in any given year could have a material adverse\nimpact on our operations and financial condition.\nWe performed services relating to waste generated by government clients (domestic), either directly as a\nprime contractor or indirectly for others as a subcontractor to government entities, representing\napproximately $70,642,000, or 78.7%, of our total revenue during 2023, as compared to $59,658,000, or\n84.5%, of our total revenue during 2022.\nSee discussion of a multi-year contract valued up to approximately EUR 50 million awarded to us and our\nJV partner by the European Commission on December 18, 2023, for the treatment of radioactive waste from\nthe Joint Research Center in Ispra, Italy under “Business Environment” within this MD&A.\nOur revenues are project/event based where the completion of one contract with a specific customer may be\nreplaced by another contract with a different customer from year to year.\nPerma-Fix Canada Inc. (“PF Canada”). During the fourth quarter of 2021, PF Canada received a Notice of\nTermination (“NOT”) from Canadian Nuclear Laboratories, LTD. (“CNL”) on a Task Order Agreement\n(“TOA”) that PF Canada entered into with CNL in May 2019 for remediation work within Ontario, Canada\n(“Agreement”). The NOT was received after work under the TOA was substantially completed and work\nunder the TOA has since been completed. CNL may terminate the TOA at any time for convenience. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, PF Canada has approximately $2,389,000 in unpaid receivables due from CNL as a\nresult of work performed under the TOA. CNL and PF Canada have reached a settlement agreement on\npayment of the receivables to PF Canada by CNL, subject to certain conditions/terms precedents being met,\nincluding release of certain liens. On January 22, 2024, we received a partial payment of approximately\n$741,000 from CNL, with the remaining receivables to be paid by CNL upon completion of the settlement\nconditions/terms, which we believe should occur during 2024.\nPotential Partnership with Springfields Fuels Limited. As discussed above, we have signed a non-binding\nterm sheet addressing plans to partner with Springfields Fuels Limited, an affiliate of Westinghouse Electric\nCompany LLC, to develop and manage a nuclear waste-materials treatment facility in the United Kingdom.\nSee “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Investing Activities” of this MD&A for a discussion of this\ntransaction.\nInflation and Supply Chain. Our financial results have been negatively impacted by various\nmacroeconomic factors, including the effects of inflation, supply chain issues, labor shortages, and higher\ninterest rates, due, in part, to the impact of COVID-19 (which has mostly subsided). Continued increases in\nany of our operating costs, including utility, transportation, wage rates, and supply costs, may further\nincrease our overall cost of goods sold or operating expenses. We may attempt to increase our service and\ntreatment prices in order to maintain satisfactory margin from the effect of these factors as discussed above;\nhowever, competitive pressures in our industry may have the effect of inhibiting our ability to reflect these\nincreased costs in the prices of our services that we provide to our customers and therefore reduce our\nprofitability.\nRelated Party Transactions\nSee a discussion of our related party transactions in “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\n– Notes to Consolidate Financial Statements – Note 16 – Related Party Transactions.”\nITEM 7A.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements\nConsolidated Financial Statements Page No.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID Number 248)\n34\nConsolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 36\nConsolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022 38\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the\nyears ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 39\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022 40\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years\nended December 31, 2022 and 2022 41\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements 42\nFinancial Statement Schedules\nIn accordance with the rules of Regulation S-X, schedules are not submitted because they are not applicable\nto or required by the Company.\n33\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nBoard of Directors and Stockholders\nPerma-Fix Environmental Services, Inc.\nOpinion on the financial statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Perma-Fix Environmental Services, Inc. (a\nDelaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related\nconsolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for\nthe years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our\nopinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company\nas of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then\nended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to\nexpress an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting\nfirm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are\nrequired to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws\nand the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we\nplan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we\nengaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are\nrequired to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of\nexpressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nAccordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such\nprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the\nfinancial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant\nestimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.\nWe believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical audit matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the\nfinancial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and\nthat: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does\nnot alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or\non the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRealizability of deferred tax assets\nAs described further in Note 13 to the financial statements, deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation\nallowance if, based on the evaluation of positive and negative evidence, in management’s judgement it is\nmore likely than not that some portion or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. During the year\nended December 31, 2023, management concluded that sufficient positive evidence exists to ensure the\nrealizability of the net deferred tax assets that are recorded on the balance sheet.\nThe principal consideration for our determination that the realizability of the net deferred tax assets is a\ncritical audit matter is that the projected financial information related to the profitability of the Company,\nwhich is primarily reliant on the ability to predict future revenue, subject to significant management\n34\njudgement in determining whether the net deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in the\nfuture. This, in turn, led to a high degree of auditor judgement and effort in performing procedures and\nevaluating audit evidence related to management’s assessment of the realization of the net deferred tax\nassets.\nOur audit procedures related to the realizability of the net deferred tax assets included the following, among\nothers.\n We evaluated the positive and negative evidence available to support management’s assessment of the\nrealizability of the net deferred tax assets\n We tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in management’s assessment\n We evaluated the prospective financial information related to future profitability including\nconsideration of:\no The current and past performance of the Company\no The consistency with external market and industry data\no The consistency with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit\n/s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2014.\nAtlanta, Georgia\nMarch 13,

1\nDESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nPerma-Fix Environmental Services, Inc. (the Company, which may be referred to as we, us, or our), an\nenvironmental and technology know-how company, is a Delaware corporation, engaged through its\nsubsidiaries, in two reportable segments:\nTREATMENT SEGMENT, which includes:\n- nuclear, low-level radioactive, mixed waste (containing both hazardous and low-level radioactive\nconstituents), hazardous and non-hazardous waste treatment, processing and disposal services\nprimarily through four uniquely licensed and permitted treatment and storage facilities; and\n- R&D activities to identify, develop and implement innovative waste processing techniques for\nproblematic waste streams.\nSERVICES SEGMENT, which includes:\n- Technical services, which include:\no professional radiological measurement and site survey of large government and commercial\ninstallations using advanced methods, technology and engineering;\no integrated Occupational Safety and Health services including IH assessments; hazardous\nmaterials surveys, e.g., exposure monitoring; lead and asbestos management/abatement\noversight; indoor air quality evaluations; health risk and exposure assessments; health &\nsafety plan/program development, compliance auditing and training services; and OSHA\ncitation assistance;\no global technical services providing consulting, engineering, project management, waste\nmanagement, environmental, and D&D field, technical, and management personnel and\nservices to commercial and government customers; and\no on-site waste management services to commercial and governmental customers.\n- Nuclear services, which include:\no technology-based services including engineering, D&D, specialty services and construction,\nlogistics, transportation, processing and disposal;\no remediation of nuclear licensed and federal facilities and the remediation cleanup of nuclear\nlegacy sites. Such services capability includes: project investigation; radiological\nengineering; partial and total plant D&D; facility decontamination, dismantling, demolition,\nand planning; site restoration; logistics; transportation; and emergency response; and\n- A company owned equipment calibration and maintenance laboratory that services, maintains,\ncalibrates, and sources (i.e., rental) health physics, IH and customized NEOSH instrumentation.\nThe Company’s continuing operations consist of the operations of our subsidiaries/facilities as follow:\nDiversified Scientific Services, Inc. (“DSSI”), Perma-Fix of Florida, Inc. (“PFF”), Perma-Fix of Northwest\nRichland, Inc. (“PFNWR”), Safety & Ecology Corporation (“SEC”), Perma-Fix Environmental Services\nUK Limited (“PF UK Limited”), Perma-Fix Canada, Inc. (“PF Canada”) and Oak Ridge Environmental\nWaste Operations Center (“EWOC”).\nThe Company’s continuing operations also consisted of Perma-Fix ERRG, a variable interest entity (“VIE”)\nfor which we were the primary beneficiary. The VIE was an unpopulated joint venture (“JV”) entered\nbetween the Company and Engineering/Remediation Resources Group, Inc. (“ERRG”) for a specific project\nunder the Services Segment in which the Company and ERRG had a 51% and 49% partnership interest in\nthe joint venture, respectively. During the fourth quarter of 2022, project work under the JV was completed\nThe Company’s discontinued operations (see “Note 8 – Discontinued Operations”) consist of operations of\nall our subsidiaries included in our Industrial Segment which encompasses subsidiaries divested in 2011 and\n42\nearlier, as well as three previously closed locations.\nOn December 18, 2023, a JV where the Company and Campoverde Srl (“JV partner”) each owns 50% of\nthe partnership, was awarded a multi-year contract valued up to approximately EUR 50 million by the\nEuropean Commission (the “Contracting Authority”) for the treatment of radioactive waste from the Joint\nResearch Center in Ispra, Italy. Work under this JV has not started as of December 31, 2023. The scope of\nwork to be performed in the initial phases of this contract will be performed predominately by our JV\npartner. Revenue generated by the Company under the initial phases will be limited to project management\nsupport through 2025. The Company expects to generate an increase in revenue under this contract starting\nin 2026 when the waste treatment phases begin. The Contracting Authority may terminate the contract\nunder certain conditions as set forth in the contract. Once activities commence under this JV, the Company\nwill consolidate the operations of this JV into its financial statements.\nFinancial Positions and Liquidity\nThe Company experienced significant improvement in its 2023 financial results as the lingering effects of\nCOVID-19 began to subside starting in the early part of 2022. The Company’s Treatment Segment\ncontinued to see steady improvements in waste receipts from certain customers who had previously delayed\nwaste shipments due, in part, from the impact of COVID-19. Within the Company’s Services Segment,\ncertain projects which were delayed/curtailed in first part of 2022 due, in part, from the lingering effects of\nthe COVID-19, achieved full operational status and improved productivity in 2023 which positively\nimpacted revenue. Revenues from both of the Company’s Segments were also positively impacted from\ncontracts won in 2023 as procurement and planning on behalf of our government clients continued to\nprogress as the lingering effects of COVID-19 pandemic subsided.\nHeading into 2024, the Company expects to see overall continue steady improvements in waste receipts and\nincreases in project work from certain existing contracts, contracts won in 2023, and bids submitted in both\nsegments that are awaiting awards. However, due to our operations which is subject to seasonal factor, the\nCompany generally experiences lower revenue in the first quarter due to overall reduced activities by our\ncustomers from the usual slowdown in operations due, in part, from returning from the holiday periods and\npoorer weather conditions. Additionally, due to Congress’s inability to timely approve FY 2024 budget and\nthe extension of the continuing resolution, certain of our government related customers have informed us\nthat waste shipments will likely be delayed. Although the Company expects to see overall improvements in\nrevenue in 2024 as disclosed above, if Congress is unable to enact the full FY 2024 appropriation bills or\nfurther extend the continuing resolutions to fund government spending by the late March deadline, the U.S.\ngovernment will enter into a partial shutdown. The full impact of any additional continued resolution\nbeyond March or a partial government shutdown is uncertain. If a partial government shutdown were to\noccur and were to continue an extended period, our financial results of operations could be negatively\nimpacted by delays in procurement actions, waste shipments and project delays on newly awarded projects.\nThe Company’s cash flow requirements during the twelve-months ended December 31, 2023, were\nprimarily financed by its operations, credit facility availability and cash on hand (which included the ERC,\nalong with interest, that the Company received in March 2023 (See “Note 10 – Employee Retention Credit\n(“ERC”) and proceeds from a new term loan dated July 31, 2023, in the amount of $2,500,000 provided to\nus under an amendment to the Company’s existing credit facility (See “Note 9 – Long Term Debt”)). The\nCompany’s cash flow requirements for the next twelve months will consist primarily of general working\ncapital needs, scheduled principal payments on our debt obligations, remediation projects, and planned\ncapital expenditures. The Company plans to fund these requirements from its operations, cash on hand,\ncredit facility availability, and collections of unpaid receivables (See “Note 14 – Commitments and\nContingencies - Perma-Fix Canada, Inc. (“PF Canada”)” and “Note 19 – Subsequent Events – Perma-Fix\nCanada, Inc. (“PF Canada”)” for a discussion of a settlement agreement relating to unpaid receivables due\nto the Company from Canadian Nuclear Laboratories (“CNL”)). The Company’s ability to utilize its credit\nfacility from its lender is subject to meeting its quarterly financial covenant requirements, among other\nthings. The Company continues to explore all sources of increasing its capital and/or liquidity and to\nimprove its revenue and working capital, including, but not limited to entering into equity transactions.\nThere are no assurances that the Company will be successful in increasing our liquidity through our efforts.\nThe Company is continually reviewing operating costs and reviewing the possibility of further reducing\n43\noperating costs and non-essential expenditures to bring them in line with revenue levels, when necessary. At\nthis time, the Company believes that its cash flows from operations, our available liquidity from our credit\nfacility, and our cash on hand should be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months.\nNOTE 2\nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe Company’s consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries. The Company’s consolidated financial statements for 2022 also included the accounts of\nPerma-Fix ERRG, a VIE for which we were the primary beneficiary as discussed above, after elimination of\nall significant intercompany accounts and transactions.\nUse of Estimates\nThe Company prepares financial statements in conformity with accounting standards generally accepted in\nthe United States (“U.S. GAAP”), which may require estimates of future cash flows and assumptions that\naffect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the\ndate of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the\nreporting period. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results could differ\nfrom those estimates.\nCash and Finite Risk Sinking Fund (Restricted Cash)\nAs of December 31, 2023, and 2022, the Company had cash on hand of approximately $7,500,000 and\n$1,866,000, respectively. Starting in late 2023, the Company maintained an interest bearing money account\nwith its lender. At December 31, 2023, and 2022, the Company had finite risk sinking funds of\napproximately $12,074,000 and $11,570,000, respectively, which represented cash held as collateral under\nthe Company’s financial assurance policy (see “Note 14 – Commitment and Contingencies – Insurance” for\na discussion of this finite risk sinking fund).\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable are customer obligations due under normal trade terms generally requiring payment\nwithin 30 or 60 days from the invoice date based on the customer type (government, broker, or\ncommercial). The carrying amount of accounts receivables is reduced by a credit loss determined in\naccordance with Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-13 “Credit Losses (Topic 326) Measurement\nof Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” which requires the Company to consider forward-looking\ninformation in estimating the expected loss and is developed using historical collection experience, current\nand future economic and market conditions that may affect customers’ ability to pay, and a review of the\ncurrent status of customers’ accounts receivables. The Company does not apply a credit loss allowance to\ngovernment related receivables due to our past successful experience in their collectability. The Company’s\nmonitoring activities include routine follow-up on past due accounts and consideration of customers’\nfinancial conditions. Once the Company has exhausted all options in the collection of a delinquent accounts\nreceivable balance, which includes collection letters, demands for payment, collection agencies and\nattorneys, the account is deemed uncollectible and subsequently written off. The write off process involves\napprovals from senior management based on required approval thresholds.\nThe following table sets forth the activity in the allowance for credit losses for the years ended December\n31, 2023, and 2022 (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nAllowance for credit losses - beginning of year $ 57 $ 85\nProvision charges (Recovery of) 44 (21)\nWrite-off (71) (7)\nAllowance for credit losses - end of year $ 30 $ 57\n44\nUnbilled Receivables\nUnbilled receivables are generated by differences between invoicing timing and our over time revenue\nrecognition methodology used for revenue recognition purposes. As major processing and contract\ncompletion phases are completed and the costs are incurred, the Company recognizes the corresponding\npercentage of revenue. Within our Treatment Segment, the facilities experience delays in processing\ninvoices due to the complexity of the documentation that is required for invoicing, as well as the difference\nbetween completion of revenue recognition milestones and agreed upon invoicing terms, which results in\nunbilled receivables. The timing differences occur for several reasons which include: delays in the final\nprocessing of all wastes associated with certain work orders and delays for analytical testing that is required\nafter the facilities have processed waste but prior to our release of waste for disposal. The tasks relating to\nthese delays can take months to complete but are generally completed within twelve months.\nUnbilled receivables within our Services Segment can result from work performed under contracts but\ninvoice milestones have not yet been met and/or contract claims and pending change orders, including\nrequests for equitable adjustments (“REA”) for which work has been performed and collection of revenue is\nreasonably assured.\nInventories\nInventories consist of treatment chemicals, saleable used oils, and certain supplies. Additionally, the\nCompany has replacement parts in inventory, which are deemed critical to the operating equipment and may\nalso have extended lead times should the part fail and need to be replaced. Inventories are valued at the\nlower of cost or net realizable value with cost determined by the first-in, first-out method.\nDisposal and Transportation Costs\nThe Company accrues for waste disposal based on the waste at each facility at the end of each accounting\nperiod. Current market prices for transportation and disposal costs are applied to the end of period waste\ninventories to calculate for the transportation and disposal accruals.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment expenditures are capitalized and depreciated using the straight-line method over the\nestimated useful lives of the assets for financial statement purposes, while accelerated depreciation methods\nare principally used for income tax purposes. Generally, asset lives range from ten to forty years for\nbuildings (including improvements and asset retirement costs) and three to seven years for office furniture\nand equipment, vehicles, and decontamination and processing equipment. Leasehold improvements are\ncapitalized and amortized over the lesser of the term of the lease or the life of the asset. Maintenance and\nrepairs are charged directly to expense as incurred. The cost and accumulated depreciation of assets sold or\nretired are removed from the respective accounts, and any gain or loss from sale or retirement is recognized\nin the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Renewals and improvements, which extend\nthe useful lives of the assets, are capitalized.\nCertain property and equipment expenditures are financed through leases. Amortization of financed leased\nassets is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, assets recorded under finance leases were $1,608,000 less accumulated depreciation of\n$545,000, resulting in net fixed assets under finance leases of $1,063,000. As of December 31, 2022, assets\nrecorded under finance leases were $1,201,000 less accumulated depreciation of $549,000, resulting in net\nfixed assets under finance leases of $652,000. These assets are recorded within net property and equipment\non the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nLong-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or\nchanges in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.\nRecoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset\nto estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of\nan asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which\nthe carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are separately\npresented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell\nand are no longer depreciated.\n45\nOur depreciation expense totaled approximately $2,370,000 and $1,872,000 in 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nLeases\nThe Company accounts for leases in accordance with FASB’s ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842).” At the\ninception of an arrangement, the Company determines if an arrangement is, or contains, a lease based on\nfacts and circumstances present in that arrangement. Lease classifications, recognition, and measurement are\nthen determined at the lease commencement date.\nThe Company’s operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and operating lease liabilities include primarily\nleases for office and warehouse spaces used to conduct our business. The Company’s operating leases also\ninclude the lease of a building with land utilized for our waste treatment operations which includes a\npurchase option. These leases have remaining terms of approximately one to six years. The Company\nincludes renewal options in valuing its ROU assets and liabilities when it determines that it is reasonably\ncertain to exercise these renewal options; however, at December 31, 2023, none of our operating leases has\nremaining renewal options. As most of our operating leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company\nuses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate when determining the present value of the lease\npayments. The incremental borrowing rate is determined based on the Company’s secured borrowing rate,\nlease terms and current economic environment. Some of our operating leases include both lease (rent\npayments) and non-lease components (maintenance costs such as cleaning and landscaping services). The\nCompany has elected the practical expedient to account for lease component and non-lease component as a\nsingle component for all leases under ASU 2016-02. Lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a\nstraight-line basis over the lease term.\nFinance leases primarily consist of processing and transport equipment used by our facilities’ operations.\nThe Company’s finance leases have remaining terms of approximately one to six years. See “Property and\nEquipment” above for assets recorded under financed leases. Borrowing rates for our finance leases are\neither explicitly stated in the lease agreements or implicitly determined from available terms in the lease\nagreements.\nThe Company adopted the policy to not recognize ROU assets and liabilities for short term leases.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets consist primarily of the recognized value of the permits required to operate our business.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment annually as of October\n1, or when events or changes in the business environment indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.\nIf the fair value of the asset is less than the carrying amount, a quantitative test is performed to determine\nthe fair value. The impairment loss, if any, is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over\nits fair value. Judgments and estimates are inherent in these analyses and include assumptions for, among\nother factors, forecasted revenue, gross margin, growth rate, operating income, timing of expected future\ncash flows, and the determination of appropriate long-term discount rates. Impairment testing of our\nindefinite-lived permits related to our Treatment reporting unit as of October 1, 2023 and 2022 resulted in\nno impairment charges.\nIntangible assets that have definite useful lives are amortized using the straight-line method over the\nestimated useful lives (with the exception of customer relationships which are amortized using an\naccelerated method) and are excluded from our annual intangible asset valuation review as of October 1.\nDefinite-lived intangible assets are also tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances\nsuggest impairment might exist.\nResearch and Development (“R&D”)\nOperational innovation and technical know-how are very important to the success of our business. Our goal\nis to discover, develop, and bring to market innovative ways to process waste that address unmet\nenvironmental needs and to develop new company service offerings. The Company conducts research\ninternally and also through collaborations with other third parties. R&D costs consist primarily of employee\nsalaries and benefits, laboratory costs, third party fees, and other related costs associated with the\ndevelopment and enhancement of new potential waste treatment processes and new technology and are\n46\ncharged to expense when incurred in accordance with ASC Topic 730, “Research and Development.”\nAccrued Closure Costs and Asset Retirement Obligations (“ARO”)\nAccrued closure costs represent our estimated environmental liability to clean up our facilities, as required\nby our permits, in the event of closure. ASC 410, “Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations”\nrequires that the discounted fair value of a liability for an ARO be recognized in the period in which it is\nincurred with the associated ARO capitalized as part of the carrying cost of the asset. The recognition of an\nARO requires that management make numerous estimates, assumptions and judgments regarding such\nfactors as estimated probabilities, timing of settlements, material and service costs, current technology, laws\nand regulations, and credit adjusted risk-free rate to be used. This estimate is inflated, using an inflation\nrate, to the expected time at which the closure will occur, and then discounted back, using a credit adjusted\nrisk free rate, to the present value. ARO’s are included within buildings as part of property and equipment\nand are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the property. In periods subsequent to initial\nmeasurement of the ARO, the Company must recognize period-to-period changes in the liability resulting\nfrom the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate of\nundiscounted cash flows. Increases in the ARO liability due to passage of time impact net income as\naccretion expense, which is included in cost of goods sold. Changes in costs resulting from changes or\nexpansion at the facilities require adjustment to the ARO liability and are capitalized and charged as\ndepreciation expense, in accordance with the Company’s depreciation policy.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for in accordance with ASC 740, “Income Taxes.” Under ASC 740, the\nprovision for income taxes is comprised of taxes that are currently payable and deferred taxes that relate to\nthe temporary differences between financial reporting carrying values and tax bases of assets and liabilities.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable\nincome in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Any effect\non deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that\nincludes the enactment date.\nASC 740 requires that deferred income tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely\nthan not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The Company\nregularly assesses the likelihood that the deferred tax asset will be recovered from future taxable income.\nThe Company considers projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies, then records a\nvaluation allowance to reduce the carrying value of the net deferred income taxes to an amount that is more\nlikely than not to be realized.\nASC 740 sets out a consistent framework for preparers to use to determine the appropriate recognition and\nmeasurement of uncertain tax positions. ASC 740 uses a two-step approach wherein a tax benefit is\nrecognized if a position is more-likely-than-not to be sustained. The amount of the benefit is then measured\nto be the highest tax benefit which is greater than 50% likely to be realized. ASC 740 also sets out\ndisclosure requirements to enhance transparency of an entity’s tax reserves. The Company recognizes\naccrued interest and income tax penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax\nexpense.\nThe Company reassesses the validity of our conclusions regarding uncertain income tax positions on a\nquarterly basis to determine if facts or circumstances have arisen that might cause us to change our\njudgment regarding the likelihood of a tax position’s sustainability under audit.\nForeign Currency\nThe Company’s foreign subsidiaries include PF UK Limited and PF Canada. Assets and liabilities are\ntranslated to U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date and revenue and expenses at\nthe average exchange rate for the period. Foreign currency translation adjustments for these subsidiaries are\naccumulated as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’\nequity. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are recognized in the Consolidated\nStatements of Operations.\n47\nConcentration Risk\nThe Company performed services relating to waste generated by government clients (domestic), either\nindirectly for others as a subcontractor to government entities or directly as a prime contractor, representing\napproximately $70,642,000, or 78.8%, of our total revenue during 2023, as compared to $59,658,000, or\n84.5%, of our total revenue during 2022.\nOur revenues are project/event based where the completion of one contract with a specific customer may be\nreplaced by another contract with a different customer from year to year.\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist\nprincipally of cash and accounts receivable. The Company maintains cash with high quality financial\ninstitutions, which may exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insured amounts from time\nto time. The Company has not experienced any losses due to such cash concentration. Concentration of\ncredit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited due to the Company's large number of customers\nand their dispersion throughout the United States as well as with the significant amount of work that we\nperform for government entities.\nThe Company had two government related customers whose total unbilled and net outstanding receivable\nbalances each represented 13.2% of the Company’s total consolidated unbilled and net accounts receivable\nat December 31, 2023. The Company had two government related customers whose total unbilled and net\noutstanding receivable balances represented 12.5% and 23.0% of the Company’s total consolidated unbilled\nand net accounts receivable at December 31, 2022.\nRevenue Recognition and Related Policies\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with FASB’s ASC 606, “Revenue from Contracts with\nCustomers.” ASC 606 provides a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with\ncustomers. Under ASC 606, a five-step process is utilized in order to determine revenue recognition,\ndepicting the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it\nexpects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Under ASC 606, a performance obligation is a\npromise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account. A\ncontract transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenues as\nthe performance obligation is satisfied.\nTreatment Segment Revenues:\nContracts in our Treatment Segment primarily have a single performance obligation as the promise to\nreceive, treat and dispose of waste is not separately identifiable in the contract and, therefore, not distinct.\nPerformance obligations are generally satisfied over time using the input method. Under the input method,\nthe Company uses a measure of progress divided into major phases which include receipt (ranging from\n9.0% to 33%), treatment/processing (ranging from 40% to 87%) and shipment/final disposal (ranging from\n2.0% to 27%). As major processing phases are completed and the costs are incurred, the proportional\npercentage of revenue is recognized. Transaction price for Treatment Segment contracts are determined by\nthe stated fixed rate per unit price as stipulated in the contract.\nThe Company periodically enter into arrangements with customers for transportation of wastes to either our\nfacility or to non-company owned disposal sites. Revenue from this arrangement is recognized at a point in\ntime, upon the transfer of control. Control transfers when the wastes are picked up by the Company.\nServices Segment Revenues:\nRevenues for our Services Segment are generated from time and materials or fixed price arrangements:\nThe Company’s primary obligation to customers in time and materials contracts relate to the provision of\nservices to the customer at the direction of the customer. This provision of services at the request of the\ncustomer is the performance obligation, which is satisfied over time. Revenue earned from time and\nmaterials contracts is determined using the input method and is based on contractually defined billing rates\napplied to services performed and materials delivered.\n48\nUnder fixed price contracts, the objective of the project is not attained unless all scope items within the\ncontract are completed and all of the services promised within fixed fee contracts constitute a single\nperformance obligation. Transaction price is estimated based upon the estimated cost to complete the overall\nproject. Revenue from fixed price contracts is recognized over time primarily using the input method. For\nthe input method, revenue is recognized based on costs incurred on the project relative to the total estimated\ncosts of the project.\nAs discussed above for the Treatment and Services Segments, the Company’ revenue is generally\nrecognized using the input method. This method of measuring progress provides a faithful depiction of the\ntransfer to goods and services because the costs incurred are expected to be substantially proportionate to\nthe Company’s satisfaction of the performance obligation.\nContracts with our customers within our Treatment Segment are generally short term with an original\nexpected length of one year or less. For the Services Segment, contracts with our customers generally have\noriginal terms ranging from one year or less to approximately twenty-four months. The Company’s\ncontracts and subcontracts relating to activities at governmental sites generally allow for termination for\nconvenience at any time at the government’s option without payment of a substantial penalty.\nVariable Consideration\nThe Company’s contracts generally do not give rise to variable consideration. However, from time to time,\nthe Company may submit requests for equitable adjustments under certain of its government contracts for\nprice or other modifications that are determined to be variable consideration. The Company estimates the\namount of variable consideration to include in the estimated transaction price based on historical experience\nwith government contracts, anticipated performance and management’s best judgment at the time and to the\nextent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the\nuncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. These estimates are re-assessed each\nreporting period as required.\nSignificant Payment Terms\nInvoicing is based on schedules established in customer contracts. Payment terms vary by customers but are\ngenerally established at 30 days from invoicing.\nIncremental Costs to Obtain a Contract\nCosts incurred to obtain contracts with our customers are immaterial and as a result, the Company expenses\n(within selling, general and administration expenses (“SG&A”)) incremental costs incurred in obtaining\ncontracts with our customer as incurred.\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nThe Company applies the practical expedient in ASC 606-10-50-14 and does not disclose information about\nremaining performance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less.\nWithin our Services Segment, there are service contracts which provide that the Company has a right to\nconsideration from a customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of our\nperformance completed to date. For those contracts, the Company has utilized the practical expedient in\nASC 606-10-55-18, which allows the Company to recognize revenue in the amount for which we have the\nright to invoice; accordingly, the Company does not disclose the value of remaining performance\nobligations for those contracts.\nThe Company’s contracts and subcontracts relating to activities at governmental sites generally allow for\ntermination for convenience at any time at the government’s option without payment of a substantial\npenalty. The Company does not disclose remaining performance obligations on these contracts.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation granted to employees are accounted for in accordance with ASC 718,\n“Compensation – Stock Compensation.” Stock-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services\nfrom nonemployees are also accounted for under ASC 718. ASC 718 requires stock-based payments to\n49\nemployees and nonemployees, including grant of options, to be recognized in the Statement of Operations\nbased on their fair values. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair-\nvalue of stock-based awards which requires subjective assumptions. Assumptions used to estimate the fair\nvalue of stock-based awards include the exercise price of the award, the expected term, the expected\nvolatility of our stock over the stock-based award’s expected term, the risk-free interest rate over the\naward’s expected term, and the expected annual dividend yield. The Company accounts for forfeitures when\nthey occur.\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\nThe components of comprehensive income (loss) are net income (loss) and the effects of foreign currency\ntranslation adjustments.\nIncome (Loss) Per Share\nBasic income (loss) per share is calculated based on the weighted-average number of outstanding common\nshares during the applicable period. Diluted income (loss) per share is based on the weighted-average\nnumber of outstanding common shares plus the weighted-average number of potential outstanding common\nshares. In periods where they are anti-dilutive, such amounts are excluded from the calculations of dilutive\nearnings per share. Income (loss) per share is computed separately for each period presented.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nCertain assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, while other assets\nand liabilities are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Fair value is determined based on the\nexchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the\nprincipal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market\nparticipants. The three-tier value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies,\nis:\nLevel 1—Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2—Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as\nquoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar\nassets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be\ncorroborated by observable market data.\nLevel 3—Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting the Company’s own assumptions,\nconsistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants.\nFinancial instruments include cash (Level 1), accounts receivable, accounts payable, and debt obligations\n(Level 3). Credit is extended to customers based on an evaluation of a customer’s financial condition and,\ngenerally, collateral is not required. As of December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, the fair value of the\nCompany’s financial instruments approximated their carrying values. The fair value of the Company’s\nrevolving credit, term loans and capital loan approximate its carrying value due to the variable interest rate.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards – Not Yet Adopted\nIn August 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-05, “Business Combinations—Joint Venture Formations\n(Subtopic 805-60): Recognition and Initial Measurement.” ASU 2023-05 applies to the formation of a “joint\nventure” or a “corporate joint venture” and requires a joint venture to initially measure all contributions\nreceived upon its formation at fair value. The guidance does not impact accounting by the venturers. The\nnew guidance is applicable to joint venture entities with a formation date on or after January 1, 2025 on a\nprospective basis. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial\nstatements.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to\nReportable Segment Disclosures,” which expands reportable segment disclosure requirements by requiring\ndisclosures of significant reportable segment expenses that are regularly provided to the CODM and\nincluded within each reported measure of a segment's profit or loss. The ASU also requires disclosure of the\ntitle and position of the individual identified as the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the\nreported measures of a segment's profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to\nallocate resources. Additionally, ASU 2023-07 requires all segment profit or loss and assets disclosures to\n50\nbe provided on an annual and interim basis. The amendments in this ASU are required to be adopted for\nfiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2024 with early adoption permitted, and should be applied on a retrospective basis. ASU\n2023-07 will be effective for the Company’s financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nThis ASU will not have impact on the Company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company is evaluating the impact to the related segment reporting disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic\n740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-09”), which modifies the rules on income tax\ndisclosures to require entities to disclose (1) specific categories in the rate reconciliation, (2) the income or\nloss from continuing operations before income tax expense or benefit (separated between domestic and\nforeign) and (3) income tax expense or benefit from continuing operations (separated by federal, state and\nforeign). ASU 2023-09 also requires entities to disclose their income tax payments to international, federal,\nstate and local jurisdictions, among other changes. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning\nafter December 15, 2024. ASU 2023-09 should be applied on a prospective basis, but retrospective\napplication is permitted. This ASU will not have impact on the Company’s consolidated financial condition\nor results of operations. The Company is evaluating the impact to its income taxes reporting disclosures.\nNOTE 3\nREVENUE\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nIn general, the Company's business segmentation is aligned according to the nature and economic\ncharacteristics of our services and provides meaningful disaggregation of each business segment's results of\noperations. The following tables present further disaggregation of our revenues by different categories for\nour Services and Treatment Segments:\nRevenue by Contract Type\n(In thousands) Twelve Months Ended Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nTreatment Services Total Treatment Services Total\nFixed price $ 43,477 $ 4 1,540 $ 85,017 $ 3 3,358 $ 2 6,960 $ 60,318\nTime and materials ― 4,718 4,718 ― 10,281 10,281\nTotal $ 43,477 $ 4 6,258 $ 89,735 $ 3 3,358 $ 3 7,241 $ 70,599\nRevenue by generator\n(In thousands) Twelve Months Ended Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nTreatment Services Total Treatment Services Total\nDomestic government $ 31,448 $ 39,194 $ 70,642 $ 2 3,752 $ 35,906 $ 59,658\nDomestic commercial 10,670 6 ,357 17,027 8 ,307 1,408 9,715\nForeign government 1,001 619 1,620 5 74 (202) 372\nForeign commercial 358 88 446 725 129 854\nTotal $ 43,477 $ 46,258 $ 89,735 $ 3 3,358 $ 37,241 $ 70,599\nContract Balances\nThe timing of revenue recognition and billings results in unbilled receivables (contract assets).

A breach of any of these financial\ncovenants, unless waived by PNC, could result in a default under our credit facility allowing our lender to\nimmediately require the repayment of all outstanding debt under our credit facility and terminate all\ncommitments to extend further credit. The Company’s Loan Agreement, as amended, prohibits us from\npaying cash dividends on our Common Stock without prior approval from our lender.

The ERC was subsequently amended by the Taxpayer\nCertainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2020, the Consolidated Appropriation Act of 2021, and the\nAmerican Rescue Plan Act of 2021, all of which amended and extended the ERC availability and guidelines\nunder the CARES Act. Following these amendments, the Company determined that it was eligible for the\nERC, and as a result of the foregoing legislations, was eligible to claim a refundable tax credit against the\nCompany’s share of certain payroll taxes equal to 70% of the qualified wages paid to employees between\nJuly 1, 2021 and September 30, 2021. Qualified wages were limited to $10,000 per employee per calendar\nquarter in 2021 for a maximum allowable ERC per employee of $7,000 per calendar quarter in 2021. For\npurposes of the amended ERC, an eligible employer was defined as having experienced a significant (20%\nor more) decline in gross receipts during one or more of the first three 2021 calendar quarters when\ncompared to 2019.\nDuring the third quarter of 2022, the Company determined it was eligible for the ERC and amended its third\nquarter 2021 employer payroll tax filings claiming a refund from the U.S. Treasury in the amount of\napproximately $1,975,000. As there is no authoritative guidance under U.S. GAAP on accounting for\ngovernment assistance to for-profit business entities, the Company accounted for the ERC by analogy to\nInternational Accounting Standard (\"IAS\") 20, “Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of\nGovernment Assistance.” In accordance with IAS 20, management determined it had reasonable assurance\nfor receipt of the ERC and recorded the expected refund as other income (within “Other income (expense)”)\non the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and other receivables (within “Prepaid and other\nassets”) on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. On March 30, 2023, the Company received the\nERC refund of $1,975,000 and approximately $60,000 in interest (recorded within “Interest Income” on the\nCompany’s Consolidated Statements of Operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2023), totaling\napproximately $2,035,000.\nNOTE 11\nACCRUED EXPENSES\nAccrued expenses include the following (in thousands) at December 31:\n62\n2023 2022\nSalaries and employee benefits $ 4,120 $ 2,629\nAccrued sales, property and other tax 477 240\nInterest payable 23 8\nInsurance payable 1,390 1,253\nOther 550 463\nTotal accrued expenses $ 6,560 $ 4,593\nAccrued expenses for 2023 included a total of approximately $750,000 in compensation expenses accrued\nunder the 2023 Management Incentive Plans (“MIPs”) for our executives (See “Note 18 – Employment\nAgreements and MIPs” for further discussion of the 2023 MIPs) in addition to a remaining $25,000 in\ndiscretionary bonus approved by the Company’s Compensation Committee payable to the Company’s EVP\nof Nuclear and Technical Services.\nNOTE 12\nACCRUED CLOSURE COSTS AND ARO\nAccrued closure costs represent our estimated environmental liability to clean up our fixed-based regulated\nfacilities as required by our permits, in the event of closure.

The Company has elected to account for\nGILTI tax in the period in which it is incurred, and therefore has not provided any deferred tax impacts of\nGILTI in its consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. As the\nCanada and United Kingdom foreign subsidiaries are in loss positions for 2023, no GILTI inclusion is\nexpected for these entities for the current year.\nThe Company had temporary differences and net operating loss carry forwards from both our continuing\nand discontinued operations, which gave rise to deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2023, and 2022 as\nfollows (in thousands):\nDeferred tax assets: 2023 2022\nNet operating losses $ 9 ,876 $ 11,646\nEnvironmental and closure reserves 2,332 2,269\nLease liability 525 482\nCapital loss carryforward 780 756\nAccrued expenses 1,186 776\nR&D cost capitalization 905 25\nTax credits 200 135\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nDepreciation and amortization (4,260) (4,351)\nIndefinite lived intangible assets (557) (503)\nRight-of-use lease asset (510) (476)\n481(a) adjustment  (53)\nPrepaid expenses (46) (30)\n10,431 10,676\nValuation allowance (6,131) (6,560)\nNet deferred income tax asset 4,300 4,116\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company assessed whether its deferred tax asset will more likely than not to\nbe realized.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING\nAND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone.\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information\nrequired to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (the “Commission”) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the\ntime periods specified in the rules and forms of the Commission and that such information is\naccumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer\n(“CEO”) (Principal Executive Officer), and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) (Principal\nFinancial Officer), as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding the required disclosure.\nIn designing and assessing our disclosure controls and procedures, our management\nrecognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can\nprovide only reasonable assurance of achieving their stated control objectives and are subject\nto certain limitations, including the exercise of judgment by individuals, the difficulty in\nidentifying unlikely future events, and the difficulty in eliminating misconduct completely.\nOur management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of\nour disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based upon this assessment, our CEO and\nCFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control\nover financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934. Internal control over financial reporting is designed to\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of America. Because of its inherent\nlimitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements\nor fraudulent acts. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are\nsubject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or\nthat the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. A control\nsystem, no matter how well designed, can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to\nfinancial statement preparation and presentation.\nInternal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain\nto the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance\nthat transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of the consolidated\nfinancial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United\n72\nStates of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in\naccordance with appropriate authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and\n(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized\nacquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the\nconsolidated financial statements.\nManagement, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, conducted an assessment of the\neffectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 based on the\nframework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Based on this assessment,\nmanagement and our CEO and CFO, concluded that the Company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\nThis Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of the Company’s independent\nregistered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Since the\nCompany is not a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, management’s report was not\nsubject to attestation by the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm\npursuant to the rules of the Commission that permit the Company to provide only\nmanagement’s report in this Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and\n15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2023 that\nhave materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls\nover financial reporting.\nITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION\n(a) None.\n(b) During the quarter ended December 31, 2023, no director or \"officer\" (as defined\nin Rule 16a-1(f)) of the Company adopted or terminated a \"Rule 10b5-1 trading\narrangement\" or \"non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement,\" as each term is defined in\nItem 408(a) of Regulation S-K.\nITEM 9C.

Members of the Governance and Nominating Committee\nduring 2023 were Joe R. Reeder (Chairperson), Thomas P. Bostick, Kerry C. Duggan and Zach P. Wamp.\nAll members of the Nominating Committee are and were “independent” as that term is defined by current\nNasdaq listing standards.\nThe Governance and Nominating Committee has specific responsibilities which include:\n considering and making recommendations to the Board regarding the composition and\nchairmanship of the committees of our Board;\n developing and making recommendations to our Board regarding corporate governance guidelines\nwhich include policies and procedures that promote honest and ethical conduct and prohibit conflict\nof interest in business conduct;\n overseeing evaluations of the Board’s performance, including committees of the Board; and\n overseeing Company practices and initiatives with respect to environmental, social and governance\nmatters.\nThe Governance and Nominating Committee recommends to the Board of Directors candidates to fill\nvacancies on the Board and the nominees for election as directors at each annual meeting of stockholders. In\nmaking such recommendations, the Governance and Nominating Committee takes into account information\nprovided to them from the candidates, as well as the Committee’s own knowledge and information obtained\nthrough inquiries to third parties to the extent the Committee deems appropriate. The Company’s Bylaws\nsets forth certain minimum director qualifications to qualify as a nominee for election as a director. To\nqualify for nomination or for election as a director, an individual must:\n be an individual at least 21 years of age who is not under legal disability;\n have the ability to be present, in person, at all regular and special meetings of the Board of\nDirectors;\n not serve on the boards of more than three other publicly-held companies;\n satisfy the director qualification requirements of all environmental and nuclear commissions, boards\nor similar regulatory or law enforcement authorities to which the Company is subject so as not to\n80\ncause the Company to fail to satisfy any of the licensing requirements imposed by any such\nauthority;\n not be affiliated with, employed by or be a representative of, or have or acquire a material personal\ninvolvement with, or material financial interest in, any “Business Competitor” (as defined in the\nBylaws);\n not have been convicted of a felony or of any misdemeanor involving moral turpitude; and\n have been nominated for election to the Board of Directors in accordance with the terms of the\nBylaws.\nIn addition to the minimum director qualifications as mentioned above, in order for any proposed nominee\nto be eligible to be a candidate for election to the Board of Directors, such candidate must deliver to the\nGovernance and Nominating Committee a completed questionnaire with respect to the background,\nqualifications, stock ownership and independence of such proposed nominee. The Governance and\nNominating Committee reviews each candidate’s qualifications to include considerations of:\n standards of integrity, personal ethics and values, commitment, and independence of thought and\njudgment;\n ability to represent the interests of the Company’s stockholders;\n ability to dedicate sufficient time, energy and attention to fulfill the requirements of the position;\nand\n diversity of skills and experience with respect to accounting and finance, management and\nleadership, business acumen, vision and strategy, charitable causes, business operations, and\nindustry knowledge.\nThe Governance and Nominating Committee does not assign specific weight to any particular criteria and\nno particular criterion is necessarily applicable to all prospective nominees. The Governance and\nNominating Committee does not have a formal policy for the consideration of diversity in identifying\nnominees for directors. However, diversity is one of the many factors taken into account when considering\npotential candidates to serve on the Board of Directors. The Company recognizes that diversity in\nprofessional and life experiences may include consideration of gender, race, cultural background or national\norigin, in identifying individuals who possess the qualifications that the Governance and Nominating\nCommittee believes are important to be represented on the Board. The Company also views and values\ndiversity from the perspective of professional and life experiences, as well as geographic location,\nrepresentative of the markets in which we do business. The Company believes that the inclusion of diversity\nas one of many factors considered in selecting director nominees is consistent with the Company's goal of\ncreating a board of directors that best serves our needs and those of our shareholders.\nStockholder Nominees\nThe Governance and Nominating Committee will consider properly submitted stockholder nominations for\ncandidates for membership on the Board from stockholders who meet each of the requirements set forth in\nthe Bylaws, including, but not limited to, the requirements that any such stockholder own at least 1% of the\nCompany’s shares of the Common Stock entitled to vote at the meeting on such election, has held such\nshares continuously for at least one full year, and continuously holds such shares through and including the\ntime of the annual or special meeting. Nominations of persons for election to the Board may be made at any\nAnnual Meeting of Stockholders, or at any Special Meeting of Stockholders called for the purpose of\nelecting directors. Any stockholder nomination (“Proposed Nominee”) must comply with the requirements\nof the Company’s Bylaws and the Proposed Nominee must meet the minimum qualification requirements as\ndiscussed above. For a nomination to be made by a stockholder, such stockholder must provide advance\nwritten notice to the Governance and Nominating Committee, delivered to the Company’s principal\nexecutive office address (i) in the case of an Annual Meeting of Stockholders, no later than the 90th day nor\nearlier than the 120th day prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding Annual Meeting of\nStockholders; and (ii) in the case of a Special Meeting of Stockholders called for the purpose of electing\ndirectors, not later than the 10th day following the day on which public disclosure of the date of the Special\nMeeting of Stockholders is made.\n81\nThe Governance and Nominating Committee will evaluate the qualification of the Proposed Nominee and\nthe Proposed Nominee’s disclosure and compliance requirements in accordance with the Company’s\nBylaws.

The Board believes that this leadership\nstructure promotes balance between the Board’s independent authority to oversee our business, and the CEO\nand his management team, who manage the business on a day-to-day basis.\nThe Company does not have a written policy with respect to the separation of the positions of Chairman of\nthe Board and CEO. The Company believes it is important to retain its flexibility to allocate the\nresponsibilities of the offices of the Chairman and CEO in any way that is in the best interests of the\nCompany at a given point in time; therefore, the Company’s leadership structure may change in the future\nas circumstances may dictate.\nMark A.

Accordingly, Schelhammer Capital Bank AG believes that (i) it is not the beneficial owner, as\nsuch term is defined in Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act, of the shares of Common Stock registered in\nSchelhammer Capital Bank AG’s name because (a) Schelhammer Capital Bank AG holds the Common\nStock as a nominee only, (b) Schelhammer Capital Bank AG has neither voting nor investment power over\nsuch shares, and (c) Schelhammer Capital Bank AG has not nominated or sought to nominate, and does not\nintend to nominate in the future, any person to serve as a member of our Board; and (ii) it is not required to\nfile reports under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act or to file either Schedule 13D or Schedule 13G in\nconnection with the shares of our Common Stock registered in the name of Schelhammer Capital Bank AG.\nIf the representations of, or information provided by Schelhammer Capital Bank AG, are incorrect or\nSchelhammer Capital Bank AG was historically acting on behalf of its investors as a group, rather than on\nbehalf of each investor independent of other investors, then Schelhammer Capital Bank AG and/or the\ninvestor group would have become a beneficial owner of more than 10% of our Common Stock on February\n9, 1996, as a result of the acquisition on such date of 1,100 shares of our Preferred Stock that were\nconvertible into a maximum of 256,560 shares of our Common Stock. If either Schelhammer Capital Bank\nAG or a group of Schelhammer Capital Bank AG’s investors became a beneficial owner of more than 10%\nof our Common Stock on February 9, 1996, or at any time thereafter, and thereby required to file reports\nunder Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, then Schelhammer Capital Bank AG has failed to file a Form 3 or\nany Forms 4 or 5 since February 9, 1996.

Realized\nvalue on this exercise was determined based on the difference between the (a) exercise price ($3.15) per share of the Option\nShares multiplied by the 8,000 Option Shares exercised, and (b) the market value ($10.115) on the date of exercise of the Option\nShares times the 8,000 Option Shares exercised.\nEmployment Agreements\nOn April 20, 2023, upon recommendation by the Compensation Committee and approval by the Board, the\nCompany entered into employment agreements with each of Mark Duff, President and CEO, Ben\nNaccarato, EVP and CFO, Dr. Louis Centofanti, EVP of Strategic Initiatives, Andrew Lombardo, EVP of\nNuclear and Technical Services, and Richard Grondin, EVP of Waste Treatment Operations (collectively\nthe “New Employment Agreements” and each, individually, a “New Employment Agreement”).” The\nCompany had previously entered into employment agreements with each of Mark Duff, Ben Naccarato, Dr.\nLouis Centofanti, Andrew Lombardo and Richard Grondin on July 22, 2020, all five of which agreements\nwere due to expire on July 22, 2023, but which were terminated effective April 20, 2023 upon the execution\nof the New Employment Agreements.\nEach of the New Employment Agreements, which are substantially identical except for compensation, are\neffective April 20, 2023. Under the New Employment Agreements, each of these executive officers is\nprovided an annual salary, which annual salary may be increased from time to time, but not reduced, as\ndetermined by the Compensation Committee. In addition, each of these executive officers is entitled to\nparticipate in the Company’s broad-based benefits plans and to certain performance compensation payable\nunder separate MIPs as approved by the Company’s Compensation Committee and the Company’s Board.\nThe Company’s Compensation Committee and the Board approved individual 2023 MIPs on January 19,\n2023 (which were effective January 1, 2023 and applicable for the 2023 fiscal year) for each of the\nexecutive officers (see discussion of each of the 2023 MIPs below under “2023 MIPs”).\nEach of the New Employment Agreements is effective for three years from April 20, 2023 (the “Initial\nTerm”) unless earlier terminated by the Company or by the executive officer. At the end of the Initial Term\nof each New Employment Agreement, each New Employment Agreement will automatically be extended\nfor one additional year, unless at least six months prior to the expiration of the Initial Term, the Company or\nthe executive officer provides written notice not to extend the terms of the New Employment Agreement.\nMr. Andrew Lombardo retired from the position of EVP of Nuclear and Technical Services effective\nJanuary 1, 2024. Upon Mr. Lombardo’s retirement from the position of EVP of Nuclear and Technical\nServices, he no longer was an executive officer of the Company. Upon his retirement as EVP of Nuclear\nand Technical Services, his employment agreement dated April 20, 2023, was terminated effective January\n1, 2024. Mr. Lombardo remains employed by the Company at a reduced capacity, and assists with the\ntransition of his former responsibilities as well as contributing to certain business development matters.\n90\nPursuant to the New Employment Agreements, if the executive officer’s employment is terminated due to\ndeath, disability or for cause (as defined in the agreements), the Company will pay to the executive officer\nor to his estate an amount equal to the sum of any unpaid base salary and accrued unused vacation time\nthrough the date of termination and any benefits due to the executive officer under any employee benefit\nplan (the “Accrued Amounts”) plus any performance compensation payable pursuant to the executive\nofficer’s MIP with respect to the fiscal year immediately preceding the date of termination. In the event that\nan executive officer’s employment is terminated due to death, the Company will also pay a lump-sum\npayment (the “Cash Medical Continuation Benefit”) equal to eighteen times the monthly premium that\nwould be required to be paid, pursuant to the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as\namended (“COBRA”), to continue group health coverage for the executive officer’s eligible covered\ndependents in effect on the date of the executive officer’s termination of employment, based on the\npremium for the first month of COBRA coverage. Such cash payment will be taxable and will be made\nregardless of whether the executive officer’s eligible covered dependents elect COBRA continuation\ncoverage.\nIf the executive officer terminates his employment for “good reason” (as defined in the agreements) or is\nterminated by the Company without cause (including any such termination for “good reason” or without\ncause within 24 months after a Change in Control (as defined in the agreements), the Company will pay the\nexecutive officer Accrued Amounts, (a) two years of full base salary, plus (b) (i) two times the performance\ncompensation (under the executive officer’s MIP) earned with respect to the fiscal year immediately\npreceding the date of termination provided the performance compensation earned with respect to the fiscal\nyear immediately preceding the date of termination has not yet been paid, or (ii) if performance\ncompensation earned with respect to the fiscal year immediately preceding the date of termination has\nalready been paid to the executive officer, the executive officer will be paid an additional year of the\nperformance compensation earned with respect to the fiscal year immediately preceding the date of\ntermination, and (c) the Cash Medical Continuation Benefit. If the executive officer terminates his\nemployment for a reason other than for good reason, the Company will pay to the executive officer an\namount equal to the Accrued Amounts plus any performance compensation payable pursuant to the MIP\napplicable to such executive officer.\nAdditionally, in the event of a Change in Control (as defined in the agreements), all outstanding stock\noptions to purchase the common stock held by the executive officer will immediately become exercisable in\nfull commencing on the date of termination through the original term of the options. In the event of the\ndeath of an executive officer, all outstanding stock options to purchase common stock held by the executive\nofficer will immediately become exercisable in full commencing on the date of death, with such options\nexercisable for the lesser of the original option term or twelve months from the date of the executive\nofficer’s death. In the event an executive officer terminates his employment for “good reason” (as defined in\nthe agreements) or is terminated by the Company without cause, all outstanding stock options to purchase\ncommon stock held by the officer will immediately become exercisable in full commencing on the date of\ntermination, with such options exercisable for the lesser of the original option term or within 60 days from\nthe date of the executive officer’s date of termination. Severance benefits payable with respect to a\ntermination (other than Accrued Amounts) shall not be payable until the termination constitutes a\n“separation from service” (as defined under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h)).\nPotential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control\nThe following table sets forth the potential (estimated) payments and benefits to which each executive\nofficer would be entitled upon termination of employment by the executive officer for “good reason” or by\nthe Company “without cause,” or following a Change in Control of the Company, as specified under each of\ntheir respective Employment Agreements with the Company, assuming each circumstance described below\noccurred on December 31, 2023, the last day of our most recent fiscal year. Such potential payments include\nany Accrued Amounts (accrued base salary earned for 2023 but paid in 2024, as well as accrued unused\nvacation/sick time and other vested benefits under the Company plans in which the executive officer\nparticipates). The executive officer is not entitled to payment of any benefits upon termination for cause or\nresignation without good reason other than for Accrued Amounts.\n91\nGood Reason or by\nName and Principal Position Company Without Change in Control\nPotential Payment/Benefit Cause of the Company\nMark Duff\nPresident and CEO\nBase salary and Accrued Amounts $ 791,176 (1) $ 791,176 (1)\nPerformance compensation $ 374,870 (2) $ 374,870 (2)\nStock Options $ 435,650 (3) $ 435,650 (3)\nCash Medical Benefit Cotinuation $ 32,814 (4) $ 32,814 (4)\nBen Naccarato\nEVP and CFO\nBase salary and Accrued Amounts $ 682,857 (1) $ 682,857 (1)\nPerformance compensation $ 304,772 (2) $ 304,772 (2)\nStock Options $ 249,225 (3) $ 249,225 (3)\nCash Medical Benefit Cotinuation $ 54,144 (4) $ 54,144 (4)\nDr. Louis Centofanti\nEVP of Strategic Initiatives\nBase salary and Accrued Amounts $ 674,187 (1) $ 674,187 (1)\nPerformance compensation $ 253,980 (2) $ 253,980 (2)\nStock Options $ 205,700 (3) $ 205,700 (3)\nCash Medical Benefit Cotinuation $ 37,415 (4) $ 37,415 (4)\nAndy Lombardo\nEVP of Nuclear and Technical Services\nBase salary and Accrued Amounts $ 652,427 (1) $ 652,427 (1)\nPerformance compensation $ 304,772 (2) $ 304,772 (2)\nStock Options $ 176,985 (3) $ 176,985 (3)\nCash Medical Benefit Cotinuation $  (4) $  (4)\nRichard Grondin\nEVP of Waste Treatment Operations\nBase salary and Accrued Amounts $ 626,791 (1) $ 626,791 (1)\nPerformance compensation $ 261,234 (2) $ 261,234 (2)\nStock Options $ 148,665 (3) $ 148,665 (3)\nCash Medical Benefit Cotinuation $ 37,415 (4) $ 37,415 (4)\n(1) Represents two times the base salary of the executive officer at December 31, 2023, plus “Accrued Amounts.”\n(2) Represents two times the performance compensation earned for fiscal year 2023 (see “2023 MIPs” below).\n(3) Benefit is calculated based on the difference between the exercise price of each option and the market value of the Company’s\nCommon Stock per share (as reported on the Nasdaq) at December 31, 2023 times the number of options outstanding at\nDecember 31, 2023.

Base salary\nranges for executive officers are determined for each executive based on his or her position and\nresponsibility by using market data and comparisons to similar companies within the business segments in\nwhich the Company operates.\nDuring its review of base salaries for executives, the Compensation Committee primarily considers:\n market data and comparisons to similar companies within the business segments in which the\nCompany operates;\n internal review of the executive’s compensation, both individually and relative to other officers; and\n individual performance of the executive.\nSalary levels are typically considered annually as part of the performance review process as well as upon a\npromotion or other change in job responsibility. Merit-based salary increases for executives are based on the\nCompensation Committee’s assessment of the individual’s performance. The base salary and potential\nannual base salary adjustments for the NEOs are set forth in their respective employment agreements. On\nOctober 19, 2023, the Compensation Committee and the Board approved a base salary increase adjustment,\neffective January 1, 2024, of seven percent for the CEO and five percent for each of the CFO, EVP of\nStrategic Initiatives, and the EVP of Waste Treatment Operations. The following reflects the base salary for\neach of the NEOs on January 1, 2024, after the base salary increase: $417,155 for the CEO; $332,811 for\nthe CFO; $277,346 for the EVP of Strategic Initiatives; and $285,267 for the EVP of Waste Treatment\nOperations.\nPerformance-Based Incentive Compensation\nThe Compensation Committee has the latitude to design cash and equity-based incentive compensation\nprograms to promote high performance and achievement of our corporate objectives by directors and the\nNEOs, encourage the growth of stockholder value and enable employees to participate in our long-term\ngrowth and profitability. The Compensation Committee may grant stock options and/or performance\nbonuses. In granting these awards, the Compensation Committee may establish any conditions or\nrestrictions it deems appropriate. In addition, the CEO has discretionary authority to grant stock options to\ncertain high-performing executives or officers, subject to the approval of the Compensation Committee. The\nexercise price for each stock option granted is at or above the market price of our Common Stock on the\ndate of grant. Stock options may be awarded to newly hired or promoted executives at the discretion of the\nCompensation Committee. Grants of stock options to eligible newly hired executive officers are generally\nmade at the next regularly scheduled Compensation Committee meeting following the hire date.\n2023 MIPs\nOn January 19, 2023, the Compensation Committee and the Board approved individual MIPs for the\ncalendar year 2023 for each of the NEOs. Each of the MIPs was effective January 1, 2023.\nThe performance compensation payable under each MIP was based upon meeting certain of the Company’s\nseparate target objectives during 2023 as described in each of the MIPs below, provided, however, no\nperformance compensation was to be paid for attaining any of the Company’s separate target objectives\nunless a minimum of 75% of the EBITDA target objective was achieved. The Compensation Committee\nbelieves performance compensation payable under each of the MIPs should be based on achievement of at\nleast 75% of EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), a non-U.S. GAAP\n(accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America) financial measurement, as the\nCompany believes that this target provides a better indicator of operating performance as it excludes certain\nnon-cash items. EBITDA has certain limitations as it does not reflect all items of income or cash flows that\naffect the Company’s financial performance under U.S. GAAP.\n93\nIn formulating certain targets set forth in the MIPs, the Compensation Committee and the Board considered\nthe Board-approved budget for 2023, economic conditions (continued potential impact of COVID-19),\nforecasts for 2023 government spending, as well as the Compensation Committee’s expectation for\nperformance that in its estimation would warrant payment of incentive cash compensation.\nPerformance compensation amounts earned under the 2023 MIPs are to be paid on or about 90 days after\nyear-end, or sooner, based on finalization of our audited financial statements for 2023. For 2023, a total of\napproximately $750,000 was earned by the NEOs under the MIPs. See “Compensation Earned Under 2023\nMIPs” below for amount earned by each NEO under his respective MIP.\nThe Compensation Committee retained the right to modify, change or terminate each MIP and may adjust\nthe various target amounts described below, at any time and for any reason.\nThe total to be paid to the NEOs under the 2023 MIPs may not exceed 50% of the Company’s pre-tax net\nincome prior to the calculation of performance compensation.\nThe following schedules reflect performance compensation that was payable under each of the 2023 MIPs,\nalong with a description of the target objectives.\nCEO MIP:\nAnnualized Base Pay: $374,870\nPerformance Incentive Compensation Target (at 100% of Plan): $187,435\nTotal Annual Target Compensation (at 100% of Plan): $562,305\nPerma-Fix Environmental Services, Inc.\n2023 Management Incentive Plan\nCEO MIP MATRIX\nTarget Objectives Performance Target Achieved\n75%-89% 90%-110% 111%-129% 130%-150% >150%\nRevenue (1) (6) $ 9,372 $ 18,744 $ 32,132 $ 4 5,520 $ 72,297\nEBITDA (2) 56,229 112,461 192,790 273,120 433,778\nHealth & Safety (3) (6) 14,058 28,115 28,115 28,115 28,115\nPermit & License Violations (4) (6) 14,058 28,115 28,115 28,115 28,115\n$ 9 3,717 $ 187,435 $ 281,152 $3 74,870 $ 562,305\nCFO MIP:\nAnnualized Base Pay: $304,772\nPerformance Incentive Compensation Target (at 100% of Plan): $152,386\nTotal Annual Target Compensation (at 100% of Plan): $457,158\nPerma-Fix Environmental Services, Inc.\n2023 Management Incentive Plan\nCFO MIP MATRIX\nTarget Objectives Performance Target Achieved\n75%-89% 90%-110% 111%-129% 130%-150% >150%\nRevenue (1) (6) $ 7,619 $ 15,239 $ 2 5,035 $ 33,743 $ 4 0,273\nEBITDA (2) 57,146 114,289 150,209 202,455 241,641\nHealth & Safety (3) (6) 5,714 11,429 11,429 11,429 11,429\nPermit & License Violations (4) (6) 5,714 11,429 11,429 11,429 11,429\n$ 7 6,193 $ 152,386 $1 98,102 $ 259,056 $3 04,772\n94\nEVP of Strategic Initiatives MIP:\nAnnualized Base Pay: $253,980\nPerformance Incentive Compensation Target (at 100% of Plan): $126,990\nTotal Annual Target Compensation (at 100% of Plan): $380,970\nPerma-Fix Environmental Services, Inc.\n2023 Management Incentive Plan\nEVP OF STRATEGIC INITIATIVES MIP MATRIX\nTarget Objectives Performance Target Achieved\n75%-89% 90%-110% 111%-129% 130%-150% >150%\nRevenue (1) (6) $ 6,350 $ 12,699 $ 2 0,863 $ 28,119 $ 33,562\nEBITDA (2) 47,621 95,243 125,176 168,716 201,370\nHealth & Safety (3) (6) 4,762 9,524 9,524 9,524 9,524\nPermit & License Violations (4) (6) 4,762 9,524 9,524 9,524 9,524\n$ 6 3,495 $ 126,990 $1 65,087 $ 215,883 $2 53,980\nEVP of Waste Treatment Operations MIP:\nAnnualized Base Pay: $261,233\nPerformance Incentive Compensation Target (at 100% of Plan): $130,617\nTotal Annual Target Compensation (at 100% of Plan): $391,850\nPerma-Fix Environmental Services, Inc.\n2023 Management Incentive Plan\nEVP OF WASTE TREATMENT OPERATIONS MIP MATRIX\nTarget Objectives Performance Target Achieved\n75%-89% 90%-110% 111%-129% 130%-150% >150%\nRevenue (1) (6) $ 6,531 $ 13,062 $ 18,660 $ 26,123 $ 31,721\nEBITDA (2) 39,185 78,371 111,958 156,741 190,328\nHealth & Safety (3) (6) 9,796 19,592 19,592 19,592 19,592\nPermit & License Violations (4) (6) 9,796 19,592 19,592 19,592 19,592\n$ 65,308 $ 130,617 $ 169,802 $ 222,048 $ 261,233\nEVP of Nuclear and Technical Services MIP:\nAnnualized Base Pay: $304,772\nPerformance Incentive Compensation Target (at 100% of Plan): $152,386\nTotal Annual Target Compensation (at 100% of Plan): $457,158\n95\nPerma-Fix Environmental Services, Inc.\n2023 Management Incentive Plan\nEVP OF NUCLEAR & TECHNICAL SERVICES MIP MATRIX\nTarget Objectives Performance Target Achieved\n75%-89% 90%-110% 111%-129% 130%-150% >150%\nRevenue (1) (6) $ 7,619 $ 15,239 $ 21,769 $ 30,477 $ 3 7,008\nEBITDA (2) 45,716 91,431 130,617 182,863 222,048\nHealth & Safety (3) (6) 11,429 22,858 22,858 22,858 22,858\nCost Performance Incentive (5) (6) 11,429 22,858 22,858 22,858 22,858\n$ 7 6,193 $ 152,386 $ 198,102 $ 259,056 $3 04,772\n(1) Revenue was defined as the total consolidated third-party top line revenue as publicly reported in the\nCompany’s 2023 financial statements.

For\nthe EVP of Waste Treatment Operations, the incentive target is based on actual number of WCLTA in\nthe Treatment Segments only. The Corporate Controller will submit a report on a quarterly basis\ndocumenting and confirming the number of Worker’s Compensation Lost Time Accidents, supported\nby the Worker’s Compensation Loss Report provided by the company’s carrier or broker. Such claims\nwill be identified on the loss report as “indemnity claims.” The following number of Worker’s\nCompensation Lost Time Accidents and corresponding performance target thresholds has been\nestablished for the annual Incentive Compensation Plan calculation for 2024.\nWork Comp.

Stock options succeed by delivering value to executives only when the value of our stock\nincreases. The 2017 Plan authorizes the grant of Non-Qualified Stock Options (“NQSOs”) and Incentive\nStock Options (“ISOs”) for the purchase of our Common Stock.\nThe 2017 Plan was adopted to:\n enhance the link between the creation of stockholder value and long-term executive incentive\ncompensation;\n provide an opportunity for increased equity ownership by executives; and\n maintain competitive levels of total compensation;\nStock option award levels are determined based on market data, vary among participants based on their\npositions with the Company and are granted generally at the Compensation Committee’s regularly\nscheduled July or August meeting. Newly hired or promoted executive officers who are eligible to receive\noptions are generally awarded such options at the next regularly scheduled Compensation Committee\nmeeting following their hire or promotion date.\nOptions are awarded with an exercise price equal to or not less than the closing price of the Company’s\nCommon Stock on the date of the grant as reported on the Nasdaq. In certain limited circumstances, the\nCompensation Committee may grant options to an executive at an exercise price in excess of the closing\nprice of the Company’s Common Stock on the grant date.\nThe Company’s NEOs have outstanding options from the Company’s 2017 Plan (See “Item 11 – Executive\nCompensation – Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End - Outstanding Equity Awards at December\n31, 2023,” for outstanding options under the 2017 Plan for each of our NEOs).\nIn cases of termination of an executive officer’s employment due to death, by the executive for “good\nreason,” by the Company without cause, and due to a “change of control,” all outstanding stock options to\npurchase common stock held by the executive officer will immediately become exercisable in full (see\n101\nfurther discussion of the exercisability term of these options in each of these circumstances in\n“EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION – Employment Agreements”). Otherwise, vesting of option awards\nceases upon termination of employment and exercise right of the vested option amount ceases upon three\nmonths from termination of employment except in the case of retirement (subject to a six-month limitation)\nand disability (subject to a one-year limitation).\nAccounting for Stock-Based Compensation\nWe account for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, “Compensation – Stock\nCompensation.” ASC 718 establishes accounting standards for entity exchanges of equity instruments for\ngoods or services. It also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods\nor services that are based on the fair value of the entity’s equity instruments or that may be settled by the\nissuance of those equity instruments. ASC 718 requires all stock-based payments to employees, including\ngrants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. The\nCompany uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair-value of stock-based awards\nwhich requires subjective assumptions. Assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options granted\ninclude the exercise price of the award, the expected term, the expected volatility of the Company’s stock\nover the option’s expected term, the risk-free interest rate over the option’s expected term, and the expected\nannual dividend yield. We recognize stock-based compensation expense using a straight-line amortization\nmethod over the requisite period, which is the vesting period of the stock option grant.\nRetirement and Other Benefits\n401(k) Plan\nThe Company adopted the Perma-Fix Environmental Services, Inc. 401(k) Plan (the “401(k) Plan”) in 1992,\nwhich is intended to comply with Section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code and the provisions of the\nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. All full-time employees who have attained the age of\n18 are eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan. Eligibility is immediate upon employment but enrollment is\nonly allowed during four quarterly open periods of January 1, Apri1 1, July 1, and October 1. Participating\nemployees may make annual pretax contributions to their accounts up to 100% of their compensation, up to\na maximum amount as limited by law. At our discretion, we may make matching contributions based on the\nemployee’s elective contributions. Company contributions vest over a period of five years. In 2023, the\nCompany contributed approximately $576,000 in 401(k) matching funds, of which approximately $34,000\nwas for our NEOs (see the “Summary Compensation” table in this section for 401(k) matching fund\ncontributions made for the NEOs for 2023).\nPerquisites and Other Personal Benefits\nThe Company provides executive officers with limited perquisites and other personal benefits\n(health/disability/life insurance) that the Company and the Compensation Committee believe are reasonable\nand consistent with its overall compensation program to better enable the Company to attract and retain\nsuperior employees for key positions. The Compensation Committee periodically reviews the levels of\nperquisites and other personal benefits provided to executive officers. The executive officers are provided\nan auto allowance.\nCompensation of Directors\nDirectors who are employees receive no additional compensation for serving on the Board or its\ncommittee(s). In 2023, the Company provided the following annual compensation to each non-employee\ndirector for service on the Board and the committee(s) for which he/she serves:\n a quarterly fee of $11,500;\n an additional quarterly fee of $8,750 to the Chairman of the Board;\n an additional quarterly fee of $6,250 to the Chairman of the Audit Committee;\n an additional quarterly fee of $3,125 to the Chairman of each of the Compensation Committee, the\nGovernance and Nominating Committee, and the Strategic Committee. The Chairman of the Board was\nnot eligible to receive a quarterly fee for serving as the Chairman of any the aforementioned\ncommittees;\n102\n an additional $1,250 to each Audit Committee member (excluding the Chairman of the Audit\nCommittee);\n an additional quarterly fee of $500 to each member of the Compensation Committee, the Governance\nand Nominating Committee, and the Strategic Committee. Such fee was payable only if the member did\nnot also serve as the Chairman of any other standing committees or as the Chairman of the Board; and\n a fee of $1,000 for each in-person board meeting attended and a $500 fee for meeting attendance via\nconference call;\nUnder the 2003 Outside Directors Stock Plan (“2003 Outside Directors Plan”), each director may elect to\nhave either 65% or 100% of such fees payable in Common Stock, with the balance, if any, payable in cash.\nEach non-employee director was also granted a NQSO to purchase up to 10,000 shares of Common Stock\nupon reelection at the 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, with vesting at 25% per year, beginning on the\nfirst anniversary date of the grant, with each option having a 10-year term.\nDr. Louis Centofanti, a current member of the Board, is not eligible to receive compensation for his service\nas a director of the Company as he is an employee of the Company. As the Company’s President and CEO,\nMr. Duff, who was elected by the Company’s Board as a Board member effective April 20, 2023, also is not\neligible to receive compensation for his service as a director of the Company (see “Summary\nCompensation” table in this section for each of Dr. Centofanti’s and Mark Duff’s annual salary and other\ncompensation as an employee of the Company).\nThe table below summarizes the director compensation expenses recognized by the Company for director\noptions and stock awards (resulting from fees earned) for the year ended December 31, 2023. The terms of\nthe 2003 Outside Directors Plan are further described below under “2003 Outside Directors Plan.”\nDirector Compensation\nFees Nonqualified\nEarned or Non-Equity Deferred\nPaid Stock Option Incentive Plan Compensation All Other\nName In Cash Awards Awards Compensation Earnings Compensation Total\n($) (1) ($) (2) ($) (4) ($) ($) ($) ($)\nThomas P.

The amounts set forth above represent the portion of the director’s fees paid in cash and exclude the value of\nthe director’s fee elected to be paid in Common Stock under the 2003 Outside Directors Plan, which values are included under\n“Stock Awards.”\n(2) The number of shares of Common Stock comprising stock awards granted under the 2003 Outside Directors Plan is calculated\nbased on 75% of the closing market value of the Common Stock as reported on the Nasdaq on the business day immediately\npreceding the date that the quarterly fee is due. Such shares are fully vested on the date of grant. The value of the stock award\nis based on the market value of our Common Stock at each quarter end times the number of shares issuable under the award.\nThe amount shown is the fair value of the Common Stock on the date of the award.\n(3) Reflects options granted under the Company’s 2003 Outside Directors Plan resulting from re-election to the Board on July 20,\n2023. Options are for a 10-year period with an exercise price of $9.81 per share and vest 25% per year, beginning on the first\nanniversary date of the grant. The value of the option award for each outside director is calculated based on the fair value of\nthe option per share (approximately $6.46) on grant date times the number of options granted, which was 10,000 for each\ndirector, pursuant to ASC 718, “Compensation – Stock Compensation.”.\n(4) The following table reflects the aggregate number of outstanding NQSOs held by the Company’s directors at December 31,\n2023. As an employee of the Company or its subsidiaries, neither Dr. Centofanti nor Mark Duff is eligible to participate in the\n103\n2003 Outside Directors Plan. Options reflected below for each of Dr. Centofanti and Mark Duff were granted from the 2017\nPlan as discussed previously:\nOptions Outstanding at\nName December 31, 2023\nDr. Louis Centofanti 65,000\nThomas P.

Zwecker 46,800\nTotal 487,200\n2003 Outside Directors Plan\nWe believe that it is important for our directors to have a personal interest in our success and growth and for\ntheir interests to be aligned with those of our stockholders; therefore, under our 2003 Outside Directors\nPlan, each outside director is granted a 10-year NQSO to purchase up to 20,000 shares of Common Stock on\nthe date such director is initially elected to the Board, and receives on each re-election date a NQSO to\npurchase up to another 10,000 shares of our Common Stock, with the exercise price being the fair market\nvalue of the Common Stock preceding the option grant date. Common Stock shares subject to option\ngranted vest at 25% per year, beginning on the first anniversary date of the grant and no option shall be\nexercisable after the expiration of ten years from the date the option is granted. As of December 31, 2023,\noptions to purchase 300,000 shares of Common Stock were outstanding under the 2003 Outside Directors\nPlan, of which 142,500 were vested.\nAs a member of the Board, each director may elect to receive either 65% or 100% of his or her director's fee\nin shares of our Common Stock. The number of shares received by each director is calculated based on 75%\nof the fair market value of the Common Stock determined on the business day immediately preceding the\ndate that the quarterly fee is due. The balance of each director’s fee, if any, is payable in cash. In 2023, fees\nearned by our outside directors totaled approximately $572,000.\nIn the event of a “change of control” (as defined in the 2003 Outside Directors Plan) or by reason of the\ndirector’s death or Disability (as defined), each outstanding stock option and stock award shall immediately\nbecome exercisable in full notwithstanding the vesting or exercise provisions contained in the stock option\nagreement.\nITEM 12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND\nMANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS\nSecurity Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners\nSchelhammer Capital Bank AG, a banking institution regulated by the banking regulations of Austria, has\nrepresented to the Company that as of February 1, 2024, it holds of record as a nominee for, and as an agent\nof, certain accredited investors, 1,837,572 shares of our Common Stock. None of the Common Stock held\nby Schelhammer Capital Bank AG for the account of any single investor represents more than 4.9% of our\nCommon Stock and, to the best knowledge of Schelhammer Capital Bank AG, as far as stocks held by such\ninvestors in accounts with Schelhammer Capital Bank AG, none of such investors act together as a group or\notherwise act in concert for the purpose of voting on matters subject to the vote of our stockholders or for\npurpose of disposition or investment of such stock. Additionally, the investors for whom Schelhammer\nCapital Bank AG acts as nominee with respect to such shares maintain full voting and dispositive power\nover the Common Stock beneficially owned by such investors, and Schelhammer Capital Bank AG has\nneither voting nor investment power over such shares. Accordingly, Schelhammer Capital Bank AG\nbelieves that (i) it is not the beneficial owner, as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act, of\nthe shares of Common Stock registered in Schelhammer Capital Bank AG’s name because (a) Schelhammer\nCapital Bank AG holds the Common Stock as a nominee only, (b) Schelhammer Capital Bank AG has\n104\nneither voting nor investment power over such shares, and (c) Schelhammer Capital Bank AG has not\nnominated or sought to nominate, and does not intend to nominate in the future, any person to serve as a\nmember of our Board; and (ii) it is not required to file reports under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act or to\nfile either Schedule 13D or Schedule 13G in connection with the shares of our Common Stock registered in\nthe name of Schelhammer Capital Bank AG.\nNotwithstanding the previous paragraph, if Schelhammer Capital Bank AG's representations to us described\nabove are incorrect or if the investors for whom Schelhammer Capital Bank AG acts as nominee are acting\nas a group, then Schelhammer Capital Bank AG or a group of such investors could be a beneficial owner of\nmore than 5% of our voting securities. If Schelhammer Capital Bank AG was deemed the beneficial owner\nof such shares, the following table sets forth information as to the shares of voting securities that\nSchelhammer Capital Bank AG may be considered to beneficially own on February 1, 2024:\nAmount and Percent\nName of Title Nature of Of\nRecord Owner Of Class Ownership Class (*)\nSchelhammer Capital Bank AG Common 1,837,572(+) 13.44%\n(*) This calculation is based upon 13,671,022 shares of Common Stock outstanding on February 12, 2024,\nplus the number of shares of Common Stock which Schelhammer Capital Bank AG, as agent for certain\naccredited investors, has the right to acquire within 60 days, which is none.\n(+) This amount is the number of shares that Schelhammer Capital Bank AG has represented to us that it\nholds of record as nominee for, and as an agent of, certain accredited investors. As of February 1, 2024, the\ndate of Schelhammer Capital Bank AG’s representations to us, Schelhammer Capital Bank AG has no\nwarrants or options to acquire, as agent for certain investors, additional shares of our Common Stock.\nAlthough Schelhammer Capital Bank AG is the record holder of the shares of Common Stock described in\nthis note, Schelhammer Capital Bank AG has advised us that it does not believe it is a beneficial owner of\nthe Common Stock or that it is required to file reports under Section 16(a) or Section 13(d) of the Exchange\nAct. Schelhammer Capital Bank AG has advised us that it (a) holds the Common Stock as a nominee only\nand that it does not exercise voting or investment power over the Common Stock held in its name and that\nno one investor for which it holds our Common Stock holds more than 4.9% of our issued and outstanding\nCommon Stock and (b) has not nominated, and has not sought to nominate, and does not intend to nominate\nin the future, any person to serve as a member of our Board.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR\nINDEPENDENCE\nWe describe below transactions to which we were a party during our last two fiscal years or to which we\ncurrently propose to be a party in the future, and in which:\n the amounts involved exceeded or will exceed the lesser of $120,000 or one percent of the average\nof our total assets at year-end for the last two completed fiscal years; and\n any of our directors, executive officers or beneficial owners of more than 5% of any class of our\nvoting securities, or any member of the immediate family of the foregoing persons, had or will have\na direct or indirect material interest.\nAudit Committee Review\nOur Audit Committee Charter provides for the review by the Audit Committee of any related party\ntransactions, other than transactions involving an employment relationship with the Company, which are\nreviewed by the Compensation Committee. Although we do not have written policies for the review of\nrelated party transactions, the Audit Committee reviews transactions between the Company and its directors,\nexecutive officers, holders of more than 5% of any class of the Company’s voting securities, and their\nrespective immediate family members. In reviewing a proposed transaction, the Audit Committee takes into\naccount, among other factors it deems appropriate:\n(1) the extent of the related person’s interest in the transaction;\n(2) whether the transaction is on terms generally available to an unaffiliated third-party under the\nsame or similar circumstances;\n107\n(3) the cost and benefit to the Company;\n(4) the impact or potential impact on a director’s independence in the event the related party is a\ndirector, an immediate family member of a director or an entity in which a director is a partner,\nstockholder or executive officer;\n(5) the availability of other sources for comparable products or services;\n(6) the terms of the transaction; and\n(7) the risks to the Company.\nIn addition, as applicable, the Audit Committee considers Section 144 of the Delaware General Corporation\nLaw (“DGCL”) and the Company’s Code of Ethics.\nThe provisions of Section 144 of the DGCL apply to transactions between the Company and any of its\nofficers or directors, or any organization in which any such individual has a financial interest or serves as a\ndirector or officer (individually, a “Section 144 Related Party,” and, collectively, “Section 144 Related\nParties”). Section 144 provides that a transaction between a corporation and any Section 144 Related Party\nwill not be void or voidable solely because such transaction involves the corporation and the Section 144\nRelated Party, or solely because the Section 144 Related Party is present at or participates or votes in the\nmeeting of the board or committee which authorizes the transaction, if the transaction (a) is approved in\ngood faith after full disclosure of the material facts of the transaction by a majority vote of (i) the\ndisinterested directors, or (ii) the stockholders, and (b) is fair as to the corporation as of the time it is\nauthorized, approved, or ratified by the board, a committee or the stockholders.\nOur Code of Ethics, which applies to our Board and all our employees, including the executive officers\nidentified under the heading “Named Executive Officers” and our senior financial officers, provides that\nsuch individuals must exhibit and promote honest and ethical conduct in connection with the performance of\nhis or her duties for and on behalf of the Company, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent\nconflicts of interest involving such individual and the Company, by, among other considerations:\n not entering into a transaction that would result in a conflict of interest with what is in the best\ninterest of the Company and that is reasonably likely to result in material personal gain to any such\nindividuals or their affiliates;\n not having a personal financial interest in any of the Company’s suppliers, customers or competitors\nthat could cause divided loyalty as a result of having the ability to influence the Company’s\ndecisions with that particular supplier or customer or actions to be taken by the Company that could\nmaterially benefit a competitor.\nRelated party transactions are reviewed by the Audit Committee prior to the consummation of the\ntransaction. With respect to a related party transaction arising between Audit Committee meetings, the CFO\nmay present it to the Audit Committee Chairperson, who will review and may approve the related party\ntransaction subject to ratification by the Audit Committee at the next scheduled meeting. Our Audit\nCommittee shall approve only those transactions that, in light of known circumstances, are not inconsistent\nwith the Company’s best interests.\nRelated Party Transactions\nDavid Centofanti\nDavid Centofanti serves as our Vice President of Information Systems. For such position, he received\nannual compensation of $191,000 and $187,000 for 2023 and 2022, respectively. David Centofanti is the\nson of Dr. Louis F. Centofanti, our EVP of Strategic Initiatives and a Board member.\nBoard Independence\nOur Common Stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Rule 5605 of the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules\nrequires a majority of a listed company's board of directors to be comprised of independent directors. In\naddition, the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules require that, subject to specified exceptions, each member of a\nlisted company's audit, compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees be independent\nunder applicable provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).\n108\nAudit committee members must also satisfy independence criteria set forth in Rule 10A-3 under the\nExchange Act, and compensation committee members must also satisfy the independence criteria set forth\nin Rule 10C-1 under the Exchange Act. Under Nasdaq Rule 5605(a)(2), a director will only qualify as an\n\"independent director\" if, in the opinion of our Board, that person does not have a relationship that would\ninterfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. In order\nto be considered independent for purposes of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act, a member of an audit\ncommittee of a listed company may not, other than in his or her capacity as a member of the audit\ncommittee, the board of directors, or any other board committee, accept, directly or indirectly, any\nconsulting, advisory, or other compensatory fee from the listed company or any of its subsidiaries or\notherwise be an affiliated person of the listed company or any of its subsidiaries. In order to be considered\nindependent for purposes of Rule 10C-1, the board must consider, for each member of a compensation\ncommittee of a listed company, all factors specifically relevant to determining whether a director has a\nrelationship to such company which is material to that director's ability to be independent from management\nin connection with the duties of a compensation committee member, including, but not limited to: the source\nof compensation of the director, including any consulting advisory or other compensatory fee paid by such\ncompany to the director; and whether the director is affiliated with the company or any of its subsidiaries or\naffiliates.\nOur Board annually reviews the composition of our Board of Directors and its committees and the\nindependence of each director. Based upon information requested from and provided by each director\nconcerning his/her background, employment and affiliations, including family relationships, our Board of\nDirectors has determined that Ms. Kerry C. Duggan and each of Messrs. Thomas P. Bostick, Joseph T.\nGrumski, Joe R. Reeder, Larry M. Shelton, Zach P. Wamp and Mark A. Zwecker is an \"independent\ndirector\" as defined under the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules. Our Board of Directors has also determined that\neach member of our Audit Committee, consisting of Mark A. Zwecker (Chairperson), Joseph T. Grumski,\nand Larry M. Shelton, and each member of our Compensation and Stock Option Committee, consisting of\nJoseph T. Grumski (Chairperson), Zach P. Wamp, and Mark A. Zwecker, satisfy the independence\nstandards for such committees established by the Commission and the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules, as\napplicable. In making such determination, our Board of Directors considered the relationships that each\nsuch non-employee director has with our Company and all other facts and circumstances our Board of\nDirectors deemed relevant in determining independence, including the beneficial ownership of our capital\nstock by each non-employee director.\nOur Board of Directors has determined that neither Dr. Louis Centofanti nor Mark J. Duff is deemed to be\nan “independent director” because of their employment as a senior executive of the Company.\nITEM 14. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES\nThe following table reflects the aggregate fees for the audit and other services provided by Grant Thornton\nLLP, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, for fiscal years 2023 and 2022:\nFee Type 2023 2022\n(1)\nAudit Fees $ 699,000 $ 743,000\n(2)\nTax Fees 100,000 113,000\nTotal $ 799,000 $ 856,000\n(1) Audit fees consist of audit work performed in connection with the annual financial statements, the reviews of unaudited quarterly\nfinancial statements, and work generally only the independent registered accounting firm can reasonably provide, such as consents\nand review of regulatory documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission\n(2) Fees for income tax planning, filing, and consulting.\nEngagement of the Independent Auditor\nTo ensure that our independent registered public accounting firm is engaged only to provide audit and non-\n109\naudit services that are compatible with maintaining its independence, the Audit Committee has a policy that\nrequires the Committee to review and approve in advance all services to be provided by the Company’s\nindependent accounting firm before the firm is engaged to provide those services. The Audit Committee\nconsiders non-audit services and fees when assessing auditor independence, and determined that tax return\npreparation and other tax compliance services is compatible with maintaining our accounting firm's\nindependence. All services under the headings Audit Fees and Tax Fees were approved by the Audit\nCommittee pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X of the Exchange Act. The\nAudit Committee's pre-approval policy provides as follows:\n The Audit Committee will review and pre-approve on an annual basis all audits, audit-related,\ntax and other services, along with acceptable cost levels, to be performed by the independent\naccounting firm and any member of the independent accounting firm’s alliance network of\nfirms, and may revise the pre-approved services during the period based on later determinations.\nPre-approved services typically include: audits, quarterly reviews, regulatory filing\nrequirements, consultation on new accounting and disclosure standards, employee benefit plan\naudits, reviews and reporting on management's internal controls and specified tax matters.\n Any proposed service that is not pre-approved on the annual basis requires a specific pre-\napproval by the Audit Committee, including cost level approval.\n The Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to one or more of the Audit\nCommittee members. The delegated member must report to the Audit Committee, at the next\nAudit Committee meeting, any pre-approval decisions made.\nPART IV\nITEM 15.

We will furnish any exhibit to a shareholder upon\nreceipt of a written request and payment of a specified reasonable fee, which fee shall be limited to the registrant’s reasonable expenses in furnishing such exhibit.\nEach request must set forth a good-faith representation that, as of the record date for the solicitation of proxies, the person making the request was a beneficial\nowner of securities of the Company entitled to vote.\nThe Company defines EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA before research and\ndevelopment costs related to the Medical Isotope project, gain on extinguishment of debt, income from Employee Retention Credit (ERC) refund claim (net of costs\nincurred), and loss on deconsolidation of subsidiary (where applicable). Both EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not measures of performance calculated in\naccordance with accounting standards generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), and should not be considered in isolation of, or as a\nsubstitute for, earnings as an indicator of operating performance or cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. The Company believes the\npresentation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA is relevant and useful by enhancing the readers’ ability to understand the Company’s operating performance. The\nCompany’s management utilizes EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA as a means to measure performance. The Company’s meas urements of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA\nmay not be comparable to similar titled measures reported by other companies. The table below reconciles EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, both non-GAAP\nmeasures, to GAAP numbers for income (loss) from continuing operations for the periods noted.\nFiscal Year Fiscal Year Fiscal Year\n(In thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations $ 918 $ (3,211) $ 1092\nAdjustments:\nDepreciation and amortization 2,568 2,109 1,687\nInterest income (606) (99) (26)\nInterest expense 323 175 247\nInterest expense—financing fees 93 61 41\nIncome tax expense (benefit) 17 (378) (3,890)\nEBITDA 3,313 (1,343) (849)\nResearch and development costs related to medical isotope project — --- 414\nGain on extinguishment of debt — --- (5,381)\nIncome from ERC refund claim, net (1) ---- (1,908) —\nLoss on deconsolidation of subsidiary — --- 1,062\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 3,313 $ (3,251) $(4,754)\n(1) Net of costs incurred in connection with the ERC program in the amount of approximately $67.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements contained in the Shareholders’ letter, which have been added to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, may be deemed additional forward-looking\nstatements.
