This surpasses last year’s totals and is the most the organization has ever collected during the annual event. In total, HCA Healthcare has now collected more than 88,600 pounds of medication since launching “Crush the Crisis” as an enterprise initiative in 2019. \n\n“I am amazed by the results of this year’s Crush the Crisis,” said Dr. Randy Fagin, chief medical officer of HCA Healthcare’s National Group. “Our colleagues showed up for their communities to help remove unneeded medication before it could fall into the wrong hands. This record-breaking year is a testament to how HCA Healthcare cares for the communities we serve.” \n\nHCA Healthcare facilities across the country partnered with local law enforcement to help communities safely and anonymously dispose of unused or expired medication. An estimated 14.5 million doses of medication were collected at more than 125 collection sites. HCA Healthcare’s “Crush the Crisis” events were held in alignment with the Drug Enforcement Administration’s (DEA) National Prescription Drug Take Back Day, which collected [ 629,953 pounds of medication. ](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dea.gov%2Ftakebackday%23results&esheet=54155591&newsitemid=20241120575181&lan=en-US&anchor=629%2C953+pounds+of+medication.&index=2&md5=695130e299e5d6bfdb81e5fcabe62d8b)\n\nThe HCA Healthcare facilities that helped collect the greatest amount of medication during the event this year include: \n\n  * CJW Medical Center in Richmond, Virginia collected 992 pounds \n  * HCA HealthONE Aurora in Aurora, Colorado collected 861 pounds \n  * HCA HealthONE Sky Ridge in Lone Tree, Colorado collected 842 pounds \n  * Medical City McKinney in McKinney, Texas collected 694 pounds \n  * HCA HealthONE Mountain Ridge in Thornton, Colorado collected 534 pounds \n\n\n\nHCA Healthcare uses data from approximately 43 million annual patient encounters to help continuously improve care. The organization uses the science of “big data” to help reduce prescription drug misuse and transform pain management, with initiatives in surgical, emergency and other care settings, including: \n\n  * **Enhanced Surgical Recovery (ESR):** a multi-modal approach to pain management using pre, intra and post-operative interventions to optimize outcomes. HCA Healthcare’s ESR programs have demonstrated significant improvements in surgical recovery and patient satisfaction, including decreases in opioid usage. \n  * **Electronic Prescribing of Controlled Substances (EPCS):** aims to stem increasing rates of opioid-related addiction, misuse diversion and death by making it more difficult for medication-seekers to doctor-shop and alter prescriptions. Physicians have access to aggregated electronic health records, providing data to help them prescribe opioids judiciously. \n\n\n\n**About HCA Healthcare**\n\nNashville-based HCA Healthcare is one of the nation’s leading providers of healthcare services comprising 187 hospitals and approximately 2,400 ambulatory sites of care, including surgery centers, freestanding ERs, urgent care centers, and physician clinics, in 20 states and the United Kingdom. With its founding in 1968, HCA Healthcare created a new model for hospital care in the United States, using combined resources to strengthen hospitals, deliver patient-focused care and improve the practice of medicine. HCA Healthcare has conducted a number of clinical studies, including one that demonstrated that full-term delivery is healthier than early elective delivery of babies and another that identified a clinical protocol that can reduce bloodstream infections in ICU patients by 44%.

Their analysis is based on a voluntary survey that assesses companies on their policies, practices and benefits for veterans and their families. Recruitment and employment practices, as well as retention and support programs, are given the most weight in scoring. \n\nAs part of its commitment to supporting veterans, this year HCA Healthcare is giving: \n\n  * $50,000 to the Armed Services YMCA to expand the capabilities of the “Children’s Waiting Room” at Blanchfield Army Community Hospital. \n  * $35,000 to CreatiVets, an organization dedicated to empowering veterans and their families to find healing from service-related trauma through art, including songwriting, visual arts, music and creative writing. This gift will help finalize the build of the prescriptive music repository for veterans and their families to find healing through music. \n  * $35,000 to The Honor Foundation, a career transition program for U.S. Special Operations Forces, to help enhance their industry “trek” experiences to various companies for program fellows in eight states and four virtual cohorts. \n  * $30,000 to Operation Stand Down, an organization that engages veterans early in their transition from military service to find meaningful employment, to help expand their “Career Recon” employment program for transitioning service members. \n\n\n\nHCA Healthcare has a long history of supporting veterans and their families through their transition to the civilian workforce. In 2011, HCA Healthcare joined the Veteran Jobs Mission as an inaugural employer member, and committed to the coalition’s goal of hiring 100,000 veterans by 2020. In 2012, HCA Healthcare joined the second cohort of the Department of Defense’s Military Spouse Employment Partnership in order to formalize its commitment to hiring military spouses. In 2013, HCA Healthcare joined the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s Hiring Our Heroes national advisory councils on veteran and military spouse employment, and, in 2015, HCA Healthcare received the Lee Anderson Award for overall excellence in hiring and retaining veterans, and transitioning service members and military spouses. In 2018, HCA Healthcare was an inaugural employer partner of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s “Hiring 100,000 Military Spouses” campaign and has since hired more than 8,500 military spouses. In 2019, HCA Healthcare and the U.S. Army Medical Recruitment Brigade created the Patriot Partnership Program providing specialized education and training for physician residency and fellowship programs nationwide. In 2021, HCA Healthcare received the Secretary of Defense Employer Support Freedom Award, the highest recognition given by Employer Support of the National Guard and Reserves (ESGR). \n\nHCA Healthcare also maintains a Veterans Colleague Network, which helps promote community and purpose and has also been successful in helping recently transitioned veterans navigate the civilian workforce. For those who wish to continue serving, HCA Healthcare also offers military leave and supplemental pay to eligible colleagues to serve as active duty military while working at HCA Healthcare. The organization also provides pathways for non-traditional military talent to find meaningful employment opportunities in healthcare through partnerships with Hiring Our Heroes, 50-Strong and local veteran service organizations across the country. \n\n**About HCA Healthcare**\n\nNashville-based HCA Healthcare is one of the nation’s leading providers of healthcare services comprising 187 hospitals and approximately 2,400 ambulatory sites of care, including surgery centers, freestanding ERs, urgent care centers, and physician clinics, in 20 states and the United Kingdom.

These non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted to exclude losses (gains)\non sales of facilities and losses on retirement of debt. We believe net income attributable to HCA Healthcare,\nInc., as adjusted, diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, and Adjusted EBITDA are important measures that\nsupplement discussions and analysis of our results of operations. We believe it is useful to investors to provide\ndisclosures of our results of operations on the same basis used by management.

Adjusted\nEBITDA and the Adjusted EBITDA margin (Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenues) are utilized by management\nand investors to compare our current operating results with the corresponding periods during the previous year\nand to compare our operating results with other companies in the health care industry. It is reasonable to\nexpect that adjustments, including losses (gains) on sales of facilities and losses on retirement of debt will\noccur in future periods, but the amounts recognized can vary significantly from period to period, do not directly\nrelate to the ongoing operations of our health care facilities and complicate period comparisons of our results of\noperations and operations comparisons with other health care companies.\nNet income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc., as adjusted, diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, and\nAdjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as\nalternatives to net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. as a measure of operating performance or cash\nflows from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity. Because net income\nattributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc., as adjusted, diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, and Adjusted\nEBITDA are not measurements determined in accordance with GAAP and are susceptible to varying\ncalculations, net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc., as adjusted, diluted earnings per share, as\nadjusted, and Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures\npresented by other companies.\n11\nHCA Healthcare, Inc.\nSupplemental Non-GAAP Disclosures\n2024 Operating Results Forecast\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nFor the Year Ending\nDecember 31, 2024\nLow High\nRevenues $ 69,750 $ 71,750\nNet income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc.

Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by generally\naccepted accounting principles for complete consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, all\nadjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included and are of a normal and recurring nature.\nThe majority of our expenses are “costs of revenues” items. Costs that could be classified as general and\nadministrative would include our corporate office costs, which were $111 million and $89 million for the quarters ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $301 million and $253 million for the nine months ended September\n30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Operating results for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not\nnecessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024. For further\ninformation, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in our annual report on Form\n10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n(cid:0)5 (cid:0)H (cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)X (cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)\nOur revenues generally relate to contracts with patients in which our performance obligations are to provide\nhealth care services to the patients. Revenues are recorded during the period our obligations to provide health care\nservices are satisfied. Our performance obligations for inpatient services are generally satisfied over periods that\naverage approximately five days, and revenues are recognized based on charges incurred in relation to total expected\ncharges. Our performance obligations for outpatient services are generally satisfied over a period of less than one day.\nThe contractual relationships with patients, in most cases, also involve a third-party payer (Medicare, Medicaid,\nmanaged care health plans and commercial insurance companies, including plans offered through the health insurance\nexchanges), and the transaction prices for the services provided are dependent upon the terms provided by (Medicare\nand Medicaid) or negotiated with (managed care health plans and commercial insurance companies) the third-party\npayers. The payment arrangements with third-party payers for the services we provide to the related patients typically\nspecify payments at amounts less than our standard charges. Medicare generally pays for inpatient and outpatient\nservices at prospectively determined rates based on clinical, diagnostic and other factors. Services provided to patients\nhaving Medicaid coverage are generally paid at prospectively determined rates per discharge, per identified service or\nper covered member. Agreements with commercial insurance carriers, managed care and preferred provider\norganizations generally provide for payments based upon predetermined rates per diagnosis, per diem rates or\ndiscounted fee-for-service rates. Management continually reviews the contractual estimation process to consider and\nincorporate updates to laws and regulations and the frequent changes in managed care contractual terms resulting from\ncontract renegotiations and renewals.\n8\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nNOTE 1 — BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\n(cid:0)5 (cid:0)H (cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)X (cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:11)(cid:0)F (cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)X (cid:0)H (cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:12)\nOur revenues are based upon the estimated amounts we expect to be entitled to receive from patients and third-\nparty payers. Estimates of contractual adjustments under managed care and commercial insurance plans are based upon\nthe payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements. Revenues related to uninsured patients and uninsured\ncopayment and deductible amounts for patients who have health care coverage may have discounts applied (uninsured\nand other discounts). We also record estimated implicit price concessions (based primarily on historical collection\nexperience) related to uninsured accounts to record these revenues at the estimated amounts we expect to collect.\nPatients treated at our hospitals for non-elective care, who have income at or below 400% of the federal poverty level,\nare eligible for charity care. Because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care, they\nare not reported in revenues. Our revenues by primary third-party payer classification and other (including uninsured\npatients) for the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are summarized in the following table\n(dollars in millions):\nQuarter\n2024 Ratio 2023 Ratio\nMedicare $ 2,584 14.8% $ 2,560 15.8%\nManaged Medicare 2,949 16.9 2,535 15.6\nMedicaid 1,208 6.9 1,001 6.2\nManaged Medicaid 1,031 5.9 1,039 6.4\nManaged care and insurers 8,497 48.6 7,687 47.4\nInternational (managed care and insurers) 424 2.4 375 2.3\nOther 794 4.5 1,016 6.3\nRevenues $ 17,487 100.0% $ 16,213 100.0%\nNine Months\n2024 Ratio 2023 Ratio\nMedicare $ 8,043 15.4% $ 7,865 16.5%\nManaged Medicare 8,888 17.0 7,635 16.0\nMedicaid 3,316 6.3 2,478 5.2\nManaged Medicaid 3,042 5.8 2,846 6.0\nManaged care and insurers 25,591 49.0 23,140 48.5\nInternational (managed care and insurers) 1,252 2.4 1,127 2.4\nOther 2,186 4.1 2,574 5.4\nRevenues $ 52,318 100.0% $ 47,665 100.0%\nTo quantify the total impact of the trends related to uninsured patient accounts, we believe it is beneficial to view\ntotal uncompensated care, which is comprised of charity care, uninsured discounts and implicit price concessions.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we paid $83 million to acquire a hospital facility in\nTexas and $198 million to acquire nonhospital health care entities. Purchase price amounts have been allocated to the\nrelated assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received proceeds of $295 million for the sale of a\nhospital facility in California and $17 million related to sales of real estate and other health care entity investments. We\nrecognized pretax gains of $209 million for these transactions. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we\nreceived proceeds of $162 million for the sale of two hospital facilities in Louisiana and $21 million related to sales of\nreal estate and other health care entity investments. We recognized pretax losses of $12 million for these transactions.\nNOTE 3 — INCOME TAXES\nOur provisions for income taxes for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were $424 million and $355\nmillion, respectively, and the effective tax rates were 25.0% and 24.8%, respectively. Our provisions for income taxes\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were $1.419 billion and $1.131 billion, respectively, and the\neffective tax rates were 24.7% and 23.7%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 is related primarily to adjustments to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits. Our provisions for\nincome taxes included tax benefits related to settlements of employee equity awards of $93 million and $89 million for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nOur gross unrecognized tax benefits were $720 million, excluding accrued interest and penalties of $261 million,\nas of September 30, 2024 ($639 million and $177 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2023). Unrecognized tax\nbenefits of $465 million ($320 million as of December 31, 2023) would affect the effective tax rate, if recognized.\nAt September 30, 2024, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) was conducting examinations of the Company’s\n2016, 2017 and 2018 federal income tax returns and the 2019 returns of certain affiliates. We are also subject to\nexamination by the IRS for tax years after 2019 as well as by state and foreign taxing authorities. Depending on the\nresolution of any federal, state and foreign tax disputes, the completion of examinations by federal, state or foreign\ntaxing authorities, or the expiration of statutes of limitation for specific taxing jurisdictions, we believe it is reasonably\npossible that our liability for unrecognized tax benefits may significantly increase or decrease within the next 12\nmonths. However, we are currently unable to estimate the range of any possible change.\nNOTE 4 — EARNINGS PER SHARE\nWe compute basic earnings per share using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.

Level 2 inputs\nare inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or\nindirectly. Level 2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs\nobservable for the asset or liability (other than quoted prices), such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and yield\ncurves observable at commonly quoted intervals.

We are also subject to\nclaims and suits arising in the ordinary course of business, including claims for personal injuries or wrongful restriction\nof, or interference with, physicians’ staff privileges. In certain of these actions the claimants may seek punitive damages\nagainst us which may not be covered by insurance. We are also subject to claims by various taxing authorities for\nadditional taxes and related interest and penalties. The resolution of any such lawsuits, claims or legal and regulatory\nproceedings could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\nHealth care companies are routinely subject to investigations by various governmental agencies.

We use adjusted segment EBITDA as an analytical indicator for purposes of allocating resources to geographic\nareas and assessing their performance. Adjusted segment EBITDA is commonly used as an analytical indicator within\nthe health care industry and also serves as a measure of leverage capacity and debt service ability. Adjusted segment\nEBITDA should not be considered as a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting\nprinciples, and the items excluded from adjusted segment EBITDA are significant components in understanding and\nassessing financial performance. Because adjusted segment EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance\nwith generally accepted accounting principles and is thus susceptible to varying calculations, adjusted segment\nEBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nThird Quarter 2024 Operations Summary\nRevenues increased to $17.487 billion in the third quarter of 2024 from $16.213 billion in the third quarter of\n2023. Net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. totaled $1.270 billion, or $4.88 per diluted share, for the quarter\nended September 30, 2024, compared to $1.079 billion, or $3.91 per diluted share, for the quarter ended September 30,\n2023. Third quarter results for 2024 include losses on sales of facilities of $4 million, or $0.02 per diluted share. All\n“per diluted share” disclosures are based upon amounts net of the applicable income taxes. Shares used for diluted\nearnings per share were 259.917 million shares for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and 275.424 million shares for\nthe quarter ended September 30, 2023. During 2023 and the first nine months of 2024, we repurchased 14.465 million\nshares and 13.059 million shares, respectively, of our common stock.\nThird quarter results for 2024 also included additional expenses and loss of revenues estimated at approximately\n$50 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, associated with the impact of Hurricane Helene on our Florida, Georgia and\nNorth Carolina facilities. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2024, we anticipate ongoing additional expenses and\nloss of revenues of approximately $200 million to $300 million, or $0.60 to $0.90 per diluted share, due to Hurricane\nHelene’s impact to our North Carolina facilities, as well as from Hurricane Milton, which impacted certain facilities in\nFlorida during October. The impact to the third quarter of 2024 and estimates for the fourth quarter of 2024 do not\ninclude any insurance recoveries we may receive.\nRevenues increased 7.9% on a consolidated basis and 7.1% on a same facility basis for the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase in consolidated revenues can be\nprimarily attributed to the combined impact of a 2.8% increase in revenue per equivalent admission and a 5.0% increase\nin equivalent admissions. The same facility revenues increase primarily resulted from the combined impact of a 2.5%\nincrease in same facility revenue per equivalent admission and a 4.5% increase in same facility equivalent admissions.\nWe recorded revenues of $397 million during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023 related to the\nFlorida Medicaid hospital directed payment program for the year ended September 30, 2023.\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2024, consolidated admissions and same facility admissions both\nincreased 4.5% compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Surgeries declined 0.8% on both a consolidated\nbasis and on a same facility basis during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. Emergency department visits increased 4.4% on a consolidated basis and 4.6% on a same facility\nbasis during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Consolidated\nand same facility uninsured admissions declined 1.6% and 1.8%, respectively, for the quarter ended September 30,\n2024, compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\nCash flows from operating activities increased $1.036 billion, from $2.479 billion for the third quarter of 2023 to\n$3.515 billion for the third quarter of 2024. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily related\nto positive changes in working capital items of $859 million, mainly from a decline in accounts receivable, and an\nincrease in net income of $285 million, excluding the non-cash impact of gains and losses on sales of facilities and\ndepreciation and amortization, partially offset by an increase of $190 million in income tax payments.\nResults of Operations\n(cid:0)5 (cid:0)H (cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)X (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:18)(cid:0)9 (cid:0)R (cid:0)O(cid:0)X (cid:0)P (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)7 (cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)G (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)\nOur revenues generally relate to contracts with patients in which our performance obligations are to provide\nhealth care services to the patients. Revenues are recorded during the period our obligations to provide health care\nservices are satisfied. Our performance obligations for inpatient services are generally satisfied over periods that\naverage approximately five days, and revenues are recognized based on charges incurred in relation to total expected\ncharges. Our performance obligations for outpatient services are generally satisfied over a period of less than one day.\nThe contractual relationships with patients, in most cases, also involve a third-party payer (Medicare, Medicaid,\nmanaged care health plans and commercial insurance companies, including plans offered through the health insurance\nexchanges), and the transaction prices for the services provided are dependent upon the terms provided by (Medicare\nand Medicaid) or negotiated with (managed care health plans and commercial insurance companies) the third-party\npayers. The payment arrangements with third-party payers for the services we provide to the related patients typically\nspecify payments at amounts less than our standard charges. Medicare generally pays for inpatient and outpatient\nservices at prospectively determined rates based on clinical, diagnostic and other factors. Services provided to patients\nhaving Medicaid coverage are generally paid at prospectively determined rates per discharge, per identified service or\n17\nITEM 2.

Management continually reviews the contractual estimation process to consider and\nincorporate updates to laws and regulations and the frequent changes in managed care contractual terms resulting from\ncontract renegotiations and renewals.\nRevenues increased 7.9% from $16.213 billion in the third quarter of 2023 to $17.487 billion in the third quarter\nof 2024. Our revenues are based upon the estimated amounts we expect to be entitled to receive from patients and\nthird-party payers. Estimates of contractual adjustments under managed care and commercial insurance plans are based\nupon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements. Revenues related to uninsured patients and\nuninsured copayment and deductible amounts for patients who have health care coverage may have discounts applied\n(uninsured and other discounts). We also record estimated implicit price concessions (based primarily on historical\ncollection experience) related to uninsured accounts to record self-pay revenues at the estimated amounts we expect to\ncollect. Patients treated at our hospitals for non-elective care, who have income at or below 400% of the federal poverty\nlevel, are eligible for charity care. Because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity\ncare, they are not reported in revenues. Our revenues by primary third-party payer classification and other (including\nuninsured patients) for the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are summarized in the\nfollowing table (dollars in millions):\nQuarter\n2024 Ratio 2023 Ratio\nMedicare $ 2,584 14.8% $ 2,560 15.8%\nManaged Medicare 2,949 16.9 2,535 15.6\nMedicaid 1,208 6.9 1,001 6.2\nManaged Medicaid 1,031 5.9 1,039 6.4\nManaged care and insurers 8,497 48.6 7,687 47.4\nInternational (managed care and insurers) 424 2.4 375 2.3\nOther 794 4.5 1,016 6.3\nRevenues $ 17,487 100.0% $ 16,213 100.0%\nNine Months\n2024 Ratio 2023 Ratio\nMedicare $ 8,043 15.4% $ 7,865 16.5%\nManaged Medicare 8,888 17.0 7,635 16.0\nMedicaid 3,316 6.3 2,478 5.2\nManaged Medicaid 3,042 5.8 2,846 6.0\nManaged care and insurers 25,591 49.0 23,140 48.5\nInternational (managed care and insurers) 1,252 2.4 1,127 2.4\nOther 2,186 4.1 2,574 5.4\nRevenues $ 52,318 100.0% $ 47,665 100.0%\nConsolidated and same facility revenue per equivalent admission increased 2.8% and 2.5%, respectively, in the\nthird quarter of 2024, compared to the third quarter of 2023.

Some state Medicaid programs\nuse, or have applied to use, waivers granted by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) to implement\nMedicaid expansion, impose different eligibility or enrollment restrictions, or otherwise implement programs that vary\nfrom federal standards. We receive supplemental payments in several states. These supplemental payment programs are\nregularly reviewed by certain government agencies, and some states have made requests to CMS to modify their\nexisting supplemental payment programs. In May 2024, CMS issued a final rule related to Medicaid managed care\nprograms that addresses access, financing and quality within these programs. This final rule addresses aspects of state\ndirected program arrangements with new and updated requirements to ensure a more consistent and transparent\napproach for participating states. The various elements of the rule take effect between issuance and early 2028. It is\npossible that these developments, reviews and requests will result in the restructuring of or other significant changes to\nsupplemental payment programs.

The increase in consolidated revenues can be\nprimarily attributed to the combined impact of a 2.8% increase in revenue per equivalent admission and a 5.0% increase\nin equivalent admissions. The same facility revenues increase primarily resulted from the combined impact of a 2.5%\nincrease in same facility revenue per equivalent admission and a 4.5% increase in same facility equivalent admissions.\nSalaries and benefits, as a percentage of revenues, were 45.0% in the third quarter of 2024 and 46.6% in the third\nquarter of 2023.

Supply costs per equivalent admission increased 4.8% in the third quarter of 2024, compared to the third quarter\nof 2023. Supply costs per equivalent admission increased 6.8% for medical devices, 1.6% for pharmacy supplies and\n4.4% for general medical and surgical items in the third quarter of 2024, compared to the third quarter of 2023.\nOther operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, were 21.2% in the third quarter of 2024 and 20.8% in the\nthird quarter of 2023. Other operating expenses is primarily comprised of contract services, professional fees, repairs\nand maintenance, rents and leases, utilities, insurance (including professional liability insurance) and nonincome taxes.\nThe 0.4% increase in other operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to\nthe third quarter of 2023, was primarily related to increased costs for professional fees and state provider fees in certain\nstates, in addition to higher repairs and maintenance expense related to the response to Hurricane Helene at impacted\nhospitals, primarily in North Carolina. We have seen inflation have a negative impact on certain of these expenses and\nexpect inflationary pressures will continue to impact operating expenses in the future. Provisions for losses related to\nprofessional liability risks were $157 million and $145 million for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nEquity in earnings of affiliates was $15 million and $19 million in the third quarters of 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively.\nDepreciation and amortization increased $73 million, from $769 million in the third quarter of 2023 to $842\nmillion in the third quarter of 2024. The increase in depreciation relates primarily to capital expenditures at our existing\nfacilities.\nInterest expense was $515 million in the third quarter of 2024 and $483 million in the third quarter of 2023. Our\naverage debt balance was $41.846 billion for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $38.881 billion for the third quarter\nof 2023. The average effective interest rate for our debt was 4.9% for both of the quarters ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023.\nDuring the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, we recorded losses on sales of facilities of $4 million and gains on\nsales of facilities of $2 million, respectively.\nThe effective tax rates were 25.0% and 24.8% for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Salaries and benefits were favorably impacted by a 21.9% decline in contract labor during the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Salaries and benefits\nper equivalent admission increased 0.1% in the first nine months of 2024, compared to the first nine months of 2023.\nSame facility salaries and benefits per full time equivalent increased 1.7% for the first nine months of 2024, compared\nto the first nine months of 2023. We continue to utilize certain contract, overtime and other premium rate labor costs to\nsupport our clinical staff and patients. While these costs have declined compared to the prior year period, future costs\nmay be affected by labor market conditions and other factors.\nSupplies, as a percentage of revenues, were 15.2% in the first nine months of 2024 and 15.4% in the first nine\nmonths of 2023. Supply costs per equivalent admission increased 2.7% in the first nine months of 2024, compared to\nthe first nine months of 2023. Supply costs per equivalent admission increased 4.3% for medical devices and 3.0% for\ngeneral medical and surgical items and declined 2.1% for pharmacy supplies in the first nine months of 2024, compared\nto the first nine months of 2023.\nOther operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, were 21.0% in the first nine months of 2024 and 19.5% in\nthe first nine months of 2023. Other operating expenses is primarily comprised of contract services, professional fees,\nrepairs and maintenance, rents and leases, utilities, insurance (including professional liability insurance) and nonincome\ntaxes. The 1.5% increase in other operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, for the first nine months of 2024,\ncompared to the first nine months of 2023, was primarily related to increased costs for professional fees and state\nprovider fees in certain states. We have seen inflation have a negative impact on certain of these expenses and expect\ninflationary pressures will continue to impact operating expenses in the future. Provisions for losses related to\nprofessional liability risks were $469 million and $433 million for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nEquity in earnings of affiliates was $13 million and equity in losses of affiliates was $6 million in the first nine\nmonths of 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nDepreciation and amortization increased $168 million, from $2.288 billion in the first nine months of 2023 to\n$2.456 billion in the first nine months of 2024. The increase in depreciation relates primarily to capital expenditures at\nour existing facilities.\n23\nITEM 2.

Our average debt balance was $40.901 billion for the first nine months of 2024 compared to $38.695 billion for\nthe first nine months of 2023. The average effective interest rate for our debt was 5.0% for both of the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nDuring the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, we recorded gains on sales of facilities of $209 million and losses\non sales of facilities of $12 million, respectively. The gain for 2024 was primarily related to the sale of a hospital facility\nin California.\nThe effective tax rates were 24.7% and 23.7% for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The\neffective tax rate computations exclude net income attributable to noncontrolling interests as it relates to consolidated\npartnerships. The increase in the effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2024 is related primarily to adjustments\nto our liability for unrecognized tax benefits. Our provisions for income taxes for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023\nincluded tax benefits of $93 million and $89 million, respectively, related to employee equity award settlements.\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased from $595 million for the first nine months of 2023\nto $649 million for the first nine months 2024. The increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests related\nprimarily to the operations of one of our Texas markets.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash provided by operating activities totaled $7.955 billion for the first nine months of 2024 compared to $6.757\nbillion for the first nine months of 2023. The $1.198 billion increase in cash provided by operating activities, for the\nfirst nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023, related primarily to an increase in net income of\n$798 million, excluding the non-cash impact of gains and losses on sales of facilities, depreciation and amortization and\nshare-based compensation, and positive changes in working capital items of $547 million, mainly from a decline in\ninventories and other assets, partially offset by an increase in income tax payments of $416 million. The combination of\ninterest payments and net income tax payments in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 totaled $2.891 billion and\n$2.530 billion, respectively. Working capital totaled $1.762 billion at September 30, 2024 and $2.272 billion at\nDecember 31, 2023 (decline was primarily due to the $2.258 billion increase in long-term debt due within one year,\noffset by a $1.953 billion increase in cash and cash equivalents).\nCash used in investing activities was $3.587 billion in the first nine months of 2024 compared to $3.720 billion in\nthe first nine months of 2023. Excluding acquisitions, capital expenditures were $3.590 billion in the first nine months\nof 2024 and $3.585 billion in the first nine months of 2023. Planned capital expenditures are expected to approximate\n$5 billion in 2024. At September 30, 2024, there were projects under construction which had estimated additional costs\nto complete and equip over the next five years of approximately $4.7 billion. We expect to finance capital expenditures\nwith internally generated and borrowed funds.\nCash used in financing activities totaled $2.419 billion in the first nine months of 2024, compared to $3.055\nbillion in the first nine months of 2023. During the first nine months of 2024, net cash flows used in financing activities\nincluded a net increase of $3.269 billion in our indebtedness, payment of dividends of $525 million, repurchase of\ncommon stock of $4.342 billion and distributions to noncontrolling interests of $530 million. During the first nine\nmonths of 2023, net cash flows used in financing activities included a net increase of $1.109 billion in our indebtedness,\npayment of dividends of $501 million, repurchase of common stock of $2.901 billion and distributions to noncontrolling\ninterests of $497 million.\nDuring February 2024, we issued $4.500 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes comprised of (i)\n$1.000 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.450% senior notes due 2031 (the “Existing 2031 Notes”), (ii) $1.300\nbillion aggregate principal amount of 5.600% senior notes due 2034, (iii) $1.500 billion aggregate principal amount of\n6.000% senior notes due 2054 and (iv) $700 million aggregate principal amount of 6.100% senior notes due 2064. We\nused the net proceeds to repay borrowings under our asset-based revolving credit facility and for general corporate\npurposes. During March 2024, we repaid all of the $2.000 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.000% senior notes\ndue 2024 at maturity.\n24\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources (continued)\nDuring August 2024, we issued $3.000 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes comprised of (i) $750\nmillion aggregate principal amount of 5.450% senior notes due 2031 (the “New 2031 Notes”), (ii) $1.250 billion\naggregate principal amount of 5.450% senior notes due 2034 and (iii) $1.000 billion aggregate principal amount of\n5.950% senior notes due 2054. The New 2031 Notes represent a further issuance of our Existing 2031 Notes, issued\nduring February 2024, and together with the New 2031 Notes, the aggregate principal amount of these notes is $1.750\nbillion. We used the net proceeds to repay borrowings under our asset-based revolving credit facility and for general\ncorporate purposes.\nWe have significant debt service requirements. Our debt totaled $42.965 billion at September 30, 2024. Our\ninterest expense was $1.533 billion for the first nine months of 2024 and $1.447 billion for the first nine months of\n2023.\nIn addition to cash flows from operations, available sources of capital include amounts available under our senior\nsecured credit facilities ($7.986 billion available as of both September 30, 2024 and October 28, 2024) and anticipated\naccess to public and private debt markets.\nInvestments of our insurance subsidiaries, held to maintain statutory equity levels and to provide liquidity to pay\nclaims, totaled $648 million and $564 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. An\ninsurance subsidiary maintained net reserves for professional liability risks of $120 million and $121 million at\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Our facilities are insured by our insurance subsidiary for\nlosses up to $80 million per occurrence; however, this coverage is generally subject, in most cases, to a $15 million per\noccurrence self-insured retention. Additionally, the insurance subsidiary has entered into reinsurance contracts providing\nreimbursement for a certain portion of losses in excess of self-insured retentions. Net reserves for the self-insured\nprofessional liability risks retained were $1.980 billion and $1.926 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023, respectively. Claims payments, net of reinsurance recoveries, during the next 12 months are expected to\napproximate $547 million. We estimate that approximately $517 million of the expected net claim payments during the\nnext 12 months will relate to claims subject to the self-insured retention.\nManagement believes that cash flows from operations, amounts available under our senior secured credit facilities\nand our anticipated access to public and private debt markets will be sufficient to meet expected liquidity needs for the\nforeseeable future.\n(cid:0)0 (cid:0)D (cid:0)U (cid:0)N (cid:0)H (cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)5 (cid:0)L(cid:0)V (cid:0)N (cid:0)(cid:3)\nWe are exposed to market risk related to changes in market values of securities. The investment securities held by\nour insurance subsidiaries were recorded at $648 million at September 30, 2024. These investments are carried at fair\nvalue, with changes in unrealized gains and losses that are not credit-related being recorded as adjustments to other\ncomprehensive income. At September 30, 2024, we had unrealized losses of $18 million on the insurance subsidiaries’\ninvestments.\nWe are exposed to market risk related to market illiquidity. Investments in debt and equity securities held by our\ninsurance subsidiaries could be impaired by the inability to access the capital markets. Should the insurance subsidiaries\nrequire significant amounts of cash in excess of normal cash requirements to pay claims and other expenses on short\nnotice, we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner or be forced to sell them at a price less than\nwhat we might otherwise have been able to in a normal market environment. We may be required to recognize credit-\nrelated impairments on our investment securities in future periods should issuers default on interest payments or should\nthe fair market valuations of the securities deteriorate due to ratings downgrades or other issue-specific factors.\nWe are also exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates. With respect to our interest-bearing\nliabilities, approximately $1.256 billion of our debt at September 30, 2024 was subject to variable rates of interest,\nwhile the remaining debt balance of $41.709 billion at September 30, 2024 was subject to fixed rates of interest. Both\nthe general level of interest rates and our leverage affect our variable interest rates. Our variable debt is comprised\nprimarily of amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit facilities. The average effective interest rate for our\ndebt was 5.0% for both of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n25\nITEM 2.

The estimates of fair\nvalue are based upon the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues of long-term debt with the same maturities.\nBased on a hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates, the potential annualized reduction to future pretax earnings would\nbe approximately $13 million. To mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates, we generally target a majority of\nour debt portfolio to be maintained at fixed rates.\nWe are exposed to currency translation risk related to our foreign operations. We currently do not consider the\nmarket risk related to foreign currency translation to be material to our consolidated financial statements or our\nliquidity.\nTax Examinations\nAt September 30, 2024, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) was conducting examinations of the Company’s\n2016, 2017 and 2018 federal income tax returns and the 2019 returns for certain affiliates. We are also subject to\nexamination by the IRS for tax years after 2019 as well as by state and foreign taxing authorities. Management believes\nHCA Healthcare, Inc. and its predecessors, subsidiaries and affiliates properly reported taxable income and paid taxes in\naccordance with applicable laws and agreements established with the IRS, state and foreign taxing authorities, and final\nresolution of any disputes will not have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.\nHowever, if payments due upon final resolution of any issues exceed our recorded estimates, such resolutions could\nhave a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.\n26\nITEM 2.
