LLC based on the $13.01 closing stock price of Dynavax's common stock on November 8, 2024. The final number of shares repurchased under the ASR will be based on the volume-weighted average prices of Dynavax's common stock during the term of the ASR, and subject to adjustments related to the terms and conditions of the ASR agreement. The final settlement of the ASR is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2025.

We believe our commercial execution to date, overall financial position, and our commitment to achieving profitability, afford us the capacity to return cash to shareholders through the share repurchase program announced today. We will continue to execute on our strategic growth pillars focused on maximizing the HEPLISAV-B opportunity, delivering on our clinical pipeline, and pursuing external opportunities to drive sustainable value for our shareholders,\" said Ryan Spencer, Chief Executive Officer of Dynavax.\n\n\"Additionally, we have decided to discontinue development of our Tdap-1018 program based on results from the Phase 1 extension study. The program showed improved immunogenicity driven by CpG 1018, however, we do not believe the data support sufficient differentiation to be successful commercially. This decision aligns with our commitment to prudent management of resources aimed at generating long-term value.\"\n\n**_BUSINESS UPDATES_**\n\n**_HEPLISAV-B® [Hepatitis B Vaccine (Recombinant), Adjuvanted]_**_HEPLISAV-B vaccine is the first and only adult hepatitis B vaccine approved in the U.S., the European Union and Great Britain that enables series completion with only two doses in one month. Hepatitis B vaccination is universally recommended for adults aged 19-59 in the U.S._\n\n  * HEPLISAV-B achieved record quarterly net product revenue of $79.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 27% compared to $62.3 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * HEPLISAV-B total estimated market share in the U.S. increased to approximately 44%, compared to approximately 41% for the third quarter 2023.\n  * HEPLISAV-B estimated market share in the retail pharmacy segment increased to approximately 55%, compared to approximately 53% for the third quarter of 2023. HEPLISAV-B estimated market share in the Integrated Delivery Networks (IDNs) and Large Clinics segment was approximately 56%, compared to approximately 54% for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Dynavax now expects the hepatitis B adult vaccine market in the U.S. to expand to a peak of over $900 million in annual sales by 2030, with HEPLISAV-B expected to achieve at least 60% total market share. Additionally, Dynavax believes the HEPLISAV-B U.S. market opportunity will remain substantial beyond 2030 due to the ongoing penetration of the unvaccinated eligible adult population, observed revaccination practices by healthcare providers, and continued gains in market share.\n\n\n\n**_Clinical Pipeline_** _Dynavax is advancing a pipeline of differentiated product candidates that leverage its CpG 1018_ _®_ _adjuvant, which has demonstrated its ability to enhance the immune response with a favorable tolerability profile in a wide range of clinical trials and real-world commercial use._\n\n**HEPLISAV-B Regulatory Updates**\n\n  * In the third quarter, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the Company's supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) to include pregnancy information from HBV-28, a post-licensure observational retrospective cohort study, in the U.S. label for HEPLISAV-B. The HBV-28 study showed no increased risk of major birth defects or miscarriage in women who received HEPLISAV-B compared to an active comparator.\n  * Regarding the Complete Response Letter issued for the sBLA to include a four-dose HEPLISAV-B vaccine regimen for adults on hemodialysis on the U.S. label, Dynavax recently received feedback from the FDA regarding the potential to conduct an observational retrospective cohort study to support the sBLA filing.\n\n\n\n**Shingles vaccine program:**_Z-1018_  _is an investigational vaccine_  _candidate_  _being developed for the prevention of shingles in adults aged 50 years and older._\n\n  * Dynavax is currently conducting a randomized, active-controlled, dose escalation, multicenter Phase 1/2 trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of Z-1018 compared to Shingrix® in approximately 440 healthy adults aged 50 to 69. Dynavax anticipates reporting top line immunogenicity and safety data in the second half of 2025, including a comparison of CD4+ T-cells.\n\n\n\n**Plague vaccine program:**_Dynavax is developing a plague (rF1V) vaccine candidate adjuvanted with CpG 1018® currently in a Phase 2 clinical trial in collaboration with, and fully funded by, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD)._\n\n  * Based on the results from a randomized, active-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial of the two-dose plague vaccine adjuvanted with CpG 1018, Dynavax has submitted a proposal to the DoD regarding additional clinical and manufacturing activities. \n\n\n\n**Tdap vaccine program:**_Tdap-1018 was an investigational vaccine candidate intended for active booster immunization against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (Tdap)._\n\n  * Dynavax announced today that it has decided to discontinue development of its Tdap-1018 program based on results from a long-term Phase 1 extension study that did not demonstrate a differentiated profile that the Company believes would be successful commercially.\n\n\n\n**_THIRD QUARTER 2024 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS_**\n\n**Total Revenues and Net Product Revenue.**\n\n  * Total revenues for the third quarter of 2024 were $80.6 million, a 16% year-over-year increase compared to $69.5 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * HEPLISAV-B net product revenue was $79.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, a 27% year-over-year increase compared to $62.3 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Other revenue was $1.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, an 82% decrease compared to $7.2 million for the third quarter of 2023. Other revenue primarily includes revenue from the plague vaccine agreement with the U.S. Department of Defense.\n\n\n\n**Cost of Sales - Product.** Cost of sales - product for HEPLISAV-B in the third quarter of 2024 decreased to $13.1 million, compared to $13.2 million for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower per-unit manufacturing costs as a result of previous process improvements, partially offset by higher sales volumes.\n\n**Research and Development Expenses (R &D). **R&D expenses for the third quarter of 2024 increased to $14.4 million, compared to $14.1 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily driven by costs related to the ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial for the shingles program, partially offset by the completion of clinical trial activities for the Tdap and plague programs.\n\n**Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses (SG &A). **SG&A expenses for the third quarter of 2024 increased to $43.1 million, compared to $38.1 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily driven by increased headcount and other investments to support HEPLISAV-B and pipeline growth.\n\n**Net Income.** Net income was $17.6 million, or $0.13 per share basic and $0.12 diluted in the third quarter of 2024, compared to net income of $14.3 million, or $0.11 per share basic and $0.10 diluted in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n**Cash and Marketable Securities.** Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $764.0 million as of September 30, 2024, an increase compared to $742.3 million as of December 31, 2023.\n\n**_Full Year 2024 FINANCIAL GUIDANCE_**\n\nDynavax is updating its full year 2024 financial guidance, based on the Company's current operating plan: \n\n  * Narrowing HEPLISAV-B net product revenue range from approximately $265 to $280 million, to approximately $265 to $270 million\n  * Reiterating HEPLISAV-B gross margin of approximately 80%\n  * Reducing and narrowing research and development expense range from approximately $60 to $75 million, to approximately $55 to $65 million\n  * Narrowing selling, general and administrative expense range from approximately $160 to $180 million, to approximately $170 to $180 million\n  * Expect positive net income for full year 2024\n\n\n\n**_Conference Call and Webcast Information_**\n\nDynavax will host a conference call and live audio webcast on Thursday, November 7, 2024, at 4:30 p.m. ET/1:30 p.m. PT.

We believe our commercial execution to date, overall financial position, and our commitment to achieving profitability, afford us the capacity to return cash to shareholders through the share repurchase program announced today. We will continue to execute on our strategic growth pillars focused on maximizing the HEPLISAV-B opportunity, delivering on our clinical pipeline, and pursuing external opportunities to drive sustainable value for our shareholders,\" said Ryan Spencer, Chief Executive Officer of Dynavax.\n\n\"Additionally, we have decided to discontinue development of our Tdap-1018 program based on results from the Phase 1 extension study. The program showed improved immunogenicity driven by CpG 1018, however, we do not believe the data support sufficient differentiation to be successful commercially. This decision aligns with our commitment to prudent management of resources aimed at generating long-term value.\"\n\n**_BUSINESS UPDATES_**\n\n**_HEPLISAV-B® [Hepatitis B Vaccine (Recombinant), Adjuvanted]_**_HEPLISAV-B vaccine is the first and only adult hepatitis B vaccine approved in the U.S., the European Union and Great Britain that enables series completion with only two doses in one month. Hepatitis B vaccination is universally recommended for adults aged 19-59 in the U.S._\n\n  * HEPLISAV-B achieved record quarterly net product revenue of $79.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 27% compared to $62.3 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * HEPLISAV-B total estimated market share in the U.S. increased to approximately 44%, compared to approximately 41% for the third quarter 2023.\n  * HEPLISAV-B estimated market share in the retail pharmacy segment increased to approximately 55%, compared to approximately 53% for the third quarter of 2023. HEPLISAV-B estimated market share in the Integrated Delivery Networks (IDNs) and Large Clinics segment was approximately 56%, compared to approximately 54% for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Dynavax now expects the hepatitis B adult vaccine market in the U.S. to expand to a peak of over $900 million in annual sales by 2030, with HEPLISAV-B expected to achieve at least 60% total market share. Additionally, Dynavax believes the HEPLISAV-B U.S. market opportunity will remain substantial beyond 2030 due to the ongoing penetration of the unvaccinated eligible adult population, observed revaccination practices by healthcare providers, and continued gains in market share.\n\n\n\n**_Clinical Pipeline_** _Dynavax is advancing a pipeline of differentiated product candidates that leverage its CpG 1018_ _®_ _adjuvant, which has demonstrated its ability to enhance the immune response with a favorable tolerability profile in a wide range of clinical trials and real-world commercial use._\n\n**HEPLISAV-B Regulatory Updates**\n\n  * In the third quarter, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the Company's supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) to include pregnancy information from HBV-28, a post-licensure observational retrospective cohort study, in the U.S. label for HEPLISAV-B. The HBV-28 study showed no increased risk of major birth defects or miscarriage in women who received HEPLISAV-B compared to an active comparator.\n  * Regarding the Complete Response Letter issued for the sBLA to include a four-dose HEPLISAV-B vaccine regimen for adults on hemodialysis on the U.S. label, Dynavax recently received feedback from the FDA regarding the potential to conduct an observational retrospective cohort study to support the sBLA filing.\n\n\n\n**Shingles vaccine program:**_Z-1018_  _is an investigational vaccine_  _candidate_  _being developed for the prevention of shingles in adults aged 50 years and older._\n\n  * Dynavax is currently conducting a randomized, active-controlled, dose escalation, multicenter Phase 1/2 trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of Z-1018 compared to Shingrix® in approximately 440 healthy adults aged 50 to 69. Dynavax anticipates reporting top line immunogenicity and safety data in the second half of 2025, including a comparison of CD4+ T-cells.\n\n\n\n**Plague vaccine program:**_Dynavax is developing a plague (rF1V) vaccine candidate adjuvanted with CpG 1018® currently in a Phase 2 clinical trial in collaboration with, and fully funded by, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD)._\n\n  * Based on the results from a randomized, active-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial of the two-dose plague vaccine adjuvanted with CpG 1018, Dynavax has submitted a proposal to the DoD regarding additional clinical and manufacturing activities. \n\n\n\n**Tdap vaccine program:**_Tdap-1018 was an investigational vaccine candidate intended for active booster immunization against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (Tdap)._\n\n  * Dynavax announced today that it has decided to discontinue development of its Tdap-1018 program based on results from a long-term Phase 1 extension study that did not demonstrate a differentiated profile that the Company believes would be successful commercially.\n\n\n\n**_THIRD QUARTER 2024 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS_**\n\n**Total Revenues and Net Product Revenue.**\n\n  * Total revenues for the third quarter of 2024 were $80.6 million, a 16% year-over-year increase compared to $69.5 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * HEPLISAV-B net product revenue was $79.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, a 27% year-over-year increase compared to $62.3 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Other revenue was $1.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, an 82% decrease compared to $7.2 million for the third quarter of 2023. Other revenue primarily includes revenue from the plague vaccine agreement with the U.S. Department of Defense.\n\n\n\n**Cost of Sales - Product.** Cost of sales - product for HEPLISAV-B in the third quarter of 2024 decreased to $13.1 million, compared to $13.2 million for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower per-unit manufacturing costs as a result of previous process improvements, partially offset by higher sales volumes.\n\n**Research and Development Expenses (R &D). **R&D expenses for the third quarter of 2024 increased to $14.4 million, compared to $14.1 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily driven by costs related to the ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial for the shingles program, partially offset by the completion of clinical trial activities for the Tdap and plague programs.\n\n**Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses (SG &A). **SG&A expenses for the third quarter of 2024 increased to $43.1 million, compared to $38.1 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily driven by increased headcount and other investments to support HEPLISAV-B and pipeline growth.\n\n**Net Income.** Net income was $17.6 million, or $0.13 per share basic and $0.12 diluted in the third quarter of 2024, compared to net income of $14.3 million, or $0.11 per share basic and $0.10 diluted in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n**Cash and Marketable Securities.** Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $764.0 million as of September 30, 2024, an increase compared to $742.3 million as of December 31, 2023.\n\n**_Full Year 2024 FINANCIAL GUIDANCE_**\n\nDynavax is updating its full year 2024 financial guidance, based on the Company's current operating plan: \n\n  * Narrowing HEPLISAV-B net product revenue range from approximately $265 to $280 million, to approximately $265 to $270 million\n  * Reiterating HEPLISAV-B gross margin of approximately 80%\n  * Reducing and narrowing research and development expense range from approximately $60 to $75 million, to approximately $55 to $65 million\n  * Narrowing selling, general and administrative expense range from approximately $160 to $180 million, to approximately $170 to $180 million\n  * Expect positive net income for full year 2024\n\n\n\n**_Conference Call and Webcast Information_**\n\nDynavax will host a conference call and live audio webcast on Thursday, November 7, 2024, at 4:30 p.m. ET/1:30 p.m. PT.
