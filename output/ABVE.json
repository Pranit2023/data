(Nasdaq: ABVE, ABVEW)\n(“Above Food” or the “Company”), an innovative food company leveraging its vertically integrated supply\nchain to deliver differentiated ingredients and consumer products, today announced additional details\nrelated to its expanded chickpea business in connection with its previously announced acquisition of the\nspecialty crop food ingredient division (the “Assets”) of Montana-based The Redwood Group, LLC (“TRG”).\nThis strategic acquisition solidifies Above Food's position as North America's largest chickpea\nmanufacturer, positioning the Company to capitalize on the growing global demand for plant-based proteins\nand meet increasing consumer preferences for sustainable, nutritious food options.\n“We are pleased to expand our presence in the rapidly growing global chickpea market. Together with our\nrecent acquisition, Above Food is now one of North America’s largest chickpea ingredient suppliers with a\nbusiness that now represents approximately US$62 million on an annualized basis or 14% of our combined\nrevenue on a proforma basis,” said Lionel Kambeitz, Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and\nExecutive Chairman of Above Food. “Our enhanced leadership in the chickpea sector aligns perfectly with\nour seed-to-fork platform, allowing us to control every step from seed selection and farming to ingredient\nprocessing and formulation, for conventional, natural regenerative, organic, and regenerative organic\ncertified chickpeas. By leveraging our expanded operations and increased processing capabilities, we are\nwell-positioned to meet the growing demand for plant-based proteins across human food, pet food, and\nexport markets. Furthermore, we are able to drive innovation in chickpea-based products, strengthen\nrelationships with growers and suppliers, and capture a larger share of the global chickpea trade. This\nstrategic move not only positions Above Food as the go-to partner for food manufacturers seeking high-\nquality, sustainable chickpea ingredients but also aligns perfectly with our mission to create a healthier\nworld — one seed, one field, and one bite at a time.”\nStrategic Importance of Leadership in Chickpea Industry\nThe chickpea industry represents a substantial and growing opportunity for Above Food, driven by several\nkey factors:\n Large and Growing Market: The US$15 billion global chickpea market is projected to grow at a CAGR\nof 7.4% through 2032, according to Zion Market Research. This growth outpaces many traditional\nprotein sources, indicating a shift towards plant-based protein options. Notably, Saskatchewan, is the\nprimary chickpea-producing province in Canada, accounting for approximately 80% of the country's\nproduction according to Saskatchewan Pulse Growers.\n Rising Consumer Demand: Chickpeas align perfectly with current consumer trends towards plant-\nbased proteins, healthy eating, and sustainability, with 39% of US consumers trying to incorporate\nmore plant-based foods in their diets. Chickpea’s nutritional density makes them an attractive option\nfor consumers seeking healthier food choices and for manufacturers developing new nutritious\nproduct formulations.\n Versatility Across Applications: Chickpeas are incredibly versatile ingredients used in human food,\npet food, and export markets. From traditional hummus and falafel to innovative meat alternatives,\ngluten-free flours, and plant-based dairy substitutes, chickpeas are used in a wide range of products.\nThis versatility provides Above Food with diverse revenue streams across high-growth categories,\ndriving demand and fueling ongoing product innovation.\n Sustainability Advantages: Chickpeas emerge as a frontrunner in sustainable agriculture, boasting a\nsignificantly lower environmental footprint compared to animal proteins. Their water-efficient\ncultivation, natural soil-enriching properties as nitrogen-fixers, and reduced carbon emissions align\nperfectly with the growing consumer demand for eco-friendly food options. These sustainability\ncredentials, coupled with chickpeas' role in promoting biodiversity and food security, position them as\na key ingredient for environmentally conscious consumers and manufacturers in the evolving\nlandscape of sustainable food systems.\n Innovation Opportunities: Above Food's enhanced chickpea processing capabilities open up new\navenues for product development and innovation in the plant-based protein sector, positioning the\nCompany at the forefront of emerging food technology trends. The number of new product launches\ncontaining chickpea as an ingredient increased by 74% globally between 2018 and 2022, according\nto the Mintel Global New Products Database.\nAbout Above Food\nAbove Food Ingredients Inc.

This growth is outpacing the\noverall pet food market, indicating a strong shift towards consumers adopting plant-based protein\nformulations for their pets.\n Expanding Pet Ownership: 66% of US households own a pet, according to the American Pet Products\nAssociation. The US pet population has been consistently growing at 1-2% annually from 2013-2022,\nas reported by Euromonitor. This trend is expected to continue, creating a steadily expanding\ncustomer base for pet food products.\n Pet Humanization Trend: According to Packaged Facts, 92-96% of US pet owners view their pets as\nfamily members. This \"humanization\" of pets has been a strong long-term trend for over a decade,\ntransforming pet owners into \"pet parents\" who prioritize their pets' well-being and are willing to invest\nin premium nutrition options.\n Health and Nutrition Focus: Mirroring trends in human nutrition, pet parents are increasingly seeking\nhealthier, higher-quality food options for their pets.

This trend has been further\naccelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, with 48% of pet parents reporting feeling closer to their pets\ndue to the pandemic, according to an American Pet Products Association's Pulse Study.\n Plant-Based Innovation: The plant-based food movement is driving innovation in pet food, with\ningredients like chickpeas and flaxseed becoming increasingly popular alternatives to traditional soy,\ncorn, and wheat proteins. This shift opens up new opportunities for differentiated ingredient suppliers\nlike Above Food, now North America’s largest chickpea manufacturer following the acquisition of\nTRG, to become valuable innovation partners with manufacturers in developing novel, nutritious plant-\nbased pet food formulations.\n Market Resilience: The pet category has historically shown resilience during economic downturns, as\nconsumers continue to prioritize spending on their pets even when tightening budgets in other areas.\nThis resilience was demonstrated during both the financial crisis in 2008 and the COVID-19 pandemic\nwhen the pet industry experienced positive growth despite a reduced appetite for consumer spending.\nAbout Above Food\nAbove Food Ingredients Inc.

For example, a conflict of interest may\narise when a Covered Party is also an executive officer, a major shareholder or has a material\ninterest in a company or organization doing business with the Company.\n1 Item 404(a) of SEC Regulation S-K defines “immediate family member” as a person’s child, stepchild, parent,\nstepparent, spouse, sibling, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law or sister-in-\nlaw, or any person (other than a tenant or employee) sharing the person’s household.\n1\nEach Covered Party has an obligation to conduct the Company’s business in an honest\nand ethical manner, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest\nbetween personal and professional relationships. Any situation that involves, or may reasonably\nbe expected to involve, a conflict of interest with the Company, should be disclosed promptly to\nthe Company’s Audit Committee of the Board.\nII. Disclosures\nThe information in the Company's public communications, including all reports and\ndocuments filed with or submitted to the SEC, must be full, fair, accurate, timely and\nunderstandable.\nTo ensure the Company meets this standard, all Covered Parties (to the extent they are\ninvolved in the Company’s disclosure process) are required to maintain familiarity with the\ndisclosure requirements, processes and procedures applicable to the Company commensurate\nwith their duties. Covered Parties are prohibited from knowingly misrepresenting, omitting or\ncausing others to misrepresent or omit, material facts about the Company to others, including the\nCompany’s independent auditors, governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations.\nIII. Compliance with Laws, Rules and Regulations\nThe Company is obligated to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. It is\nthe personal responsibility of each Covered Party to adhere to the standards and restrictions\nimposed by these laws, rules and regulations in the performance of his or her duties for the\nCompany.\nThe Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer or\nController (or persons performing similar functions) of the Company are also required to\npromote compliance by all employees with the Code and to abide by Company standards,\npolicies and procedures.\nIV. Reporting, Accountability and Enforcement\nThe Company promotes ethical behavior at all times and encourages Covered Parties to\ntalk to supervisors, managers and other appropriate personnel, including officers, the General\nCounsel, outside counsel for the Company and the Board or the relevant committee thereof,\nwhen in doubt about the best course of action in a particular situation.\nCovered Parties should promptly report suspected violations of laws, rules, regulations or\nthe Code to appropriate personnel, including officers, the General Counsel, outside counsel for\nthe Company and the Board or the relevant committee thereof. Reports may be made\nanonymously. If requested, confidentiality will be maintained, subject to applicable law,\nregulations and legal proceedings.\nThe Audit Committee of the Board or other appropriate officer or body shall investigate\nand determine, or shall designate appropriate persons to investigate and determine, the\nlegitimacy of such reports. The Audit Committee or other appropriate officer or body will then\n2\ndetermine the appropriate disciplinary action. Such disciplinary action includes, but is not\nlimited to, reprimand, termination with cause, and possible civil and criminal prosecution.\nTo encourage employees to report any and all violations, the Company will not tolerate\nretaliation for reports made in good faith. Retaliation or retribution against any Covered Party\nfor a report made in good faith of any suspected violation of laws, rules, regulations or this Code\nis cause for appropriate disciplinary action.\nV. Waivers\nBefore an employee, or an immediate family member of any such employee, engages in\nany activity that would be otherwise prohibited by the Code, he or she is strongly encouraged to\nobtain a written waiver from the Audit Committee or, if the Audit Committee defers decision on\nsuch waiver to the Board, from the Board.\nBefore a director or executive officer, or an immediate family member of a director or\nexecutive officer, engages in any activity that would be otherwise prohibited by the Code, he or\nshe must obtain a written waiver from the Audit Committee or, if the Audit Committee defers\ndecision on such waiver to the Board, from the disinterested directors of the Board. Such waiver\nmust then be disclosed to the Company’s shareholders, along with the reasons for granting the\nwaiver, within four business days.\nVI. No Rights Created\nThis Code is a statement of certain fundamental principles, policies and procedures that\ngovern the Company’s Covered Parties in the conduct of the Company’s business. It is not\nintended to and does not create any rights in any employee, customer, client, visitor, supplier,\ncompetitor, shareholder or any other person or entity. It is the Company’s belief that the policy\nis robust and covers most conceivable situations.\n3"
