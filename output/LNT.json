In an era where energy is more vital than ever, we embrace our corporate responsibility with unwavering dedication, focusing on delivering affordable, safe, reliable and increasingly sustainable energy. Our strategy is designed to ensure responsible energy delivery through a balanced and diverse resource portfolio. We are committed to pioneering innovative, customer-focused solutions that meet new energy demands in a cost-effective and sustainable manner. Here are some of our standout achievements from the past year. **2023 accomplishments:**\n\n  * **Diversified energy portfolio** : We expanded our energy mix with 639 MW of solar projects in Wisconsin and initiated energy storage at renewable facilities.\n  * **Collaborative innovation** : Partnered with agencies and universities, including the Alliant Energy Solar Farm at Iowa State University, to explore cutting-edge technologies.\n  * **Secured federal funding** : Established a federal funding office and secured a Department of Energy grant for the Columbia Energy Storage Project.\n  * **Community engagement** : Donated nearly $11 million to community-focused organizations, with employees volunteering over 72,000 hours.\n\n\n\n**Reliability and resilience** We have fortified the grid to ensure reliable energy delivery. As a leading owner/operator of wind and solar energy, we are committed to providing cost-effective energy for the future. Our efforts have resulted in a 25% reduction in outages over the past decade. We continue to invest in our system and propose flexible generation resources to meet demand spikes. **The path ahead** Our commitment to supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy is steadfast, and our journey to net-zero will be shaped by balancing customer needs, affordability, economic development and sustainability. Through the execution of our Clean Energy Blueprint, we are progressing toward our aspirational goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions from our utility operations by 2050. We will continue to evolve our strategic plans to keep pace with this dynamic industry. Success will require the collective effort of customers, investors, and external stakeholders to find the right balance. We are proud to have been the trusted energy provider to our communities for over a century. We look forward to continuing to serve our customers responsibly for many years to come.\n\n![Lisa Barton, Alliant Energy](/-/media/alliant/images/cleanenergy/responsibility-report/lisa-barton-coffee2.jpg?sc_lang=en&la=en&h=1600&w=1534&hash=631F102D1450F77E7883D4074549178F)\n\nLisa Barton \n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) \n\n[ ![aerial view of a solar field](/-/media/alliant/images/cleanenergy/responsibility-report/crr-video-tn.jpg?sc_lang=en&la=en&h=569&w=1253&hash=0BE7529EB25453B7868D73B79428EE2B) ](https://www.youtube.com/embed/OFG_MGBx8Yg)\n\nVideo: 2024 Corporate Responsibility Report \n\n### [ Sustainability and Our Values  See more  ](/cleanenergy/ourenergyvision/responsibilityreport/sustainabilityvalues) ### [ Clean Energy Vision and Goals  Our vision and goals demonstrate our strong commitment to sustainability.
