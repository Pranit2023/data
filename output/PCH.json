Net income was $23.7 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, on revenues of $265.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Excluding an after-tax gain on insurance recoveries, adjusted net income was $11.4 million, or $0.14 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2023. \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * Generated Total Adjusted EBITDDA of $45.9 million and Total Adjusted EBITDDA margin of 18% \n  * Completed construction on the Waldo, Arkansas sawmill expansion and modernization project \n  * Repurchased 57,000 shares for $2.4 million, or $42 per share \n  * Maintained strong liquidity of $460 million as of September 30, 2024 \n\n\n\n“During the third quarter, our businesses delivered solid operational performance while navigating a challenging lumber market as well as the broader economic environment,” said Eric Cremers, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Additionally, our Wood Products division achieved a significant milestone with the successful completion of the construction phase of our Waldo, Arkansas sawmill expansion and modernization project. We believe this strategic investment positions the Waldo mill to be a top quartile sawmill, enabling it to generate an additional $25 million of Adjusted EBITDDA annually under a mid-cycle sales environment once the mill reaches its new capacity output. As for capital allocation, we will continue to be disciplined stewards of our shareholders’ capital and remain focused on returning capital to shareholders while prioritizing the long-term value for our shares. Looking forward, we believe that lumber markets are stabilizing as supply and demand in the industry continue to align. We are also optimistic that reductions in interest rates will serve as a catalyst, creating positive momentum in the housing and repair and remodel markets, thereby driving demand in our business,” stated Mr. Cremers. \n\n**Financial Highlights**\n\n**($ in millions, except per share data)** |  **Q3 2024** |  **Q2 2024** |  **Q3 2023**  \n---|---|---|---  \nRevenues  |  $  |  255.1  |  $  |  320.7  |  $  |  265.5   \nNet income  |  $  |  3.3  |  $  |  13.7  |  $  |  23.7   \nWeighted-average shares outstanding, diluted (in thousands)  |  79,277  |  79,741  |  80,379   \nNet income per diluted share  |  $  |  0.04  |  $  |  0.17  |  $  |  0.29   \nAdjusted Net Income 1 |  $  |  3.3  |  $  |  13.7  |  $  |  11.4   \nAdjusted Net Income Per Diluted Share 1 |  $  |  0.04  |  $  |  0.17  |  $  |  0.14   \nTotal Adjusted EBITDDA 1 |  $  |  45.9  |  $  |  103.2  |  $  |  56.3   \nTotal Adjusted EBITDDA Margin 1 |  18.0  |  %  |  32.2  |  %  |  21.2  |  %   \nDividends per share  |  $  |  0.45  |  $  |  0.45  |  $  |  0.45   \nNet cash from operations  |  $  |  26.5  |  $  |  100.6  |  $  |  41.0   \nCash and cash equivalents  |  $  |  161.1  |  $  |  199.7  |  $  |  302.8   \n1 Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income Per Diluted Share, Total Adjusted EBITDDA and Total Adjusted EBITDDA Margin are non-GAAP measures.

Management believes that these non-GAAP measures, when read in conjunction with our GAAP financial statements, provide useful information to investors and other interested parties as described below. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered only as supplemental to, are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to other similarly titled non-GAAP measures presented by other companies due to potential inconsistencies in methods of calculation. \n\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Per Diluted Share are non-GAAP measures that represent GAAP net income (loss) and GAAP net income (loss) per diluted share before certain items, net of tax, that management believes impact the ability to compare the performance of our business, either period-over-period or with other businesses. \n\nTotal Adjusted EBITDDA and Total Adjusted EBITDDA Margin are non-GAAP measures that remove the impact of specific items that management believes do not directly reflect the core business operations on an ongoing basis and can be used to evaluate the operational performance of assets under management. \n\nWe define Total Adjusted EBITDDA Margin as Total Adjusted EBITDDA divided by Revenues. \n\nReconciliations of Total Adjusted EBITDDA, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Per Diluted Share to their most comparable GAAP measures are set forth in the accompanying “Non-GAAP Reconciliations” at the end of this release. \n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nA live conference call and webcast will be held Tuesday, October 29, 2024, at 9:00 a.m. Pacific Time (12:00 p.m. Eastern Time).

The modernization project construction has been completed and the facility is beginning its ramp-up phase, and it is anticipated that it will take 6 to 12 months to reach the mill’s new dimensional lumber capacity of 275 million board feet per year. The Waldo modernization and expansion project is a $131 million strategic investment that is expected to increase the mill’s annual capacity by 85 million board feet, improve recovery by 6%, and reduce cash processing costs by approximately 30%. Once the ramp-up phase is completed, the mill is expected to generate approximately $25 million incremental Adjusted EBITDDA annually under a mid-cycle sales environment and an internal rate of return of approximately 22% in our base case. \n\nPotlatchDeltic has collaborated with BID Group for this turnkey project. The project includes a new saw line, planer upgrade, and a new continuous kiln. In addition, a Fulghum Industries, Inc. 170’ 45-ton log crane was installed and commissioned as part of the modernization. “I am very appreciative of the PotlatchDeltic and BID Group team members for their relentless efforts and focus on safety during this project. The productive working relationship with BID Group and the contributions by the suppliers and contractors on this project were an essential part of the on-time start-up,” said Ashlee Cribb, Vice President of Wood Products at PotlatchDeltic. \n\n**About PotlatchDeltic**\n\nPotlatchDeltic (Nasdaq: PCH) is a leading Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) that owns over 2.1 million acres of timberlands in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina. Through its taxable REIT subsidiary, the company also operates six sawmills, an industrial-grade plywood mill, a residential and commercial real estate development business, and a rural timberland sales program. PotlatchDeltic, a leader in sustainable forest practices, is committed to environmental and social responsibility and to responsible governance. More information can be found at [www.potlatchdeltic.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.potlatchdeltic.com&esheet=54115242&newsitemid=20240829949418&lan=en-US&anchor=www.potlatchdeltic.com&index=1&md5=a184b9f949397d6d344e36dd1bc3c638) . \n\n**Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information**\n\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws including, without limitation, our expectations regarding the Waldo, Arkansas sawmill modernization project, its expected completion of the ramp-up phase, corresponding impacts to production capacity, recovery, cash processing costs, operating cost reductions, Adjusted EBITDDA, and anticipated return on investment. Words such as “anticipated,” “expected,” “will,” and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. You should carefully read forward-looking statements, including statements that contain these words, because they discuss the future expectations or state other “forward-looking” information about PotlatchDeltic. A number of important factors could impact our ability and our contractors’ ability to complete the ramp-up phase of the Waldo modernization plan on time and to achieve the expected benefits, such as the factors described in PotlatchDeltic’s Annual Report on Form 10-K and in the company’s other filings with the SEC. PotlatchDeltic assumes no obligation to update the information in this communication, except as otherwise required by law. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, all of which speak only as of the date hereof. \n\n**Non-GAAP Measures**\n\nThis press release references forward-looking estimates of Adjusted EBITDDA, which is a non-GAAP measure that management uses to evaluate the performance of the company. Adjusted EBITDDA, as we define it, is calculated as net income (loss) before interest expense, net, income taxes, basis of real estate sold, depreciation, depletion and amortization and certain special items. Adjusted EBITDDA should not be considered in isolation from, and is not intended to represent an alternative to, our GAAP results. We have not provided a reconciliation of this forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure of net income (loss) because Adjusted EBITDDA, as we define it, excludes the impact of certain items listed above in our definition of Adjusted EBITDDA, and management cannot estimate these items or the impact they will have on Adjusted EBITDDA on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort. As a result, investors may be unable to accurately compare the expected impact of the Waldo sawmill modernization and expansion project to our historical results or the results or expected results of other companies that may have treated such matters differently. Nonetheless, management believes that providing this forward-looking non-GAAP information about the Waldo sawmill modernization and expansion project is useful to investors, and given the uncertain nature of forward-looking statements, we believe investors are able to take into account the inherent limitations of this forward-looking non-GAAP information. We cannot predict the occurrence, timing or amount of any of the items that we exclude from our Adjusted EBITDA estimate. Accordingly, the actual effect of these items, when determined, could potentially be significant to the calculation of Adjusted EBITDDA and actual results may differ materially from our estimate. \n\n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20240829949418r1&sid=q4-prod&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\n**(Investors)** **Wayne Wasechek** 509-835-1521 **(Media)** **Anna Torma** 509-835-1558 \n\nSource: PotlatchDeltic Corporation\n\n**Multimedia Files:**\n\n[ ![Multimedia JPG file for PotlatchDeltic Announces Waldo, Arkansas Sawmill Construction Completed](//s1.q4cdn.com/378084150/files/doc_multimedia/2024/8/1008778196/Color_PotlatchDeltic_Logo_Left_CircleR@thumbnail.png) ](//s1.q4cdn.com/378084150/files/doc_multimedia/2024/8/1008778196/Color_PotlatchDeltic_Logo_Left_CircleR.jpg)\n\nDownload:\n\n[ Download original 26 KB (836 x 182) ](//s1.q4cdn.com/378084150/files/doc_multimedia/2024/8/1008778196/Color_PotlatchDeltic_Logo_Left_CircleR.jpg)\n\n[ Download thumbnail 8 KB (200 x 44) ](//s1.q4cdn.com/378084150/files/doc_multimedia/2024/8/1008778196/Color_PotlatchDeltic_Logo_Left_CircleR@thumbnail.png)\n\n[ Download lowres 34 KB (480 x 104) ](//s1.q4cdn.com/378084150/files/doc_multimedia/2024/8/1008778196/Color_PotlatchDeltic_Logo_Left_CircleR@lowres.png)\n\n[ Download square 12 KB (250 x 250) ](//s1.q4cdn.com/378084150/files/doc_multimedia/2024/8/1008778196/Color_PotlatchDeltic_Logo_Left_CircleR@square.png)\n\n[View All News](https://investors.potlatchdeltic.com/news-and-events/default.aspx)\n\n## Quick Links\n\n  * [News](/news-and-events/default.aspx#news)\n  * [Investor Presentation](/news-and-events/default.aspx#presentations)\n  * [Financial Reports](https://investors.potlatchdeltic.com/financial-information/default.aspx)\n  * [Analyst Center](/stock-information/default.aspx#analyst)\n\n\n\n## Email Alerts\n\nTo opt-in for investor email alerts, please enter your email address in the field below and select at least one alert option.

Net income was $23.7 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, on revenues of $265.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Excluding an after-tax gain on insurance recoveries, adjusted net income was $11.4 million, or $0.14 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2023. \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * Generated Total Adjusted EBITDDA of $45.9 million and Total Adjusted EBITDDA margin of 18% \n  * Completed construction on the Waldo, Arkansas sawmill expansion and modernization project \n  * Repurchased 57,000 shares for $2.4 million, or $42 per share \n  * Maintained strong liquidity of $460 million as of September 30, 2024 \n\n\n\n“During the third quarter, our businesses delivered solid operational performance while navigating a challenging lumber market as well as the broader economic environment,” said Eric Cremers, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Additionally, our Wood Products division achieved a significant milestone with the successful completion of the construction phase of our Waldo, Arkansas sawmill expansion and modernization project. We believe this strategic investment positions the Waldo mill to be a top quartile sawmill, enabling it to generate an additional $25 million of Adjusted EBITDDA annually under a mid-cycle sales environment once the mill reaches its new capacity output. As for capital allocation, we will continue to be disciplined stewards of our shareholders’ capital and remain focused on returning capital to shareholders while prioritizing the long-term value for our shares. Looking forward, we believe that lumber markets are stabilizing as supply and demand in the industry continue to align. We are also optimistic that reductions in interest rates will serve as a catalyst, creating positive momentum in the housing and repair and remodel markets, thereby driving demand in our business,” stated Mr. Cremers. \n\n**Financial Highlights**\n\n**($ in millions, except per share data)** |  **Q3 2024** |  **Q2 2024** |  **Q3 2023**  \n---|---|---|---  \nRevenues  |  $  |  255.1  |  $  |  320.7  |  $  |  265.5   \nNet income  |  $  |  3.3  |  $  |  13.7  |  $  |  23.7   \nWeighted-average shares outstanding, diluted (in thousands)  |  79,277  |  79,741  |  80,379   \nNet income per diluted share  |  $  |  0.04  |  $  |  0.17  |  $  |  0.29   \nAdjusted Net Income 1 |  $  |  3.3  |  $  |  13.7  |  $  |  11.4   \nAdjusted Net Income Per Diluted Share 1 |  $  |  0.04  |  $  |  0.17  |  $  |  0.14   \nTotal Adjusted EBITDDA 1 |  $  |  45.9  |  $  |  103.2  |  $  |  56.3   \nTotal Adjusted EBITDDA Margin 1 |  18.0  |  %  |  32.2  |  %  |  21.2  |  %   \nDividends per share  |  $  |  0.45  |  $  |  0.45  |  $  |  0.45   \nNet cash from operations  |  $  |  26.5  |  $  |  100.6  |  $  |  41.0   \nCash and cash equivalents  |  $  |  161.1  |  $  |  199.7  |  $  |  302.8   \n1 Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income Per Diluted Share, Total Adjusted EBITDDA and Total Adjusted EBITDDA Margin are non-GAAP measures.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nGeneral\nPotlatchDeltic Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to in this report as the company, us, we or our) is a leading timberland Real\nEstate Investment Trust (REIT) with operations in nine states. We are engaged in activities associated with timberland management, including\nthe sale of timber, the ownership and management of over 2.1 million acres of timberlands and the purchase and sale of timberlands. We are\nalso engaged in the manufacturing and sale of wood products and the development of real estate. Our timberlands, real estate development\nprojects and all of our wood products facilities are located within the continental United States. The primary market for our products is the United\nStates. We converted to a REIT effective January 1, 2006.\nCondensed Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements provide an overall view of our results and financial condition and\nreflect all adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position, results of operations and\ncash flows for the interim periods presented. Except as otherwise disclosed in these Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements,\nsuch adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature. Intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation. The\nCondensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and\nExchange Commission pertaining to interim financial statements. Certain disclosures normally provided in accordance with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States (GAAP) have been omitted. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 15,\n2024. Results of operations for interim periods should not be regarded as necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full\nyear.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and\nrequires judgments affecting the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results may differ materially\nfrom our estimates.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nAt any given time, we are subject to claims and actions incidental to the operations of our business. Based on information currently available, we\ndo not expect that any sums we may have to pay in connection with any legal proceeding would have a material adverse effect on our\nconsolidated financial position or net cash flow. Additionally, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no\nsignificant changes to our obligation under the Thomson Reservoir Project. At September 30, 2024, we have $2.2 million accrued for our\nestimated remaining contribution to the project, all of which is included in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities in our Condensed\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. For further information on the project, refer to Note 18: Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-07, Segment Reporting\n(Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. ASU 2023-07 provides updates to qualitative and quantitative reportable\nsegment disclosure requirements, including enhanced disclosures about significant segment expense categories that are regularly reported to\nthe chief operating decision maker and included in each reported measure of a segment’s profit or loss and increased interim disclosure\nrequirements, among others. The adoption of this ASU on January 1, 2024, including the required retrospective application for all periods\npresented in the financial statements, will be reflected in our annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024, and interim\nfinancial statements beginning in 2025. The application of this new guidance is not expected to have an impact on the company’s consolidated\nfinancial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, as the guidance pertains to disclosure only.\nRecent Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. ASU 2023-09 provides\nqualitative and quantitative updates to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disclosures, among others, in order to enhance the\ntransparency of income tax disclosures, including consistent categories and greater disaggregated information in the rate reconciliation and\ndisaggregated by jurisdiction of income taxes paid. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, may be applied\nprospectively or retrospectively, and early adoption is permitted. Management is evaluating this ASU and currently does not expect it will have an\nimpact on the company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, as the guidance pertains to disclosure only.\n9\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 2. SEGMENT INFORMATION\nOur operations are organized into three reportable segments: Timberlands, Wood Products and Real Estate. Management activities in the\nTimberlands segment include planting and harvesting trees and building and maintaining roads. The Timberlands segment also generates\nrevenues from non-timber resources such as hunting leases, recreation permits and leases, mineral rights contracts and carbon sequestration.\nThe Wood Products segment manufactures and sells lumber and plywood. The Real Estate segment includes the sale of land holdings deemed\nnon-strategic or identified as having higher and better use alternatives, a master planned community development and a country club.\nOur Timberlands segment supplies our Wood Products segment with a portion of its wood fiber needs. These intersegment revenues are based\non prevailing market prices and typically represent a sizable portion of the Timberlands segment’s total revenues. Our other segments generally\ndo not generate intersegment revenues. These intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation.\nThe reportable segments follow the same accounting policies used for our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, with the exception of\nthe valuation of inventories, which are reported using the average cost method for purposes of reporting segment results.\nThe following table presents our revenues by major product:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nTimberlands\nNorthern region\nSawlogs $ 46,236 $ 48,538 $ 120,606 $ 138,685\nPulpwood 232 330 512 1,102\nOther 365 362 1,051 995\nTotal Northern revenues 46,833 49,230 122,169 140,782\nSouthern region\nSawlogs 31,711 31,863 97,236 91,419\nPulpwood 18,383 17,503 49,346 48,641\nStumpage 3,899 7,057 15,619 20,438\nOther 4,306 4,155 12,514 12,383\nTotal Southern revenues 58,299 60,578 174,715 172,881\nTotal Timberlands revenues 105,132 109,808 296,884 313,663\nWood Products\nLumber 107,473 132,852 345,084 379,939\nResiduals and Panels 31,939 32,256 96,505 105,633\nTotal Wood Products revenues 139,412 165,108 441,589 485,572\nReal Estate\nRural real estate 24,409 11,616 114,788 34,005\nDevelopment real estate 10,912 4,289 21,274 16,498\nOther 3,380 3,247 9,478 9,576\nTotal Real Estate revenues 38,701 19,152 145,540 60,079\nTotal segment revenues 283,245 294,068 884,013 859,314\nIntersegment Timberlands revenues1 (28,114) (28,559) (80,084) (89,736)\nOther intersegment revenues — — — (6)\nTotal consolidated revenues $ 255,131 $ 265,509 $ 803,929 $ 769,572\n1Intersegment revenues represent logs sold by our Timberlands segment to our Wood Products segment.\n10\nTable of Contents\nManagement uses Adjusted EBITDDA to evaluate the operating performance and effectiveness of operating strategies of our segments and\nallocation of resources to them. EBITDDA is calculated as net income (loss) before interest expense, net, income taxes, basis of real estate sold,\ndepreciation, depletion and amortization. Adjusted EBITDDA further excludes certain specific items that are considered to hinder comparison of\nthe performance of our businesses either year-on-year or with other businesses. Our calculation of Adjusted EBITDDA may not be comparable to\nthat reported by other companies.\nThe following table summarizes information for each of the company’s reportable segments and includes a reconciliation of Total Adjusted\nEBITDDA to income (loss) before income taxes. Corporate information is included to reconcile segment data to the Condensed Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nAdjusted EBITDDA:\nTimberlands $ 35,824 $ 42,062 $ 104,696 $ 118,017\nWood Products (9,581) 15,039 (16,525) 26,975\nReal Estate 31,861 14,165 127,657 45,867\nCorporate (12,203) (11,696) (36,624) (32,958)\nEliminations and adjustments 1 (3,292) (407) 1,599\nTotal Adjusted EBITDDA 45,902 56,278 178,797 159,500\nInterest expense, net1 (9,635) (7,971) (18,049) (15,783)\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization (25,487) (30,248) (85,150) (89,099)\nBasis of real estate sold (12,905) (6,109) (73,522) (21,624)\nCatchMark merger-related expenses — — — (2,453)\nGain on fire damage — 16,326 — 39,436\nNon-operating pension and other postretirement employee\nbenefits 200 (228) 602 (685)\nLoss on disposal of assets (338) (18) (267) (39)\nOther 1,516 370 1,348 638\nIncome (loss) before income taxes $ (747) $ 28,400 $ 3,759 $ 69,891\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization:\nTimberlands $ 16,778 $ 19,267 $ 51,193 $ 55,623\nWood Products 8,395 10,740 33,138 32,723\nReal Estate 138 120 412 397\nCorporate 176 121 407 356\n25,487 30,248 85,150 89,099\nBond discounts and deferred loan fees1 406 410 1,219 1,228\nTotal depreciation, depletion and amortization $ 25,893 $ 30,658 $ 86,369 $ 90,327\nBasis of real estate sold:\nReal Estate $ 12,908 $ 6,111 $ 73,530 $ 21,629\nEliminations and adjustments (3) (2) (8) (5)\nTotal basis of real estate sold $ 12,905 $ 6,109 $ 73,522 $ 21,624\n1Bond discounts and deferred loan fees are reported within interest expense, net on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n11\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 3. EARNINGS PER SHARE\nThe following table reconciles the number of shares used in calculating basic and diluted earnings per share:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nBasic weighted-average shares outstanding 79,173 80,132 79,494 80,102\nIncremental shares due to:\nPerformance shares 30 182 19 137\nRestricted stock units 74 65 50 40\nDiluted weighted-average shares outstanding 79,277 80,379 79,563 80,279\nFor stock-based awards, the dilutive effect is calculated using the treasury stock method. Under this method, the dilutive effect is computed as if\nthe awards were exercised at the beginning of the period (or at time of issuance, if later) and assumes the related proceeds were used to\nrepurchase common stock at the average market price during the period. Related proceeds include future compensation cost associated with the\nstock award.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were approximately 50,000 and 138,000 stock-based awards, respectively, that\nwere excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share as they were anti-dilutive. For the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2023, there were approximately 2,000 and 28,000 stock-based awards, respectively, that were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings\nper share as they were anti-dilutive. Anti-dilutive stock-based awards could be dilutive in future periods.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn August 31, 2022, our board of directors authorized management to repurchase up to $200.0 million of our common stock with no set time limit\nfor the repurchase (the 2022 Repurchase Program). Shares under the 2022 Repurchase Program may be repurchased in open market\ntransactions, including pursuant to trading plans adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (a Trading\nPlan), or through privately negotiated transactions. The timing, manner, price and amount of repurchases will be determined according to, and\nsubject to, the terms of a Trading Plan, and, subject to the terms of a Trading Plan, the 2022 Repurchase Program may be suspended,\nterminated or modified at any time for any reason.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 56,851 and 666,475 shares of our common stock, respectively,\nfor total consideration of $2.4 million and $27.4 million, respectively, under the 2022 Repurchase Plan. During the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, we repurchased 282,988 and 291,749 shares of our common stock, respectively, for total consideration of $12.7 million and\n$13.1 million, respectively, under the 2022 Repurchase Plan. At September 30, 2024, we had remaining authorization of $97.6 million for future\nstock repurchases under the 2022 Repurchase Program. Transaction costs are not counted against authorized funds.\nWe record share repurchases upon trade date as opposed to the settlement date. We record a liability to account for repurchases that have not\nbeen cash settled. We retire shares upon repurchase. Any excess repurchase price over par is recorded in accumulated deficit.\nNOTE 4.

Additionally, in January 2024, we acquired 16,000 acres of mature timberlands in Arkansas for $31.4 million, including\ntransaction costs. We funded the acquisition with cash on hand.\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities\n(in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nAccrued payroll and benefits $ 20,770 $ 24,473\nAccounts payable 18,527 12,521\nDeferred revenue1 14,084 10,455\nAccrued interest 6,625 8,344\nAccrued taxes 6,375 5,712\nOther current liabilities 23,909 20,878\nTotal accounts payable and accrued liabilities $ 90,290 $ 82,383\n1Deferred revenue predominately relates to hunting and other access rights on our timberlands, payments received for lumber shipments where control of goods has not\ntransferred, member-related activities at an owned country club and any post-close obligations for real estate sales. These deferred revenues are recognized over the term of the\nrespective contract, which is typically twelve months or less, except for country club initiation fees which are recognized over the average life of club membership.\nNOTE 5. DEBT\nTERM LOANS\nAt September 30, 2024, our total outstanding principal on our long-term debt of $1.0 billion included $971.0 million of term loans under our\nSecond Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement (Amended Term Loan Agreement) with our primary lender. Approximately $165.7 million\nof our outstanding long-term debt was classified as current at September 30, 2024 on our accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance\nSheets, including a $65.7 million revenue bond that matured in October 2024 and a $100.0 million term loan that matures in August 2025. Certain\nborrowings under the Amended Term Loan Agreement are at the one-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR)-indexed variable rates,\nplus an applicable margin between 1.61% and 2.30%. We have entered into SOFR-indexed interest rate swaps to fix the interest rate on these\nvariable rate term loans. See Note: 6 Derivative Instruments for additional information.\nOn November 1, 2024, we entered into a tenth amendment to the Amended Term Loan Agreement, which provided for a new 8-year term loan of\n$38.0 million maturing on November 1, 2032, a new 9-year term loan of $38.0 million maturing on November 1, 2033, and a new 10-year term\nloan of $100.0 million maturing on November 1, 2034 (collectively, the New Term Loans). The proceeds of the New Term Loans were used to\nrefinance a $110.0 million term loan under the Amended Term Loan agreement that matured on November 1, 2024, and to replenish cash used\nto repay the $65.7 million revenue bond that matured in October 2024.\nThe New Term Loans bear interest at a rate equal to daily simple SOFR plus an applicable margin ranging between 2.20% and 2.30% per annum\ndepending on their respective maturity date. The New Term Loans provide for a cost-of-capital reset at year five whereby the applicable margin\nmay be reset at the sole discretion of the lender. In connection with the New Term Loans, we terminated $125.0 million of our forward-starting\ninterest rate swaps and transferred the value realized from their termination into three new daily simple SOFR-indexed interest rate swaps to fix\nthe interest rates associated with the New Term Loans. See Note 6: Derivative Instruments for additional information.\nCREDIT AGREEMENT\nOn May 18, 2023, we entered into a First Amendment to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (Amended Credit Agreement). The\nAmended Credit Agreement provides for loans based on SOFR instead of the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, provides us the option\nto borrow based on a daily SOFR or term SOFR basis, and provides mechanics relating to the transition from the use of SOFR to a replacement\nbenchmark rate upon the occurrence of certain transition events.\n13\nTable of Contents\nThe Amended Credit Agreement provides for a $300.0 million revolving line of credit that matures February 14, 2027. As provided in the\nAmended Credit Agreement, borrowing capacity may be increased by up to an additional $500.0 million. The revolving line of credit also includes\na sublimit of $75.0 million for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a sublimit of $25.0 million for swing line loans. Usage under either or\nboth sub facilities reduces availability under the revolving line of credit. We may utilize borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement to,\namong other things, refinance existing indebtedness and provide funding for working capital requirements, capital projects, acquisitions and other\ngeneral corporate expenditures. At September 30, 2024, there were no borrowings under the revolving line of credit and approximately $0.6\nmillion of our revolving line of credit was utilized for outstanding letters of credit.\nWe were in compliance with all debt and credit agreement covenants at September 30, 2024.\nNOTE 6. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS\nFrom time to time, we enter into derivative financial instruments to manage certain cash flow and fair value risks. Derivatives designated and\nqualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in the cash flows of a specific asset or liability that is attributable to a particular risk, such as\ninterest rate risk, are considered cash flow hedges. All our cash flow hedges are expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting cash flows\nattributable to the hedged interest rate risk through the term of the hedges.\nAt September 30, 2024, we had interest rate swaps associated with $761.0 million of SOFR-indexed term loan debt. These cash flow hedges\nconvert variable rates ranging from one-month SOFR plus 1.61% to 2.30%, to fixed rates ranging from 2.14% to 4.83% before patronage credits\nfrom lenders. Additionally, at September 30, 2024, we had $200.0 million of forward-starting interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges\nfor expected future debt refinancings that require settlement on the stated maturity date.\nOn October 22, 2024, we terminated $125.0 million of the forward-starting interest rate swaps and transferred the value realized from their\ntermination into three new interest rate swaps to hedge the variability in future cash flows on the New Term Loans. These new daily simple\nSOFR-indexed interest rate swaps effectively fixed the interest rates associated with the New Term Loans between 4.02% and 4.28%, before\npatronage credits from lenders, depending on the maturity date of the associated term loan. Following these transactions, we had one remaining\nforward-starting interest rate swap of $75.0 million available to fix the interest rate on future debt refinancings. See Note 5: Debt for additional\ninformation.\nThe gross fair values of derivative instruments at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were $111.7 million and $129.1 million,\nrespectively, all of which were classified in Other assets, non-current on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Derivative instruments\nthat mature within one year, as a whole, are classified as current.\nThe following table details the effect of derivatives on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and the Condensed Consolidated\nStatements of Comprehensive Income (Loss):\nThree Months Ended September Nine Months Ended September\n30, 30,\n(in thousands) Location 2024 2023 2024 2023\nDerivatives designated in cash flow hedging relationships:\nInterest rate contracts\nIncome (loss) recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax $ (23,130) $ 33,607 $ 7,574 $ 42,353\nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to Interest\nincome, net of tax1 expense, net $ 5,583 $ 5,143 $ 16,751 $ 13,505\nInterest expense, net $ 9,635 $ 7,971 $ 18,049 $ 15,783\n1Realized gains and losses on interest rate contracts consist of realized net cash received or paid and interest accruals on the interest rate swaps during the periods in addition to\namortization of amounts out of other comprehensive income related to certain terminated hedges and adjustments to interest expense resulting from amortization of inception\nvalue of certain off-market designated hedges. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we amortized approximately $8.0 million and $7.7 million, respectively,\nof the off-market designated hedges which is included in Other, net within operating activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Net cash received or paid\nis included within Interest expense, net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nAt September 30, 2024, the amount of net gains expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next 12 months is approximately $12.3 million.\nHowever, this expected amount to be reclassified into earnings is subject to volatility as the ultimate amount recognized in earnings is based on\nthe SOFR rates at the time of net swap cash payments.\n14\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 7. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nThe following table presents the estimated fair values of our financial instruments:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nCarrying Fair Carrying Fair\n(in thousands) Amount Value Amount Value\nDerivative assets related to interest rate swaps (Level 2) $ 111,735 $ 111,735 $ 129,125 $ 129,125\nLong-term debt, including current portion (Level 2):\nTerm loans $ (970,407) $ (969,050) $ (969,919) $ (965,718)\nRevenue bonds (65,735) (65,735) (65,735) (64,786)\nTotal long-term debt1 $ (1,036,142) $ (1,034,785) $ (1,035,654) $ (1,030,504)\nCompany owned life insurance asset (COLI) (Level 3) $ 6,046 $ 6,046 $ 5,220 $ 5,220\n1The carrying amount of long-term debt includes principal and unamortized discounts.\nThe fair value of interest rate swaps is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis, based on third-party sources, on the expected cash\nflows of each derivative. The analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity and uses observable\nmarket-based inputs, including interest rate forward curves.\nThe fair value of our long-term debt is estimated based upon quoted market prices for similar debt issues or estimated based on average market\nprices for comparable debt when there is no quoted market price.\nThe contract value of our company owned life insurance is based on the amount at which it could be redeemed and, accordingly, approximates\nfair value.\nWe believe that our other financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, receivables and payables have net carrying\nvalues that approximate their fair values with only insignificant differences. This is primarily due to the short-term nature of these instruments.\nNOTE 8. EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION\nWe issue new shares of common stock to settle performance share awards (PSAs), restricted stock units (RSUs) and deferred compensation\nstock equivalent units. At September 30, 2024 approximately 1.5 million shares were available for future use under our long-term incentive plans.\nShare-based compensation activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included the following:\nGranted Vested Forfeited\nPerformance Share Awards (PSAs) 130,536 — 2,767\nRestricted Stock Units (RSUs) 121,726 45,014 1,657\nApproximately 0.1 million shares of common stock were issued to employees during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as a result of\nPSA and RSU vesting during 2023 and 2024.\nThe following table details compensation expense and the related income tax benefit for company specific equity-based awards:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nEquity-based compensation expense:\nPerformance share awards $ 1,635 $ 1,483 $ 4,628 $ 3,623\nRestricted stock units 1,260 1,084 3,691 2,702\nDeferred compensation stock equivalent units expense 51 49 149 147\nTotal equity-based compensation expense $ 2,946 $ 2,616 $ 8,468 $ 6,472\nTotal tax benefit recognized for equity-based expense $ 197 $ 135 $ 554 $ 394\n15\nTable of Contents\nPerformance Share Awards\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of PSAs granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was $52.92 per share. PSAs\ngranted under the stock incentive plans have a three-year performance period and shares are issued at the end of the period if the performance\nmeasures are met. The number of shares actually issued, as a percentage of the amount subject to the PSA, could range from 0% to 200%.\nPSAs granted under the stock incentive plans do not have voting rights unless and until shares are issued upon settlement. If shares are issued\nat the end of the performance measurement period, the recipients will receive dividend equivalents in the form of additional shares of common\nstock at the date of settlement equal to the dividends that would have been paid on the shares earned had the recipients owned the shares\nduring the three-year period. The share awards are not considered participating securities.\nThe following table presents the key inputs used in the Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the fair value of the performance share awards\ngranted in 2024:\nStock price as of valuation date $ 44.67\nRisk-free rate 4.20%\nExpected volatility 27.71%\nExpected dividend yield1 —\nExpected term (years) 3.00\n1Full dividend reinvestment assumed.\nRestricted Stock Units\nThe weighted-average fair value of all RSUs granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was $44.31 per share. The fair value of\nRSUs granted equaled our common share price on the date of grant factoring in any required post-vesting holding periods. The RSU awards\ngranted accrue dividend equivalents based on dividends paid during the RSU vesting period. Recipients will receive dividend equivalents in the\nform of additional shares of common stock at the date the vested RSUs are settled. Any forfeited RSUs will not receive dividends. The share\nawards are not considered participating securities.\nNOTE 9. INCOME TAXES\nAs a REIT, we generally are not subject to federal and state corporate income taxes on income from investments in real estate, including our\ntimberlands, that we distribute to our stockholders. We conduct certain activities through our PotlatchDeltic taxable REIT subsidiaries (each, a\nTRS) which are subject to corporate level federal and state income taxes. These activities are principally comprised of our wood products\nmanufacturing operations and certain real estate investments. Therefore, income tax expense or benefit is primarily due to pre-tax book income\nor loss of the TRS, as well as permanent book versus tax differences and discrete items.\nDuring the second quarter of 2023, we reduced our federal effected deferred blended state tax rate. This reduction was a result of changes in tax\nlaws enacted in the second quarter of 2023 in certain states in which our TRSs operate. The change resulted in a $1.0 million reduction to our\nnet deferred tax liability and an offsetting reduction to tax expense, all of which was recorded as a discrete item in the second quarter of 2023.\n16\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 10.

Investors should not interpret the disclosure of a risk to imply that the risk has not\nalready materialized. Forward-looking statements contained in this report present our views only as of the date of this report. Except as required\nunder applicable law, we do not intend to issue updates concerning any future revisions of our views to reflect events or circumstances occurring\nafter the date of this report.\nOur Company\nWe are a leading timberland REIT with ownership and management of over 2.1 million acres of timberland. We also own six sawmills and an\nindustrial grade plywood mill, a residential and commercial real estate development business and a rural timberland sales program. Our\noperations are organized into three business segments: Timberlands, Wood Products and Real Estate. Our Timberlands segment supplies our\nWood Products segment with a portion of its wood fiber needs. These intersegment revenues are based on prevailing market prices and typically\nrepresent a sizable portion of the Timberlands segment’s total revenues. Our other segments generally do not generate intersegment revenues.\nIn the discussion of our consolidated results of operations, our revenues and expenses are reported after elimination of intersegment revenues\nand expenses. In the Business Segment Results discussion below, each segment’s revenues and expenses, as applicable, are presented before\nelimination of intersegment revenues and expenses.\nOur business segments have been and will continue to be influenced by a variety of factors, including tariffs, quotas and trade agreements,\nchanges in timber prices and in harvest levels from our timberlands, competition, timberland valuations, demand for our non-strategic timberland\nfor higher and better use purposes, lumber and plywood prices, weather conditions, disruptions or inefficiencies in our supply chain including the\navailability of transportation, the efficiency and level of capacity utilization of our Wood Products manufacturing operations, changes in our\nprincipal expenses such as log costs, inflation, asset dispositions or acquisitions, impact of pandemics (such as COVID-19 and its variants), fires\nat our Wood Products facilities or on our timberlands, other natural disasters, government regulation and enforcement actions, and other factors.\nAdditionally, governments and businesses across the globe are taking action on climate change and are making significant commitments towards\nreducing greenhouse gas emissions to net zero. Achieving these commitments will require governments and companies to take major steps to\nmodify operations, invest in low-carbon activities and purchase offsets to reduce environmental impacts. We believe we are well positioned to\nprovide products and services that entities may utilize to achieve these commitments through natural climate solutions, including forest carbon\noffsets, carbon capture and storage projects, selling or leasing timberlands to third parties for renewable energy projects such as for solar power\ngeneration facilities, selling pulpwood and sawmill residuals for green energy production, and other emerging technologies that allows wood fiber\nto be used in applications ranging from biofuels to bioplastics.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nTo supplement our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we\npresent certain non-GAAP measures on a consolidated basis, including Total Adjusted EBITDDA and Cash Available for Distribution (CAD),\nwhich are defined and further explained and reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure in the Liquidity and Performance Measures section below.\nThe presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered only as supplemental to, and are not intended to be considered in\nisolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our definitions of these non-GAAP\nmeasures may differ from similarly titled measures and may not be comparable to other similarly titled non-GAAP measures presented by other\ncompanies due to potential inconsistencies in methods of calculation.\nSee Note 2: Segment Information in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to the use of\nAdjusted EBITDDA for our segments.\nBusiness and Economic Trends Affecting Our Operations\nThe operating results of our Timberlands, Wood Products and Real Estate business segments have been and will continue to be affected by the\ncyclical nature of the forest products industry. Log and pulpwood sales volumes in our Timberlands segment are typically lower in the first half of\neach year as winter rains in the Southern region and spring thaw in the Northern region limit timber harvesting operations due to softened\nroadbeds and wet logging conditions that restrict access to logging sites. The third quarter is typically our Timberlands segment's strongest\nproduction quarter. Demand for our manufactured wood products typically decreases in the winter months when construction activity is slower,\nwhile demand typically increases during the spring, summer and fall when construction activity is generally higher.\n20\nTable of Contents\nThe demand for timber is directly affected by the underlying demand for lumber and other wood products, as well as by the demand for pulp,\npaper and packaging. Our Timberlands and Wood Products segments are impacted by both demand for new homes and home improvement and\nrepair of existing homes in the United States. Our Timberlands segment is also influenced by the availability of harvestable timber. In general, our\nIdaho log market is typically in balance but can be tensioned from time to time, while Southern log markets generally have more available supply.\nRural real estate dispositions and acquisitions can also be adversely affected when access to any properties to be sold or considered for\nacquisition is limited due to adverse weather conditions. Development real estate sales occur throughout the year and depend on when our\ndevelopment of residential neighborhoods and commercial lots are substantially completed. The timing of these sales can also be impacted by\ncontractor availability to complete the necessary infrastructure and other improvements.\nInterest rates impact our business primarily through their effect on mortgage rates and the broader U.S. economy, and their influence on our\ncapital allocation activities. According to economic data from Freddie Mac, between the end of 2011 and the end of 2021, the average 30-year\nfixed mortgage rate, which is correlated with long-term interest rates, was below 4.0% before beginning to rise late in the first quarter of 2022,\npeaking at approximately 7.8% in October 2023, and ending 2023 at approximately 6.6%. The first half of 2024 continued to experience\nstubbornly high mortgage rates before easing modestly late in the third quarter of 2024 following the U.S. Federal Reserve's reduction of key\nbenchmark interest rates by 50 basis points in September 2024. Inflation, which continues to slow, unemployment rates and the overall condition\nof the economy are factors that can influence the U.S. Federal Reserve’s decision to adjust interest rates.\nSingle-family housing supply continues to remain well below the historical average as housing affordability remains a barrier to home ownership.\nIn October 2024, the U.S. Census Bureau reported total housing starts during the third quarter of 2024 averaged over 1.3 million on a seasonally-\nadjusted annual basis, which was slightly lower than the second quarter of 2024. While single-family housing starts averaged approximately\n963,000 units on a seasonally-adjusted annual basis during the third quarter of 2024, which was 4.1% lower than the second quarter of 2024,\nsingle-family housing starts on a seasonally-adjusted annual basis averaged just over 1.0 million units for August and September of 2024.\nAdditionally, authorized building permits for single-family housing averaged nearly 960,000 units on a seasonally-adjusted annual basis during\nthe third quarter of 2024, which was on par with the second quarter of 2024.\nThe National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI) published in September 2024 reported that builders'\nconfidence for newly built single-family homes was 41 that month, up from 37 in December 2023. This broke a string of four consecutive monthly\ndeclines. Even though there is increased builder confidence for new construction, builders continue to face several supply-side challenges,\nincluding a scarcity of buildable lots and skilled labor, along with higher material costs that continue to increase the cost of building homes.\nOverall, we continue to believe long-term underlying housing fundamentals remain favorable due to an undersupply of homes, lower than\nhistorical-average existing inventory for sale, and a large millennial demographic in their prime home-buying years. We believe these\nfundamentals will become more favorable if the Federal Reserve reduces its key benchmark interest rates, and those rate reductions have the\neffect of reducing mortgage rates.\nThe repair and remodel sector is the largest market segment for lumber demand. Near term headwinds on the repair and remodel market appear\nto have been driven by elevated interest rates, which raise the cost of discretionary projects, coupled with the low turnover of existing homes,\nwhich typically spurs repair and remodel activity. While spending in the sector for residential home remodeling has moderated, we believe future\ninterest rate reductions along with long-term favorable underlying fundamentals, including solid household balance sheets, strong levels of home\nequity, an aging existing housing stock, and expected increases in sales of existing homes will stimulate repair and remodel demand for our\nproducts.\nIn our Timberlands segment, a significant portion of our Idaho sawlog prices are indexed on a one-month lag to lumber prices. The Northern\nregion experienced a decline in sawlog prices during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, primarily because of lower\nindexed lumber prices. In the Southern region, sawlog and pulpwood prices remained relatively stable. Our total harvest volume of over 1.9\nmillion tons in the third quarter of 2024 was slightly lower than the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to decreased stumpage sales in the South.\nWe expect to harvest between 1.8 and 1.9 million tons during the fourth quarter of 2024, with approximately 81% of the volume in the Southern\nregion.\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, we completed the construction phase of the expansion and modernization of our Waldo, Arkansas sawmill (the\nWaldo Modernization Project). The Waldo Modernization Project included upgrades to the log yard and planer, a new saw line, and a new\ncontinuous dry kiln and is expected to increase the sawmill’s annual capacity and reduce its operating costs significantly. The sawmill, which\ncontinued to operate during the construction, took limited downtime early in the third quarter to tie in the new equipment and restarted in mid-\nAugust 2024. We anticipate it will take between 6 and 12 months to reach the sawmill's expected new capacity of 275 million board feet per year.\nIn our Wood Products segment, lumber markets remained tepid during the third quarter of 2024, leading to continued pricing pressure. We\nshipped 267 million board feet of lumber during the third quarter of 2024 which was lower than the third quarter of 2023 primarily as a result of\nthe planned downtime and restart at our Waldo, Arkansas sawmill during the third quarter of\n21\nTable of Contents\n2024. We expect to ship between 275 and 285 million board feet of lumber during the fourth quarter of 2024, which takes into account the\nexpected production ramp-up at the Waldo sawmill.\nOur Real Estate segment benefited from increased rural real estate acres sold and increased residential lot sales in Chenal Valley during the\nthird quarter of 2024. We expect to sell approximately 5,500 rural acres and 40 residential lots in Chenal Valley during the fourth quarter of 2024.\nConsolidated Results\nThe following table sets forth changes in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

These decreases were partially offset by increased rural acres and residential lots sold, and a higher average price per residential\nlot in Chenal Valley due to a greater mix of premium lots sold during the third quarter of 2024.\nCost of goods sold\nCost of goods sold increased $1.3 million compared with the third quarter of 2023 mainly due to increased rural real estate acres and\nresidential lots sold, and increased log and haul costs associated with higher harvest activity. These increases were partially offset by\nlower raw material, production, and shipping costs primarily at our Waldo, Arkansas sawmill due to its planned downtime early in the third\nquarter of 2024 and restart in mid-August following the completion of the construction phase of the expansion and modernization project.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $1.1 million compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to professional\nservice fees, including costs for implementation of new systems, and employee-related costs.\nGain on fire damage\nDuring the third quarter of 2023, we recognized insurance recoveries of $16.3 million for fire damage at our Ola, Arkansas sawmill. The\nclaim with insurance carriers was finalized by the end of 2023.\n22\nTable of Contents\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense, net increased $1.7 million compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to less interest income earned on lower\naverage cash and cash equivalents held in interest bearing accounts.\nIncome taxes\nIncome taxes are primarily due to income or loss from our PotlatchDeltic taxable REIT subsidiaries (TRS). For the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, we recorded an income tax benefit of $4.1 million on TRS loss before tax of $15.6 million. For the three months\nended September 30, 2023, we recorded income tax expense of $4.7 million on TRS income before tax of $18.4 million, which included\nthe $16.3 million gain on fire damage.\nTotal Adjusted EBITDDA\nTotal Adjusted EBITDDA for the third quarter of 2024 decreased $10.4 million compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to lower\nlumber prices, lower lumber shipments, lower Northern sawlog prices and increased logging and hauling costs driven by increased harvest\nactivity. The decrease in Total Adjusted EBITDDA was partially offset by increased rural acres and residential lots sold at a higher average\nprice per residential lot in Chenal Valley. Refer to the Business Segment Results below for further discussions on activities for each of our\nsegments. See Liquidity and Performance Measures for a reconciliation of Total Adjusted EBITDDA to net income (loss), the closest\ncomparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods presented.\nYear to Date 2024 Compared with Year to Date 2023\nRevenues\nRevenues were $803.9 million, an increase of $34.4 million compared with the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to increased rural\nreal estate acres sold, including the 34,100-acre rural timberland sale for $56.7 million in the second quarter of 2024, increased lumber\nshipments, increased Southern harvest volumes, and higher residential price per lot in Chenal Valley. These increases were partially offset\nby lower lumber prices and a decrease in Northern harvest volumes and sawlog prices.\nCost of goods sold\nCost of goods sold increased $56.5 million compared with the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to increased rural real estate acres\nsold. These increases were partially offset by lower logging and hauling costs primarily due to lower Northern harvest volume, which more\nthan offset an increase in the South due to higher harvest volumes.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $6.8 million compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to employee-\nrelated costs and professional service fees, including costs for implementation of new systems. Additionally, the prior year included a $1.0\nmillion reduction in stock compensation expense due to forfeiture of a former employee’s stock awards.\nGain on fire damage\nDuring the first nine months of 2023, we recognized insurance recoveries of $39.4 million for fire damage at our Ola, Arkansas sawmill.\nThe claim with insurance carriers was finalized by the end of 2023.\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense, net increased $2.3 million compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to less interest income earned on\nlower average cash and cash equivalents held in interest bearing accounts.\nIncome taxes\nIncome taxes are primarily due to income or loss from our PotlatchDeltic TRS. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we\nrecorded an income tax benefit of $12.9 million on TRS loss before tax of $51.1 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023,\nwe recorded income tax expense of $7.7 million on TRS income before tax of $33.8 million, which included the $39.4 million gain on fire\ndamage. Income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 also included an approximate $1.0 million tax benefit from the\nreduction of our blended deferred tax rate during the second quarter of 2023.\n23\nTable of Contents\nTotal Adjusted EBITDDA\nTotal Adjusted EBITDDA for the first nine months of 2024 increased $19.3 million compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily due\nto increased rural real estate acres sold and increased average price per residential lot in Chenal Valley. The increase in Total Adjusted\nEBITDDA was partially offset by lower lumber prices, lower Northern sawlog harvest volumes and prices, and higher selling, general and\nadministrative expenses.

Southern sawlog prices remained relatively stable.\n• Harvest Volume: Total Northern harvest volume increased 11.3% primarily due to more favorable operating conditions in the first\nquarter of 2023 allowing us to accelerate harvesting earlier in 2023 than in 2024. Total Southern harvest volume decreased\napproximately 5.8% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to fewer stumpage sales.\n• Logging and Hauling Cost per Unit: Logging and hauling costs per delivered unit were lower primarily due to decreased fuel\ncosts.\nYear to Date 2024 Compared with Year to Date 2023\nTimberlands Adjusted EBITDDA for the first nine months of 2024 decreased $13.3 million compared with the first nine months of 2023 primarily\nas a result of the following:\n• Sales Price and Mix: Sawlog prices in the Northern region decreased 8.4% to $109 per ton primarily due to the effect of lower\nindexed sawlog prices in Idaho. Southern sawlog prices remained relatively stable.\n• Harvest Volume: We harvested 4.6 million tons in the Southern region during the first nine months of 2024, which was 2.6% higher\nthan the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to more favorable operating conditions during 2024 partially offset by fewer\nstumpage sales. In the Northern region, operating conditions were less favorable in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to\nthe first nine months of 2023, resulting in a 5.7% decrease in harvest volume.\n• Logging and Hauling Cost per Unit: Logging and hauling costs per delivered unit were lower due to a lower mix of Northern\nharvest volume and decreased fuel costs.\n25\nTable of Contents\nWood Products Segment\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nRevenues $ 139,412 $ 165,108 $ (25,696) $ 441,589 $ 485,572 $ (43,983)\nCosts and expenses1\nFiber costs 67,552 72,273 (4,721) 216,595 225,393 (8,798)\nFreight, logging and hauling 17,314 20,199 (2,885) 55,805 59,843 (4,038)\nManufacturing costs 58,025 54,537 3,488 175,845 163,787 12,058\nFinished goods inventory change 2,883 (690) 3,573 (1,061) (633) (428)\nSelling, general and\nadministrative expenses 3,127 3,674 (547) 10,656 9,954 702\nOther 92 76 16 274 253 21\nWood Products Adjusted EBITDDA2 $ (9,581) $ 15,039 $ (24,620) $ (16,525) $ 26,975 $ (43,500)\n1Prior to elimination of intersegment fiber costs of $28.1 million and $28.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and $80.1 million and $89.7 million for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n2Management uses Adjusted EBITDDA to evaluate the performance of the segment.

Rural\nreal estate sales in the third quarter of 2024 included a 1,200-acre sale in Idaho for approximately $3,400 per acre. Rural real estate\nsales can vary quarter-to-quarter with the average price per acre fluctuating based on both the geographic area of the real estate\nand product mix.\n• Development Sales: During the third quarter of 2024, we sold 53 residential lots at an average lot price of $204,851 compared to\n32 lots at an average lot price of $89,122 during the third quarter of 2023. The increase in average lot price was primarily due to a\nhigher mix of premium residential lot closings in the third quarter of 2024. The average price per residential lot fluctuates based on a\nvariety of factors including size, location, and planned end use within the developments. We had no commercial lot sales in Chenal\nValley during the third quarter of 2024 compared to one sale for $1.4 million, or $972,222 per acre, during the third quarter of 2023.\nYear to Date 2024 Compared with Year to Date 2023\nReal Estate Adjusted EBITDDA for the first nine months of 2024 increased $81.8 million compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily as a\nresult of the following:\n• Rural Sales: Rural real estate sales in the first nine months of 2024 included a 34,100-acre sale of four-year average age Southern\ntimberlands to FIA for $56.7 million, a 2,000-acre conservation sale in Arkansas, and a 1,200-acre sale in Idaho. The first nine\nmonths of 2023 included a 2,240-acre conservation sale in Alabama and a 2,700-acre sale in Georgia.\n• Development Sales: During the first nine months of 2024, we sold 90 residential lots at an average lot price of $168,850 compared\nto 98 lots at an average lot price of $103,526 during the first nine months of 2023. In addition, we sold 12 acres of commercial land\nin Chenal Valley for an average price of $492,746 per acre during the first nine months of 2024 compared to 7 acres of commercial\nland for an average price of $848,828 per acre during the first nine months of 2023.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash generated by our operations is highly dependent on the selling prices and volumes of our products and can vary from period to period.\nChanges in significant sources and uses of cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are presented by category as follows:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 Change\nNet cash from operating activities $ 143,062 $ 117,308 $ 25,754\nNet cash from investing activities $ (82,085) $ (27,422) $ (54,663)\nNet cash from financing activities $ (137,534) $ (121,601) $ (15,933)\nNet Cash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash from operating activities increased $25.8 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily as a\nresult of the following:\n• Cash received from customers increased $34.6 million primarily due to increased rural real estate acres sold, including the 34,100-\nacre sale to FIA, higher average lot prices in Chenal Valley, and higher Southern harvest volumes. These increases were partially\noffset by lower lumber and Northern sawlog prices, and lower Northern harvest volumes.\n• Cash payments decreased $13.5 million primarily due to lower Northern logging and hauling costs, and lower employee incentive\ncompensation payouts. These declines were partially offset by costs associated with higher Southern harvest volumes.\n• During the first nine months of 2024, we received the final $1.7 million of insurance proceeds related to business interruption\ninsurance following the fire at our Ola, Arkansas sawmill in June 2021 compared to $21.8 million received during the first nine months\nof 2023.\n28\nTable of Contents\n• Cash paid for interest, net increased by approximately $6.9 million primarily due to lower interest income earned as a result of lower\naverage cash balances in interest bearing accounts partially offset by increased patronage dividends from our lenders. Additionally,\ncash from operating activities for first nine months of 2024 includes reclassification of $22.5 million received from interest rate swaps\nthat contain an other-than-insignificant financing element at inception as investing ($20.9 million) and financing ($1.6 million) activities.\nCash from operating activities for first nine months of 2023 includes reclassification of $18.7 million received from interest rate swaps\nthat contain an other-than-insignificant financing element at inception as investing ($17.3 million) and financing ($1.4 million) activities.\n• Cash contributions to our pension and other postretirement employee benefit plans increased $5.1 million, primarily due to a $4.0\nmillion contribution to our qualified pension plan.\n• Net tax payments decreased $13.0 million due to lower taxable income generated from our TRS operations in 2024.\nNet Cash Flows from Investing Activities\nChanges in cash flows from investing activities were primarily a result of the following:\n• Cash expenditures for property, plant and equipment, timberlands reforestation and road construction projects during the first nine\nmonths of 2024 and 2023 were $71.5 million and $45.1 million, respectively, which includes capital expenditures for the Waldo,\nArkansas sawmill expansion and modernization project of $38.0 million and $14.8 million, respectively.\n• Cash expenditures for timberland acquisitions during the first nine months of 2024 was approximately $32.3 million which included the\nacquisition of 16,000 acres of mature timberlands in Arkansas. Cash expenditures for timberland acquisitions during the first nine\nmonths of 2023 was $1.7 million.\n• We received $20.9 million during the first nine months of 2024 compared to $17.3 million during the first nine months of 2023 from\ncertain interest rate swaps that contained an other-than-insignificant financing element at inception, which are required to be classified\nin investing activities. Cash flows from these above-market interest rate swaps reduce our interest costs on the corresponding variable\nrate debt.\nNet Cash Flows from Financing Activities\nChanges in cash flows from financing activities were primarily a result of the following:\n• During the first nine months of 2024, we repurchased 666,472 shares of our common stock totaling $27.4 million, compared to the\nfirst nine months of 2023 where we repurchased 291,749 shares of our common stock totaling $13.1 million, including $1.7 million\nof repurchases that were not settled in cash until the fourth quarter of 2023.\n• Dividend payments of $106.9 million during the first nine months of 2024 compared to $107.9 million during the first nine months of\n2023 due to fewer shares outstanding following share repurchases.\nFuture Sources and Uses of Cash\nAt September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $161.1 million. We expect cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash generated\nfrom our operating activities, and available borrowing capacity under our Credit Agreement, if needed, to be adequate to meet our future cash\nrequirements. At September 30, 2024, there were no significant changes in our cash commitments arising in the normal course of business under\nour known contractual and other obligations as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. See Term\nLoans, Credit Agreement and Interest Rate Swap Agreements below for more information on significant sources and uses of cash subsequent to\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nCapital Expenditures\nWe invest cash in maintenance and discretionary capital expenditures at our Wood Products facilities. We also invest cash in the reforestation of\ntimberlands and construction of roads in our Timberlands operations and to develop land in our Real Estate development operations. We\nevaluate discretionary capital improvements based on an expected level of return on investment. We expect to spend a total of approximately\n$100 million to $110 million for capital expenditures during 2024, including capital expenditures for the Waldo Modernization Project.\n29\nTable of Contents\nThe Waldo Modernization Project includes upgrades to the log yard and planer, a new saw line, a new continuous dry kiln and other\nimprovements which are expected to increase the sawmill’s annual capacity from 190 million board feet of dimensional lumber to approximately\n275 million board feet. The existing sawmill continued to operate before taking limited downtime to tie in the new equipment in July 2024.\nFollowing the restart of the sawmill in mid-August 2024, we anticipate it will take between 6 and 12 months to reach the sawmill's expected new\ncapacity of 275 million board feet per year. We expect to spend approximately $131.0 million on the modernization project, of which a total of\n$124.4 million has been spent through September 30, 2024, and the remaining $6.6 million is expected to be spent during the fourth quarter of\n2024.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn August 31, 2022, our board of directors authorized management to repurchase up to $200.0 million of our common stock with no set time limit\nfor the repurchase (the 2022 Repurchase Program). Shares under the 2022 Repurchase Program may be repurchased in open market\ntransactions, including pursuant to trading plans adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (a Trading\nPlan), or through privately negotiated transactions. At September 30, 2024, we had remaining authorization of $97.6 million for future stock\nrepurchases under the 2022 Repurchase Program. The timing, manner, price and amount of repurchases will be determined according to a\nTrading Plan, and, subject to the terms of a Trading Plan, the Repurchase Program may be suspended, terminated or modified at any time for\nany reason.\nTerm Loans, Credit Agreement, and Interest Rate Swap Agreements\nAt September 30, 2024, our total outstanding principal on our long-term debt of $1.0 billion included $971.0 million of term loans under our\nSecond Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement (Amended Term Loan Agreement) with our primary lender. Approximately $165.7 million\nof our outstanding long-term debt was classified as current at September 30, 2024 on our accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance\nSheets, including a $65.7 million revenue bond that matured in October 2024 and a $100.0 million term loan that matures in August 2025. Certain\nborrowings under the Amended Term Loan Agreement are at the one-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR)-indexed variable rates,\nplus a spread between 1.61% and 2.30%. We have entered into SOFR-indexed interest rate swaps to fix the interest rate on these variable rate\nterm loans.\nOn November 1, 2024, we entered into a tenth amendment to the Amended Term Loan Agreement, which provided for three new term loans\ntotaling $176.0 million that mature on November 1, 2032, 2033, and 2034, respectively (collectively referred to as the New Term Loans). The\nproceeds of the New Term Loans were used to refinance a $110.0 million term loan that matured on November 1, 2024 and to replenish cash\nused to repay the $65.7 million revenue bond that matured in October 2024. The New Term Loans bear interest at a rate equal to daily simple\nSOFR plus an applicable margin ranging between 2.20% and 2.30% per annum depending on the term loan's maturity date. The New Term\nLoans provide for a cost-of-capital reset at year five whereby the applicable margin may be reset at the sole discretion of the lender. As a result of\nthe tenth amendment to the Amended Term Loan Agreement, at November 1, 2024, we had approximately $1.0 billion drawn under the\nagreement with our primary lender.\nIn connection with the refinancing, we terminated $125.0 million of our $200.0 million forward-starting interest rate swaps and transferred the\nvalue realized from their termination into three new interest rate swaps to hedge the variability in future cash flows on the New Term Loans.\nThese three new daily simple SOFR-indexed interest rate swaps effectively fix the interest rates on the New Term Loans between 4.02% and\n4.28%, before patronage credits from lenders, depending on the maturity date of the associated term loan. Following these transactions, we had\none remaining forward-starting interest rate swap of $75.0 million available to fix the interest rate on future debt refinancings.\nWe have a $300.0 million revolving line of credit with a syndicate of lenders, that matures February 14, 2027 (Amended Credit Agreement).\nUnder the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement, the amount of available principal may be increased up to an additional $500.0 million. We\nmay also utilize borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement to, among other things, refinance existing indebtedness and provide funding\nfor working capital requirements, capital projects, acquisitions, and other general corporate expenditures. At September 30, 2024, there were no\nborrowings under the revolving line of credit and approximately $0.6 million of the credit facility was utilized by outstanding letters of credit.\nSee Note 5: Debt and Note 6: Derivative Instruments in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information\non our debt, credit, and interest rate swap agreements.\nFinancial Covenants\nThe Amended Term Loan Agreement and Amended Credit Agreement (collectively referred to as the Financing Agreements) contain certain\ncovenants that limit our ability and that of our subsidiaries to create liens, merge or consolidate, dispose of assets, incur indebtedness and\nguarantees, repurchase or redeem capital stock and indebtedness, make certain investments or acquisitions, enter into certain transactions with\naffiliates or change the nature of our business. The Financing Agreements also contain financial maintenance covenants including the\nmaintenance of a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio as defined in the Financing Agreements. We are permitted to\npay dividends to our stockholders under the terms of the Financing Agreements so long as we expect to remain in compliance with the financial\nmaintenance covenants.\n30\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents the components and applicable limits of Total Asset Value (TAV), a component of the Leverage Ratio, at September\n30, 2024:\n(in thousands)\nEstimated timberland fair value $ 5,220,752\nWood Products manufacturing facilities book basis (limited to 10% of TAV) 381,358\nCash and cash equivalents 161,131\nOther1 10,424\nTotal Asset Value $ 5,773,665\n1Includes, as applicable, Company Owned Life Insurance (limited to 5% of TAV), Construction in Progress (limited to 10% of TAV) and Investments in Affiliates (limited to 15% of\nTAV) as defined in the Financing Agreements.\nAt September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Financing Agreements.

There have been no changes in our credit rating during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024. In May 2024, Moody's revised their outlook on the company to negative from stable.\nCapital Structure\n(in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nLong-term debt (including current portion) $ 1,034,599 $ 1,033,728\nCash and cash equivalents (161,131) (230,118)\nNet debt 873,468 803,610\nMarket capitalization1 3,552,733 3,896,822\nEnterprise value $ 4,426,201 $ 4,700,432\nNet debt to enterprise value 19.7% 17.1%\nDividend yield2 4.0% 3.7%\nWeighted-average cost of debt, after tax3 2.3% 2.3%\n1Market capitalization is based on outstanding shares of 78.9 million and 79.4 million times closing share prices of $45.05 and $49.10 at September 30, 2024 and December 29,\n2023, respectively.\n2Dividend yield is based on annualized dividends per share of $1.80 and share prices of $45.05 and $49.10 at September 30, 2024 and December 29, 2023, respectively.\n3Weighted-average cost of debt excludes deferred debt costs and credit facility fees and includes estimated annual patronage credit on term loan debt.\nLiquidity and Performance Measures\nThe discussion below is presented to enhance the reader’s understanding of our operating performance, ability to generate cash and satisfy\nrating agency and creditor requirements. This information includes two measures: Total Adjusted EBITDDA and Cash Available for Distribution\n(CAD). These measures are not defined by GAAP and the discussion of Total Adjusted EBITDDA and CAD is not intended to conflict with or\nchange any of the GAAP disclosures described herein. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered only as supplemental to, and\nare not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nAdditionally, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to other similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures\npresented by other companies due to potential inconsistencies in methods of calculation.\n31\nTable of Contents\nTotal Adjusted EBITDDA is a non-GAAP measure that management uses in evaluating performance and to allocate resources between\nsegments. Total Adjusted EBITDDA removes the impact of specific items that management believes do not directly reflect the core business\noperations on an ongoing basis. Management believes that this non-GAAP measure, when read in conjunction with our GAAP financial\nstatements, provides useful information to investors and other interested parties by facilitating the comparability of our ongoing operating results\nover the periods presented and the identification of trends in our underlying business. It also can be used to evaluate the operational\nperformance of the assets under management and to compare our operating results against analyst financial models and against the operating\nresults of other public companies that supplement their GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe define EBITDDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, net, income taxes, basis of real estate sold, depreciation, depletion and\namortization. Adjusted EBITDDA further excludes certain specific items that are considered to hinder comparison of the performance of our\nbusinesses either year-on-year or with other businesses.\nWe reconcile Total Adjusted EBITDDA to net income (loss) for the consolidated company as it is the most comparable GAAP measure.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Total Adjusted EBITDDA for the respective periods:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet income $ 3,309 $ 23,675 $ 16,682 $ 62,241\nInterest expense, net 9,635 7,971 18,049 15,783\nIncome taxes (4,056) 4,725 (12,923) 7,650\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization 25,487 30,248 85,150 89,099\nBasis of real estate sold 12,905 6,109 73,522 21,624\nCatchMark merger-related expenses — — — 2,453\nGain on fire damage — (16,326) — (39,436)\nNon-operating pension and other postretirement\nemployee benefits (200) 228 (602) 685\nLoss on disposal of assets 338 18 267 39\nOther (1,516) (370) (1,348) (638)\nTotal Adjusted EBITDDA $ 45,902 $ 56,278 $ 178,797 $ 159,500\nWe define CAD as cash from operating activities adjusted for capital spending for purchases of property, plant and equipment, timberlands\nreforestation and roads and timberland acquisitions not classified as strategic. Management believes CAD is a useful indicator of the company’s\noverall liquidity, as it provides a measure of cash generated that is available for dividends to common stockholders (an important factor in\nmaintaining our REIT status), repurchase of the company’s common shares, debt repayment, acquisitions and other discretionary and\nnondiscretionary activities. Our definition of CAD is limited in that it does not solely represent residual cash flows available for discretionary\nexpenditures since the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations. Therefore, we believe\nit is important to view CAD as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Our\ndefinition of CAD may be different from similarly titled measures reported by other companies, including those in our industry. CAD is not\nnecessarily indicative of the CAD that may be generated in future periods.\n32\nTable of Contents\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash from operating activities to CAD:\nNine Months Ended September 30, Twelve Months Ended September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet cash from operating activities1, 2 $ 143,062 $ 117,308 $ 184,865 $ 150,772\nCapital expenditures3 (103,771) (46,757) (178,627) (79,260)\nCAD $ 39,291 $ 70,551 $ 6,238 $ 71,512\nNet cash from investing activities4 $ (82,085) $ (27,422) $ (149,967) $ (47,147)\nNet cash from financing activities $ (137,534) $ (121,601) $ (187,643) $ (284,438)\n1Net cash from operating activities for the nine and twelve months ended September 30, 2024, includes cash paid for real estate development expenditures of $5.3 million and\n$7.0 million, respectively. Net cash from operating activities for the nine and twelve months ended September 30, 2023, includes cash paid for real estate development\nexpenditures of $7.2 million and $8.4 million, respectively, and CatchMark merger-related expenses of $0.9 million and $6.6 million, respectively.\n2Net cash from operating activities for the nine and twelve months ended September 30, 2024, excludes $22.5 million and $29.5 million, respectively, of interest rate swap\nproceeds classified as investing and financing activities. Net cash from operating activities for the nine and twelve months ended September 30, 2023, excludes $18.7 million\nand $22.0 million, respectively, of interest rate swap proceeds classified as investing and financing activities.\n3The nine and twelve months ended September 30, 2024, includes capital expenditures of $38.0 million and $97.4 million, respectively, related to the Waldo Modernization\nProject. The nine and twelve months ended September 30, 2023, includes capital expenditures of $14.8 million related to the Waldo Modernization Project. Additionally, the nine\nand twelve months ended September 30, 2023 include fire-related capital expenditures for the Ola, Arkansas sawmill of $0.6 and $6.4 million, respectively, and excludes $1.4\nmillion and $10.1 million, respectively, of insurance proceeds for the Ola, Arkansas sawmill property losses. The claim with insurance carriers was finalized by the end of 2023.\n4Net cash from investing activities includes payment for capital expenditures and acquisition of non-strategic timber and timberlands, which is also included in our reconciliation of\nCAD.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThere have been no significant changes during 2024 to our critical accounting policies or estimates as presented in our 2023 Annual Report on\nForm 10-K.\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nOur market risk exposure on financial instruments includes interest rate risk on our bank credit facility, term loans and interest rate swap\nagreements and forward starting interest rate swap agreements. We are exposed to interest rate volatility on existing variable rate debt\ninstruments and future incurrences of fixed or variable rate debt, which exposure primarily relates to movements in various interest rates. We use\ninterest rate swaps and forward starting swaps to hedge our exposure to the impact of interest rate changes on existing debt and future debt\nissuances, respectively. All market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than for trading purposes.\nFor quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, of our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our exposures to market risk have not changed materially since December\n31, 2023.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe conducted an evaluation (pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act)), under the supervision and\nwith the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), of the effectiveness of our\ndisclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. These disclosure controls\nand procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports that are filed or submitted under the Exchange Act\nis recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and\nforms. Our disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that this information is\naccumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar\nfunctions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on the evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded\nthat these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024.\nThere are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error\nand the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only\nprovide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.\n33\nTable of Contents\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we implemented new enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems which replaced certain legacy\nsystems in which a significant portion of our business transactions originated, were processed, or were recorded. As a result, we have made\ncorresponding changes to our business processes and information systems, updating applicable internal controls over financial reporting where\nnecessary. Our new ERP systems are intended to provide us with enhanced transactional processing, security and management tools and are\nintended to enhance internal controls over financial reporting.\nThere have been no other changes that occurred in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30,\n2024, as defined in the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial\nreporting.\nPart II – OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nWe believe there is no pending or threatened litigation that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, operations or liquidity.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe do not believe there have been any material changes in the risk factors previously disclosed in Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nOn August 31, 2022, our board of directors authorized management to repurchase up to $200.0 million of our common stock with no set time limit\nfor the repurchase (the 2022 Repurchase Program). Shares under the 2022 Repurchase Program may be repurchased in open market\ntransactions, including pursuant to a trading plan adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the\nExchange Act), or through privately negotiated transactions. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased shares\nthrough a trading plan adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act.\nThe following table provides information with respect to purchases of common stock made by the company during the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024:\nTotal Number of Shares Purchased Maximum Dollar Value of Shares\nTotal Number of Average Price Paid as Part of Publicly Announced that May Yet Be Purchased\nCommon Share Purchases Shares Purchased Per Share Plans or Programs Under the Plans or Programs\nJuly 1 - July 31 — $ — — $ 100,000,080\nAugust 1 - August 31 — $ — — $ 100,000,080\nSeptember 1 - September 30 56,851 $ 42.20 56,851 $ 97,600,781\nTotal 56,851 $ 42.20 56,851 $ 97,600,781\nAt September 30, 2024, we had remaining authorization of $97.6 million for future stock repurchases under the 2022 Repurchase Program.

For purposes of determining whether you would receive a greater after-tax benefit from the Capped\nPayments than from receipt of the full amount of the Payments and for purposes of Section 11(c) below (if applicable), you shall be deemed to\npay federal, state and local taxes at the highest marginal rate of taxation for the applicable calendar year.\n(b)All computations and determinations called for by Sections 11(a) and 11(b) shall be made and reported in writing to the Company\nand you by a third-party service provider selected by the Company (the “Tax Advisor”), and all such computations and determinations shall be\nconclusive and binding on the Company and you.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any such reduction shall\nbe structured in a manner intended to comply with Section 409A.\n12.
