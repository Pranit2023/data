Reports 2024 Third Quarter Results\n\nCompany Release - 10/30/2024\n\nDownload the PDF version PDF Format (opens in new window)\n\nPEMBROKE, Bermuda--(BUSINESS WIRE)--  Arch Capital Group Ltd. (NASDAQ: ACGL; “Arch,” “our” or “the Company”) announces its 2024 third quarter results. The results included: \n\n  * Net income available to Arch common shareholders of $978 million, or $2.56 per share, representing a 19.0% annualized net income return on average common equity, compared to net income available to Arch common shareholders of $713 million, or $1.88 per share, for the 2023 third quarter. \n  * After-tax operating income available to Arch common shareholders (1)  of $762 million, or $1.99 per share, representing a 14.8% annualized operating return on average common equity (1) , compared to $876 million, or $2.31 per share, for the 2023 third quarter. \n  * Pre-tax current accident year catastrophic losses for the Company’s insurance and reinsurance segments, net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums, of $450 million, due in part to Hurricane Helene and a series of other global events. \n  * Favorable development in prior year loss reserves, net of related adjustments, of $119 million. \n  * Combined ratio excluding catastrophic activity and prior year development (1) of 78.3%, compared to 77.0% for the 2023 third quarter. \n  * Book value per common share of $57.00 at September 30, 2024, an 8.1% increase from June 30, 2024. \n\n\n\nNicolas Papadopoulo, Chief Executive Officer of ACGL commented: “Our third quarter results demonstrate the value of our diversified platform with excellent bottom-line contributions from all our units.

For additional details regarding the Company’s reportable segments, please refer to the Company’s Financial Supplement dated September 30, 2024. The Company’s segment information includes the use of underwriting income (loss) and a combined ratio excluding catastrophic activity and prior year development (see ‘Comments on Non-GAAP Financial Measures’ for further details). \n\n**_Insurance Segment_ **\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n---  \n(U.S. Dollars in millions)  |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **% Change**  \nGross premiums written  |  $  |  2,341  |  $  |  2,043  |  14.6   \nNet premiums written  |  1,820  |  1,522  |  19.6   \nNet premiums earned  |  1,765  |  1,412  |  25.0   \nUnderwriting income  |  $  |  120  |  $  |  129  |  (7.0)   \n**Underwriting Ratios** |  **% Point Change**  \nLoss ratio  |  61.6%  |  57.5%  |  4.1   \nUnderwriting expense ratio  |  31.5%  |  33.4%  |  (1.9)   \nCombined ratio  |  93.1%  |  90.9%  |  2.2   \nCatastrophic activity and prior year development:   \nCurrent accident year catastrophic events, net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums  |  4.9%  |  2.6%  |  2.3   \nNet (favorable) adverse development in prior year loss reserves, net of related adjustments  |  (0.7)%  |  (0.8)%  |  0.1   \nCombined ratio excluding catastrophic activity and prior year development  |  88.9%  |  89.1%  |  (0.2)   \n  \nOn August 1, 2024, the insurance segment completed the acquisition of the U.S. MidCorp and Entertainment insurance businesses from Allianz (“MCE Acquisition”). As such, the insurance segment’s 2024 third quarter results include two months of activity related to the acquired business. \n\nGross premiums written by the insurance segment in the 2024 third quarter were 14.6% higher than in the 2023 third quarter (4.4% excluding the MCE Acquisition), while net premiums written were 19.6% higher than in the 2023 third quarter (5.8% excluding the MCE Acquisition). Growth in net premiums written included the impact of the MCE Acquisition and also reflected an increase in other liability—occurrence due, in part, to new business opportunities and rate changes. Net premiums earned in the 2024 third quarter were 25.0% higher than in the 2023 third quarter (8.8% excluding the MCE Acquisition), and reflect changes in net premiums written over the previous five quarters. \n\nThe 2024 third quarter loss ratio reflected 4.9 points of current year catastrophic activity, primarily related to Hurricane Helene, compared to 2.6 points of catastrophic activity in the 2023 third quarter. Estimated net favorable development of prior year loss reserves, before related adjustments, reduced the loss ratio by 0.9 points in the 2024 third quarter, compared to 0.7 points in the 2023 third quarter. \n\nThe underwriting expense ratio was 31.5% in the 2024 third quarter, compared to 33.4% in the 2023 third quarter. The impact of the MCE Acquisition lowered the underwriting expense ratio by approximately 2.5 points, primarily due to the effects of the fair value estimation of the assets acquired at closing, including the non-recognition of deferred acquisition costs. The value of policies in force at closing are considered within the value of business acquired which is amortized through amortization of intangibles. The underwriting expense ratio also benefited from an initial lower level of operating expenses in the acquired business. \n\n**_Reinsurance Segment_ **\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n---  \n(U.S. Dollars in millions)  |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **% Change**  \nGross premiums written  |  $  |  2,763  |  $  |  2,138  |  29.2   \nNet premiums written  |  1,945  |  1,562  |  24.5   \nNet premiums earned  |  1,892  |  1,543  |  22.6   \nOther underwriting income  |  2  |  2  |  —   \nUnderwriting income  |  $  |  149  |  $  |  310  |  (51.9)   \n**Underwriting Ratios** |  **% Point Change**  \nLoss ratio  |  69.6%  |  56.4%  |  13.2   \nUnderwriting expense ratio  |  22.7%  |  23.6%  |  (0.9)   \nCombined ratio  |  92.3%  |  80.0%  |  12.3   \nCatastrophic activity and prior year development:   \nCurrent accident year catastrophic events, net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums  |  19.3%  |  9.3%  |  10.0   \nNet (favorable) adverse development in prior year loss reserves, net of related adjustments  |  (1.9)%  |  (2.8)%  |  0.9   \nCombined ratio excluding catastrophic activity and prior year development  |  74.9%  |  73.5%  |  1.4   \n  \nGross premiums written by the reinsurance segment in the 2024 third quarter were 29.2% higher than in the 2023 third quarter, while net premiums written were 24.5% higher than in the 2023 third quarter. The growth in net premiums written reflected increases in most lines of business, due in part to rate increases, new business opportunities and growth in existing accounts. Net premiums earned in the 2024 third quarter were 22.6% higher than in the 2023 third quarter, and reflect changes in net premiums written over the previous five quarters. \n\nThe 2024 third quarter loss ratio reflected 21.3 points of current year catastrophic activity, related to Hurricane Helene and a series of other global events, compared to 9.7 points of catastrophic activity in the 2023 third quarter. Estimated net favorable development of prior year loss reserves, before related adjustments, reduced the loss ratio by 2.2 points in the 2024 third quarter, compared to 2.8 points in the 2023 third quarter. The balance of the change in the loss ratio resulted, in part, from the impact of rate increases, higher level of attritional losses and changes in the mix of business. \n\nThe underwriting expense ratio was 22.7% in the 2024 third quarter, compared to 23.6% in the 2023 third quarter. The decrease primarily reflected growth in net premiums earned. \n\n**_Mortgage Segment_ **\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n---  \n(U.S. Dollars in millions)  |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **% Change**  \nGross premiums written  |  $  |  339  |  $  |  347  |  (2.3)   \nNet premiums written  |  282  |  271  |  4.1   \nNet premiums earned  |  313  |  293  |  6.8   \nOther underwriting income  |  3  |  3  |  —   \nUnderwriting income  |  $  |  269  |  $  |  282  |  (4.6)   \n**Underwriting Ratios** |  **% Point Change**  \nLoss ratio  |  (0.4)%  |  (12.1)%  |  11.7   \nUnderwriting expense ratio  |  15.2%  |  16.8%  |  (1.6)   \nCombined ratio  |  14.8%  |  4.7%  |  10.1   \nPrior year development:   \nNet (favorable) adverse development in prior year loss reserves, net of related adjustments  |  (22.8)%  |  (33.5)%  |  10.7   \nCombined ratio excluding prior year development  |  37.6%  |  38.2%  |  (0.6)   \n  \nGross premiums written by the mortgage segment in the 2024 third quarter were 2.3% lower than in the 2023 third quarter, while net premiums written were 4.1% higher. The increase in net premiums written and earned in the 2024 third quarter primarily reflected a lower level of Bellemeade premiums ceded, due in part to the termination of certain Bellemeade agreements in the 2023 fourth quarter. \n\nEstimated net favorable development of prior year loss reserves, before related adjustments, decreased the loss ratio by 20.5 points, compared to 31.4 points in the 2023 third quarter. Such amounts were primarily related to better than expected cure rates. The 2024 third quarter loss ratio, excluding net favorable development, was slightly higher than in the 2023 third quarter, primarily due to higher new delinquencies in the period. \n\nThe underwriting expense ratio was 15.2% in the 2024 third quarter, compared to 16.8% in the 2023 third quarter. The decrease was primarily due to higher level of ceding and profit commissions on U.S. primary business, along with a higher level of net premiums earned. \n\n**_Corporate_ **\n\nThe Company’s results include net investment income, net realized gains or losses (which includes realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of equity securities and assets accounted for using the fair value option, realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments, changes in the allowance for credit losses on financial assets and gains and losses realized from the acquisition or disposition of subsidiaries), equity in net income or loss of investment funds accounted for using the equity method, other income (loss), corporate expenses, transaction costs and other, amortization of intangible assets, interest expense, net foreign exchange gains or losses, income tax items, income or loss from operating affiliates and items related to the Company’s non-cumulative preferred shares. \n\nInvestment returns were as follows: \n\n(U.S. Dollars in millions, except per share data)  |  **Three Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n**September 30,** |  **June 30,** |  **September 30,**  \n**2024** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nPre-tax net investment income  |  $  |  399  |  $  |  364  |  $  |  269   \n_Per share_ |  _$_ |  _1.04_ |  _$_ |  _0.95_ |  _$_ |  _0.71_  \nEquity in net income (loss) of investment funds accounted for using the equity method  |  $  |  171  |  $  |  167  |  $  |  59   \n_Per share_ |  _$_ |  _0.45_ |  _$_ |  _0.44_ |  _$_ |  _0.16_  \nPre-tax investment income yield, at amortized cost (1)  |  4.40%  |  4.39%  |  3.68%   \nTotal return on investments (2)  |  3.97%  |  1.33%  |  (0.40)%   \n(1)  |  Presented on an annualized basis and excluding the impact of investments for which returns are not included within investment income, such as investments accounted for using the equity method and certain equities.   \n---|---  \n(2)  |  See ‘Comments on Non-GAAP Financial Measures’ for further details.   \n  \nThe growth in net investment income in the 2024 third quarter primarily reflected the effects of sustained higher interest rates available in the market, along with growth in invested assets due in part to strong operating cash flows and inflows related to the MCE Acquisition. Net realized gains were $169 million for the 2024 third quarter, compared to net realized losses of $248 million in the 2023 third quarter, and reflected sales of investments as well as the impact of financial market movements on the Company’s derivatives, equity securities and investments accounted for under the fair value option method. \n\nAmortization of intangible assets for the 2024 third quarter was $88 million, compared to $24 million for the 2023 third quarter. The higher level of expense for the 2024 third quarter reflects the amortization of intangible assets included in the MCE Acquisition, including intangible assets related to value of business acquired and distribution relationships. \n\nTransaction costs and other were $30 million for the 2024 third quarter. Transaction costs and other primarily included integration, advisory, financing, legal and other transaction costs related to the MCE Acquisition. \n\nOn a pre-tax basis, net foreign exchange losses for the 2024 third quarter were $63 million, compared to net foreign exchange gains of $22 million for the 2023 third quarter. For both periods, such amounts were primarily unrealized and resulted from the effects of revaluing the Company’s net insurance liabilities required to be settled in foreign currencies at each balance sheet date. Changes in the value of available-for-sale investments held in foreign currencies due to foreign currency rate movements are reflected as a direct increase or decrease to shareholders’ equity and are not included in the consolidated statements of income. \n\nThe Company’s effective tax rate on income before income taxes (based on the Company’s estimated annual effective tax rate) was 9.0% for the 2024 third quarter, compared to 9.1% for the 2023 third quarter. The Company’s effective tax rate on pre-tax operating income available to Arch common shareholders was 8.0% for the 2024 third quarter, consistent with 8.0% for the 2023 third quarter. The effective tax rate may fluctuate from period to period based upon the relative mix of income or loss reported by jurisdiction, the level of catastrophic loss activity incurred, and the varying tax rates in each jurisdiction. \n\nIncome from operating affiliates for the 2024 third quarter was $36 million, or $0.09 per share, compared to $54 million, or $0.14 per share, for the 2023 third quarter, and primarily reflects amounts related to the Company’s investment in Somers Group Holdings Ltd. and Coface SA. \n\n** Conference Call **\n\nThe Company will hold a conference call for investors and analysts at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time on October 31, 2024. A live webcast of this call will be available via the Investors section of the Company’s website at [http://www.archgroup.com/investors](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.archgroup.com%2Finvestors&esheet=54144880&newsitemid=20241030073497&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.archgroup.com%2Finvestors&index=1&md5=ce9013530ee2bdc5a8ede4d3516d908a). A recording of the webcast will be available in the Investors section of the Company’s website approximately two hours after the event concludes and will be archived on the site for one year. \n\nPlease refer to the Company’s Financial Supplement dated September 30, 2024, which is available via the Investors section of the Company’s website at [http://www.archgroup.com/investors](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.archgroup.com%2Finvestors&esheet=54144880&newsitemid=20241030073497&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.archgroup.com%2Finvestors&index=2&md5=af80f248fbfe3a696e1362a9b44aae7c). The Financial Supplement provides additional detail regarding the financial performance of the Company. From time to time, the Company posts additional financial information and presentations to its website, including information with respect to its subsidiaries. Investors and other recipients of this information are encouraged to check the Company’s website regularly for additional information regarding the Company. \n\nArch Capital Group Ltd., is a publicly listed Bermuda exempted company with approximately $25.0 billion in capital at September 30, 2024. Arch, which is part of the S&P 500 index, provides insurance, reinsurance and mortgage insurance on a worldwide basis through its wholly owned subsidiaries. \n\n** Comments on Non-GAAP Financial Measures **\n\nThroughout this release, the Company presents its operations in the way it believes will be the most meaningful and useful to investors, analysts, rating agencies and others who use the Company’s financial information in evaluating the performance of the Company and that investors and such other persons benefit from having a consistent basis for comparison between quarters and for comparison with other companies within the industry. These measures may not, however, be comparable to similarly titled measures used by companies outside of the insurance industry. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the Company’s overall financial performance. \n\nThis presentation includes the use of “after-tax operating income or loss available to Arch common shareholders,” which is defined as net income available to Arch common shareholders, excluding net realized gains or losses (which includes realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of equity securities and assets accounted for using the fair value option, realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments, changes in the allowance for credit losses on financial assets and gains and losses realized from the acquisition or disposition of subsidiaries), equity in net income or loss of investment funds accounted for using the equity method, net foreign exchange gains or losses, transaction costs and other, net of income taxes and the use of annualized operating return on average common equity. The presentation of after-tax operating income available to Arch common shareholders and annualized operating return on average common equity are non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G. The reconciliation of such measures to net income available to Arch common shareholders and annualized net income return on average common equity (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures) in accordance with Regulation G is included on page 2 of this release. \n\nThe Company believes that net realized gains or losses, equity in net income or loss of investment funds accounted for using the equity method, net foreign exchange gains or losses and transaction costs and other, in any particular period are not indicative of the performance of, or trends in, the Company’s business performance. Although net realized gains or losses, equity in net income or loss of investment funds accounted for using the equity method and net foreign exchange gains or losses are an integral part of the Company’s operations, the decision to realize these items are independent of the insurance underwriting process and result, in large part, from general economic and financial market conditions. Furthermore, certain users of the Company’s financial information believe that, for many companies, the timing of the realization of investment gains or losses is largely opportunistic. In addition, changes in the allowance for credit losses and net impairment losses recognized in earnings on the Company’s investments represent other-than-temporary declines in expected recovery values on securities without actual realization. \n\nThe use of the equity method on certain of the Company’s investments in certain funds that invest in fixed maturity securities is driven by the ownership structure of such funds (either limited partnerships or limited liability companies). In applying the equity method, these investments are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently adjusted based on the Company’s proportionate share of the net income or loss of the funds (which include changes in the fair value of the underlying securities in the funds). This method of accounting is different from the way the Company accounts for its other fixed maturity securities and the timing of the recognition of equity in net income or loss of investment funds accounted for using the equity method may differ from gains or losses in the future upon sale or maturity of such investments. \n\nTransaction costs and other include integration, advisory, financing, legal, severance, incentive compensation and all other costs directly related to acquisitions. The Company believes that transaction costs and other, due to their non-recurring nature, are not indicative of the performance of, or trends in, the Company’s business performance. \n\nIn the 2023 fourth quarter, the Company established a net deferred tax benefit of $1.18 billion consistent with the transition provisions specified in the Bermuda Corporate Income Tax Act of 2023. Due to the non-recurring nature of this one-time item, the Company believes that excluding this item from after-tax operating income or loss available to common shareholders provides the user with a better evaluation of the Company’s ongoing business performance. \n\nThe Company believes that showing net income available to Arch common shareholders exclusive of the items referred to above reflects the underlying fundamentals of the Company’s business since the Company evaluates the performance of and manages its business to produce an underwriting profit. In addition to presenting net income available to Arch common shareholders, the Company believes that this presentation enables investors and other users of the Company’s financial information to analyze the Company’s performance in a manner similar to how the Company’s management analyzes performance. The Company also believes that this measure follows industry practice and, therefore, allows the users of the Company’s financial information to compare the Company’s performance with its industry peer group. The Company believes that the equity analysts and certain rating agencies that follow the Company and the insurance industry as a whole generally exclude these items from their analyses for the same reasons. \n\nThe Company’s segment information includes the presentation of consolidated underwriting income or loss and a subtotal of underwriting income or loss. Such measures represent the pre-tax profitability of its underwriting operations and include net premiums earned plus other underwriting income, less losses and loss adjustment expenses, acquisition expenses and other operating expenses. Other operating expenses include those operating expenses that are incremental and/or directly attributable to the Company’s individual underwriting operations. Underwriting income or loss does not include certain income and expense items which are included in corporate. While these measures are presented in the Segment Information footnote to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, they are considered non-GAAP financial measures when presented elsewhere on a consolidated basis. The reconciliations of underwriting income or loss to income before income taxes (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure) on a consolidated basis, in accordance with Regulation G, is shown on the following pages. \n\nManagement measures segment performance for its three underwriting segments based on underwriting income or loss. The Company does not manage its assets by underwriting segment and, accordingly, investment income, income from operating affiliates and other items are not allocated to each underwriting segment. \n\nIn addition, the Company’s segment information includes the use of a combined ratio excluding catastrophic activity and prior year development, for the insurance and reinsurance segments, and a combined ratio excluding prior year development, for the mortgage segment. These ratios are non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G. The reconciliation of such measures to the combined ratio (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure) in accordance with Regulation G are shown on the individual segment pages. The Company’s management utilizes the adjusted combined ratios excluding current accident year catastrophic events and favorable or adverse development in prior year loss reserves in its analysis of the underwriting performance of each of its underwriting segments. \n\nTotal return on investments includes investment income, equity in net income or loss of investment funds accounted for using the equity method, net realized gains and losses (excluding changes in the allowance for credit losses on non-investment related financial assets) and the change in unrealized gains and losses generated by Arch’s investment portfolio. Total return is calculated on a pre-tax basis and before investment expenses and reflects the effect of financial market conditions along with foreign currency fluctuations. Management uses total return on investments as a key measure of the return generated to Arch common shareholders, and compares the return generated by the Company’s investment portfolio against benchmark returns during the periods presented. \n\nThe following tables summarize the Company’s results by segment for the 2024 third quarter and 2023 third quarter and a reconciliation of underwriting income or loss to income or loss before income taxes and net income or loss available to Arch common shareholders: \n\n(U.S. Dollars in millions)  |  **Three Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n**September 30, 2024**  \n**Insurance** |  **Reinsurance** |  **Mortgage** |  **Total**  \nGross premiums written (1)  |  $  |  2,341  |  $  |  2,763  |  $  |  339  |  $  |  5,440   \nPremiums ceded (1)  |  (521)  |  (818)  |  (57)  |  (1,393)   \nNet premiums written  |  1,820  |  1,945  |  282  |  4,047   \nChange in unearned premiums  |  (55)  |  (53)  |  31  |  (77)   \nNet premiums earned  |  1,765  |  1,892  |  313  |  3,970   \nOther underwriting income (loss)  |  —  |  2  |  3  |  5   \nLosses and loss adjustment expenses  |  (1,087)  |  (1,317)  |  1  |  (2,403)   \nAcquisition expenses  |  (308)  |  (374)  |  1  |  (681)   \nOther operating expenses  |  (250)  |  (54)  |  (49)  |  (353)   \n**Underwriting income (loss)** |  $  |  120  |  $  |  149  |  $  |  269  |  538   \nNet investment income  |  399   \nNet realized gains (losses)  |  169   \nEquity in net income (loss) of investment funds accounted for using the equity method  |  171   \nOther income (loss)  |  8   \nCorporate expenses (2)  |  (19)   \nTransaction costs and other (2)  |  (30)   \nAmortization of intangible assets  |  (88)   \nInterest expense  |  (35)   \nNet foreign exchange gains (losses)  |  (63)   \n**Income (loss) before income taxes and income (loss) from operating affiliates** |  1,050   \nIncome tax benefit (expense)  |  (98)   \nIncome (loss) from operating affiliates  |  36   \n**Net income (loss) available to Arch** |  988   \nPreferred dividends  |  (10)   \n**Net income (loss) available to Arch common shareholders** |  $  |  978   \n**Underwriting Ratios**  \nLoss ratio  |  61.6%  |  69.6%  |  (0.4)%  |  60.5%   \nAcquisition expense ratio  |  17.4%  |  19.8%  |  (0.4)%  |  17.2%   \nOther operating expense ratio  |  14.1%  |  2.9%  |  15.6%  |  8.9%   \nCombined ratio  |  93.1%  |  92.3%  |  14.8%  |  86.6%   \nNet premiums written to gross premiums written  |  77.7%  |  70.4%  |  83.2%  |  74.4%   \n(1)  |  Certain assumed and ceded amounts related to intersegment transactions are included in individual segment results.

We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight\nBoard (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S.\nfederal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the\naudits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement,\nwhether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material\nrespects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement\nof the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.\nSuch procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated\nfinancial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by\nmanagement, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal\ncontrol over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the\nrisk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based\non the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the\ncircumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures\nthat (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and\ndispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and\nexpenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the\ncompany; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nARCH CAPITAL 97 2023 FORM 10-K\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial\nstatements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or\ndisclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or\ncomplex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate\nopinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nValuation of Reserve for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nAs described in Notes 3, 5 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses\nrepresents estimates of future amounts required to pay losses and loss adjustment expenses for insured or reinsured events\nwhich have occurred at or before the balance sheet date. As of December 31, 2023, the Company’s total reserve for losses and\nloss adjustment expenses was $22.8 billion. For the insurance and reinsurance segments, management estimates ultimate losses\nand loss adjustment expenses using various generally accepted actuarial methods applied to known losses and other relevant\ninformation. Ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses are generally determined by extrapolation of claim emergence and\nsettlement patterns observed in the past that can reasonably be expected to persist into the future. Management makes a number\nof key assumptions in their reserving process, including estimating loss development patterns and expected loss ratios. For the\nmortgage segment, the lead actuarial methodology used by management is a frequency-severity method based on the inventory\nof pending delinquencies. The assumptions of frequency and severity reflect judgments based on historical data and experience.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of the reserve for losses\nand loss adjustment expenses is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing their\nestimate, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence\nrelating to the aforementioned key actuarial methods and key assumptions, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of\nprofessionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall\nopinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the\nvaluation of the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses, including controls over the selection of key actuarial methods\nand development of key assumptions. These procedures also included, among others, the involvement of professionals with\nspecialized skill and knowledge to assist in performing one or a combination of procedures, including (i) developing an\nindependent estimate, on a test basis, of the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses, and comparing the independent\nestimate to management’s actuarially determined reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses to evaluate the reasonableness\nof the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses and (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the actuarial methods and\nreasonableness of the assumptions related to loss development patterns, expected loss ratios, frequency, and severity used by\nmanagement to determine the Company’s reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses. Developing the independent estimate\nand evaluating the appropriateness of the key methods and reasonableness of the key assumptions related to loss development\npatterns, expected loss ratios, frequency and severity, as applicable, involved testing the completeness and accuracy of\nhistorical data provided by management.\nARCH CAPITAL 98 2023 FORM 10-K\nMeasurement of Deferred Tax Assets related to Certain Identifiable Intangible Assets in Bermuda Entities\nAs described in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, as of December 31, 2023, the Company recognized $1.2\nbillion in net deferred tax assets related to the Bermuda government’s enactment of the Bermuda Corporate Income Tax Act\n2023. As disclosed by management, the enacted legislation includes a provision referred to as the Economic Transition\nAdjustment, which requires Bermuda entities to establish tax basis in their assets and liabilities, excluding goodwill, based on\nfair value as of September 30, 2023. The most significant deferred tax assets recognized relates to identifiable intangible assets.\nManagement estimated the fair value of the identifiable intangible assets using discounted cash flow models. The significant\nassumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow models included the future revenue and profits expected to be generated by the\nidentifiable intangible assets and the discount rates.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the measurement of deferred tax\nassets related to certain identifiable intangible assets in Bermuda entities is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment\nby management when developing the fair value estimate of certain identifiable intangible assets, (ii) a high degree of auditor\njudgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to the\nfuture revenue and profits expected to be generated by the certain identifiable intangible assets and the discount rates, and (iii)\nthe audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall\nopinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the\nenactment of the Bermuda Corporate Income Tax Act 2023 including controls over the valuation of certain identifiable\nintangible assets related to the enactment of the Bermuda Corporate Income Tax Act 2023. These procedures also included,\namong others, (i) testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimate of the certain identifiable intangible\nassets, (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow models used by management, (iii) testing the\ncompleteness and accuracy of the data used in the models, and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions\nused by management related to the future revenue and profits expected to be generated by the certain identifiable intangible\nassets and the discount rates. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to the future revenue and profits expected to be\ngenerated by the identifiable intangible assets involved evaluating whether the assumptions used were reasonable considering\n(i) the consistency with historical revenue and profits generated by the Bermuda entities and (ii) whether the assumptions were\nconsistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to\nassist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow models and (ii) the reasonableness of the discount rate\nassumptions.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 23, 2024\nWe have served as the Company’s or its predecessor’s auditor since 1995.\nARCH CAPITAL 99 2023 FORM 10-K\nARCH CAPITAL GROUP LTD.

(NASDAQ: ACGL; “Arch,” “our” or “the Company”) announces its 2024 third quarter results. The results included: \n\n  * Net income available to Arch common shareholders of $978 million, or $2.56 per share, representing a 19.0% annualized net income return on average common equity, compared to net income available to Arch common shareholders of $713 million, or $1.88 per share, for the 2023 third quarter. \n  * After-tax operating income available to Arch common shareholders (1)  of $762 million, or $1.99 per share, representing a 14.8% annualized operating return on average common equity (1) , compared to $876 million, or $2.31 per share, for the 2023 third quarter. \n  * Pre-tax current accident year catastrophic losses for the Company’s insurance and reinsurance segments, net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums, of $450 million, due in part to Hurricane Helene and a series of other global events. \n  * Favorable development in prior year loss reserves, net of related adjustments, of $119 million. \n  * Combined ratio excluding catastrophic activity and prior year development (1) of 78.3%, compared to 77.0% for the 2023 third quarter. \n  * Book value per common share of $57.00 at September 30, 2024, an 8.1% increase from June 30, 2024. \n\n\n\nNicolas Papadopoulo, Chief Executive Officer of ACGL commented: “Our third quarter results demonstrate the value of our diversified platform with excellent bottom-line contributions from all our units.

For additional details regarding the Company’s reportable segments, please refer to the Company’s Financial Supplement dated September 30, 2024. The Company’s segment information includes the use of underwriting income (loss) and a combined ratio excluding catastrophic activity and prior year development (see ‘Comments on Non-GAAP Financial Measures’ for further details). \n\n**_Insurance Segment_ **\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n---  \n(U.S. Dollars in millions)  |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **% Change**  \nGross premiums written  |  $  |  2,341  |  $  |  2,043  |  14.6   \nNet premiums written  |  1,820  |  1,522  |  19.6   \nNet premiums earned  |  1,765  |  1,412  |  25.0   \nUnderwriting income  |  $  |  120  |  $  |  129  |  (7.0)   \n**Underwriting Ratios** |  **% Point Change**  \nLoss ratio  |  61.6%  |  57.5%  |  4.1   \nUnderwriting expense ratio  |  31.5%  |  33.4%  |  (1.9)   \nCombined ratio  |  93.1%  |  90.9%  |  2.2   \nCatastrophic activity and prior year development:   \nCurrent accident year catastrophic events, net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums  |  4.9%  |  2.6%  |  2.3   \nNet (favorable) adverse development in prior year loss reserves, net of related adjustments  |  (0.7)%  |  (0.8)%  |  0.1   \nCombined ratio excluding catastrophic activity and prior year development  |  88.9%  |  89.1%  |  (0.2)   \n  \nOn August 1, 2024, the insurance segment completed the acquisition of the U.S. MidCorp and Entertainment insurance businesses from Allianz (“MCE Acquisition”). As such, the insurance segment’s 2024 third quarter results include two months of activity related to the acquired business. \n\nGross premiums written by the insurance segment in the 2024 third quarter were 14.6% higher than in the 2023 third quarter (4.4% excluding the MCE Acquisition), while net premiums written were 19.6% higher than in the 2023 third quarter (5.8% excluding the MCE Acquisition). Growth in net premiums written included the impact of the MCE Acquisition and also reflected an increase in other liability—occurrence due, in part, to new business opportunities and rate changes. Net premiums earned in the 2024 third quarter were 25.0% higher than in the 2023 third quarter (8.8% excluding the MCE Acquisition), and reflect changes in net premiums written over the previous five quarters. \n\nThe 2024 third quarter loss ratio reflected 4.9 points of current year catastrophic activity, primarily related to Hurricane Helene, compared to 2.6 points of catastrophic activity in the 2023 third quarter. Estimated net favorable development of prior year loss reserves, before related adjustments, reduced the loss ratio by 0.9 points in the 2024 third quarter, compared to 0.7 points in the 2023 third quarter. \n\nThe underwriting expense ratio was 31.5% in the 2024 third quarter, compared to 33.4% in the 2023 third quarter. The impact of the MCE Acquisition lowered the underwriting expense ratio by approximately 2.5 points, primarily due to the effects of the fair value estimation of the assets acquired at closing, including the non-recognition of deferred acquisition costs. The value of policies in force at closing are considered within the value of business acquired which is amortized through amortization of intangibles. The underwriting expense ratio also benefited from an initial lower level of operating expenses in the acquired business. \n\n**_Reinsurance Segment_ **\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n---  \n(U.S. Dollars in millions)  |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **% Change**  \nGross premiums written  |  $  |  2,763  |  $  |  2,138  |  29.2   \nNet premiums written  |  1,945  |  1,562  |  24.5   \nNet premiums earned  |  1,892  |  1,543  |  22.6   \nOther underwriting income  |  2  |  2  |  —   \nUnderwriting income  |  $  |  149  |  $  |  310  |  (51.9)   \n**Underwriting Ratios** |  **% Point Change**  \nLoss ratio  |  69.6%  |  56.4%  |  13.2   \nUnderwriting expense ratio  |  22.7%  |  23.6%  |  (0.9)   \nCombined ratio  |  92.3%  |  80.0%  |  12.3   \nCatastrophic activity and prior year development:   \nCurrent accident year catastrophic events, net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums  |  19.3%  |  9.3%  |  10.0   \nNet (favorable) adverse development in prior year loss reserves, net of related adjustments  |  (1.9)%  |  (2.8)%  |  0.9   \nCombined ratio excluding catastrophic activity and prior year development  |  74.9%  |  73.5%  |  1.4   \n  \nGross premiums written by the reinsurance segment in the 2024 third quarter were 29.2% higher than in the 2023 third quarter, while net premiums written were 24.5% higher than in the 2023 third quarter. The growth in net premiums written reflected increases in most lines of business, due in part to rate increases, new business opportunities and growth in existing accounts. Net premiums earned in the 2024 third quarter were 22.6% higher than in the 2023 third quarter, and reflect changes in net premiums written over the previous five quarters. \n\nThe 2024 third quarter loss ratio reflected 21.3 points of current year catastrophic activity, related to Hurricane Helene and a series of other global events, compared to 9.7 points of catastrophic activity in the 2023 third quarter. Estimated net favorable development of prior year loss reserves, before related adjustments, reduced the loss ratio by 2.2 points in the 2024 third quarter, compared to 2.8 points in the 2023 third quarter. The balance of the change in the loss ratio resulted, in part, from the impact of rate increases, higher level of attritional losses and changes in the mix of business. \n\nThe underwriting expense ratio was 22.7% in the 2024 third quarter, compared to 23.6% in the 2023 third quarter. The decrease primarily reflected growth in net premiums earned. \n\n**_Mortgage Segment_ **\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n---  \n(U.S. Dollars in millions)  |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **% Change**  \nGross premiums written  |  $  |  339  |  $  |  347  |  (2.3)   \nNet premiums written  |  282  |  271  |  4.1   \nNet premiums earned  |  313  |  293  |  6.8   \nOther underwriting income  |  3  |  3  |  —   \nUnderwriting income  |  $  |  269  |  $  |  282  |  (4.6)   \n**Underwriting Ratios** |  **% Point Change**  \nLoss ratio  |  (0.4)%  |  (12.1)%  |  11.7   \nUnderwriting expense ratio  |  15.2%  |  16.8%  |  (1.6)   \nCombined ratio  |  14.8%  |  4.7%  |  10.1   \nPrior year development:   \nNet (favorable) adverse development in prior year loss reserves, net of related adjustments  |  (22.8)%  |  (33.5)%  |  10.7   \nCombined ratio excluding prior year development  |  37.6%  |  38.2%  |  (0.6)   \n  \nGross premiums written by the mortgage segment in the 2024 third quarter were 2.3% lower than in the 2023 third quarter, while net premiums written were 4.1% higher. The increase in net premiums written and earned in the 2024 third quarter primarily reflected a lower level of Bellemeade premiums ceded, due in part to the termination of certain Bellemeade agreements in the 2023 fourth quarter. \n\nEstimated net favorable development of prior year loss reserves, before related adjustments, decreased the loss ratio by 20.5 points, compared to 31.4 points in the 2023 third quarter. Such amounts were primarily related to better than expected cure rates. The 2024 third quarter loss ratio, excluding net favorable development, was slightly higher than in the 2023 third quarter, primarily due to higher new delinquencies in the period. \n\nThe underwriting expense ratio was 15.2% in the 2024 third quarter, compared to 16.8% in the 2023 third quarter. The decrease was primarily due to higher level of ceding and profit commissions on U.S. primary business, along with a higher level of net premiums earned. \n\n**_Corporate_ **\n\nThe Company’s results include net investment income, net realized gains or losses (which includes realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of equity securities and assets accounted for using the fair value option, realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments, changes in the allowance for credit losses on financial assets and gains and losses realized from the acquisition or disposition of subsidiaries), equity in net income or loss of investment funds accounted for using the equity method, other income (loss), corporate expenses, transaction costs and other, amortization of intangible assets, interest expense, net foreign exchange gains or losses, income tax items, income or loss from operating affiliates and items related to the Company’s non-cumulative preferred shares. \n\nInvestment returns were as follows: \n\n(U.S. Dollars in millions, except per share data)  |  **Three Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n**September 30,** |  **June 30,** |  **September 30,**  \n**2024** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nPre-tax net investment income  |  $  |  399  |  $  |  364  |  $  |  269   \n_Per share_ |  _$_ |  _1.04_ |  _$_ |  _0.95_ |  _$_ |  _0.71_  \nEquity in net income (loss) of investment funds accounted for using the equity method  |  $  |  171  |  $  |  167  |  $  |  59   \n_Per share_ |  _$_ |  _0.45_ |  _$_ |  _0.44_ |  _$_ |  _0.16_  \nPre-tax investment income yield, at amortized cost (1)  |  4.40%  |  4.39%  |  3.68%   \nTotal return on investments (2)  |  3.97%  |  1.33%  |  (0.40)%   \n  \n(1)  |  Presented on an annualized basis and excluding the impact of investments for which returns are not included within investment income, such as investments accounted for using the equity method and certain equities.   \n---|---  \n(2)  |  See ‘Comments on Non-GAAP Financial Measures’ for further details.   \n  \nThe growth in net investment income in the 2024 third quarter primarily reflected the effects of sustained higher interest rates available in the market, along with growth in invested assets due in part to strong operating cash flows and inflows related to the MCE Acquisition. Net realized gains were $169 million for the 2024 third quarter, compared to net realized losses of $248 million in the 2023 third quarter, and reflected sales of investments as well as the impact of financial market movements on the Company’s derivatives, equity securities and investments accounted for under the fair value option method. \n\nAmortization of intangible assets for the 2024 third quarter was $88 million, compared to $24 million for the 2023 third quarter. The higher level of expense for the 2024 third quarter reflects the amortization of intangible assets included in the MCE Acquisition, including intangible assets related to value of business acquired and distribution relationships. \n\nTransaction costs and other were $30 million for the 2024 third quarter. Transaction costs and other primarily included integration, advisory, financing, legal and other transaction costs related to the MCE Acquisition. \n\nOn a pre-tax basis, net foreign exchange losses for the 2024 third quarter were $63 million, compared to net foreign exchange gains of $22 million for the 2023 third quarter. For both periods, such amounts were primarily unrealized and resulted from the effects of revaluing the Company’s net insurance liabilities required to be settled in foreign currencies at each balance sheet date. Changes in the value of available-for-sale investments held in foreign currencies due to foreign currency rate movements are reflected as a direct increase or decrease to shareholders’ equity and are not included in the consolidated statements of income. \n\nThe Company’s effective tax rate on income before income taxes (based on the Company’s estimated annual effective tax rate) was 9.0% for the 2024 third quarter, compared to 9.1% for the 2023 third quarter. The Company’s effective tax rate on pre-tax operating income available to Arch common shareholders was 8.0% for the 2024 third quarter, consistent with 8.0% for the 2023 third quarter. The effective tax rate may fluctuate from period to period based upon the relative mix of income or loss reported by jurisdiction, the level of catastrophic loss activity incurred, and the varying tax rates in each jurisdiction. \n\nIncome from operating affiliates for the 2024 third quarter was $36 million, or $0.09 per share, compared to $54 million, or $0.14 per share, for the 2023 third quarter, and primarily reflects amounts related to the Company’s investment in Somers Group Holdings Ltd. and Coface SA. \n\n** Conference Call **\n\nThe Company will hold a conference call for investors and analysts at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time on October 31, 2024. A live webcast of this call will be available via the Investors section of the Company’s website at [http://www.archgroup.com/investors](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.archgroup.com%2Finvestors&esheet=54144880&newsitemid=20241030073497&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.archgroup.com%2Finvestors&index=1&md5=ce9013530ee2bdc5a8ede4d3516d908a). A recording of the webcast will be available in the Investors section of the Company’s website approximately two hours after the event concludes and will be archived on the site for one year. \n\nPlease refer to the Company’s Financial Supplement dated September 30, 2024, which is available via the Investors section of the Company’s website at [http://www.archgroup.com/investors](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.archgroup.com%2Finvestors&esheet=54144880&newsitemid=20241030073497&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.archgroup.com%2Finvestors&index=2&md5=af80f248fbfe3a696e1362a9b44aae7c). The Financial Supplement provides additional detail regarding the financial performance of the Company. From time to time, the Company posts additional financial information and presentations to its website, including information with respect to its subsidiaries. Investors and other recipients of this information are encouraged to check the Company’s website regularly for additional information regarding the Company. \n\nArch Capital Group Ltd., is a publicly listed Bermuda exempted company with approximately $25.0 billion in capital at September 30, 2024. Arch, which is part of the S&P 500 index, provides insurance, reinsurance and mortgage insurance on a worldwide basis through its wholly owned subsidiaries. \n\n** Comments on Non-GAAP Financial Measures **\n\nThroughout this release, the Company presents its operations in the way it believes will be the most meaningful and useful to investors, analysts, rating agencies and others who use the Company’s financial information in evaluating the performance of the Company and that investors and such other persons benefit from having a consistent basis for comparison between quarters and for comparison with other companies within the industry. These measures may not, however, be comparable to similarly titled measures used by companies outside of the insurance industry. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the Company’s overall financial performance. \n\nThis presentation includes the use of “after-tax operating income or loss available to Arch common shareholders,” which is defined as net income available to Arch common shareholders, excluding net realized gains or losses (which includes realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of equity securities and assets accounted for using the fair value option, realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments, changes in the allowance for credit losses on financial assets and gains and losses realized from the acquisition or disposition of subsidiaries), equity in net income or loss of investment funds accounted for using the equity method, net foreign exchange gains or losses, transaction costs and other, net of income taxes and the use of annualized operating return on average common equity. The presentation of after-tax operating income available to Arch common shareholders and annualized operating return on average common equity are non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G. The reconciliation of such measures to net income available to Arch common shareholders and annualized net income return on average common equity (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures) in accordance with Regulation G is included on page 2 of this release. \n\nThe Company believes that net realized gains or losses, equity in net income or loss of investment funds accounted for using the equity method, net foreign exchange gains or losses and transaction costs and other, in any particular period are not indicative of the performance of, or trends in, the Company’s business performance. Although net realized gains or losses, equity in net income or loss of investment funds accounted for using the equity method and net foreign exchange gains or losses are an integral part of the Company’s operations, the decision to realize these items are independent of the insurance underwriting process and result, in large part, from general economic and financial market conditions. Furthermore, certain users of the Company’s financial information believe that, for many companies, the timing of the realization of investment gains or losses is largely opportunistic. In addition, changes in the allowance for credit losses and net impairment losses recognized in earnings on the Company’s investments represent other-than-temporary declines in expected recovery values on securities without actual realization. \n\nThe use of the equity method on certain of the Company’s investments in certain funds that invest in fixed maturity securities is driven by the ownership structure of such funds (either limited partnerships or limited liability companies). In applying the equity method, these investments are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently adjusted based on the Company’s proportionate share of the net income or loss of the funds (which include changes in the fair value of the underlying securities in the funds). This method of accounting is different from the way the Company accounts for its other fixed maturity securities and the timing of the recognition of equity in net income or loss of investment funds accounted for using the equity method may differ from gains or losses in the future upon sale or maturity of such investments. \n\nTransaction costs and other include integration, advisory, financing, legal, severance, incentive compensation and all other costs directly related to acquisitions. The Company believes that transaction costs and other, due to their non-recurring nature, are not indicative of the performance of, or trends in, the Company’s business performance. \n\nIn the 2023 fourth quarter, the Company established a net deferred tax benefit of $1.18 billion consistent with the transition provisions specified in the Bermuda Corporate Income Tax Act of 2023. Due to the non-recurring nature of this one-time item, the Company believes that excluding this item from after-tax operating income or loss available to common shareholders provides the user with a better evaluation of the Company’s ongoing business performance. \n\nThe Company believes that showing net income available to Arch common shareholders exclusive of the items referred to above reflects the underlying fundamentals of the Company’s business since the Company evaluates the performance of and manages its business to produce an underwriting profit. In addition to presenting net income available to Arch common shareholders, the Company believes that this presentation enables investors and other users of the Company’s financial information to analyze the Company’s performance in a manner similar to how the Company’s management analyzes performance. The Company also believes that this measure follows industry practice and, therefore, allows the users of the Company’s financial information to compare the Company’s performance with its industry peer group. The Company believes that the equity analysts and certain rating agencies that follow the Company and the insurance industry as a whole generally exclude these items from their analyses for the same reasons. \n\nThe Company’s segment information includes the presentation of consolidated underwriting income or loss and a subtotal of underwriting income or loss. Such measures represent the pre-tax profitability of its underwriting operations and include net premiums earned plus other underwriting income, less losses and loss adjustment expenses, acquisition expenses and other operating expenses. Other operating expenses include those operating expenses that are incremental and/or directly attributable to the Company’s individual underwriting operations. Underwriting income or loss does not include certain income and expense items which are included in corporate. While these measures are presented in the Segment Information footnote to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, they are considered non-GAAP financial measures when presented elsewhere on a consolidated basis. The reconciliations of underwriting income or loss to income before income taxes (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure) on a consolidated basis, in accordance with Regulation G, is shown on the following pages. \n\nManagement measures segment performance for its three underwriting segments based on underwriting income or loss. The Company does not manage its assets by underwriting segment and, accordingly, investment income, income from operating affiliates and other items are not allocated to each underwriting segment. \n\nIn addition, the Company’s segment information includes the use of a combined ratio excluding catastrophic activity and prior year development, for the insurance and reinsurance segments, and a combined ratio excluding prior year development, for the mortgage segment. These ratios are non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G. The reconciliation of such measures to the combined ratio (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure) in accordance with Regulation G are shown on the individual segment pages. The Company’s management utilizes the adjusted combined ratios excluding current accident year catastrophic events and favorable or adverse development in prior year loss reserves in its analysis of the underwriting performance of each of its underwriting segments. \n\nTotal return on investments includes investment income, equity in net income or loss of investment funds accounted for using the equity method, net realized gains and losses (excluding changes in the allowance for credit losses on non-investment related financial assets) and the change in unrealized gains and losses generated by Arch’s investment portfolio. Total return is calculated on a pre-tax basis and before investment expenses and reflects the effect of financial market conditions along with foreign currency fluctuations. Management uses total return on investments as a key measure of the return generated to Arch common shareholders, and compares the return generated by the Company’s investment portfolio against benchmark returns during the periods presented. \n\nThe following tables summarize the Company’s results by segment for the 2024 third quarter and 2023 third quarter and a reconciliation of underwriting income or loss to income or loss before income taxes and net income or loss available to Arch common shareholders: \n\n(U.S. Dollars in millions)  |  **Three Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n**September 30, 2024**  \n**Insurance** |  **Reinsurance** |  **Mortgage** |  **Total**  \nGross premiums written (1)  |  $  |  2,341  |  $  |  2,763  |  $  |  339  |  $  |  5,440   \nPremiums ceded (1)  |  (521)  |  (818)  |  (57)  |  (1,393)   \nNet premiums written  |  1,820  |  1,945  |  282  |  4,047   \nChange in unearned premiums  |  (55)  |  (53)  |  31  |  (77)   \nNet premiums earned  |  1,765  |  1,892  |  313  |  3,970   \nOther underwriting income (loss)  |  —  |  2  |  3  |  5   \nLosses and loss adjustment expenses  |  (1,087)  |  (1,317)  |  1  |  (2,403)   \nAcquisition expenses  |  (308)  |  (374)  |  1  |  (681)   \nOther operating expenses  |  (250)  |  (54)  |  (49)  |  (353)   \n**Underwriting income (loss)** |  $  |  120  |  $  |  149  |  $  |  269  |  538   \nNet investment income  |  399   \nNet realized gains (losses)  |  169   \nEquity in net income (loss) of investment funds accounted for using the equity method  |  171   \nOther income (loss)  |  8   \nCorporate expenses (2)  |  (19)   \nTransaction costs and other (2)  |  (30)   \nAmortization of intangible assets  |  (88)   \nInterest expense  |  (35)   \nNet foreign exchange gains (losses)  |  (63)   \n**Income (loss) before income taxes and income (loss) from operating affiliates** |  1,050   \nIncome tax benefit (expense)  |  (98)   \nIncome (loss) from operating affiliates  |  36   \n**Net income (loss) available to Arch** |  988   \nPreferred dividends  |  (10)   \n**Net income (loss) available to Arch common shareholders** |  $  |  978   \n**Underwriting Ratios**  \nLoss ratio  |  61.6%  |  69.6%  |  (0.4)%  |  60.5%   \nAcquisition expense ratio  |  17.4%  |  19.8%  |  (0.4)%  |  17.2%   \nOther operating expense ratio  |  14.1%  |  2.9%  |  15.6%  |  8.9%   \nCombined ratio  |  93.1%  |  92.3%  |  14.8%  |  86.6%   \nNet premiums written to gross premiums written  |  77.7%  |  70.4%  |  83.2%  |  74.4%   \n  \n(1)  |  Certain assumed and ceded amounts related to intersegment transactions are included in individual segment results.
