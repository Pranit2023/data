The collaboration combines Absci’s Integrated Drug Creation™ platform with AstraZeneca's expertise in oncology with the goal to deliver an AI-designed antibody against an oncology target.\n  * Entered into a collaboration with Twist Bioscience to design a novel therapeutic using AI. Under the collaboration, the companies will integrate their industry-leading platforms to accelerate the design and development of a novel antibody therapeutic for a key biological target that potentially impacts multiple disease areas.\n  * Continuing to advance ABS-101, ABS-201, and ABS-301 programs through preclinical studies, and expecting to advance at least one additional internal asset program to a lead stage this year.\n\n\n\n**Internal Pipeline Updates, Anticipated Program Progress, and 2024 Outlook**\n\n  * **ABS-101 (potential best-in-class anti-TL1A antibody):** Last month, at Festival of Biologics Europe 2024, Absci gave a presentation titled \"Development of an AI designed therapeutic anti-TL1A antibody for IBD.” A poster containing additional data was also shared at this event, a copy of which can be found on Absci's website. Absci continues to advance ABS-101 through IND-enabling studies, plans to initiate Phase 1 clinical studies for ABS-101 in the first half of 2025, and continues to expect an interim data readout in the second half of 2025.\n  * **ABS-201 (potential best-in-class antibody for undisclosed dermatology target):** ABS-201 is designed for an undisclosed dermatological indication with significant unmet need, where the efficacy of the pharmacological standard of care is not satisfactory. Absci anticipates selecting a development candidate for this program in the second half of 2024.\n  * **ABS-301 (potential first-in-class antibody for undisclosed immuno-oncology target):** ABS-301 is a fully human antibody designed to bind to a novel target discovered through Absci's Reverse Immunology platform. Absci anticipates completion of mode-of-action validation studies for this program in the first half of 2025.\n  * **Additional Internal Pipeline Programs:** In addition to further development of ABS-101, ABS-201, and ABS-301, Absci expects to advance at least one additional internal asset program to a lead stage in 2024.\n  * **Drug Creation Partnerships:** Absci continues to make further progress on its existing drug creation partnerships, and continues to anticipate signing drug creation partnerships with at least four Partners in 2024, including one or more multi-program partnerships.\n\n\n\nAbsci now expects a gross use of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of approximately $75 million, below the previous expectation of approximately $80 million, for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024. This amount includes the expected costs associated with advancing the IND-enabling studies for ABS-101 with a third-party contract research organization.\n\nAbsci continues to focus its investments and operations on advancing its internal pipeline of programs, alongside current and future partnered programs, while achieving ongoing platform improvements and operational efficiencies. Based on the company's current plans, Absci believes its existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments will be sufficient to fund its operations into the first half of 2027.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nRevenue was $1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was driven by mix of partnered programs and related progress.\n\nResearch and development expenses were $18.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $11.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily driven by increased lab operations, including direct costs associated with IND-enabling studies for ABS-101, and an increase in stock compensation expense.\n\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses were $9.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $9.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was due to lower personnel costs and continued reductions in administrative costs, offset by an increase in stock compensation expense.\n\nNet loss was $27.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $22.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nCash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as of September 30, 2024 were $127.1 million, compared to $145.2 million as of June 30, 2024.\n\n**Webcast Information**\n\nAbsci will host a conference call to discuss its third quarter 2024 business updates and financial and operating results on Tuesday, November 12, 2024 at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time / 5:00 a.m. Pacific Time. A webcast of the conference call can be accessed at investors.absci.com.
