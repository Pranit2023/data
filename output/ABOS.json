We expect enrollment completion of our Phase 2 ALTITUDE-AD study in the first half of 2025,” said Daniel O’Connell, Chief Executive Officer of Acumen. “Additionally, we anticipate topline results from our Phase 1 healthy volunteer study investigating subcutaneous sabirnetug in the first quarter of 2025. With our clinical program gaining momentum and sabirnetug’s unique selectivity for toxic amyloid beta oligomers, we are excited about the potential to offer a next-generation treatment for early Alzheimer’s disease.”\n\n**Recent Highlights**\n\n  * **In September 2024, the****C****ompany announced it had extended its collaboration with Lonza to enable the potential future commercial launch of sabirnetug (ACU193).** The extended collaboration builds upon an existing successful relationship, in which Lonza provides drug substance manufacturing for the ALTITUDE-AD study. Under the terms of the extended agreement, Lonza will manufacture cGMP drug product of sabirnetug for the ongoing and future clinical phases and support the potential commercial launch of sabirnetug.\n  * **In October 2024, the Company hosted a virtual investor event to provide a deep dive into the scientific rationale, Phase 1 clinical results and Phase 2 clinical plans for sabirnetug.** A replay is available on the Investors section of Acumen’s website.\n  * **In October 2024, the Company presented a late-breaking presentation featuring insights from its participant screening approach used in the ongoing Phase 2 ALTITUDE-AD clinical trial evaluating sabirnetug at the 17****th****Annual Clinical Trials on Alzheimer’s Disease (CTAD) conference.**\n    * The presentation detailed the use of a validated research-use plasma phosphorylated tau 217 (pTau217) assay to screen potential participants in ALTITUDE-AD. The plasma pTau217 assay is being used as an initial screening tool to identify people who qualify for additional amyloid testing to determine eligibility for the ALTITUDE-AD trial. More details about the research are available [here](https://investors.acumenpharm.com/news-releases/news-release-details/acumen-pharmaceuticals-presents-innovative-trial-screening).\n\n\n  * **In November 2024, the Company announced the appointment of Amy Schacterle, PhD as Chief Regulatory Officer & Head of Quality. **Dr. Schacterle brings over 30 years of experience in regulatory affairs, quality assurance, and therapeutic development to Acumen, with a focus on central nervous system disorders.\n\n\n\n**Anticipated Milestones**\n\n  * The Company expects ALTITUDE-AD, a Phase 2 study to investigate sabirnetug for the treatment of early Alzheimer’s disease, to complete enrollment in the first half of 2025.\n  * The Company expects to announce topline results of a Phase 1 study to support subcutaneous administration of sabirnetug in the first quarter of 2025.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * **Cash Balance.** As of Sept. 30, 2024, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $258.9 million, compared to cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $306.1 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease in cash is related to funding ongoing operations. Cash is expected to support current clinical and operational activities into the first half of 2027.\n  * **Research and Development (R &D) Expenses. **R&D expenses were $27.2 million for the three-month period ended Sept. 30, 2024, compared to $11.2 million for the three-month period ended Sept. 30, 2023. The increase in R&D expenses was primarily due to increased clinical trial costs related to ALTITUDE-AD and license expenses.\n  * **General and Administrative (G &A) Expenses. **G&A expenses were $5.0 million for the three-month period ended Sept. 30, 2024, compared to $4.9 million for the three-month period ended Sept. 30, 2023. The increase in G&A expenses was primarily due to increased costs related to personnel.\n  * **Loss from Operations.** Loss from operations was $32.3 million for the three-month period ended Sept. 30, 2024, compared to $16.0 million for the three-month period ended Sept. 30, 2023.

Soluble AβOs have been observed to be potent neurotoxins that bind to neurons, inhibit synaptic function and induce neurodegeneration. By selectively targeting toxic soluble AβOs, sabirnetug aims to address the hypothesis that soluble AβOs are an early and persistent underlying cause of the neurodegenerative process in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Sabirnetug has been granted Fast Track designation for the treatment of early AD by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and is currently being evaluated in a Phase 2 study in patients with early AD. \n\n**About ALTITUDE-AD (Phase 2)** Initiated in 2024, ALTITUDE-AD is a Phase 2, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sabirnetug (ACU193) infusions administered once every four weeks in slowing cognitive and functional decline as compared to placebo in participants with early Alzheimer's disease. The study will enroll approximately 540 individuals with early Alzheimer’s disease (mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to AD). The global study is currently enrolling at multiple investigative sites located in the United States and Canada with plans for additional sites in Europe and the UK. More information can be found on www.clinicaltrials.gov, NCT identifier NCT06335173.\n\n**About INTERCEPT-AD (Phase 1)** Completed in 2023, INTERCEPT-AD was a Phase 1, U.S.-based, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating the safety and tolerability, and establishing clinical proof of mechanism, of sabirnetug in patients with early Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Sixty-five individuals with early AD (mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to AD) enrolled in this first-in-human study of sabirnetug. The INTERCEPT-AD study consisted of single-ascending-dose (SAD) and multiple-ascending-dose (MAD) cohorts. Results showed sabirnetug to be well-tolerated with a favorable overall safety profile. The trial showed amyloid plaque reduction, effects on synaptic biomarkers, low overall rates of ARIA-E, and evidence of target engagement that validated proof of mechanism.
