The certifications also demonstrate that the Company compliance is in line with global standards and are expected to enhance its reputation and improve its market access, customer satisfaction and loyalty, cost efficiency and sustainability, and operational efficiency.\n\n“On the heels of opening the world’s first and largest green graphite facility, receiving these ISO certifications is a testament to the strength of our patented technology,” said Aiden Lee, CEO and Co-Founder of Graphjet. “These certifications provide third-party validation of our technology and demonstrate to our customers and other stakeholders the opportunities ahead for our green graphite production process. As we continue to scale, we aim to meet the growing demand for this strategic material in semiconductors and electric vehicle batteries.”\n\n**Awarded Key Graphene Patent**\n\nIn addition, Graphjet has been granted an important patent in Malaysia, further solidifying its industry-leading position in the production of green graphite and graphene. The patent, which builds on Graphjet’s existing IP protection for palm-based synthetic graphite production, covers the company’s unique and innovative process for producing palm-based graphene. It is the only patent of its kind in Malaysia. The Company is also pursuing patents in the United States to expand its leading global IP position.\n\n“We are pleased to have been granted a significant patent for our graphene production process. This achievement further fortifies our leading IP position in the global graphite and graphene industries,” continued Aiden Lee.\n\nGraphjet’s patented, sustainable and cost-effective technology produces green graphite directly from palm kernel shells. This technology reduces the Company’s operational carbon footprint by up to 83% and reduces costs by up to 80% compared to traditional processes. Per kg of graphite produced, Graphjet produces only 2.95 kg CO2 emissions, compared to 16.8 kg CO2 emissions and 17 kg CO2 emissions from natural and synthetic graphite production, respectively, in China. Graphjet’s technology is expected to have the lowest carbon footprint of any graphite production process in the world.\n\n**About Graphjet Technology Sdn. Bhd.** Graphjet Technology Sdn. Bhd. (Nasdaq: GTI) was founded in 2019 in Malaysia as an innovative graphene and graphite producer. Graphjet Technology has the world’s first patented technology to recycle palm kernel shells generated in the production of palm seed oil to produce single layer graphene and artificial graphite. Graphjet’s sustainable production methods utilizing palm kernel shells, a waste agricultural product that is common in Malaysia, will set a new shift in graphite and graphene supply chain of the world.

This facility is the world’s first commercial-scale plant capable of recycling palm kernel shells, a highly abundant agricultural waste byproduct in Malaysia, to produce battery-grade graphite.\n\nThe new facility has the capacity to recycle up to 9,000 metric tons of palm kernel shells annually, producing up to 3,000 metric tons of graphite per year. This level of production is sufficient to support battery production for approximately 40,000 electric vehicles (EVs) per year. With a footprint exceeding 91,000 square feet, Graphjet’s facility will support a local workforce of 200 jobs, underscoring the Company’s commitment to job creation and economic growth.\n\nGraphjet has received its first shipment of palm kernel shells and has begun shipping green graphite product samples to its customers. Additionally, the Company plans to produce hard carbon at the facility to provide feedstock for its planned green graphite facility in Nevada.\n\n“The Graphjet team has achieved a monumental step towards the execution of our strategy and vision to become a reliable supplier of green graphite globally,” said Aiden Lee, CEO and Co-Founder of Graphjet. “With this facility online, Graphjet is now the primary player in green graphite production outside of China, as the Company has the largest production capacity ex-China. This facility, which is the first green graphite facility to commence operations outside of China, demonstrates our ability to leverage our technology at scale, and we are proud to commence commercial operations at the world’s largest green graphite facility of its kind. This facility will provide us with an ability to generate revenue by FY 2025, support our valued customers, and establish a strong foundation for a successful launch in the United States in Nevada.”\n\n“The opening of our facility is a clear indicator of the availability of green graphite production outside of China to support automakers and battery manufacturers,” continued Aiden Lee. “With Graphjet now officially in commercial production, we are excited to support the transition to clean energy with our environmentally friendly and cost-effective processes and technology.”\n\nGraphjet’s facility utilizes the Company’s patented, sustainable and cost-effective technology to produce green graphite directly from palm kernel shells.
