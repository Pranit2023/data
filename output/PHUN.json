(“Phunware” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: PHUN), a leader in enterprise cloud solutions for mobile applications, released [_The Essential Guide to Resort Guest Digital Experience_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=tSlfYEHzeRN_ijlFBOHSIQqNfYEtrqXizdPrhwaxDyznlUgihTXHkx7TRJbTGTmP_dxlo4ok352zxOv3f71aCWGgvlPGz3SvgtxU_dLyc8uDGACuySBNGahtIOXicW2Y8bkIyBMlySDZhb5sgvmAosC3NUckXnfQEgbSYEqzmwMoqTN9mjjWT2g4Aj7CwpvtkKjjJM8GeUmsxPIjvFdp_IdsjrCp4ltdPXesuJbfIaiiXkc_THBwTXBqFkRzls1Y) _._\n\nThe guide is based on a survey, conducted by Phunware, of 780 U.S. travelers from August to September 2024 to better understand resort guest expectations, behaviors and preferences using mobile apps while traveling.\n\n“As digital technology levels the boundaries between physical and digital experiences, resort guests increasingly seek seamless, intuitive, and personalized interactions throughout their stay,” said Jeremy Kidd, General Manager, Phunware Software. “In today’s competitive hospitality industry, understanding resort guest values, preferences, and motivations regarding digital services has become crucial to delivering exceptional resort experiences.”\n\nThe Phunware guide explores the boundaries between physical and digital experiences and guest expectations of interactions at resorts. The survey findings suggest that, from mobile check-ins and digital room keys to personalized recommendations and instant service requests, resort guests now expect the same high level of convenience and efficiency of mobile and related digital services that they do in other aspects of their daily lives.\n\nThe following are some of the key findings of the survey:\n\n  * 77% of guests expected high personal data protection.\n  * 83% of guests indicated that they were likely to provide feedback using a mobile app after participating in a resort activity or service.\n  * 65% of guests said mobile app engagement enhances their views of the ‘resort’s commitment to the guest experience.’\n  * 82% of guests indicated that using a resort’s mobile app would ‘improve their overall experience.’\n  * 95% of guests supported the notion that resorts should offer ‘real-time updates on activity and service availability.’\n  * Guests rated ‘ease of booking’ and ‘booking convenience’ as top drivers, 64% and 56%, respectively, in their decision-making to utilize ancillary resort services.\n  * 74% of guests indicated that they would likely use a retailer's app when shopping, underscoring the importance of mobile engagement in hospitality. \n\n\n\nPhunware believes these findings are indicative of significant opportunities for brands to address hospitality guest digital preferences and build positive impressions with those guests through mobile app interactions, regardless of their prior digital engagements.\n\nMethodology Note: the guide is based on a Phunware survey of a representative sample of 780 U.S. travelers with data collection from August to September 2024.\n\nThe full guide can be found [here](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=16hs7BMB2_V2u1mb1-7hi7FryHOtg_L-m8fYiolHJL6k-2WRMzvaSFg_HT-D39jIbsHtokfy39--Oc0HLgMS1ABOnRWicY9TajYWsH2mapTFye0n9XcwZSNwqHdiLPbcuPlHPpD_sysG_uq7Wuih7LfOCd9WfT5M8I-NYDKoVPzhDr9JH7e6JeU1lGa1d5XH).\n\n**About Phunware**\n\nPhunware, Inc.

All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this press release, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, business strategy and plans, and our objectives for future operations, are forward-looking statements. The words “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “expose,” “intend,” “may,” “might,” “opportunity,” “plan,” “possible,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “will,” “would” and similar expressions that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes are intended to identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. For example, Phunware is using forward-looking statements when it discusses the proposed offering and the timing and terms of such offering and its intended use of proceeds from such offering should it occur.\n\nThe forward-looking statements contained in this press release are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects on us. Future developments affecting us may not be those that we have anticipated. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) and other assumptions that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those factors described under the heading “Risk Factors” in our filings with the SEC, including our reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K and other filings that we make with the SEC from time to time. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in these forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws. These risks and others described under “Risk Factors” in our SEC filings may not be exhaustive.\n\nBy their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. We caution you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and developments in the industry in which we operate may differ materially from those made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements contained in this press release. In addition, even if our results or operations, financial condition and liquidity, and developments in the industry in which we operate are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this press release, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods.\n\n**Investor Relations Contact:**\n\nChris Tyson, Executive Vice PresidentMZ Group -

They are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to revenue or net loss, as applicable, or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other businesses. Our non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations include: (i) non-cash compensation is and will remain a key element of our overall long-term incentive compensation package, although we exclude it as an expense when evaluating its ongoing operating performance for a particular period, (ii) our non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect the impact of certain charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of ongoing operations, and (iii) other companies in our industry may calculate our non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.\n\nWe compensate for these limitations to our non-GAAP financial measures by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using our non-GAAP financial measures only for supplemental purposes. Our non-GAAP financial measures include adjustments for items that may not occur in future periods. However, we believe these adjustments are appropriate because the amounts recognized can vary significantly from period to period, do not directly relate to the ongoing operations of our business and complicate comparisons of our internal operating results and operating results of other peer companies over time. Each of the normal recurring adjustments and other adjustments described in this paragraph help management with a measure of our operating performance over time by removing items that are not related to day-to-day operations or are non-cash expenses.\n\n**Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures**  \n---  \n(_In thousands_)  \n**Three Months Ended September 30,** | **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n_(in thousands)_ | **2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \nNet loss from continuing operations | $ | (2,760 | ) | $ | (13,717 | ) | $ | (7,683 | ) | $ | (21,843 | )  \nAdd back: Depreciation | 4 | 21 | 12 | 63  \nAdd back: Interest expense | 10 | 264 | 126 | 1,354  \nLess: Interest income | (381 | ) | - | (760 | ) | -  \nEBITDA | (3,127 | ) | (13,432 | ) | (8,305 | ) | (20,426 | )  \nAdd back: Stock-based compensation | 242 | 838 | 1,532 | 3,662  \nAdd back/less: Loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt | - | 237 | (535 | ) | 237  \nAdd back: Impairment of goodwill | - | 9,043 | - | 9,043  \nLess: Gain on sale of digital assets | - | - | - | (5,310 | )  \nAdjusted EBITDA | $ | (2,885 | ) | $ | (3,314 | ) | $ | (7,308 | ) | $ | (12,794 | )  \n  \n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/d2830e4e-45b0-4782-b70d-acdc02c20531/small/pwlogo-png.png)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/d2830e4e-45b0-4782-b70d-acdc02c20531)\n\nSource: Phunware, Inc. \n\nReleased November 7, 2024\n\n  * [Email Alerts](/news-events/email-alerts)\n  * [Tear Sheet](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_c90275f19bcaec167bc6df42cb2d6791/phunware/files/Tear+Sheet.pdf \"Tear Sheet\")\n  * [Contacts](/company-information/contacts)\n  * [RSS News Feed](https://investors.phunware.com/news-events/press-releases/rss)\n\n\n\nInvestor Relations\n\n1002 West Avenue Austin, TX 78701 (512) 693-4199, ext. 0 \n\nQuick Links\n\n  * [News & Events](/news-events)\n  * [SEC Filings](/sec-filings)\n  * [Corporate Governance](/corporate-governance)\n\n\n\nCopyright © Phunware Inc.

All statements other than\nstatements of historical facts contained in this press release, including statements regarding\nour future results of operations and financial position, business strategy and plans, and our\nobjectives for future operations, are forward-looking statements. The words “anticipate,”\n“believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “expose,” “intend,” “may,” “might,”\n“opportunity,” “plan,” “possible,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “will,” “would” and\nsimilar expressions that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes are intended to\nidentify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a\nstatement is not forward-looking. For example, Phunware is using forward-looking\nstatements when it discusses the proposed offering and the timing and terms of such\noffering and its intended use of proceeds from such offering should it occur.\nThe forward-looking statements contained in this press release are based on our current\nexpectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects on us.\nFuture developments affecting us may not be those that we have anticipated. These\nforward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties (some of which are\nbeyond our control) and other assumptions that may cause actual results or performance to\nbe materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.\nThese risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those factors described under\nthe heading “Risk Factors” in our filings with the SEC, including our reports on Forms 10-K,\n10-Q, 8-K and other filings that we make with the SEC from time to time. Should one or\nmore of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of our assumptions prove\nincorrect, actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in these forward-\nlooking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking\nstatements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as\nmay be required under applicable securities laws. These risks and others described under\n“Risk Factors” in our SEC filings may not be exhaustive.\nBy their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they\nrelate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. We\ncaution you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and\nthat our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and developments in\nthe industry in which we operate may differ materially from those made in or suggested by\nthe forward-looking statements contained in this press release. In addition, even if our\nresults or operations, financial condition and liquidity, and developments in the industry in\nwhich we operate are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this press\nrelease, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in\nsubsequent periods.\nInvestor Relations Contact:\nChris Tyson, Executive Vice President\nMZ Group - MZ North America\n949-491-8235\nPHUN@mzgroup.us\nwww.mzgroup.us\nPhunware Media Contact:\nJoe McGurk, Managing Director\n917-259-6895\nPHUN@mzgroup.us\nFinancial Tables Follow\nPhunware, Inc.\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\n(In thousands, except share and per share information)\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nAssets: (Unaudited)\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 35,537 $ 3,934\nAccounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $118 and $86 as of September\n30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively 1,078 550\nDigital currencies 19 75\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 3,133 374\nCurrent assets of discontinued operation - 28\nTotal current assets 39,767 4,961\nProperty and equipment, net 27 40\nRight-of-use asset 943 1,451\nOther assets 276 276\nTotal assets $ 41,013 $ 6,728\nLiabilities and stockholders' equity\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable $ 4,776 $ 7,836\nAccrued expenses 3,005 437\nLease liability 339 629\nDeferred revenue 1,153 1,258\nPhunCoin subscription payable 1,202 1,202\nDebt - 4,936\nCurrent liabilities of discontinued operation - 205\nTotal current liabilities 10,475 16,503\nDeferred revenue 713 651\nLease liability 700 1,031\nTotal liabilities 11,888 18,185\nCommitments and contingencies\nStockholders' equity (deficit)\nCommon stock, $0.0001 par value;

They are not\nmeasurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as\nalternatives to revenue or net loss, as applicable, or any other performance measures\nderived in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled\nmeasures of other businesses. Our non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as\nanalytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of\nour operating results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations include: (i) non-\ncash compensation is and will remain a key element of our overall long-term incentive\ncompensation package, although we exclude it as an expense when evaluating its ongoing\noperating performance for a particular period, (ii) our non-GAAP financial measures do not\nreflect the impact of certain charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative\nof ongoing operations, and (iii) other companies in our industry may calculate our non-GAAP\nfinancial measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative\nmeasures.\nWe compensate for these limitations to our non-GAAP financial measures by relying\nprimarily on our GAAP results and using our non-GAAP financial measures only for\nsupplemental purposes. Our non-GAAP financial measures include adjustments for items\nthat may not occur in future periods. However, we believe these adjustments are appropriate\nbecause the amounts recognized can vary significantly from period to period, do not directly\nrelate to the ongoing operations of our business and complicate comparisons of our internal\noperating results and operating results of other peer companies over time. Each of the\nnormal recurring adjustments and other adjustments described in this paragraph help\nmanagement with a measure of our operating performance over time by removing items that\nare not related to day-to-day operations or are non-cash expenses.\nReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n(In thousands)\nThree Months Ended September Nine Months Ended September\n30, 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet loss from continuing operations $ (2,760) $ (13,717) $ (7,683) $ (21,843)\nAdd back: Depreciation 4 21 12 63\nAdd back: Interest expense 10 264 126 1,354\nLess: Interest income (381) - (760) -\nEBITDA (3,127) (13,432) (8,305) (20,426)\nAdd back: Stock-based compensation 242 838 1,532 3,662\nAdd back/less: Loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt - 237 (535) 237\nAdd back: Impairment of goodwill - 9,043 - 9,043\nLess: Gain on sale of digital assets - - - (5,310)\nAdjusted EBITDA $ (2,885) $ (3,314) $ (7,308) $ (12,794)\nSource: Phunware, Inc."
