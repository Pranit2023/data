(“Cyabra”), a provider of an AI-powered solution for combating worldwide disinformation, and Trailblazer Merger Corporation I (“Trailblazer”) (NASDAQ: TBMC), a special purpose acquisition company, announced today the signing of a definitive agreement for a business combination that upon closing is expected to result in Cyabra being publicly listed on the NASDAQ.\n\nThe spread of disinformation is one of the most pressing challenges facing society today, undermining trust in brands, individuals, communities, and democratic institutions. At a time when students are bullying their peers using AI generated fake content and automated distribution bots, nation states disseminate false narratives to impact public opinion on elections and military conflicts, and mega corporations spread misinformation about competitors, impacting tens of thousands of workers and shareholders for financial profit, Cyabra is on the front lines of this informational warfare, identifying illicit bot campaigns and providing tools to combat the bad actors in the ongoing fight to restore trust in the digital realm.\n\nDan Brahmy, CEO and co-founder of Cyabra stated, \"Our proprietary technology, developed by senior veterans from the Israeli special operations command (SOCOM), allows us to use sophisticated algorithms and advanced data analytics to determine when automated bots are being used to spread lies across social media platforms. We have corporate customers and governments worldwide using our product today to identify when an attack is occurring, providing them with the information needed to mitigate or even prevent any damage and protect their citizens and brands from the increasingly sophisticated spread of disinformation. \n\nMike Pompeo, Cyabra Board member and 70th United States Secretary of State commented, “Cyabra's efforts are not only safeguarding our digital realm, but also strengthening the foundations of free and fair discourse. Cyabra’s contributions are invaluable in the fight against malicious actors who seek to undermine our democratic institutions.\"\n\nArie Rabinowitz, CEO of Trailblazer stated, “It is becoming increasingly evident that the tremendous rise of social media in our daily lives has created a complex set of challenges. The proliferation of bad actors coupled with automated content creation and distribution tools that are easily accessible, including generative AI and bot accounts, has made the intentional dissemination of disinformation progressively worse. Cyabra presents a technology that governments, security agencies, and international enterprises are implementing to detect and monitor these threats. We are excited to present Cyabra to the public markets and look forward to supporting the Company’s growth.”\n\n**The Good, The Bad and The Fake Online** The World Economic Forum’s 2024 Global Risks Report identifies disinformation as the most significant short-term risk facing humanity. The economic impact alone is estimated to be $78 billion, according to a study conducted jointly by the University of Baltimore and CHEQ (a company specializing in cyber security).\n\nThe battle against misinformation has escalated to where 87% of executives say that the spread of disinformation is one of the most significant reputational risks to businesses today, according to Global Research. Gartner, a leading technology research firm, anticipates that by 2028, “enterprise spend on battling misinformation will surpass $30 billion annually, cannibalizing 10% of marketing and cybersecurity budgets to combat a multifront threat.”\n\n**Summary of Transaction** The transaction values Cyabra at a total enterprise value of $70 Million at signing. Upon the closing of the transaction, which is expected in the first quarter of 2025, the combined company will operate as Cyabra and will be listed on NASDAQ. \n\nThe transaction has been unanimously approved by each of Trailblazer’s and Cyabra’s Board of Directors. The proposed transaction is subject to the approval of Trailblazer and Cyabra stockholders and the satisfaction or waiver of other customary closing conditions, including a registration statement being declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). \n\n**Advisors** LifeSci Capital is acting as financial advisor and Loeb & Loeb LLP is serving as legal advisor to Trailblazer Merger Corporation I. Lowenstein Sandler LLP and Goldfarb, Gross, Seligman & Co. are serving as legal advisors to Cyabra.\n\n**About Cyabra** Founded by veterans of elite Israeli intelligence units, Cyabra is a data intelligence company that is at the forefront of the fight against the online distribution of disinformation. Cyabra has developed a proprietary AI-powered system, trusted by large corporations, governments, and security agencies to uncover risks, attacks, and malicious activity on social media platforms. Using proprietary algorithmic solutions, Cyabra’s system collects publicly available information and extracts valuable information and real time alerts, providing analytical and actionable insights, that are then communicated effectively to clients. Cyabra’s investors include Founders Fund, OurCrowd, Summus VC, and TAU Ventures.
