Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terms such as “believe,”\n“expect,” “estimate,” “could,” “should,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “seek,” “anticipate,” “project,” “will,” “shall,” “would,” “aim,” or other comparable terms. These forward-looking statements are subject to known and\nunknown risks and uncertainties, many of which may be beyond our control. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: risks related to the proposed Acquisition, including risks that we may not\ncomplete the Acquisition or that the Acquisition may not achieve its intended results; changes in macroeconomic conditions, including inflation and global supply chain challenges, especially as they may affect existing\nhome sales, interest rates, consumer confidence or labor availability; the success of our business strategies; the ability of our marketing efforts to be successful or cost-effective; our dependence on our real estate and\ndirect-to-consumer customer acquisition channels and our renewal channel; changes in the source and intensity of competition in our market; our ability to attract, retain and maintain positive relations with third-party\ncontractors and vendors; increases in parts, appliance and home system prices, and other operating costs; our ability to attract and retain qualified key employees and labor availability in our customer service\noperations; our dependence on third-party vendors, including business process outsourcers, and third-party component suppliers; cybersecurity breaches, disruptions or failures in our technology systems; our ability to\nprotect the security of personal information about our customers; lawsuits, enforcement actions and other claims by third parties or governmental authorities; evolving corporate governance and disclosure regulations\nand expectations related to environmental, social and governance matters; physical effects of climate change, including adverse weather conditions and Acts of God, along with the increased focus on sustainability;\nincreases in tariffs or changes to import/export regulations; our ability to protect our intellectual property and other material proprietary rights; negative reputational and financial impacts resulting from acquisitions or\nstrategic transactions; requirement to recognize impairment charges; third-party use of our trademarks as search engine keywords to direct our potential customers to their own websites; inappropriate use of social\nmedia by us or other parties to harm our reputation; special risks applicable to operations outside the United States by us or our business process outsource providers; a return on investment in our common stock is\ndependent on appreciation in the price; restrictions in our certificate of incorporation related to an acquisition of us or to our lawsuits against us or our directors or officers; the effects of our significant indebtedness;\nincreases in interest rates increasing the cost of servicing our indebtedness; increased borrowing costs due to lowering or withdrawal of the credit ratings, outlook or watch assigned to us, our debt securities or our\ncredit facilities; and our ability to generate significant cash needed to fund our operations and service our debt. We caution you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or outcomes\nand that actual performance and outcomes, including, without limitation, our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development of new markets or market segments in which we operate,\nmay differ materially from those made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements contained in this news release. For a discussion of other important factors that could cause Frontdoor’s results to differ\nmaterially from those expressed in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements included in this document, refer to the risks and uncertainties detailed from time to time in Frontdoor’s periodic reports filed with the\nSEC, including the disclosure contained in Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC, as such factors may be updated from time to time in Frontdoor’s periodic filings with the\nSEC, including Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Except as required by law, Frontdoor does not undertake any obligation to update or\nrevise the forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events or circumstances that occur after the date of this news release or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events or otherwise. Readers are\nadvised to review Frontdoor’s filings with the SEC, which are available from the SEC’s EDGAR database at sec.gov, and via Frontdoor’s website at frontdoorhome.com.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement Frontdoor’s results presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”), Frontdoor has disclosed the non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted\nEBITDA, Free Cash Flow, and Unrestricted Cash.\nWe define \"Adjusted EBITDA\" as net income before: depreciation and amortization expense; goodwill and intangibles impairment; restructuring charges; acquisition-related costs; provision for income taxes; non-\ncash stock-based compensation expense; interest expense; loss on extinguishment of debt; and other non-operating expenses.\nWe define “Free Cash Flow” as net cash provided from operating activities less property additions. Free Cash Flow is not a measurement of our financial performance or liquidity under U.S. GAAP and does not\npurport to be an alternative to net cash provided from operating activities or any other performance or liquidity measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nWe define “Unrestricted Cash” as cash not subject to third-party restrictions. For additional information related to our third-party restrictions, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources — Liquidity” under the heading\n“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC.\nSee the Appendix attached hereto for additional information and reconciliations of such non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental\ninformation for its and investors’ evaluation of Frontdoor’s business performance and are useful for period-over-period comparisons of the performance of Frontdoor’s business. While we believe that these non-\nGAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating our business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related\nfinancial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similarly entitled measures reported by other companies.\n© 2024 Frontdoor, Inc. All rights reserved.
