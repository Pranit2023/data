According to research performed by [Dividend Power](https://www.dividendpower.org/2021/03/23/stocks-with-100-consecutive-years-of-dividends/), Simmons is one of only 26 U.S. companies that have paid dividends for 100+ uninterrupted years. 2024 marks the 13th consecutive year that Simmons has increased its dividend, earning it Dividend Power's designation as a \"[Dividend Contender](https://www.dividendpower.org/2022/12/21/list-dividend-contenders-2022/),\" a title exclusively for companies that have increased their dividend for 10 to 24 consecutive years. As of July 1, 2024, Dividend Power research noted that _Simmons is one of only 370 companies out of the nearly 6,000 companies_ listed on the New York Stock Exchnage (NYSE) and NASDAQ to achieve this

Equally important, credit trends remained steady in the quarter and our allowance for credit\nlosses on loans ended the quarter at 1.35 percent.\nAs we enter the final quarter of 2024, we believe our strong capital and liquidity positions combined with the liability\nsensitivity position of our balance sheet will provide tailwinds as we navigate an uncertain macroeconomic\nenvironment.\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS 3Q24 2Q24 3Q23 3Q24 Highlights\nBALANCE SHEET (in millions) Comparisons reflect 3Q24 vs 2Q24\nTotal loans $17,336 $17,192 $16,772\n• Net income of $24.7 million\nTotal investment securities 6,350 6,571 7,101\nand diluted EPS of $0.20\nTotal deposits 21,935 21,841 22,231\nTotal assets 27,269 27,369 27,564 • Adjusted earnings1 of $46.0\nTotal shareholders’ equity 3,529 3,459 3,286 million and adjusted diluted\nASSET QUALITY EPS1 of $0.37\nNet charge-off ratio (NCO ratio) 0.22% 0.19% 0.28%\n• Total revenue of $174.8 million\nNonperforming loan ratio 0.59 0.60 0.49\nand PPNR1 of $37.6 million\nNonperforming assets to total assets 0.38 0.39 0.32\nAllowance for credit losses to loans (ACL) 1.35 1.34 1.30 • Adjusted total revenue1 of\nNonperforming loan coverage ratio 229 223 267 $203.2 million and adjusted\nPERFORMANCE MEASURES (in millions) PPNR1 of $66.4 million\nTotal revenue $174.8 $197.2 $196.2\n• Net interest margin of 2.74%,\nAdjusted total revenue1 203.2 197.2 196.2\nup 5 bps\nPre-provision net revenue1 (PPNR) 37.6 57.9 64.2\nAdjusted pre-provision net revenue1 66.4 59.4 66.3 • Cost of deposits unchanged\nProvision for credit losses 12.1 11.1 7.7 from 2Q24 levels at 2.79%\nPER SHARE DATA\n• Provision for credit losses on\nDiluted earnings $ 0.20 $ 0.32 $ 0.37\nloans exceeded net charge-offs\nAdjusted diluted earnings1 0.37 0.33 0.39\nin the quarter by $2.8 million\nBook value 28.11 27.56 26.26\nTangible book value1 16.78 16.20 14.77 • NCO ratio 22 bps in 3Q24; 9\nCAPITAL RATIOS bps of NCO ratio associated\nEquity to assets (EA ratio) 12.94% 12.64% 11.92% with run-off portfolio\nTangible common equity (TCE) ratio1 8.15 7.84 7.07\n• ACL ratio ends the quarter at\nCommon equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio 12.06 12.00 12.02\n1.35%\nTotal risk-based capital ratio 14.25 14.17 14.27\nLIQUIDITY ($ in millions) • EA ratio 12.94%; TCE ratio1 up\nLoan to deposit ratio 79.03% 78.72% 75.44% 31 bps to 8.15%\nBorrowed funds to total liabilities 6.16 7.38 7.37\n• Book value per share up 2%;\nUninsured, non-collateralized deposits (UCD) $ 4,659 $ 4,408 $ 4,631 tangible book value per share1\nAdditional liquidity sources 11,174 11,120 11,447\nup 4%\nCoverage ratio of UCD 2.4x 2.5x 2.5x\nSimmons First National Corporation (NASDAQ: SFNC) (Simmons or Company) today reported net income of\n$24.7 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $40.8 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $47.2 million\nin the third quarter of 2023.

The increase in allowance for credit losses on loans on a\nlinked quarter and year-over-year basis reflected normalization of the credit environment from historical lows, as\nwell as changes in the macroeconomic conditions and increased activity in the loan portfolio. The allowance for\ncredit losses on loans as a percentage of total loans was 1.35 percent at the end of the third quarter of 2024, compared\nto 1.34 percent at the end of the second quarter of 2024 and 1.30 percent at the end of the third quarter of 2023.\nNet charge-offs as a percentage of average loans for the third quarter of 2024 were 22 basis points, compared to 19\nbasis points in the second quarter of 2024 and 28 basis points in the third quarter of 2023.

The Company’s management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in\ntheir analysis of the Company’s performance. These measures adjust GAAP performance measures to, among other\nthings, include the tax benefit associated with revenue items that are tax-exempt, as well as exclude from net income\n(including on a per share diluted basis), pre-tax, pre-provision earnings, net charge-offs, income available to common\nshareholders, non-interest income, and non-interest expense certain income and expense items attributable to, for\nexample, merger activity (primarily including merger-related expenses), gains and/or losses on sale of branches, net\nbranch right-sizing initiatives, FDIC special assessment charges and gain/loss on the sale of AFS investment\nsecurities. The Company has updated its calculation of certain non-GAAP financial measures to exclude the impact\nof gains or losses on the sale of AFS investment securities in light of the impact of the Company’s strategic AFS\ninvestment securities transactions during the fourth quarter of 2023 and has presented past periods on a comparable\nbasis.\nIn addition, the Company also presents certain figures based on tangible common stockholders’ equity, tangible\nassets and tangible book value, which exclude goodwill and other intangible assets. The Company further presents\ncertain figures that are exclusive of the impact of deposits and/or loans acquired through acquisitions, mortgage\nwarehouse loans, and/or energy loans, or gains and/or losses on the sale of securities. The Company’s management\nbelieves that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they, among other things, present\nthe results of the Company’s ongoing operations without the effect of mergers or other items not central to the\nCompany’s ongoing business, as well as normalize for tax effects and certain other effects. Management, therefore,\nbelieves presentations of these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information that is\nessential to a proper understanding of the operating results of the Company’s ongoing businesses, and management\nuses these non-GAAP financial measures to assess the performance of the Company’s ongoing businesses as related\nto prior financial periods. These non-GAAP disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results\ndetermined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures\nthat may be presented by other companies.

Certain statements by Simmons First National Corporation (the “Company”, which where appropriate includes the Company’s wholly-owned banking subsidiary, Simmons Bank) contained in this presentation may not be based on\nhistorical facts and should be considered \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements relating to the Company’s future growth; business strategies; product development; revenue; expenses (including interest\nexpense and non-interest expenses); assets; loan demand (including loan growth, loan capacity, and other lending activity); deposit levels; asset quality; profitability; earnings; critical accounting policies; accretion; net interest margin; noninterest income; the\nCompany's common stock repurchase program; adequacy of the allowance for credit losses; income tax deductions; credit quality; level of credit losses from lending commitments; net interest revenue; interest rate sensitivity (including, among other things, the\npotential impact of rising rates); loan loss experience; liquidity; capital resources; future economic conditions and market risk; interest rates; the expected expenses and cost savings associated with branch closures; the Company’s ability to recruit and retain\nkey employees; increases in, and cash flows associated with, the Company’s securities portfolio; legal and regulatory limitations and compliance and competition; anticipated loan principal reductions; plans for investments in and cash flows from securities; the\nestimated annual impact of securities sales; estimated earn back periods; projections regarding loan repricing, securities investments and maturities thereof; estimates of future swap income set forth on slide 8; the interest rate sensitivity estimates and\nprojections noted on slide 15; and dividends.\nReaders are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation in that actual results could differ materially from those indicated in or implied by such forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors.\nThese factors include, but are not limited to, changes in the Company's operating or expansion strategy; the availability of and costs associated with obtaining adequate and timely sources of liquidity; the ability to maintain credit quality; changes in general\nmarket and economic conditions; increased unemployment; labor shortages; possible adverse rulings, judgments, settlements and other outcomes of pending or future litigation; the ability of the Company to collect amounts due under loan agreements;\nchanges in consumer preferences and loan demand; the effectiveness of the Company's interest rate risk management strategies; laws and regulations affecting financial institutions in general or relating to taxes; the effect of pending or future legislation;\nchanges in governmental administrations; the ability of the Company to repurchase its common stock on favorable terms; the ability of the Company to successfully manage and implement its acquisition strategy and integrate acquired institutions; difficulties\nand delays in integrating an acquired business or fully realizing cost savings and other benefits of mergers and acquisitions; changes in interest rates, deposit flows, real estate values, and capital markets; increased inflation; customer acceptance of the\nCompany's products and services; changes or disruptions in technology and IT systems (including cyber threats, attacks and events); changes in accounting principles relating to loan loss recognition (current expected credit losses, or CECL); the benefits\nassociated with the Company’s early retirement program; political crises, war, and other military conflicts (including the ongoing military conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and between Israel and Hamas) or other major events, or the prospect of these\nevents; increased competition in the markets in which the Company operates and from non-bank financial institutions; changes in governmental policies; loss of key employees; the soundness of other financial institutions and any indirect exposure related to\nthe closings of other financial institutions and their impact on the broader market through other customers, suppliers and partners, or that the conditions which resulted in the liquidity concerns experienced by closed financial institutions may also adversely\nimpact, directly or indirectly, other financial institutions and market participants with which the Company has commercial or deposit relationships; increased delinquency and foreclosure rates on commercial real estate loans; and other risk factors. Other\nrelevant risk factors may be detailed from time to time in the Company's press releases and filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including, without limitation, the Company’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. In addition,\nthere can be no guarantee that the board of directors (“Board”) of the Company will approve a quarterly dividend in future quarters, and the timing, payment, and amount of future dividends (if any) is subject to, among other things, the discretion of the Board\nand may differ significantly from past dividends. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this presentation, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that\noccur after the date of this presentation. Annualized, pro forma, projected and estimated numbers are used for illustrative purpose only, are not forecasts and may not reflect actual results.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures. This presentation contains financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The Company’s management uses these non-GAAP financial\nmeasures in their analysis of the Company’s performance and capital adequacy. These measures adjust GAAP performance measures to, among other things, include the tax benefit associated with revenue items that are tax-exempt, as well as exclude from net\nincome (including on a per share diluted basis), pre-tax, pre-provision earnings, net charge-offs, income available to common shareholders, non-interest income, and non-interest expense certain income and expense items attributable to, for example, merger\nactivity (primarily including merger-related expenses), gains and/or losses on sale of branches, net branch right-sizing initiatives, FDIC special assessment charges and gain/loss on the sale of AFS investment securities. The Company has updated its calculation of\ncertain non-GAAP financial measures to exclude the impact of gains or losses on the sale of AFS investment securities in light of the impact of the Company’s strategic AFS investment securities transactions during the fourth quarter of 2023, and has presented\npast periods on a comparable basis.\nIn addition, the Company also presents certain figures based on tangible common stockholders’ equity, tangible assets and tangible book value, which exclude goodwill and other intangible assets, and presents certain other figures to include the effect that\naccumulated other comprehensive income could have on the Company’s capital levels . The Company further presents certain figures that are exclusive of the impact of deposits and/or loans acquired through acquisitions, mortgage warehouse loans, and/or\nenergy loans, or gains and/or losses on the sale of securities. The Company’s management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they, among other things, present the results of the Company’s ongoing operations\nwithout the effect of mergers or other items not central to the Company’s ongoing business, present the Company’s capital inclusive of the potential impact of AOCI (primarily comprised of unrealized losses on securities), as well as normalize for tax effects and\ncertain other effects. Management, therefore, believes presentations of these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information that is essential to a proper understanding of the operating results of the Company’s ongoing businesses, and\nmanagement uses these non-GAAP financial measures to assess the performance of the Company’s ongoing businesses as related to prior financial periods. These non-GAAP disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in\naccordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as the reconciliation\nto the comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found in the appendix to this presentation.\n2\nSimmons First National Corporation Company Overview\nA Mid-South based financial holding company serving our customers\n$27.3 $21.9\nand the communities where we work and live since 1903\nBILLION BILLION\nTOTAL ASSETS TOTAL DEPOSITS\n$8.7 $17.3\n115 CONSECUTIVE YEARS\nPAYING DIVIDENDS3\nBILLION BILLION\nASSETS UNDER TOTAL LOANS\nMANAGEMENT/\nADMINISTRATION\n121\nYEARS OF SERVICE\n14.3% 8.2%\n234\nFINANCIAL CENTERS TOTAL RBC TCE RATIO1\nACROSS SIX STATES RATIO\n3.9% 79%\nDIVIDEND YIELD2 LOAN TO\nDEPOSIT RATIO\n1.35% 229%\nACL TO TOTAL NPL COVERAGE\nLOANS RATIO\n3\nFigures presented on this slide are as of September 30, 2024, unless otherwise noted\n1 Non-GAAP measures that management believes aid in the discussion of results.

CORPORATION\nCONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nNOTE 1: PREPARATION OF INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDescription of Business and Organizational Structure\nSimmons First National Corporation (“Company”) is a Mid-South financial holding company headquartered in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, and the parent\ncompany of Simmons Bank, an Arkansas state-chartered bank that has been in operation since 1903 (“Simmons Bank” or the “Bank”). Simmons First\nInsurance Services, Inc. and Simmons First Insurance Services of TN, LLC are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Simmons Bank and are insurance agencies\nthat offer various lines of personal and corporate insurance coverage to individual and commercial customers. The Company, through its subsidiaries,\noffers, among other things, consumer, real estate and commercial loans; checking, savings and time deposits; and specialized products and services (such as\ncredit cards, trust and fiduciary services, investments, agricultural finance lending, equipment lending, insurance and Small Business Administration\n(“SBA”) lending) from approximately 234 financial centers as of September 30, 2024, located throughout market areas in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri,\nOklahoma, Tennessee and Texas.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared based upon Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) rules that\npermit reduced disclosures for interim periods. Certain information and footnote disclosures have been condensed or omitted in accordance with those rules\nand regulations. The accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, was derived from audited financial statements. In the opinion of\nmanagement, these financial statements reflect all adjustments that are necessary for a fair presentation of interim results of operations, including normal\nrecurring accruals. Significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The results for the interim periods are not\nnecessarily indicative of results for the full year. For a more complete discussion of significant accounting policies and certain other information, this report\nshould be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor the year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the SEC on February 27, 2024.\nThe preparation of financial statements, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“US GAAP”), requires\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income items and expenses and disclosure of\ncontingent assets and liabilities. The estimates and assumptions used in the accompanying consolidated financial statements are based upon management’s\nevaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and actual results may differ from these estimates.\nMaterial estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change relate to the determination of the allowance for credit losses, the valuation of\nacquired loans, valuation of goodwill and subsequent impairment analysis, stock-based compensation plans and income taxes. Management obtains third\nparty valuations to assist in valuing certain aspects of these material estimates, as appropriate, including independent appraisals for significant properties in\nconnection with the determination of the allowance for credit losses and the fair value of acquired loans. Assumptions used in the goodwill impairment\nanalysis involve internally projected forecasts, coupled with market and third-party data. These material estimates could change as a result of the\nuncertainty in current macroeconomic conditions and other factors that are beyond the Company’s control and could cause actual results to differ materially\nfrom those projected.\nThe Company identified an error in its previously issued unaudited consolidated statements of cash flows. The cash flows associated with other borrowings\nwere presented on a net basis, rather than on a gross basis. The Company corrected this error in the accompanying unaudited consolidated statements of\ncash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The correction had no impact to the total net cash used in financing activities in the period. The\nCompany evaluated the materiality of this error utilizing Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 250 and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 99-M,\nboth quantitatively and qualitatively, and concluded that this error is immaterial to the impacted prior period.\n9\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nInvestment-Income Taxes - In March 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) No. 2023-\n02, ,QYHVWPHQWV\u0010(TXLW\\\u00030HWKRG\u0003DQG\u0003-RLQW\u00039HQWXUHV\u0003 7RSLF\u0003\u0016\u0015\u0016 \u0003$FFRXQWLQJ\u0003IRU\u0003,QYHVWPHQWV\u0003LQ\u00037D[\u0003&UHGLW\u00036WUXFWXUHV\u00038VLQJ\u0003WKH\u00033URSRUWLRQDO\u0003$PRUWL]DWLRQ\n0HWKRG (“ASU 2023-02”), that introduced the option to apply the proportional amortization method to account for investments made primarily for the\npurpose of receiving income tax credits and other income tax benefits when certain requirements are met. The proportional amortization method results in\nthe cost of the investment being amortized in proportion to the income tax credits and other income tax benefits received, with the amortization of the\ninvestment and the income tax credits being presented net in the income statement as a component of income tax expense (benefit). ASU 2023-02 was\neffective for public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 31, 2023, with early adoption\npermitted. The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2023-02 and apply the proportional amortization method for all income tax credits during the first\nquarter of 2023 by utilizing the modified retrospective method. The adoption of ASU 2023-02 did not have a material impact on the Company’s results of\noperations, financial position or disclosures.\nCredit Losses on Financial Instruments - In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-02, )LQDQFLDO\u0003,QVWUXPHQWV\u0003\u0010\u0003&UHGLW\u0003/RVVHV\u0003 7RSLF\u0003\u0016\u0015\u0019 \u00037URXEOHG\n'HEW\u00035HVWUXFWXULQJV\u0003DQG\u00039LQWDJH\u0003'LVFORVXUHV (“ASU 2022-02”), which eliminated the accounting guidance on troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) for\ncreditors in ASC Topic 310-40 and amended the guidance on “vintage disclosures” to require disclosure of current-period gross write-offs by year of\norigination. The ASU also updated the requirements related to accounting for credit losses under ASC 326 and added enhanced disclosures for creditors\nwith respect to loan refinancings and restructurings made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. ASU 2022-02 was effective for public business\nentities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. The Company\nadopted ASU 2022-02 effective January 1, 2023 on a prospective basis. The adoption of ASU 2022-02 did not have a material impact on the Company’s\nresults of operations or financial position. See Note 4, Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses, for additional information.\nFair Value Hedging - In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-01, 'HULYDWLYHV\u0003DQG\u0003+HGJLQJ\u0003 7RSLF\u0003\u001b\u0014\u0018 \u0003)DLU\u00039DOXH\u0003+HGJLQJ\u0003\u0010\u00033RUWIROLR\u0003/D\\HU\n0HWKRG (“ASU 2022-01”), which clarified the guidance on fair value hedge accounting of interest rate risk for portfolios of financial assets. This ASU\namended the guidance in ASU 2017-12 that, among other things, established the “last-of-layer” method for making the fair value hedge accounting for\nthese portfolios more accessible. ASU 2022-01 renamed that method the “portfolio layer” method and expanded the scope of the guidance to allow entities\nto apply the portfolio layer method to portfolios of all financial assets, including both prepayable and nonprepayable financial assets. The scope expansion\nis consistent with the FASB’s efforts to simplify hedge accounting and allowed entities to apply the same method to similar hedging strategies. ASU 2022-\n01 was effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2022, with early\nadoption permitted. The adoption of 2022-01 did not have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or disclosures.\nReference Rate Reform – In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, 5HIHUHQFH\u00035DWH\u00035HIRUP\u0003 7RSLF\u0003\u001b\u0017\u001b \u0003)DFLOLWDWLRQ\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003(IIHFWV\u0003RI\u00035HIHUHQFH\n5DWH\u00035HIRUP\u0003RQ\u0003)LQDQFLDO\u00035HSRUWLQJ (“ASU 2020-04”), which provided relief for companies preparing for discontinuation of interest rates such as the\nLondon Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”). LIBOR is a benchmark interest rate referenced in a variety of agreements that are used by numerous entities.\nOn March 5, 2021, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) announced that the majority of LIBOR rates will no longer be published after December\n31, 2021. Effective January 1, 2022, the ICE Benchmark Administration Limited, the administrator of the LIBOR, ceased the publication of one-week and\ntwo-month USD LIBOR and as of June 30, 2023, ceased the publications of the remaining tenors of USD LIBOR (one, three, six and 12-month).\nOther interest rates used globally could also be discontinued for similar reasons. ASU 2020-04 provided optional expedients and exceptions to contracts,\nhedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform. The main provisions for contract modifications include optional relief by\nallowing the modification as a continuation of the existing contract without additional analysis and other optional expedients regarding embedded features.\nOptional expedients for hedge accounting permitted changes to critical terms of hedging relationships and to the designated benchmark interest rate in a fair\nvalue hedge and also provided relief for assessing hedge effectiveness for cash flow hedges. Companies were able to apply ASU 2020-04 immediately;\nhowever, the guidance was only available for a limited time (generally through December 31, 2022). The Company formed a LIBOR Transition Team in\n2020, has created standard LIBOR replacement language for new and modified loan notes, and is monitoring the remaining loans with LIBOR rates\nmonthly to ensure progress in updating these loans with acceptable LIBOR replacement language or converting them to other interest rates. During 2021,\nthe Company did not offer LIBOR-indexed rates on loans which it originated, although it did participate in some shared credit agreements originated by\nother banks subject to the Company’s determination that the LIBOR replacement language in the loan documents met the Company’s standards.\n10\nPursuant to the Joint Regulatory Statement on LIBOR transition issued in October 2021, the Company’s policy, as of January 1, 2022, is not to enter into\nany new LIBOR-based credit agreements and not extend, renew, or modify prior LIBOR credit agreements without requiring conversion of the agreements\nto other interest rates. The adoption of ASU 2020-04 has not had a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.\nIn January 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-01, 5HIHUHQFH\u00035DWH\u00035HIRUP\u0003 7RSLF\u0003\u001b\u0017\u001b \u00036FRSH (“ASU 2021-01”), which clarified that certain optional\nexpedients and exceptions in ASC 848 for contract modifications and hedge accounting apply to derivatives that are affected by the changes in the interest\nrates used for margining, discounting, or contract price alignment for derivative instruments that are being implemented as part of the market-wide\ntransition to new reference rates (commonly referred to as the “discounting transition”). ASU 2021-01 also amended the expedients and exceptions in ASC\n848 to capture the incremental consequences of the scope clarification and to tailor the existing guidance to derivative instruments affected by the\ndiscounting transition. ASU 2021-01 was effective upon issuance and generally could be applied through December 31, 2022. ASU 2021-01 did not have a\nmaterial impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.\nIn December 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-06, 5HIHUHQFH\u00035DWH\u00035HIRUP\u0003 7RSLF\u0003\u001b\u0017\u001b \u0003'HIHUUDO\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u00036XQVHW\u0003'DWH\u0003RI\u00037RSLF\u0003\u001b\u0017\u001b\u0003(“ASU 2022-06”).\nASU 2022-06 deferred the sunset date of Topic 848 from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024, after which entities will no longer be permitted to\napply the relief in Topic 848.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nStock Compensation - In March 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-01, &RPSHQVDWLRQ\u00106WRFN\u0003&RPSHQVDWLRQ\u0003 7RSLF\u0003\u001a\u0014\u001b \u00036FRSH\u0003$SSOLFDWLRQ\u0003RI\u00033URILWV\n,QWHUHVW\u0003DQG\u00036LPLODU\u0003$ZDUGV\u0003(“ASU 2024-01”), in response to feedback received by the FASB requesting guidance on how entities should determine the\nappropriate guidance to apply when accounting for the issuance of profits interest units and similar types of awards. ASU 2024-01 adds an example with\nfour fact patterns to ASC 718-10 to assist preparers of financial statements in determining whether profits interest and similar awards should be accounted\nfor within the scope of the guidance. ASU 2024-01 only addresses the scope determination and does not amend the recognition, classification or\nmeasurement guidance. ASU 2024-01 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2024, with\nearly adoption permitted for interim or annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. Entities may choose to\nadopt 2024-01 on a prospective or retrospective basis. The adoption of ASU 2024-01 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s\noperations, financial position or disclosures.\nIncome Taxes - In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, ,QFRPH\u00037D[HV\u0003 7RSLF\u0003\u001a\u0017\u0013 \u0003,PSURYHPHQWV\u0003WR\u0003,QFRPH\u00037D[\u0003'LVFORVXUHV (“ASU 2023-\n09”), primarily focused on income tax disclosures regarding effective tax rates and cash income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 requires public business entities,\non an annual basis, to disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative\nthreshold (if the effect of those reconciling items is equal to or greater than five percent of the amount computed by multiplying pretax income by the\napplicable statutory income tax rate). ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15,\n2024, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of ASU 2023-09 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s operations, financial\nposition or disclosures.\nSegment Reporting - In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, 6HJPHQW\u00035HSRUWLQJ\u0003 7RSLF\u0003\u0015\u001b\u0013 \u0003,PSURYHPHQWV\u0003WR\u00035HSRUWDEOH\u00036HJPHQW\n'LVFORVXUHV (“ASU 2023-07”), which expands reportable segment disclosure requirements through enhanced disclosures about significant segment\nexpenses. The amendments in this update introduce a new requirement to disclose significant segment expenses regularly provided to the chief operating\ndecision maker, extend certain annual disclosures to interim periods, clarify that single reportable segment entities must apply Topic 280 in its entirety,\npermit more than one measure of segment profit or loss to be reported under certain conditions and require disclosure of the title and position of the chief\noperating decision maker. ASU 2023-07 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods\nwithin fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of ASU 2023-07 is not expected to have a material\nimpact on the Company’s operations, financial position or disclosures.\nThere have been no other significant changes to the Company’s accounting policies disclosed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of\nthe Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Presently, the Company is not aware of any other changes to the\nAccounting Standards Codification that will have a material impact on its present or future financial position or results of operations.\n11\nNOTE 2: ACQUISITIONS\nSpirit of Texas Bancshares, Inc.\nOn April 8, 2022, the Company completed its merger with Spirit of Texas Bancshares, Inc. (“Spirit”) pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of\nMerger dated as of November 18, 2021 (“Spirit Agreement”), at which time Spirit merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the\nsurviving corporation. The Company issued 18,275,074 shares of its common stock valued at approximately $464.9 million as of April 8, 2022, plus\n$1,393,508.90 in cash, in exchange for all outstanding shares of Spirit capital stock (and common stock equivalents) to effect the merger.\nPrior to the acquisition, Spirit, headquartered in Conroe, Texas, conducted banking business through its subsidiary bank, Spirit of Texas Bank SSB, from 35\nbranches located primarily in the Texas Triangle - consisting of Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, San Antonio and Austin metropolitan areas - with additional\nlocations in the Bryan-College Station, Corpus Christi and Tyler metropolitan areas, along with offices in North Central and South Texas. Including the\neffects of the acquisition method accounting adjustments, the Company acquired approximately $3.11 billion in assets, including approximately\n$2.29 billion in loans (inclusive of loan discounts), and approximately $2.72 billion in deposits.\nGoodwill of $174.1 million was recorded as a result of the transaction. The merger strengthened the Company’s position in the Texas market and brought\nforth additional opportunities in the Company’s current footprint, which gave rise to the goodwill recorded. The goodwill will not be deductible for tax\npurposes.\nA summary, at fair value, of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Spirit acquisition, as of the acquisition date, is as follows:\nAcquired from Fair Value\n(In thousands) Spirit Adjustments Fair Value\nAssets Acquired\nCash and due from banks $ 277,790 $ — $ 277,790\nInvestment securities 362,088 (13,401) 348,687\nLoans acquired 2,314,085 (19,925) 2,294,160\nAllowance for credit losses on loans (17,005) 7,382 (9,623)\nPremises and equipment 84,135 (19,074) 65,061\nBank owned life insurance 36,890 — 36,890\nGoodwill 77,681 (77,681) —\nCore deposit and other intangible assets 6,245 32,386 38,631\nOther assets 58,403 (3,411) 54,992\nTotal assets acquired $ 3,200,312 $ (93,724) $ 3,106,588\nLiabilities Assumed\nDeposits:\nNoninterest bearing transaction accounts $ 825,228 $ (534) $ 824,694\nInterest bearing transaction accounts and savings deposits 1,383,663 — 1,383,663\nTime deposits 509,209 1,081 510,290\nTotal deposits 2,718,100 547 2,718,647\nOther borrowings 37,547 503 38,050\nSubordinated debentures 36,491 879 37,370\nAccrued interest and other liabilities 23,667 (3,311) 20,356\nTotal liabilities assumed 2,815,805 (1,382) 2,814,423\nEquity 384,507 (384,507) —\nTotal equity assumed 384,507 (384,507) —\nTotal liabilities and equity assumed $ 3,200,312 $ (385,889) $ 2,814,423\nNet assets acquired 292,165\nPurchase price 466,311\nGoodwill $ 174,146\n12\nDuring 2023, the Company finalized its analysis of the loans acquired along with other acquired assets and assumed liabilities related to the Spirit\nacquisition.\nThe Company’s operating results include the operating results of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities of Spirit subsequent to the acquisition date.\nThe following is a description of the methods used to determine the fair values of significant assets and liabilities presented in the acquisition above.\n&DVK\u0003DQG\u0003GXH\u0003IURP\u0003EDQNV – The carrying amount of these assets is a reasonable estimate of fair value based on the short-term nature of these assets.\n\u0003\n,QYHVWPHQW\u0003VHFXULWLHV – Investment securities were acquired with an adjustment to fair value based upon quoted market prices if material. Otherwise, the\ncarrying amount of these assets was deemed to be a reasonable estimate of fair value.\n/RDQV\u0003DFTXLUHG – Fair values for loans were based on a discounted cash flow methodology that considered factors including the type of loan and related\ncollateral, classification status, fixed or variable interest rate, term of loan and whether or not the loan was amortizing, and current discount rates. The\ndiscount rates used for loans are based on current market rates for new originations of comparable loans and include adjustments for liquidity concerns. The\ndiscount rate does not include a factor for credit losses as that has been included in the estimated cash flows. Loans were grouped together according to\nsimilar characteristics and were treated in the aggregate when applying various valuation techniques. See Note 4, Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses,\nin the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to purchased financial assets with credit deterioration.\n3UHPLVHV\u0003DQG\u0003HTXLSPHQW – Bank premises and equipment were acquired with an adjustment to fair value, which represents the difference between the\nCompany’s current analysis of property and equipment values completed in connection with the acquisition and book value acquired.\n%DQN\u0003RZQHG\u0003OLIH\u0003LQVXUDQFH – Bank owned life insurance is carried at its current cash surrender value, which is the most reasonable estimate of fair value.\n*RRGZLOO – The consideration paid as a result of the acquisition exceeded the fair value of the assets acquired, resulting in an intangible asset, goodwill.\nGoodwill established prior to the acquisitions, if applicable, was written off.\n&RUH\u0003GHSRVLW\u0003LQWDQJLEOH – This intangible asset represents the value of the relationships that the acquired banks had with their deposit customers. The fair\nvalue of this intangible asset was estimated based on a discounted cash flow methodology that gave appropriate consideration to expected customer\nattrition rates, cost of the deposit base and the net maintenance cost attributable to customer deposits. Any core deposit intangible established prior to the\nacquisitions, if applicable, was written off.\n2WKHU\u0003DVVHWV – The fair value adjustment results from certain assets whose value was estimated to be more or less than book value, such as certain prepaid\nassets, receivables and other miscellaneous assets. Otherwise, the carrying amount of these assets was deemed to be a reasonable estimate of fair value.\n'HSRVLWV – The fair values used for the demand and savings deposits that comprise the transaction accounts acquired, by definition equal the amount\npayable on demand at the acquisition date. The Company performed a fair value analysis of the estimated weighted average interest rate of the certificates\nof deposits compared to the current market rates and recorded a fair value adjustment for the difference when material.\n\u0003\n2WKHU\u0003ERUURZLQJV – The fair value of other borrowings is estimated based on borrowing rates currently available to the Company for borrowings with\nsimilar terms and maturities.\n6XERUGLQDWHG\u0003GHEHQWXUHV\u0003± The fair value of subordinated debentures is estimated based on borrowing rates currently available to the Company for\nborrowings with similar terms and maturities.\n$FFUXHG\u0003LQWHUHVW\u0003DQG\u0003RWKHU\u0003OLDELOLWLHV – The fair value adjustment results from certain liabilities whose value was estimated to be more or less than book\nvalue, such as certain accounts payable and other miscellaneous liabilities. The adjustment also establishes a liability for unfunded commitments equal to\nthe fair value of that liability at the date of acquisition. The carrying amount of accrued interest and the remainder of other liabilities was deemed to be a\nreasonable estimate of fair value.\n13\nNOTE 3: INVESTMENT SECURITIES\nHeld-to-maturity (“HTM”) securities, which include any security for which the Company has both the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity, are\ncarried at historical cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. Premiums and discounts are amortized and accreted,\nrespectively, to interest income using the constant effective yield method over the security’s estimated life. Prepayments are anticipated for mortgage-\nbacked and SBA securities. Premiums on callable securities are amortized to their earliest call date.\nAvailable-for-sale (“AFS”) securities, which include any security for which the Company has no immediate plan to sell but which may be sold in the\nfuture, are carried at fair value. Realized gains and losses, based on specifically identified amortized cost of the individual security, are included in other\nincome. Unrealized gains and losses are recorded, net of related income tax effects, in stockholders’ equity, further discussed below. Premiums and\ndiscounts are amortized and accreted, respectively, to interest income using the constant effective yield method over the estimated life of the security.\nPrepayments are anticipated for mortgage-backed and SBA securities.

As of September 30, 2024, the related remaining combined net unrealized losses of $112.7 million\nin accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) will be amortized over the remaining life of the securities.

A portion of the unrealized losses were related to the Company’s MBS, which are\nissued and guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored entities and agencies, and the Company’s state and political subdivision securities, specifically\ninvestments in insured fixed rate municipal bonds for which the issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments under the contractual terms\nof the securities.\n15\nFurthermore, the decline in fair value for each of the above AFS securities is attributable to the rates for those investments yielding less than current market\nrates. Management does not believe any of the securities are impaired due to reasons of credit quality. Management believes the declines in fair value for\nthe securities are temporary. As of September 30, 2024, management does not have the immediate intent to sell the securities, and management believes the\naccounting standard of “more likely than not” has not been met regarding whether the Company would be required to sell any of the AFS securities before\nrecovery of amortized cost.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nAll MBS held by the Company are issued by U.S. government-sponsored entities and agencies. These securities are either explicitly or implicitly\nguaranteed by the U.S. government, highly rated by major rating agencies and have a long history of no credit losses. Accordingly, no allowance for credit\nlosses has been recorded for these securities.\nRegarding securities issued by state and political subdivisions and other HTM securities, the adequacy of the reserve for credit loss is determined quarterly\nbased on methodology similar to the methodology for determining the allowance for credit losses on loans. The methodology considers, but is not limited\nto: (i) issuer bond ratings, (ii) issuer geography, (iii) whether issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments under the contractual terms of\nthe securities, (iv) probability-weighted multiple scenario forecasts, and (v) the issuers’ size.\nThe following table details activity in the allowance for credit losses by investment security type for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024\non the Company’s HTM securities portfolio.\nState and Political Other\n(In thousands) Subdivisions Securities Total\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024\nHeld-to-maturity\nBeginning balance, July 1, 2024 $ 191 $ 3,023 $ 3,214\nProvision for credit loss expense — — —\nNet increase (decrease) in allowance on previously impaired securities 36 (36) —\nEnding balance, September 30, 2024 $ 227 $ 2,987 $ 3,214\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nHeld-to-maturity\nBeginning balance, January 1, 2024 $ 2,006 $ 1,208 $ 3,214\nProvision for credit loss expense — — —\nNet (decrease) increase in allowance on previously impaired securities (1,779) 1,779 —\nEnding balance, September 30, 2024 $ 227 $ 2,987 $ 3,214\nActivity in the allowance for credit losses by investment security type for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 on the Company’s HTM\nand AFS securities portfolio was as follows:\nState and Political Other\n(In thousands) Subdivisions Securiti es Total\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2023\nHeld-to-maturity\nBeginning balance, July 1, 2023 $ 934 $ 2,280 $ 3,214\nProvision for credit loss expense — — —\nNet increase (decrease) in allowance on previously impaired securities 586 (586) —\nEnding balance, September 30, 2023 $ 1,520 $ 1,694 $ 3,214\nAvailable-for-sale\nBeginning balance, July 1, 2023 $ — $ 2,396 $ 2,396\nProvision for credit loss expense — — —\nNet decrease in allowance on previously impaired securities — (1,200) (1,200)\nEnding balance, September 30, 2023 $ — $ 1,196 $ 1,196\n16\nState and Political Other\n(In thousands) Subdivisions Securities Total\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nHeld-to-maturity\nBeginning balance, January 1, 2023 $ 110 $ 1,278 $ 1,388\nProvision for credit loss expense 824 1,002 1,826\nNet increase (decrease) in allowance on previously impaired securities 586 (586) —\nEnding balance, September 30, 2023 $ 1,520 $ 1,694 $ 3,214\nAvailable-for-sale\nBeginning balance, January 1, 2023 $ — $ — $ —\nProvision for credit loss expense — 12,800 12,800\nReduction due to sales — (2,078) (2,078)\nNet decrease in allowance on previously impaired securities — (2,526) (2,526)\nSecurities charged-off — (7,000) (7,000)\nEnding balance, September 30, 2023 $ — $ 1,196 $ 1,196\nBased upon the Company’s analysis of the underlying risk characteristics of its HTM and AFS portfolios, including credit ratings and other qualitative\nfactors, as previously discussed, there was no provision for credit losses related to the Company’s securities portfolios recorded for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024. The Company recorded a provision for credit losses related to AFS securities of $12.8 million for the nine months\nended September 30, 2023.

The difference between amortized cost and unpaid principal balance is due to (i) premiums and\ndiscounts associated with acquisition date fair value adjustments on acquired loans of $9.0 million and $13.2 million at September 30, 2024 and December\n31, 2023, respectively, and (ii) deferred origination costs and fees of $10.1 million and $6.5 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively.\nAccrued interest on loans, which is excluded from the amortized cost of loans held for investment, totaled $83.9 million and $77.1 million at September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and is included in interest receivable on the consolidated balance sheets.\n/RDQ\u00032ULJLQDWLRQ\u00125LVN\u00030DQDJHPHQW – The Company seeks to manage its credit risk by diversifying its loan portfolio, determining that borrowers have\nadequate sources of cash flow for loan repayment without liquidation of collateral; obtaining and monitoring collateral; and providing an adequate\nallowance for credit losses by regularly reviewing loans through the internal loan review process. The loan portfolio is diversified by borrower, purpose and\nindustry. The Company seeks to use diversification within the loan portfolio to reduce its credit risk, thereby minimizing the adverse impact on the\nportfolio if weaknesses develop in either the economy or a particular segment of borrowers. Collateral requirements are based on credit assessments of\nborrowers and may be used to recover the debt in case of default.\n&RQVXPHU – The consumer loan portfolio consists of credit card loans and other consumer loans. Credit card loans are diversified by geographic region to\nreduce credit risk and minimize any adverse impact on the portfolio. Although they are regularly reviewed to facilitate the identification and monitoring of\ncreditworthiness, credit card loans are unsecured loans, making them more susceptible to economic downturns that result in increased\nunemployment. Other consumer loans include direct installment loans and account overdrafts. Loans in this portfolio segment are sensitive to\nunemployment and other key consumer economic measures.\n5HDO\u0003HVWDWH – The real estate loan portfolio consists of construction and development loans (“C&D”), single family residential loans and commercial\nloans. C&D and commercial real estate (“CRE”) loans can be particularly sensitive to valuation of real estate. CRE cycles are inevitable. The long planning\nand production process for new properties and rapid shifts in business conditions and employment create an inherent tension between supply and demand\nfor commercial properties. While general economic trends often move individual markets in the same direction over time, the timing and magnitude of\nchanges are determined by other forces unique to each market. CRE cycles tend to be local in nature and longer than other credit cycles. Factors\ninfluencing the CRE market are traditionally different from those affecting residential real estate markets; thereby making predictions for one market based\non the other difficult. Additionally, submarkets within CRE – such as office, industrial, apartment, retail and hotel – also experience different cycles,\nproviding an opportunity to lower the overall risk through diversification across types of CRE loans. Management realizes that local demand and supply\nconditions will also mean that different geographic areas will experience cycles of different amplitude and duration. The Company monitors these loans\nclosely.\n19\n&RPPHUFLDO – The commercial loan portfolio includes commercial and agricultural loans, representing loans to commercial customers and farmers for use\nin normal business or farming operations to finance working capital needs, equipment purchases or other expansion projects. Paycheck Protection Program\n(“PPP”) loans are also included in the commercial loan portfolio. Collection risk in this portfolio is driven by the creditworthiness of the underlying\nborrowers, particularly cash flow from customers’ business or farming operations. The Company continues its efforts to keep loan terms short, reducing the\nnegative impact of upward movement in interest rates. Term loans are generally set up with one or three year balloons, and the Company has instituted a\npricing mechanism for commercial loans. It is general practice to require personal guaranties on commercial loans for closely-held or limited liability\nentities.\n3D\\FKHFN\u00033URWHFWLRQ\u00033URJUDP\u0003/RDQV – The Company originated loans pursuant to multiple PPP appropriations of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and\nEconomic Security Act which provided 100% federally guaranteed loans for small businesses to cover up to 24 weeks of payroll costs and assistance with\nmortgage interest, rent and utilities. Notably, these small business loans may be forgiven by the SBA if borrowers maintain their payrolls and satisfy certain\nother conditions. PPP loans have a zero percent risk-weight for regulatory capital ratios. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total\noutstanding balance of PPP loans was $2.4 million and $4.8 million, respectively.\n2WKHU – The other loan portfolio includes mortgage warehouse loans, representing warehouse lines of credit to mortgage originators for the disbursement of\nnewly originated 1-4 family residential loans. Also included in the other loan portfolio are loans to public sector customers, including state and local\ngovernments.\n1RQDFFUXDO\u0003DQG\u00033DVW\u0003'XH\u0003/RDQV – Loans are considered past due if the required principal and interest payments have not been received as of the date such\npayments were due. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when, in management’s opinion, the borrower may be unable to meet payment obligations as\nthey become due, as well as when required by regulatory provisions. Loans may be placed on nonaccrual status regardless of whether or not such loans are\nconsidered past due. When interest accrual is discontinued, all unpaid accrued interest is reversed.

Modifications to borrowers experiencing financial\ndifficulties may include interest rate reductions, principal or interest forgiveness and/or term extensions. The Company primarily uses interest rate\nreduction and/or payment modifications or extensions, with an occasional forgiveness of principal.\nThe following table presents a summary of the amortized cost basis of loan modifications granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, segregated\nby class of loans and type of loan modification, for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024.\nPercent of\nInterest Rate Total Class\n(Dollars in thousands) Reduction of Loans\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024\nReal estate:\nSingle family residential $ 142 0.01 %\nTotal real estate $ 142\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nReal estate:\nSingle family residential $ 795 0.03 %\nTotal real estate $ 795\nThe financial effects of the loan modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty were not significant during the three and nine month\nperiods ended September 30, 2024.

Furthermore, such modifications did not significantly impact the Company’s determination of the allowance for credit\nlosses during those periods.\nThe Company closely monitors the performance of loans that are modified to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. There was one commercial loan\nto a borrower experiencing financial difficulty with a period-end amortized cost basis of $23,000 that was modified during the previous twelve months and\nwhich subsequently defaulted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. There were no loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty that\nhad a payment default during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and were modified in the twelve months prior to default. In relation to loans\nmodified to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, the Company defines a payment default as a payment received more than 90 days after its due date.\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $5.0 million and $2.5 million, respectively, of consumer mortgage loans secured by\nresidential real estate properties for which formal foreclosure proceedings are in process. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had\n$575,000 and $506,000, respectively, of Other Real Estate Owned (“OREO”) secured by residential real estate properties.\n&UHGLW\u00034XDOLW\\\u0003,QGLFDWRUV – As part of the on-going monitoring of the credit quality of the Company’s loan portfolio, management tracks certain credit\nquality indicators including trends related to (i) the weighted-average risk rating of commercial and real estate loans, (ii) the level of classified commercial\nand real estate loans, (iii) net charge-offs, (iv) non-performing loans (see details above) and (v) the general economic conditions of the Company’s local\nmarkets.\nThe Company utilizes a risk rating matrix to assign a risk rate to each of its commercial and real estate loans. Risk ratings are updated on an ongoing basis\nand are subject to change by continuous loan monitoring processes including lending management monitoring, executive management and board\ncommittee oversight, and independent credit review. A description of the general characteristics of the risk ratings is as follows:\n• 3DVV\u0003 ([FHOOHQW – This category includes loans which are virtually free of credit risk. Borrowers in this category represent the highest credit quality\nand greatest financial strength.\n• 3DVV\u0003 *RRG - Loans under this category possess a nominal risk of default. This category includes borrowers with strong financial strength and superior\nfinancial ratios and trends. These loans are generally fully secured by cash or equivalents (other than those rated “excellent”).\n• 3DVV\u0003 $FFHSWDEOH\u0003±\u0003$YHUDJH - Loans in this category are considered to possess a normal level of risk. Borrowers in this category have satisfactory\nfinancial strength and adequate cash flow coverage to service debt requirements. If secured, the perfected collateral should be of acceptable quality and\nwithin established borrowing parameters.\n• 3DVV\u0003 0RQLWRU - Loans in the Watch (Monitor) category exhibit an overall acceptable level of risk, but that risk may be increased by certain conditions,\nwhich represent “red flags”. These “red flags” require a higher level of supervision or monitoring than the normal “Pass” rated credit. The borrower\nmay be experiencing these conditions for the first time, or it may be recovering from weakness, which at one time justified a higher rating. These\nconditions may include: weaknesses in financial trends; marginal cash flow; one-time negative operating results; non-compliance with policy or\nborrowing agreements; poor diversity in operations; lack of adequate monitoring information or lender supervision; questionable management\nability/stability.\n 6SHFLDO\u00030HQWLRQ - A loan in this category has potential weaknesses that deserve management’s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential\nweaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the institution’s credit position at some future date. Special\nMention loans are not adversely classified (although they are “criticized”) and do not expose an institution to sufficient risk to warrant adverse\nclassification. Borrowers may be experiencing adverse operating trends or an ill-proportioned balance sheet. Non-financial characteristics of a Special\nMention rating may include management problems, pending litigation, a non-existent or ineffective loan agreement or other material structural\nweakness, and/or other significant deviation from prudent lending practices.\n• 6XEVWDQGDUG - A Substandard loan is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral\npledged, if any. Loans so classified must have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses, that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. The loans are\ncharacterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. This does not imply ultimate loss\nof the principal, but may involve burdensome administrative expenses and the accompanying cost to carry the loan.\n23\n• 'RXEWIXO - A loan classified Doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in a substandard loan except that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation\nin full (on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values) highly questionable and improbable. Doubtful borrowers are usually in default,\nlack adequate liquidity or capital, and lack the resources necessary to remain an operating entity. The possibility of loss is extremely high, but because\nof specific pending events that may strengthen the asset, its classification as loss is deferred. Pending factors include: proposed merger or acquisition;\nliquidation procedures; capital injection; perfection of liens on additional collateral; and refinancing plans. Loans classified as Doubtful are placed on\nnonaccrual status.\n• /RVV - Loans classified Loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as bankable assets is not warranted. This\nclassification does not mean that the loans has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off this\nbasically worthless loan, even though partial recovery may be affected in the future. Borrowers in the Loss category are often in bankruptcy, have\nformally suspended debt repayments, or have otherwise ceased normal business operations. Loans should be classified as Loss and charged-off in the\nperiod in which they become uncollectible.\nThe Company monitors credit quality in the consumer portfolio by delinquency status. The delinquency status of loans is updated daily. A description of\nthe delinquency credit quality indicators is as follows:\n• &XUUHQW\u0003- Loans in this category are either current in payments or are under 30 days past due. These loans are considered to have a normal level of risk.\n• \u0016\u0013\u0010\u001b \u0003'D\\V\u00033DVW\u0003'XH - Loans in this category are between 30 and 89 days past due and are subject to the Company’s loss mitigation process. These\nloans are considered to have a moderate level of risk.\n• \u0013\u000e\u0003'D\\V\u00033DVW\u0003'XH - Loans in this category are 90 days or more past due and are placed on nonaccrual status. These loans have been subject to the\nCompany’s loss mitigation process and foreclosure and/or charge-off proceedings have commenced.\nThe Company uses a dual risk rating scale that utilizes quantitative models and qualitative factors (“score cards”) to assist in determining the appropriate\nrisk rating for its commercial loans. This dual risk rating methodology incorporates a “probability of default” analysis which utilizes quantified metrics\nsuch as loan terms and financial performance, as well as a “loss given default” analysis which utilizes collateral values and economics of the market,\namong other attributes. Model outputs are reviewed and analyzed to ensure the projected risk levels are commensurate with underwriting and credit leader\nexpectations. The risk rating scale includes Probability of Default levels of 1 – 16 and Loss Given Default levels of A – I. The scale allows for more\ngranular recognition of risk and diversification of grading among traditional Pass grades.\nThe following is a reconciliation between the expanded risk rating scale and the Company’s traditional risk rating segments utilized within the commercial\nloan classes presented in the credit quality indicator tables.\n• 3DVV - Includes loans with an expanded risk rating of 1 through 11. Loans with a risk rating of 10 and 11 equate to loans included on management’s\n“watch list” and is intended to be utilized on a temporary basis for pass grade borrowers where a significant risk-modifying action is anticipated in the\nnear term.\n• 6SHFLDO\u00030HQWLRQ - Includes loans with an expanded risk rating of 12.\n• 6XEVWDQGDUG - Includes loans with an expanded risk rating of 13 and 14.\n• 'RXEWIXO\u0003DQG\u0003ORVV\u0003- Includes loans with an expanded risk rating of 15 and 16.\n24\nThe following table presents a summary of loans by credit quality indicator, as of September 30, 2024, segregated by class of loans.\nTerm Loans Amortized Cost Basis by Origination Year\nLines of LOC\nCredit Converted to\n(“LOC”) Term Loans\n2019 and Amortized Amortized\n(In thousands) 2024 (YTD) 2023 2022 2021 2020 Prior Cost Basis Cost Basis Total\nConsumer -

The allowance, in the judgment of management, is necessary to reserve for expected loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio. The\nCompany’s allowance for credit loss methodology includes reserve factors calculated to estimate current expected credit losses to amortized cost balances\nover the remaining contractual life of the portfolio, adjusted for prepayments, in accordance with ASC Topic 326-20, )LQDQFLDO\u0003,QVWUXPHQWV\u0003\u0010\u0003&UHGLW\n/RVVHV. Accordingly, the methodology is comprised of two components: individual assessments on loans with unique risk characteristics and collective\nassessments for loans that share similar risk characteristics. Loans with similar risk characteristics such as loan type, collateral type, and internal risk\nratings are aggregated for collective assessment. The Company uses statistically-based models that leverage assumptions about current and future economic\nconditions throughout the contractual life of the loan. Expected credit losses are estimated by either lifetime loss rates or expected loss cash flows based on\nthree key parameters: probability-of-default (“PD”), exposure-at-default (“EAD”), and loss-given-default (“LGD”). Future economic conditions are\nincorporated to the extent that they are reasonable and supportable. Beyond the reasonable and supportable periods, the economic variables revert to a\nhistorical equilibrium at a pace dependent on the state of the economy reflected within the economic scenarios. To determine the best estimate of credit\nlosses as of September 30, 2024, the Company utilized a probability-weighted, multiple-scenario approach consisting of Baseline, Upside (S1), and\nDownside (S3) scenarios published by Moody’s Analytics in June 2024 that was updated to reflect the U.S. economic outlook. The Company also includes\nqualitative adjustments to the allowance based on factors and considerations that have not otherwise been fully accounted for. These factors may include\nbut are not limited to portfolio trends and considerations, other economic considerations, policy actions, concentration risk, or imprecision risk.\n28\nLoans with similar risk characteristics such as loan type, collateral type, and internal risk ratings are aggregated into homogeneous segments for\nassessment. Reserve factors are based on estimated probability of default and loss given default for each segment. The estimates are determined based on\neconomic forecasts over the reasonable and supportable forecast period based on projected performance of economic variables that have a statistical\nrelationship with the historical loss experience of the segments.\nLoans that have unique risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. These evaluations are typically performed on loans with a deteriorated\ninternal risk rating. For a collateral-dependent loan, the Company’s evaluation process includes a valuation by appraisal or other collateral analysis adjusted\nfor selling costs, when appropriate. This valuation is compared to the remaining outstanding principal balance of the loan. If a loss is determined to be\nprobable, the loss is included in the allowance for credit losses as a specific allocation.\nLoans for which the repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of collateral and where the borrower is experiencing\nfinancial difficulty had an amortized cost of $109.6 million and $144.6 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, as further\ndetailed in the table below.

This reserve\nis maintained at a level management believes to be sufficient to absorb losses arising from unfunded loan commitments. The reserve for unfunded\ncommitments was $25.6 million for both periods ended September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The adequacy of the reserve for unfunded\ncommitments is determined quarterly based on methodology similar to the methodology for determining the allowance for credit losses. No adjustment was\nmade to the reserve for unfunded commitments during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, as it was considered sufficient to cover\nany loss expectations. During the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2023, $11.3 million and $16.3 million, respectively, was released from\nthe reserve for unfunded commitments primarily due to a decline in unfunded commitments resulting from customers utilizing lines of credit during the\nperiods.\n3URYLVLRQ\u0003IRU\u0003&UHGLW\u0003/RVVHV\nProvision for credit losses is determined by the Company as the amount to be added to the allowance for credit loss accounts for various types of financial\ninstruments including loans, securities and off-balance-sheet credit exposure after net charge-offs have been deducted to bring the allowance to a level\nwhich, in management’s best estimate, is necessary to absorb expected credit losses over the lives of the respective financial instruments.\nThe components of the provision for credit losses for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nProvision for credit losses related to:\nLoans $ 12,148 $ 20,222 $ 33,453 $ 36,199\nUnfunded commitments — (11,300) — (16,300)\nSecurities - HTM — — — 1,826\nSecurities - AFS — (1,200) — 10,274\nTotal $ 12,148 $ 7,722 $ 33,453 $ 31,999\n3XUFKDVHG\u0003&UHGLW\u0003'HWHULRUDWHG\u0003 ³3&'´ \u0003/RDQV\nPurchased loans that reflect a more-than-insignificant deterioration of credit from origination are considered PCD.

At lease commencement, the lease contract is reviewed to determine whether the contract is a\nfinance lease or an operating lease; a lease liability is recognized on a discounted basis, related to the Company’s obligation to make lease payments; and a\nright-of-use asset is also recognized related to the Company’s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. The Company accounts\nfor lease and non-lease components (such as taxes, insurance and common area maintenance costs) separately as such amounts are generally readily\ndeterminable under the lease contracts. Lease payments over the expected term are discounted using the Company’s FHLB advance rates for borrowings of\nsimilar term. If it is reasonably certain that a renewal or termination option will be exercised, the effects of such options are included in the determination\nof the expected lease term. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; the Company recognizes lease expense\nfor these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nThe Company’s leases are classified as operating leases with a term, including expected renewal or termination options, greater than one year, and are\nrelated to certain office facilities and office equipment. The following table presents information as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 related\nto the Company’s right-of-use lease assets, included in premises and equipment, and lease liabilities, included in accrued interest and other liabilities.\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023\nRight-of-use lease assets $ 69,331 $ 67,267\nLease liabilities 71,315 68,788\nWeighted average remaining lease term 8.45 years 8.81 years\nWeighted average discount rate 3.65 % 3.52 %\nOperating lease cost for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 was $4.0 million and $12.2 million, respectively, as compared to $4.2\nmillion and $11.7 million for the same periods in 2023.\nNOTE 6: PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT\nPremises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.

Goodwill impairment was neither\nindicated nor recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or the year ended December 31, 2023.\nCore deposit premiums represent the value of the relationships that acquired banks had with their deposit customers and are amortized over periods ranging\nfrom 10 years to 15 years and are periodically evaluated, at least annually, as to the recoverability of their carrying value. Other intangible assets represent\nthe value of other acquired relationships, including relationships with trust and wealth management customers, and are being amortized over various\nperiods ranging from 8 years to 15 years.\nChanges in the carrying amount and accumulated amortization of the Company’s core deposit premiums and other intangible assets at September 30, 2024\nand December 31, 2023 were as follows:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023\nCore deposit premiums:\nBalance, beginning of year $ 101,344 $ 116,016\nAmortization (10,327) (14,672)\nBalance, end of period 91,017 101,344\nBooks of business and other intangibles:\nBalance, beginning of year 11,301 12,935\nAmortization (1,225) (1,634)\nBalance, end of period 10,076 11,301\nTotal other intangible assets, net $ 101,093 $ 112,645\nThe carrying basis and accumulated amortization of the Company’s other intangible assets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were as follows:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023\nCore deposit premiums:\nGross carrying amount $ 177,624 $ 187,467\nAccumulated amortization (86,607) (86,123)\nCore deposit premiums, net 91,017 101,344\nBooks of business and other intangibles:\nGross carrying amount 22,068 22,068\nAccumulated amortization (11,992) (10,767)\nBooks of business and other intangibles, net 10,076 11,301\nTotal other intangible assets, net $ 101,093 $ 112,645\nThe Company’s estimated remaining amortization expense on other intangible assets as of September 30, 2024 is as follows:\nAmortization\n(In thousands) Year Expense\nRemainder of 2024 $ 3,851\n2025 12,819\n2026 12,346\n2027 12,218\n2028 11,312\nThereafter 48,547\nTotal $ 101,093\n33\nNOTE 8: TIME DEPOSITS\nTime deposits included approximately $1.65 billion and $1.73 billion of certificates of deposit over $250,000 at September 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023, respectively.

Benefits from tax positions should be recognized in the\nfinancial statements only when it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority that\nwould have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured at the largest\namount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Tax positions that previously failed to meet the more-\nlikely-than-not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Previously\nrecognized tax positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be derecognized in the first subsequent financial\nreporting period in which that threshold is no longer met. ASC Topic 740 also provides guidance on the accounting for and disclosure of unrecognized tax\nbenefits, interest and penalties. The Company has no history of expiring net operating loss carryforwards and is projecting significant pre-tax and financial\ntaxable income in future years. The Company expects to fully realize its deferred tax assets in the future.\nThe amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease in the future for various reasons including adding amounts for current tax year positions,\nexpiration of open income tax returns due to the statutes of limitation, changes in management’s judgment about the level of uncertainty, status of\nexaminations, litigation and legislative activity and the addition or elimination of uncertain tax positions.\nSection 382 of the Internal Revenue Code imposes an annual limit on the ability of a corporation that undergoes an “ownership change” to use its U.S. net\noperating losses to reduce its tax liability. The Company has engaged in three tax-free reorganization transactions in which acquired net operating losses are\nlimited pursuant to Section 382. In total, approximately $35.0 million of federal net operating losses subject to the IRC Section 382 annual limitation are\nexpected to be utilized by the Company. All of the acquired net operating loss carryforwards are expected to be fully utilized by 2036.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction. The Company’s U.S. federal income tax returns are open and subject to examinations\nfrom the 2020 tax year and forward. The Company’s various state income tax returns are generally open from the 2020 and later tax return years based on\nindividual state statute of limitations.\n35\nNOTE 10: SECURITIES SOLD UNDER AGREEMENTS TO REPURCHASE\nThe Company utilizes securities sold under agreements to repurchase to facilitate the needs of its customers and to facilitate secured short-term funding\nneeds. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are stated at the amount of cash received in connection with the transaction. The Company monitors\ncollateral levels on a continuous basis. The Company may be required to provide additional collateral based on the fair value of the underlying securities.\nSecurities pledged as collateral under repurchase agreements are maintained with the Company’s safekeeping agents.\nThe gross amount of recognized liabilities for repurchase agreements was $50.7 million and $67.6 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively. The remaining contractual maturity of the securities sold under agreements to repurchase in the consolidated balance sheets as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is presented in the following tables.\nRemaining Contractual Maturity of the Agreements\nOvernight and Greater than\n(In thousands) Continuous Up to 30 Days 30-90 Days 90 Days Total\nSeptember 30, 2024\nRepurchase agreements:\nU.S. Government agencies $ 50,671 $ — $ — $ — $ 50,671\nDecember 31, 2023\nRepurchase agreements:\nU.S. Government agencies $ 67,569 $ — $ — $ — $ 67,569\nNOTE 11: OTHER BORROWINGS AND SUBORDINATED NOTES AND DEBENTURES\nDebt at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 consisted of the following components:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023\nOther Borrowings\nFHLB advances, net of discount, due 2024 to 2033, 4.56% to 5.52% secured by real estate loans $ 1,028,016 $ 953,222\nOther long-term debt 17,862 19,144\nTotal other borrowings 1,045,878 972,366\nSubordinated Notes and Debentures\nSubordinated notes payable, due 4/1/2028, fixed-to-floating rate (fixed rate of 5.00% through 3/31/2023, floating\nrate of 2.15% above the three month LIBOR rate, reset quarterly)(1) 330,000 330,000\nSubordinated notes payable, net of premium adjustments, due 7/31/2030, fixed-to-floating rate (fixed rate of\n6.00% through 7/30/2025, floating rate of 5.92% above the three month SOFR rate, reset quarterly) 37,085 37,171\nUnamortized debt issuance costs (830) (1,030)\nTotal subordinated notes and debentures 366,255 366,141\nTotal other borrowings and subordinated debt $ 1,412,133 $ 1,338,507\n_________________________\n(1) The Company transitioned from the three month LIBOR rate to the three month Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), plus a comparable\nspread adjustment of 26.161 basis points, beginning with interest accrued on the notes from and after October 1, 2023.\n36\nIn March 2018, the Company issued $330.0 million in aggregate principal amount, of 5.00% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes (“Notes”) at a\npublic offering price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes. The Company incurred $3.6 million in debt issuance costs related to the\noffering during March 2018. The Notes will mature on April 1, 2028 and initially bore interest at a fixed rate of 5.00% per annum, payable semi-annually\nin arrears. From and including April 1, 2023 to, but excluding, the maturity date or the date of earlier redemption, the interest rate resets quarterly to an\nannual interest rate equal to the “then-current three month LIBOR rate” plus 215 basis points, payable quarterly in arrears, and the Company transitioned\nfrom the “then-current three month LIBOR rate” to the “three month SOFR, plus a comparable spread adjustment of 26.161 basis points,” beginning with\ninterest accrued on the Notes from and after October 1, 2023. The Notes will be subordinated in right of payment to the payment of the Company’s other\nexisting and future senior indebtedness, including all of its general creditors. The Notes are obligations of the Company only and are not obligations of, and\nare not guaranteed by, any of its subsidiaries. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes to repay certain outstanding\nindebtedness. The Notes qualify for Tier 2 capital treatment.\nThe Company assumed subordinated debt in an aggregate principal amount, net of premium adjustments, of $37.4 million in connection with the Spirit\nacquisition in April 2022 (the “Spirit Notes”). The Spirit Notes will mature on July 31, 2030, and initially bear interest at a fixed annual rate of 6.00%,\npayable quarterly, in arrears, to, but excluding, July 31, 2025. From and including July 31, 2025, to, but excluding, the maturity date or earlier redemption\ndate, the interest rate will reset quarterly to an interest rate per annum equal to a benchmark rate, which is expected to be the then-current three-month\nSOFR rate, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (provided, that in the event the benchmark rate is less than zero, the benchmark rate\nwill be deemed to be zero) plus 592 basis points, payable quarterly, in arrears.\nThe Company had total outstanding FHLB advances of $1.03 billion and $953.2 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively,\nwhich are primarily fixed rate, fixed term advances, are due less than one year from origination and therefore are classified as short-term advances by the\nCompany. At September 30, 2024, the FHLB advances outstanding were secured by mortgage loans and investment securities totaling approximately $7.02\nbillion and the Company had approximately $4.96 billion of additional advances available from the FHLB.\nThe Company’s long-term debt primarily includes subordinated debt and other notes payable. Aggregate annual maturities of long-term debt at\nSeptember 30, 2024, are as follows:\nYear (In thousands)\nRemainder of 2024 $ 447\n2025 1,822\n2026 1,824\n2027 1,919\n2028 332,798\nThereafter 48,323\nTotal $ 387,133\nNOTE 12: CONTINGENT LIABILITIES\nIn the ordinary course of its operations, the Company and its subsidiaries are parties to various legal proceedings incidental to the conduct of its business,\nincluding proceedings based on breach of contract claims, lender liability claims, and other ordinary-course claims, some of which seek substantial relief or\ndamages.\nThe Company establishes reserves for legal proceedings when potential losses become probable and can be reasonably estimated. While the ultimate\nresolution (including amounts thereof) of any legal proceedings cannot be determined at this time, based on information presently available and after\nconsultation with legal counsel, management believes that the ultimate outcome in such proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will not have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the Company’s business, consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. It is possible, however, that future\ndevelopments could result in an unfavorable outcome for or resolution of any of these proceedings, which may be material to the Company’s results of\noperations for a given fiscal period.\n37\nNOTE 13: CAPITAL STOCK\nOn February 27, 2009, at a special meeting, the Company’s shareholders approved an amendment to the Articles of Incorporation to establish 40,040,000\nauthorized shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value. On April 27, 2022, the Company’s shareholders approved amendments to the Company’s Articles of\nIncorporation to remove an $80.0 million cap on the aggregate liquidation preference associated with the preferred stock and increase the number of\nauthorized shares of the Company’s Class A common stock from 175,000,000 to 350,000,000.\nOn October 29, 2019, the Company filed Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (“October Amended Articles”) with the Arkansas Secretary of\nState. The October Amended Articles classified and designated Series D Preferred Stock, Par Value $0.01 Per Share (“Series D Preferred Stock”), out of\nthe Company’s authorized preferred stock. On November 30, 2021, the Company redeemed all of the Series D Preferred Stock, including accrued and\nunpaid dividends. On April 27, 2022, the Company’s shareholders approved an amendment to the Company’s Articles of Incorporation to remove the\nclassification and designation for the Series D Preferred Stock. As of September 30, 2024, there were no shares of preferred stock issued or outstanding.\nIn January 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program (“2022 Program”) under which the Company could repurchase\nup to $175.0 million of its Class A common stock currently issued and outstanding. Because the 2022 Program was set to terminate on January 31, 2024,\nthe Company’s Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program in January 2024 (“2024 Program”) under which the Company may\nrepurchase up to $175.0 million of its Class A common stock currently issued and outstanding. The 2024 Program will be executed in accordance with\nRule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and will terminate on January 31, 2026 (unless terminated sooner).\nUnder the 2024 Program, which replaced the 2022 Program, the Company may repurchase shares of its common stock through open market and privately\nnegotiated transactions or otherwise. The timing, pricing, and amount of any repurchases under the 2024 Program will be determined by the Company’s\nmanagement at its discretion based on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, trading volume and market price of the Company’s common stock,\ncorporate considerations, the Company’s working capital and investment requirements, general market and economic conditions, and legal requirements.\nThe 2024 Program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any common stock and may be modified, discontinued, or suspended at any time without\nprior notice. The Company anticipates funding for this 2024 Program to come from available sources of liquidity, including cash on hand and future cash\nflow.\nNo shares were repurchased during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024. Market conditions and the Company’s capital needs,\namong other things, will drive decisions regarding additional, future stock repurchases. During the three and nine month periods ended September 30,\n2023, the Company repurchased 1,128,962 shares at an average price of $17.69 per share and 2,257,049 shares at an average price of $17.72 per share,\nrespectively, under the 2022 Program.\nNOTE 14: UNDIVIDED PROFITS\nSimmons Bank, the Company’s subsidiary bank, is subject to legal limitations on dividends that can be paid to the parent company without prior approval\nof the applicable regulatory agencies. The approval of the Commissioner of the Arkansas State Bank Department is required if the total of all dividends\ndeclared by an Arkansas state bank in any calendar year exceeds seventy-five percent (75%) of the total of its net profits, as defined, for that year combined\nwith seventy-five percent (75%) of its retained net profits of the preceding year. Since Simmons Bank is also under supervision of the Federal Reserve, it is\nfurther limited if the total of all dividends declared in any calendar year by Simmons Bank exceeds its net income to date for that year combined with its\nretained net profits for the preceding two years. At September 30, 2024, undivided profits of Simmons Bank were approximately $536.2 million, none of\nwhich were available for payment of dividends to the Company, without prior regulatory approval.\nThe risk-based capital guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board and the Arkansas State Bank Department include the definitions for (1) a well-capitalized\ninstitution, (2) an adequately-capitalized institution, and (3) an undercapitalized institution. The criteria for a well-capitalized institution are: a 5% “Tier l\nleverage capital” ratio, an 8% “Tier 1 risk-based capital” ratio, 10% “total risk-based capital” ratio; and a 6.5% “common equity Tier 1 (CET1)” ratio.\nThe Company and Simmons Bank must hold a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% composed of CET1 capital above its minimum risk-based capital\nrequirements. Failure to meet this capital conservation buffer would result in additional limits on dividends, other distributions and discretionary bonuses.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company and Simmons Bank met all capital adequacy requirements, including the capital conservation buffer, under the\nBasel III Capital Rules. The Company’s CET1 ratio was 12.06% at September 30, 2024.\n38\nNOTE 15: STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nThe Company’s Board of Directors has adopted various stock-based compensation plans, including the 2023 Stock and Incentive Plan that was approved\nby shareholders and became effective April 18, 2023. The plans provide for the grant of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock\nappreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance stock units and stock awards. Pursuant to the plans, shares are reserved for\nfuture issuance by the Company upon exercise of stock options or awards of restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance stock units or stock awards\ngranted to directors, officers and other key employees or consultants.\nThe table below summarizes the transactions under the Company’s active stock-based compensation plans for the nine months ended September 30, 2024:\nStock Options Non-vested Stock Awards Non-vested Stock Units\nOutstanding Outstanding Outstanding\nWeighted Weighted Weighted\nAverage Average Average\nNumber Exercise Number Grant-Dat e Number Grant-Dat e\n(Shares in thousands) of Shares Price of Shares Fair Value of Shares Fair Value\nBeginning balance, January 1, 2024 447 $ 22.56 — $ — 1,273 $ 24.23\nGranted — — — — 853 18.81\nStock options exercised (38) 20.29 — — — —\nStock awards/units vested (earned) — — — — (404) 24.63\nForfeited/expired (37) 22.52 — — (176) 25.42\nBalance, September 30, 2024 372 $ 22.80 — $ — 1,546 $ 21.01\nExercisable, September 30, 2024 372 $ 22.80\nThe following table summarizes information about stock options under the plans outstanding at September 30, 2024:\nOptions Outstanding Options Exercisable\nWeighted\nAverage Weighted Weighted\nNumber Remainin g Average Number Average\nof Shares Contractual Exercise of Shares Exercise\nRange of Exercise Prices (In thousand s) Life (Years) Price (In thousand s) Price\n$ 20.29 — $ 20.29 3 0.25 $20.29 3 $20.29\n22.20 — 22.20 51 0.48 22.20 51 22.20\n22.75 — 22.75 249 0.85 22.75 249 22.75\n23.51 — 23.51 62 1.30 23.51 62 23.51\n24.07 — 24.07 7 0.96 24.07 7 24.07\n$ 20.29 — $ 24.07 372 0.87 $22.80 372 $22.80\nThe table below summarizes the Company’s performance stock unit activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024:\n(In thousands) Performance Stock Units\nNon-vested, January 1, 2024 492\nGranted 188\nVested (earned) (42)\nForfeited (112)\nNon-vested, September 30, 2024 526\n39\nStock-based compensation expense was $8.9 million and $9.6 million during the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nStock-based compensation expense is recognized ratably over the requisite service period for all stock-based awards. There was no unrecognized stock-\nbased compensation expense related to stock options at September 30, 2024. Unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to non-vested stock\nawards and stock units was $18.1 million at September 30, 2024. At such date, the weighted-average period over which this unrecognized expense is\nexpected to be recognized was 1.7 years.\nThe intrinsic value of stock options outstanding and stock options exercisable at September 30, 2024 was $4,000. Aggregate intrinsic value represents the\ndifference between the Company’s closing stock price on the last trading day of the period, which was $21.54 as of September 30, 2024, and the exercise\nprice multiplied by the number of options outstanding. There total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023 was $48,000 and $6,000, respectively.\nThe fair value of the Company’s employee stock options granted is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. This\nmodel requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, changes to which can materially affect the fair value estimate. There were no stock options\ngranted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nNOTE 16: EARNINGS PER SHARE (“EPS”)\nBasic EPS is computed by dividing reported net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding\nduring each period. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing reported net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average common shares\nand all potential dilutive common shares outstanding during the period.\nThe computation of earnings per share is as follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(In thousands, except per share data) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet income available to common stockholders $ 24,740 $ 47,247 $ 104,374 $ 151,150\nAverage common shares outstanding 125,538 125,914 125,449 126,730\nAverage potential dilutive common shares 461 370 461 370\nAverage diluted common shares 125,999 126,284 125,910 127,100\nBasic earnings per share $ 0.20 $ 0.38 $ 0.83 $ 1.19\nDiluted earnings per share $ 0.20 $ 0.37 $ 0.83 $ 1.19\nThere were 371,790 stock options excluded from the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 earnings per share calculation due to the related\nstock option exercise price exceeding the average market price of the Company’s stock during the periods.

Included in other income during the nine month period ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 was a $4.0 million legal reserve recapture associated with previously disclosed legal matters, coupled with fair value adjustments\nassociated with certain equity investments and death benefits from bank owned life insurance.\nOther operating expenses consisted of the following:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nProfessional services $ 5,554 $ 4,801 $ 15,950 $ 14,443\nPostage 2,296 2,283 6,507 6,973\nTelephone 1,580 1,750 4,860 5,182\nCredit card expense 3,201 3,356 9,744 9,989\nMarketing 7,059 5,787 20,066 18,041\nSoftware and technology 10,970 10,707 32,585 31,299\nOperating supplies 562 474 1,808 1,762\nAmortization of intangibles 3,851 4,097 11,553 12,291\nBranch right sizing expense 410 547 1,165 1,621\nOther expense 9,057 8,780 28,167 26,993\nTotal other operating expenses $ 44,540 $ 42,582 $ 132,405 $ 128,594\nNOTE 19: CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS\nFrom time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries have made loans, other extensions of credit, and vendor contracts to directors, officers, their associates\nand members of their immediate families. Additionally, some directors, officers and their associates and members of their immediate families have placed\ndeposits with the Company’s subsidiary bank, Simmons Bank. Such loans and other extensions of credit, deposits and vendor contracts (which were not\nmaterial) were made in the ordinary course of business, on substantially the same terms (including interest rates and collateral) as those prevailing at the\ntime for comparable transactions with unrelated persons or through a competitive bid process. Further, in management’s opinion, these extensions of credit\ndid not involve more than normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features.\nNOTE 20: COMMITMENTS AND CREDIT RISK\nThe Company grants agribusiness, commercial and residential loans to customers primarily throughout Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee\nand Texas, along with credit card loans to customers throughout the United States. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as\nlong as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses\nand may require payment of a fee. Since a portion of the commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not\nnecessarily represent future cash requirements. Each customer’s creditworthiness is evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if\ndeemed necessary, is based on management’s credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, inventory,\nproperty, plant and equipment, commercial real estate and residential real estate.\nAt September 30, 2024, the Company had outstanding commitments to extend credit aggregating approximately $759.1 million and $3.96 billion for credit\ncard commitments and other loan commitments, respectively. At December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding commitments to extend credit\naggregating approximately $738.2 million and $4.17 billion for credit card commitments and other loan commitments, respectively.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had outstanding commitments to originate fixed-rate mortgage loans of approximately $27.4 million. At\nDecember 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding commitments to originate fixed-rate mortgage loans of approximately $16.6 million. The commitments\nextend over varying periods of time with the majority being disbursed within a thirty-day period.\n41\nStandby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees\nare primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond financing and similar transactions. The credit\nrisk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers. The Company had total outstanding letters\nof credit amounting to $58.4 million and $54.2 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, with terms ranging from 9 months to\n15 years. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no deferred revenue under standby letter of credit agreements.\nThe Company has purchased letters of credit from the FHLB as security for certain public deposits. The amount of the letters of credit was $1.02 billion\nand $580.8 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and they expire in less than one year from issuance.\nNOTE 21: FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nASC Topic 820, )DLU\u00039DOXH\u00030HDVXUHPHQWV defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value\nmeasurements.\nASC Topic 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market\nparticipants at the measurement date. The guidance also establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use\nof unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC Topic 820 describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:\n• /HYHO\u0003\u0014\u0003,QSXWV – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n• /HYHO\u0003\u0015\u0003,QSXWV – Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for\nsimilar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for\nsubstantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\n• /HYHO\u0003\u0016\u0003,QSXWV – Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or\nliabilities.\nIn general, fair value is based upon quoted market prices, where available. If such quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally\ndeveloped models that primarily use, as inputs, observable market-based parameters. Valuation adjustments may be made to ensure that financial\ninstruments are recorded at fair value. These adjustments may include amounts to reflect counterparty credit quality and the Company’s creditworthiness,\namong other things, as well as unobservable parameters. Any such valuation adjustments are applied consistently over time. The Company’s valuation\nmethodologies may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. While management\nbelieves the Company’s valuation methodologies are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or\nassumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Furthermore,\nthe reported fair value amounts have not been comprehensively revalued since the presentation dates, and therefore, estimates of fair value after the balance\nsheet date may differ significantly from the amounts presented herein. A more detailed description of the valuation methodologies used for assets and\nliabilities measured at fair value, as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy, is set forth below.\nFollowing is a description of the inputs and valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis and recognized in the\naccompanying consolidated balance sheets, as well as the general classification of such assets pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.\n$YDLODEOH\u0010IRU\u0010VDOH\u0003VHFXULWLHV – Where quoted market prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation\nhierarchy. Level 1 securities would include highly liquid government bonds, mortgage products and certain other financial products. Other securities\nclassified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value utilizing Level 2 inputs. For these securities, the Company obtains fair value measurements from an\nindependent pricing service. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S.\nTreasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the security’s terms and\nconditions, among other things. In order to ensure the fair values are consistent with ASC Topic 820, the Company periodically checks the fair values by\ncomparing them to another pricing source, such as Bloomberg. The availability of pricing confirms Level 2 classification in the fair value hierarchy. The\nthird-party pricing service is subject to an annual review of internal controls. In certain cases where Level 1 or Level 2 inputs are not available, securities\nare classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy. The Company’s investment in U.S. Treasury securities, if any, is reported at fair value utilizing Level 1\ninputs. The remainder of the Company’s available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value utilizing Level 2 inputs.\n42\n0RUWJDJH\u0003ORDQV\u0003KHOG\u0003IRU\u0003VDOH – Mortgage loans held for sale are reported at fair value on an aggregate basis. Adjustments to fair value are recognized\nmonthly and reflected in earnings. In determining the fair value of loans held for sale, the Company may consider outstanding investor commitments,\ndiscounted cash flow analyses with market assumptions or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. Such loans are classified within\neither Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Where assumptions are made using significant unobservable inputs, such loans held for sale are\nclassified as Level 3. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the aggregate fair value of mortgage loans held for sale exceeded their cost.\n'HULYDWLYH\u0003LQVWUXPHQWV – The Company’s derivative instruments are reported at fair value utilizing Level 2 inputs. The Company obtains fair value\nmeasurements from dealer quotes.\nThe following table sets forth the Company’s financial assets by level within the fair value hierarchy that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis\nas of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nFair Value Measurements Using\nQuoted Prices in\nActive Markets fo r Significant Other Significant\nIdentical Assets Observable Inputs Unobservable In puts\n(In thousands) Fair Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nSeptember 30, 2024\nAvailable-for-sale securities\nU.S. Treasury $ 1,290 $ 1,290 $ — $ —\nU.S. Government agencies 58,397 — 58,397 —\nMortgage-backed securities 1,510,402 — 1,510,402 —\nState and political subdivisions 898,178 — 898,178 —\nOther securities 222,827 — 222,827 —\nMortgage loans held for sale 8,270 — — 8,270\nDerivative asset 108,170 — 108,170 —\nDerivative liability (28,397) — (28,397) —\nDecember 31, 2023\nAvailable-for-sale securities\nU.S. Treasury $ 2,254 $ 2,254 $ — $ —\nU.S. Government agencies 72,502 — 72,502 —\nMortgage-backed securities 1,940,307 — 1,940,307 —\nStates and political subdivisions 902,793 — 902,793 —\nOther securities 234,297 — 234,297 —\nMortgage loans held for sale 9,373 — — 9,373\nDerivative asset 130,271 — 130,271 —\nDerivative liability (27,584) — (27,584) —\nCertain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, the instruments are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis\nbut are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include the following:\n,QGLYLGXDOO\\\u0003DVVHVVHG\u0003ORDQV\u0003 FROODWHUDO\u0010GHSHQGHQW – When the Company has a specific expectation to initiate, or has initiated, foreclosure proceedings, and\nwhen the repayment of a loan is expected to be substantially dependent on the liquidation of underlying collateral, the relationship is deemed collateral-\ndependent. Fair value of the loan is determined by establishing an allowance for credit loss for any exposure based on the valuation of the underlying\ncollateral. The valuation of the collateral is determined by either an independent third-party appraisal or other collateral analysis. Discounts can be made by\nthe Company based upon the overall evaluation of the independent appraisal. Collateral-dependent loans are classified within Level 3 of the fair value\nhierarchy due to the unobservable inputs used in determining their fair value such as collateral values and the borrower’s underlying financial condition.\nCollateral values supporting the individually assessed loans are evaluated quarterly for updates to appraised values or adjustments due to non-current\nvaluations.\n43\n)RUHFORVHG\u0003DVVHWV\u0003DQG\u0003RWKHU\u0003UHDO\u0003HVWDWH\u0003RZQHG – Foreclosed assets and other real estate owned are reported at fair value, less estimated costs to sell. At\nforeclosure, if the fair value, less estimated costs to sell, of the real estate acquired is less than the Company’s recorded investment in the related loan, a\nwrite-down is recognized through a charge to the allowance for credit losses. Additionally, valuations are periodically performed by management and any\nsubsequent reduction in value is recognized by a charge to income. The fair value of foreclosed assets and other real estate owned is estimated using Level\n3 inputs based on unobservable market data.\nThe significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) used in the fair value measurement of collateral for collateral-dependent loans and foreclosed assets primarily\nrelate to the specialized discounting criteria applied to the borrower’s reported amount of collateral. The amount of the collateral discount depends upon the\ncondition and marketability of the collateral, as well as other factors which may affect the collectability of the loan. Management’s assessment of the\nsignificance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset. It is reasonably\npossible that a change in the estimated fair value for instruments measured using Level 3 inputs could occur in the future. As the Company’s primary\nobjective in the event of default would be to liquidate the collateral to settle the outstanding balance of the loan, collateral that is less marketable would\nreceive a larger discount.\nThe following table sets forth the Company’s assets by level within the fair value hierarchy that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nFair Value Measurements Using\nQuoted Prices in Significant\nActive Markets for Significant Other Unobservable\nIdentical Assets Observable Inputs Inputs\n(In thousands) Fair Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3 )\nSeptember 30, 2024\nIndividually assessed loans (1) (2) (collateral-dependent) $ 109,648 $ — $ — $ 109,648\nForeclosed assets and other real estate owned (1) 902 — — 902\nDecember 31, 2023\nIndividually assessed loans (1) (2) (collateral-dependent) $ 144,604 $ — $ — $ 144,604\nForeclosed assets and other real estate owned (1) 3,646 — — 3,646\n________________________\n(1) These amounts represent the resulting carrying amounts on the consolidated balance sheets for collateral-dependent loans and foreclosed assets\nand other real estate owned for which fair value re-measurements took place during the period.\n(2) Identified reserves of $33.3 million and $18.7 million were related to collateral-dependent loans for which fair value re-measurements took place\nduring the periods ended September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nASC Topic 825, )LQDQFLDO\u0003,QVWUXPHQWV, requires disclosure in annual and interim financial statements of the fair value of financial assets and financial\nliabilities, including those financial assets and financial liabilities that are not measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis or nonrecurring basis.\nThe following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments not previously disclosed.\n&DVK\u0003DQG\u0003FDVK\u0003HTXLYDOHQWV – The carrying amount for cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value (Level 1).\n,QWHUHVW\u0003EHDULQJ\u0003EDODQFHV\u0003GXH\u0003IURP\u0003EDQNV – The fair value of interest bearing balances due from banks – time is estimated using a discounted cash flow\ncalculation that applies the rates currently offered on deposits of similar remaining maturities (Level 2).\n+HOG\u0010WR\u0010PDWXULW\\\u0003VHFXULWLHV – Fair values for held-to-maturity securities equal quoted market prices, if available, such as for highly liquid government\nbonds (Level 1). If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are estimated based on quoted market prices of similar securities. For these securities,\nthe Company obtains fair value measurements from an independent pricing service. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include\ndealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds,\ncredit information and the security’s terms and conditions, among other things (Level 2). In certain cases where Level 1 or Level 2 inputs are not available,\nsecurities are classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy.\n44\n/RDQV – The fair value of loans is estimated by discounting the future cash flows, using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers\nwith similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities. Additional factors considered include the type of loan and related collateral, variable or\nfixed rate, classification status, remaining term, interest rate, historical delinquencies, loan to value ratios, current market rates and remaining loan balance.\nThe loans were grouped together according to similar characteristics and were treated in the aggregate when applying various valuation techniques. The\ndiscount rates used for loans were based on current market rates for new originations of similar loans. Estimated credit losses were also factored into the\nprojected cash flows of the loans. The fair value of loans is estimated on an exit price basis incorporating the above factors (Level 3).\n'HSRVLWV – The fair value of demand deposits, savings accounts and money market deposits is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (i.e.,\ntheir carrying amount) (Level 2). The fair value of fixed-maturity time deposits is estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies the rates\ncurrently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities (Level 3).\n)HGHUDO\u0003)XQGV\u0003SXUFKDVHG\u000f\u0003VHFXULWLHV\u0003VROG\u0003XQGHU\u0003DJUHHPHQW\u0003WR\u0003UHSXUFKDVH\u0003DQG\u0003VKRUW\u0010WHUP\u0003GHEW – The carrying amount for federal funds purchased, securities\nsold under agreement to repurchase and short-term debt are a reasonable estimate of fair value (Level 2).\n2WKHU\u0003ERUURZLQJV – For short-term instruments, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value.

For fixed rate\nloan commitments, fair value also considers the difference between current levels of interest rates and the committed rates. The fair values of letters of\ncredit and lines of credit are based on fees currently charged for similar agreements or on the estimated cost to terminate or otherwise settle the obligations\nwith the counterparties at the reporting date.\nThe fair value of a financial instrument is the current amount that would be exchanged between willing parties, other than in a forced liquidation. Fair value\nis best determined based upon quoted market prices. However, in many instances, there are no quoted market prices for the Company’s various financial\ninstruments. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques.\nThose techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. Accordingly, the fair\nvalue estimates may not be realized in an immediate settlement of the instrument.\n45\nThe estimated fair values, and related carrying amounts, of the Company’s financial instruments are as follows:\nCarrying Fair Value Measurements\n(In thousands) Amount Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nSeptember 30, 2024\nFinancial assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 603,402 $ 603,402 $ — $ — $ 603,402\nInterest bearing balances due from banks - time 100 — 100 — 100\nHeld-to-maturity securities, net 3,658,700 — 3,109,610 — 3,109,610\nInterest receivable 125,700 — 125,700 — 125,700\nLoans, net 17,102,817 — — 16,174,963 16,174,963\nFinancial liabilities:\nNoninterest bearing transaction accounts 4,521,715 — 4,521,715 — 4,521,715\nInterest bearing transaction accounts and savings deposits 10,863,945 — 10,863,945 — 10,863,945\nTime deposits 6,549,774 — — 6,542,007 6,542,007\nFederal funds purchased and securities sold under\nagreements to repurchase 51,071 — 51,071 — 51,071\nOther borrowings 1,045,878 — 1,045,075 — 1,045,075\nSubordinated notes and debentures 366,255 — 361,885 — 361,885\nInterest payable 63,210 — 63,210 — 63,210\nDecember 31, 2023\nFinancial assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 614,092 $ 614,092 $ — $ — $ 614,092\nInterest bearing balances due from banks - time 100 — 100 — 100\nHeld-to-maturity securities, net 3,726,288 — 3,135,370 — 3,135,370\nInterest receivable 122,430 — 122,430 — 122,430\nLoans, net 16,620,439 — — 15,734,766 15,734,766\nFinancial liabilities:\nNoninterest bearing transaction accounts 4,800,880 — 4,800,880 — 4,800,880\nInterest bearing transaction accounts and savings deposits 10,997,425 — 10,997,425 — 10,997,425\nTime deposits 6,446,673 — — 6,414,222 6,414,222\nFederal funds purchased and securities sold under\nagreements to repurchase 67,969 — 67,969 — 67,969\nOther borrowings 972,366 — 970,846 — 970,846\nSubordinated notes and debentures 366,141 — 349,424 — 349,424\nInterest payable 35,618 — 35,618 — 35,618\nThe fair value of commitments to extend credit, letters of credit and lines of credit is not presented since management believes the fair value to be\ninsignificant.\n46\nNOTE 22: DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS\nThe Company utilizes derivative instruments to manage exposure to various types of interest rate risk for itself and its customers within policy guidelines.\nTransactions should only be entered into with an associated underlying exposure. All derivative instruments are carried at fair value.\nDerivative contracts involve the risk of dealing with institutional derivative counterparties and their ability to meet contractual terms. Institutional\ncounterparties must have an investment grade credit rating and be approved by the Company’s asset/liability management committee. In arranging these\nproducts for its customers, the Company assumes additional credit risk from the customer and from the dealer counterparty with whom the transaction is\nundertaken. Credit risk exists due to the default credit risk created in the exchange of the payments over a period of time. Credit exposure on interest rate\nswaps is limited to the net favorable value and interest payments of all swaps with each counterparty. Access to collateral in the event of default is\nreasonably assured. Therefore, credit exposure may be reduced by the amount of collateral pledged by the counterparty.\n+HGJH\u00036WUXFWXUHV\nThe Company will seek to enter derivative structures that most effectively address the risk exposure and structural terms of the underlying position being\nhedged. The term and notional principal amount of a hedge transaction will not exceed the term or principal amount of the underlying exposure. In\naddition, the Company will use hedge indices which are the same as, or highly correlated to, the index or rate on the underlying exposure. Derivative credit\nexposure is monitored on an ongoing basis for each customer transaction and aggregate exposure to each counterparty is tracked. The Company has set a\nmaximum outstanding notional contract amount at 25% of the Company’s assets.\n)DLU\u00039DOXH\u0003+HGJHV\nFor derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting loss or\ngain on the hedged asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current earnings. The gain or loss on the derivative instrument is\npresented on the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item. During the third quarter of 2021, the Company began utilizing\ninterest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges to mitigate the effect of changing interest rates on the fair values of fixed rate callable AFS securities.\nThe hedging strategy converts the fixed interest rates to variable interest rates based on federal funds rates. The two year forward start date for these swaps\noccurred during late third quarter of 2023 and involves the payment of fixed interest rates with a weighted average of 1.21% in exchange for variable\ninterest rates based on federal funds rates. For the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, the net amount included in interest income on investment\nsecurities in the consolidated statements of income related to fair value hedges was $33.8 million.\nThe following table summarizes the fair value hedges recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nBalance Sheet Weighted Average\n(In thousands) Location Pay Rate Receive Rate Notional Fair Value Notional Fair Value\nDerivative assets Other assets 1.21% Federal Funds $ 1,001,715 $ 79,743 $ 1,001,715 $ 102,644\nThe following amounts were recorded on the balance sheet related to carrying amounts and cumulative basis adjustments for fair value hedges.\nCumulative Amount of Fair Value Hedging\nAdjustment Included in the Carrying Amount\nCarrying Amount of Hedged Assets of Hedged Assets\nLine Item on the Balance Sheet (In thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nInvestment securities - Available-for-sale $ 959,342 $ 940,010 $ 80,038 $ 104,408\n47\n&XVWRPHU\u00035LVN\u00030DQDJHPHQW\u0003,QWHUHVW\u00035DWH\u00036ZDSV\nThe Company’s qualified loan customers have the opportunity to participate in its interest rate swap program for the purpose of managing interest rate risk\non their variable rate loans with the Company. The Company enters into such agreements with customers, then offsetting agreements are executed between\nthe Company and an approved dealer counterparty to minimize market risk from changes in interest rates. The counterparty contracts are identical to\ncustomer contracts in terms of notional amounts, interest rates, and maturity dates, except for a fixed pricing spread or fee paid to the Company by the\ndealer counterparty.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nAs permitted by SEC rules, management presents a sequential quarterly analysis of the Company’s performance as we believe that comparing current\nquarter results to those of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is more useful in identifying current business trends and provides a more relevant\nanalysis of our business results. Accordingly, we have compared our results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 to our results of\noperations for the three months ended June 30, 2024, as applicable, throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\nResults of Operations. For additional information regarding the Company’s results for the three months ended June 30, 2024, please refer to our second\nquarter Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August 6, 2024.\nOVERVIEW\nDuring the first nine months of 2024, we delivered solid results that clearly reflect our driving principles centered on a strong risk management culture,\nprofitability and organic growth. While we continue to operate against a backdrop of uncertainty concerning the macroeconomic environment and the\ntiming of lower interest rates, we are comforted by our strong capital and liquidity positions:\n• Total deposits as of September 30, 2024 were $21.94 billion, compared to $22.24 billion as of December 31, 2023. Uninsured non-collateralized\ndeposits as of September 30, 2024 were approximately $4.66 billion, or 21% of total deposits.\n• Capital levels were steady during the quarter, with all regulatory capital ratios remaining significantly above “well-capitalized” guidelines as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 (see Table 11 in the 5LVN\u0010%DVHG\u0003&DSLWDO section below). As of September 30, 2024, our ratio of common equity to total assets was\n12.94%, the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets was 8.15% and our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 9.57%.\n• Key credit quality metrics as of September 30, 2024 also remained solid, with our nonperforming loan coverage ratio at 229% and our allowance for\ncredit losses as a percent of total loans ratio was 1.35%.\n• Significant liquidity position with a loan to deposit ratio of 79% and 76% as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Additional\nliquidity sources available to us as of September 30, 2024 totaled $11.17 billion and our uninsured, non-collateralized deposit coverage ratio was 2.4x.\nOur net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $24.7 million, or $0.20 diluted earnings per share, compared to net income of $40.8\nmillion, or $0.32 diluted earnings per share, for the three months ended June 30, 2024. Included in the results for the three months ended September 30,\n2024 were the impacts of a loss on sale of securities; results for the three months ended June 30, 2024 included certain items related to a FDIC special\nassessment. Also included in both comparative period end results were certain items related to our branch right sizing initiatives, termination of vendor and\nsoftware services, and early retirement program costs. Excluding these certain items and the tax effect, adjusted earnings for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 were $46.0 million, or $0.37 adjusted diluted earnings per share, compared to $41.9 million, or $0.33 adjusted diluted earnings per\nshare, for the three months ended June 30, 2024. During the third quarter of 2024, given prevailing market conditions, we executed a strategic decision to\nsell approximately $251.5 million of AFS investment securities with a weighted average yield of approximately 1.29%, resulting in an after-tax loss of\n$21.0 million. The proceeds from the sale were used to pay off higher rate wholesale funding consisting of Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances.\nNet income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $104.4 million, or $0.83 diluted earnings per share, compared to net income of $151.2\nmillion, or $1.19 diluted earnings per share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Included in the results for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 were certain items related to a FDIC special assessment and termination of vendor and software services; results for the nine months\nended September 30, 2023 included certain items related to acquisition costs. Also included in each comparative period end results were certain items\nrelated to branch right sizing initiatives, loss on sale of securities and early retirement program costs. Excluding these certain items and the tax effect,\nadjusted earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $128.3 million, or $1.02 adjusted diluted earnings per share, compared to $157.5\nmillion, or $1.24 adjusted diluted earnings per share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nIn 2024, Simmons Bank was recognized by 8\u00116\u0011\u00031HZV\u0003 \u0003:RUOG\u00035HSRUW\u0003as one of the “2024-2025 Best Companies to Work For in the South” and by )RUEHV\nas one of “America’s Best-In-State Banks 2024 in Tennessee” and one of “America’s Best-In-State Employers 2024 in Missouri”.\n50\nCredit trends throughout the industry are beginning to normalize after an extended period at historically low levels. Our asset quality metrics remain strong\nand reflect our conservative credit culture, as well as our focus on maintaining disciplined pricing and conservative underwriting standards given the\ncurrent economic environment. Total nonperforming loans as of September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023, and September 30, 2023 were $101.7 million,\n$84.5 million, and $81.9 million, respectively. Non-performing assets as a percent of total assets were 0.38% at September 30, 2024, compared to 0.33% at\nDecember 31, 2023 and 0.32% at September 30, 2023.\nAs of September 30, 2024, stockholders’ equity was $3.53 billion, book value per share was $28.11 and tangible book value per share was $16.78.\nTotal loans were $17.34 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to $16.85 billion at December 31, 2023. Our unfunded commitments were $3.96 billion\nand $4.17 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Our commercial loan pipeline totaled $1.24 billion as of September 30,\n2024, compared to $948.2 million at December 31, 2023.\nIn our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation in this Item 2, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations,” we provide certain financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States (“US GAAP”). We believe the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides a meaningful basis for\nperiod-to-period and company-to-company comparisons, which we believe will assist investors and analysts in analyzing the adjusted financial measures of\nthe Company and predicting future performance. See the *$$3\u00035HFRQFLOLDWLRQ\u0003RI\u00031RQ\u0010*$$3\u0003)LQDQFLDO\u00030HDVXUHV\u0003section below for additional discussion\nand reconciliations of non-GAAP measures.\nSimmons First National Corporation is a Mid-South based financial holding company that, as of September 30, 2024, has approximately $27.3 billion in\nconsolidated assets and, through its subsidiaries, conducts financial operations in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOverview\nWe follow accounting and reporting policies that conform, in all material respects, to US GAAP and to general practices within the financial services\nindustry. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\namounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. While we base estimates on historical experience, current information and other\nfactors deemed to be relevant, actual results could differ from those estimates.\nWe consider accounting estimates to be critical to reported financial results if (i) the accounting estimate requires management to make assumptions about\nmatters that are highly uncertain and (ii) different estimates that management reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period,\nor changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, could have a material impact on our financial statements.\nThe accounting policies that we view as critical to us are those relating to estimates and judgments regarding (a) the determination of the adequacy of the\nallowance for credit losses, (b) acquisition accounting and valuation of loans, (c) the valuation of goodwill and the useful lives applied to intangible assets,\n(d) the valuation of stock-based compensation plans and (e) income taxes.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe allowance for credit losses is a reserve established through a provision for credit losses charged to expense, which represents management’s best\nestimate of lifetime expected losses based on reasonable and supportable forecasts, quantitative factors, and other qualitative considerations. The\nallowance, in the judgment of management, is necessary to reserve for expected credit losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio. Our allowance for\ncredit loss methodology includes reserve factors calculated to estimate current expected credit losses to amortized cost balances over the remaining\ncontractual life of the portfolio, adjusted for prepayments, in accordance with ASC Topic 326-20, )LQDQFLDO\u0003,QVWUXPHQWV\u0003\u0010\u0003&UHGLW\u0003/RVVHV. For further\ninformation see the section $OORZDQFH\u0003IRU\u0003&UHGLW\u0003/RVVHV below.\nOur evaluation of the allowance for credit losses is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates. The actual amounts of credit losses realized in the\nnear term could differ from the amounts estimated in arriving at the allowance for credit losses reported in the financial statements.\n51\nAcquisition Accounting, Loans\nWe account for our acquisitions under ASC Topic 805, %XVLQHVV\u0003&RPELQDWLRQV, which requires the use of the acquisition method of accounting. All\nidentifiable assets acquired, including loans, are recorded at fair value. The fair value for acquired loans at the time of acquisition is based on a variety of\nfactors including discounted expected cash flows, adjusted for estimated prepayments and credit losses. In accordance with ASC 326, the fair value\nadjustment is recorded as a premium or discount to the unpaid principal balance of each acquired loan. Loans that have been identified as having\nexperienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination are purchased credit deteriorated (“PCD”) loans.\nThe net premium or discount on PCD loans is adjusted by our allowance for credit losses recorded at the time of acquisition. The remaining net premium or\ndiscount is accreted or amortized into interest income over the remaining life of the loan using a constant yield method. The net premium or discount on\nloans that are not classified as PCD (“non-PCD”), that includes credit and non-credit components, is accreted or amortized into interest income over the\nremaining life of the loan using a constant yield method. We then record the necessary allowance for credit losses on the non-PCD loans through provision\nfor credit losses expense.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Other intangible assets represent purchased assets\nthat also lack physical substance but can be separately distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights or because the asset is\ncapable of being sold or exchanged either on its own or in combination with a related contract, asset or liability. We perform an annual goodwill\nimpairment test, and more than annually if circumstances warrant, in accordance with ASC Topic 350, ,QWDQJLEOHV\u0003±\u0003*RRGZLOO\u0003DQG\u00032WKHU, as amended by\nASU 2011-08 – THVWLQJ\u0003*RRGZLOO\u0003IRU\u0003,PSDLUPHQW and ASU 2017-04 -\u0003,QWDQJLEOHV\u0003±\u0003*RRGZLOO\u0003DQG\u00032WKHU. ASC Topic 350 requires that goodwill and\nintangible assets that have indefinite lives be reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if certain conditions occur. Our assessment depends on\nseveral assumptions which are dependent on market and economic conditions. Impairment losses on recorded goodwill, if any, will be recorded as\noperating expenses.\nTo quantitatively test goodwill for impairment, a present value of discounted cash flows calculation is completed and relies on several assumptions that\nhave a level of subjectivity and judgement. These assumptions are dependent on market and economic conditions. Key inputs to estimate terminal fair\nvalue of the Company include projected forecasts, noninterest expense savings and a pricing multiple based on a group of peer banks with similar\ncharacteristics. These inputs are discounted by the cost of equity, which includes assumptions involving our beta; equity risk, size and company premiums;\nand the 20-year treasury rate. Assumptions used in calculating the cost of equity are obtained from market and third-party data. Results are compared to\nbook value; no impairment was indicated as of September 30, 2024. Judgement is inherent in assessing goodwill for impairment. The various assumptions\nused in assessing goodwill for impairment involve uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from those\nprojected.\nStock-Based Compensation Plans\nWe have adopted various stock-based compensation plans. The plans provide for the grant of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock\nappreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance stock units and stock awards. Pursuant to the plans, shares are reserved for\nfuture issuance by the Company upon exercise of stock options or awarding of restricted stock, restricted stock units or performance stock units granted to\ndirectors, officers and other key employees.\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 718, &RPSHQVDWLRQ\u0003±\u00036WRFN\u0003&RPSHQVDWLRQ, the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the\nBlack-Scholes option-pricing model that uses various assumptions. This model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, changes to which can\nmaterially affect the fair value estimate. For additional information, see Note 15, Stock-Based Compensation, in the accompanying Condensed Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report.\n52\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to the federal income tax laws of the United States, and the tax laws of the states and other jurisdictions where we conduct business. Due to\nthe complexity of these laws, taxpayers and the taxing authorities may subject these laws to different interpretations. Management must make conclusions\nand estimates about the application of these innately intricate laws, related regulations, and case law. When preparing the Company’s income tax returns,\nmanagement attempts to make reasonable interpretations of the tax laws. Taxing authorities have the ability to challenge management’s analysis of the tax\nlaw or any reinterpretation management makes in its ongoing assessment of facts and the developing case law. Management assesses the reasonableness of\nits effective tax rate quarterly based on its current estimate of net income and the applicable taxes expected for the full year. On a quarterly basis,\nmanagement also reviews circumstances and developments in tax law affecting the reasonableness of deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for\ncontingent tax liabilities.\nNET INTEREST INCOME\nOverview\nNet interest income, our principal source of earnings, is the difference between the interest income generated by earning assets and the total interest cost of\nthe deposits and borrowings obtained to fund those assets. Factors that determine the level of net interest income include the volume of earning assets and\ninterest bearing liabilities, yields earned and rates paid, the level of non-performing loans and the amount of noninterest bearing liabilities supporting\nearning assets. Net interest income is analyzed in the discussion and tables below on a fully taxable equivalent basis. The adjustment to convert certain\nincome to a fully taxable equivalent basis consists of dividing tax-exempt income by one minus the combined federal and state income tax rate of 26.135%.\nOur practice is to limit exposure to interest rate movements by maintaining a significant portion of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities in short-\nterm repricing. In the last several years, on average, approximately 41% of our loan portfolio and approximately 89% of our time deposits have repriced in\none year or less. As of September 30, 2024, our interest rate sensitivity shows that approximately 46% of our loans and 94% of our time deposits will\nreprice in the next year.\nNet Interest Income - Sequential Quarter Analysis\nFor the three month period ended September 30, 2024, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $164.1 million, an increase of $3.6\nmillion, or 2.3%, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024. The increase in net interest income was primarily the result of a $5.0 million increase\nin fully tax equivalent interest income, partially offset by a $1.3 million increase in interest expense.\nThe increase in interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis primarily resulted from a $6.9 million increase in interest income on loans, partially\noffset by a decrease of $1.9 million in interest income on investment securities. The increase in interest income provided by loans reflects an increase\nattributable to loan volume of $1.7 million, coupled with a $5.2 million increase in interest income related to loan yield. The loan yield for the third quarter\nof 2024 was 6.44% compared to 6.39% from the preceding sequential quarter, representing a 5 basis point increase. The decrease in interest income on\ninvestment securities was primarily related to a $2.0 million decrease attributable to volume related to our taxable investment portfolio, as our portfolio\nexperienced pay downs, maturities, and a strategic sale of $251.5 million of lower-yielding available-for-sale (“AFS”) securities to pay off higher rate\nwholesale fundings consisting of FHLB advances during the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nThe $1.3 million increase in interest expense is mostly due to the additional reliance on other wholesale borrowings sources, primarily FHLB advances,\nwhich led to a $2.0 million increase in interest expense during the quarter. Interest expense decreased by $2.1 million due to the decrease in deposit volume\nover the period, which was partially offset by the $1.3 million increase related to rates, largely due to the modest 2 basis point increase related to time\ndeposit accounts, as we believe deposit costs appeared to have peaked during the third quarter of 2024.\n53\nNet Interest Income - Year-over-Year Analysis\nNet interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 decreased $30.5 million, or 5.9%, over the\nsame period in 2023. The decrease in net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was the result of a $99.9 million increase in fully tax equivalent\ninterest income, more than offset by a $130.4 million increase in interest expense.\nThe increase in interest income during the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 resulted from increases in interest income on loans and\ninvestments, primarily as a result of higher market interest rates. The increase in interest income on loans of $82.9 million reflects an increase attributable\nto loan volume of $21.2 million coupled with a 48 basis point rise in loan yield that resulted in a $61.7 million increase. The increase attributable to loan\nvolume was due to solid organic loan growth over the comparative period. The increase of $18.4 million in interest income on investment securities is\nprimarily related to an increase of $37.1 million in interest income on taxable investment securities due to yield increases over the period of 116 basis\npoints. The increase in interest income on taxable investment securities due to yield increases was mitigated by an $18.4 million decrease due to the decline\nin our taxable investment portfolio average balances which decreased by $788.2 million or 16.4%, as our portfolio experienced pay downs, maturities, the\nstrategic sale of lower-yielding AFS securities during the third quarter of 2024 as discussed above and a strategic sale of $241.1 million of lower-yielding\nAFS securities late in the fourth quarter of 2023, the proceeds of which we used to pay off higher-rate wholesale fundings in each period.\nThe $130.4 million increase in interest expense is mainly due to the increase in our deposit account rates over the period, combined with the change in\ndeposit mix as the market experiences a shift in consumer sentiment given the attractiveness of higher yielding time deposits in the current higher interest\nrate environment. Interest expense increased $114.8 million due to the increase in rate of 92 basis points on interest-bearing deposit accounts and $13.3\nmillion due to the increase in deposit volume over the period. Further, an increase of $2.9 million in interest expense was related to an increase in rates on\nour subordinated debentures during the same period. We continually monitor and look for opportunities to fairly reprice our deposits while remaining\ncompetitive in this current challenging rate environment.\nNet Interest Margin\nOur net interest margin on a fully tax equivalent basis was 2.74% and 2.70% for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, as compared\nto 2.69% and 2.82% for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and the nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Net interest margin\nexperienced a 5 basis point increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the preceding sequential quarter, while net interest margin\ndecreased 12 basis points during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase as\ncompared to the preceding sequential quarter was aided by the strategic sale of lower-yielding AFS investment securities during the three month period\nended September 30, 2024. The decrease when compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to the rising deposit rate pressure from\nincreased market competition and consumer migration toward higher rate deposits.\n54\nNet Interest Income Tables\nTables 1 and 2 reflect an analysis of net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30,\n2024 and the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nTable 1: Analysis of Net Interest Margin\n)7(\u0003 \u0003)XOO\\\u00037D[DEOH\u0003(TXLYDOHQW\u0003XVLQJ\u0003DQ\u0003HIIHFWLYH\u0003WD[\u0003UDWH\u0003RI\u0003\u0015\u0019\u0011\u0014\u0016\u0018\b\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, June 30, September 30, September 30,\n(In thousands) 2024 2024 2024 2023\nInterest income $ 334,289 $ 329,145 $ 986,083 $ 886,643\nFTE adjustment 6,398 6,576 19,396 18,932\nInterest income – FTE 340,687 335,721 1,005,479 905,575\nInterest expense 176,577 175,240 522,560 392,145\nNet interest income – FTE $ 164,110 $ 160,481 $ 482,919 $ 513,430\nYield on earning assets – FTE 5.68 % 5.64 % 5.62 % 4.97 %\nCost of interest bearing liabilities 3.73 % 3.72 % 3.69 % 2.81 %\nNet interest spread – FTE 1.95 % 1.92 % 1.93 % 2.16 %\nNet interest margin – FTE 2.74 % 2.69 % 2.70 % 2.82 %\nTable 2: Changes in Fully Taxable Equivalent Net Interest Margin\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024\nSeptember 30, 2024 compared to September 30,\n(In thousands) compared to June 30, 2024 2023\nDecrease due to change in earning assets $ (283) $ (2,265)\nIncrease due to change in earning asset yields 5,249 102,169\nIncrease (decrease) due to change in interest bearing liabilities 196 (9,788)\nDecrease due to change in interest rates paid on interest bearing liabilities (1,533) (120,627)\nIncrease (decrease) in net interest income $ 3,629 $ (30,511)\n55\nTable 3 shows, for each major category of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, the average (computed on a daily basis) amount outstanding, the\ninterest earned or expensed on such amount and the average rate earned or expensed for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 and\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The level\nof provision to the allowance is based on management’s judgment, with consideration given to the composition, maturity and other qualitative\ncharacteristics of the portfolio, assessment of current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts, past due and non-performing loans and\nhistorical net credit loss experience. It is management’s practice to review the allowance on a monthly basis and, after considering the factors previously\nnoted, to determine the level of provision made to the allowance.\nThe provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $12.1 million as compared to $11.1 million for the three months ended\nJune 30, 2024. Provision expense for both periods was related to loans and reflected loan growth in the quarters, as well as the impact of updated economic\nassumptions.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our provision for credit losses was $33.5 million as compared to $32.0 million for the same period ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. Provision expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was related to loans and reflected loan growth in the quarter, as well\nas the impact of updated economic assumptions. Provision expense for the same period ended September 30, 2023 consisted of a $36.2 million expense\nrelated to loans and was primarily due to the impacts described above, which was partially offset by the recapture of $16.3 million reflecting the continued\ndecline in unfunded commitments over the period, and a $12.1 million expense related to securities which was primarily due to decreases in the value of\ncorporate bonds in the investment securities portfolio.\n58\nNONINTEREST INCOME\nNoninterest income is principally derived from recurring fee income, which includes service charges, wealth management fees and debit and credit card\nfees. Noninterest income also includes income on the sale of mortgage loans, income from the increase in cash surrender values of bank owned life\ninsurance and gains (losses) from sales of securities.\nFor the three month period ended September 30, 2024, total noninterest income was $17.1 million, a decrease of approximately $26.2 million or 60.4%,\ncompared to the three month period ended June 30, 2024. The majority of the decrease in noninterest income during the three months ended September 30,\n2024 was due to a loss on sale of securities of $28.4 million. During the period, we sold approximately $251.5 million of AFS investment securities as part\nof a strategic decision to sell low yielding securities to pay off higher rate wholesale fundings consisting of FHLB advances. Adjusting for this certain item,\nadjusted noninterest income for the three month period ended September 30, 2024 increased $2.2 million, or 5.1%, from the prior sequential quarter. The\nincrease in adjusted noninterest income on a sequential quarter basis was primarily due to an increase in other income of $1.9 million from the prior\nsequential quarter reflecting gains on the sale of other real estate owned largely related to two properties sold during the quarter.\nNoninterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by approximately $30.0 million or 22.4% as compared to the nine months\nended September 30, 2023. The decrease, as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to losses on sale of securities of $28.4 million\ndiscussed above and $391,000, recognized during each respective period. Adjusting for these certain items, adjusted noninterest income for the nine month\nperiod ended September 30, 2024 decreased $2.0 million, or 1.5%, from the prior comparative period. The decrease on an adjusted basis was related to a\n$6.6 million decrease in other income due to a $4.0 million legal reserve recapture associated with litigation, coupled with fair value adjustments related to\nSmall Business Investment Company (“SBIC”) investments and death benefits from bank owned life insurance totaling $3.5 million recorded during the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023. Partially offsetting the decrease in other income was an increase of $2.8 million in bank owned life insurance\nincome during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to a higher earnings credit rate as compared to the prior period.\nTable 5 shows noninterest income for the three month periods ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 and the nine months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023, respectively, as well as changes between periods.\nTable 5: Noninterest Income\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, June 30, Change September 30, September 30, Change\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2024 $ % 2024 2023 $ %\nService charges on deposit\naccounts $ 12,713 $ 12,252 $ 461 3.8% $ 36,920 $ 37,748 $ (828) (2.2)%\nDebit and credit card fees 8,144 8,162 (18) (0.2) 24,552 23,650 902 3.8\nWealth management fees 8,226 8,274 (48) (0.6) 23,978 22,524 1,454 6.5\nMortgage lending income 1,956 1,973 (17) (0.9) 6,249 6,130 119 1.9\nBank owned life insurance income 3,757 3,876 (119) (3.1) 11,447 8,623 2,824 32.8\nOther service charges and fees 2,381 2,352 29 1.2 6,932 6,776 156 2.3\nLoss on sale of securities, net (28,393) — (28,393) * (28,393) (391) (28,002) *\nOther income 8,346 6,410 1,936 30.2 21,928 28,532 (6,604) (23.2)\nTotal noninterest income $ 17,130 $ 43,299 $ (26,169) (60.4)% $ 103,613 $ 133,592 $ (29,979) (22.4)%\n_________________________\n*Not meaningful\nRecurring fee income (total service charges, wealth management fees, debit and credit card fees) was $31.5 million and $31.0 million for the three month\nperiods ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively, and was $92.4 million and $90.7 million for the nine month periods ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n59\nNONINTEREST EXPENSE\nNoninterest expense consists of salaries and employee benefits, occupancy, equipment, foreclosure losses and other expenses necessary for our operations.\nManagement remains committed to controlling the level of noninterest expense through the continued use of expense control measures. We utilize an\nextensive profit planning and reporting system involving all subsidiaries. Based on a needs assessment of the business plan for the upcoming year, monthly\nand annual profit plans are developed, including manpower and capital expenditure budgets. These profit plans are subject to extensive initial reviews and\nmonitored by management monthly. Variances from the plan are reviewed monthly and, when required, management takes corrective action intended to\nensure financial goals are met. We also regularly monitor staffing levels at each subsidiary to ensure productivity and overhead are in line with existing\nworkload requirements.\nNoninterest expense was $137.2 million for the three month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to noninterest expense of $139.4 million for\nthe three month period ended June 30, 2024, representing a decrease of $2.2 million, or 1.6%, as compared to the preceding quarter. Adjusted noninterest\nexpense, which excludes branch right sizing, early retirement program costs, termination of vendor and software services, and FDIC special assessment (for\nthe three months ended June 30, 2024), for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $136.8 million, a decrease of $1.0 million as compared to the\nthree months ended June 30, 2024.\nNoninterest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by approximately $1.5 million or 0.4% as compared to the nine months\nended September 30, 2023. Adjusted noninterest expense, which excludes branch right sizing, merger related costs (for the nine months ended September\n30, 2023), FDIC special assessment (for the nine months ended September 30, 2024), termination of vendor and software services (for the nine months\nended September 30, 2024) and early retirement program costs, increased $5.8 million, or 1.4%, as compared to the nine months ended September 30,\n2023.\nSalaries and employee benefits expense decreased $1.5 million during the three month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the preceding\nsequential quarter and decreased $6.6 million during the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in the prior year.\nAdjusted salaries and employee benefits expense, which excludes early retirement program costs, for the three months ended September 30, 2024,\ndecreased $1.4 million, or 2.0%, as compared to the preceding sequential quarter and decreased $1.8 million, or 0.8%, during the nine month period ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease as compared to the preceding sequential quarter reflects incentive\ncompensation accrual adjustments, while the decrease as compared to the same period in the prior year is primarily due to the successful execution of\nprograms as part of our Better Bank Initiative.\nDeposit insurance expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024 and nine months\nended September 30, 2023 decreased by $111,000 and increased by $3.6 million, respectively. While the variance in deposit insurance expense on a\nsequential quarter basis is relatively flat, the increase on a year over year basis for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is significantly attributable to\nthe additional FDIC special assessments totaling $1.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which were levied to support the Deposit\nInsurance Fund following the failure of certain banks in 2023, coupled with base assessment rate increases related to changes in the mix of deposits.\n60\nTable 6 below shows noninterest expense for the three month periods ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 and the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as well as changes between periods.\nTable 6: Noninterest Expense\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, June 30, Change September 30, September 30, Change\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2024 $ % 2024 2023 $ %\nSalaries and employee benefits $ 69,168 $ 70,598 $ (1,430) (2.0)% $ 212,200 $ 213,969 $ (1,769) (0.8)%\nEarly retirement program (1) 118 (119) (100.9) 336 5,166 (4,830) (93.5)\nOccupancy expense, net 12,216 11,864 352 3.0 36,338 35,008 1,330 3.8\nFurniture and equipment expense 5,612 5,623 (11) (0.2) 16,376 15,296 1,080 7.1\nOther real estate and foreclosure\n87 117 (30) (25.6) 383 703 (320) (45.5)\nexpense\nDeposit insurance 5,571 5,682 (111) (2.0) 18,388 14,766 3,622 24.5\nMerger related costs — — — — — 1,420 (1,420) (100.0)\nOther operating expenses:\nProfessional services 5,554 6,329 (775) (12.3) 15,950 14,443 1,507 10.4\nPostage 2,296 2,174 122 5.6 6,507 6,973 (466) (6.7)\nTelephone 1,580 1,560 20 1.3 4,860 5,182 (322) (6.2)\nDebit and credit card 3,201 3,215 (14) (0.4) 9,744 9,989 (245) (2.5)\nMarketing 7,059 6,359 700 11.0 20,066 18,041 2,025 11.2\nSoftware and technology 10,970 10,872 98 0.9 32,585 31,299 1,286 4.1\nOperating supplies 562 607 (45) (7.4) 1,808 1,762 46 2.6\nAmortization of intangibles 3,851 3,852 (1) — 11,553 12,291 (738) (6.0)\nBranch right sizing 410 519 (109) (21.0) 1,165 1,621 (456) (28.1)\nOther 9,057 9,865 (808) (8.2) 28,167 26,993 1,174 4.4\nTotal noninterest expense $ 137,193 $ 139,354 $ (2,161) (1.6)% $ 416,426 $ 414,922 $ 1,504 0.4%\nINVESTMENTS AND SECURITIES\nOur securities portfolio is the second largest component of earning assets and provides a significant source of revenue. Securities within the portfolio are\nclassified as either held-to-maturity (“HTM”) or AFS. Our philosophy regarding investments is conservative based on investment type and maturity.\nInvestments in the portfolio primarily include U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. Government agencies, MBS and municipal securities. Our general policy is not\nto invest in derivative type investments or high-risk securities, except for collateralized MBS for which collection of principal and interest is not\nsubordinated to significant superior rights held by others.\nHTM and AFS investment securities were $3.66 billion and $2.69 billion, respectively, at September 30, 2024, compared to the HTM amount of $3.73\nbillion and AFS amount of $3.15 billion at December 31, 2023. We continue to look for opportunities to maximize the value of the investment portfolio.\nDuring the quarters ended June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, we transferred, at fair value, $1.99 billion and $500.8 million, respectively, of securities\nfrom the AFS portfolio to the HTM portfolio. The related remaining combined net unrealized losses of $112.7 million in accumulated other comprehensive\nincome (loss) as of September 30, 2024 will be amortized over the remaining life of the securities. No gains or losses on these securities were recognized at\nthe time of transfer.\nManagement has the ability and intent to hold the securities classified as HTM until they mature, at which time we expect to receive full value for the\nsecurities. The contractual terms of those investments do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than the amortized cost bases of the\ninvestments. We expect the cash flows from principal maturities of securities to provide flexibility to fund future loan growth or reduce wholesale funding.\nDuring the three month period ended September 30, 2024, we sold approximately $251.5 million of AFS investment securities as part of a strategic\ndecision to sell low yielding securities to pay off higher rate wholesale fundings consisting of FHLB advances resulting in a gross realized loss of $28.4\nmillion.\n61\nFurthermore, as of September 30, 2024, we have the ability to hold the securities classified as AFS for a period of time sufficient for a recovery of\namortized cost, we do not have an immediate intent to sell the securities classified as AFS, and we believe the accounting standard of “more likely than\nnot” has not been met regarding whether we would be required to sell any of the AFS securities before recovery of amortized cost. For the remainder of\n2024, we will continue to evaluate targeted sales of AFS securities based on prevailing market conditions and our funding and liquidity positions. The\nunrealized losses are largely due to increases in market interest rates over the yields available at the time the underlying securities were purchased. The fair\nvalue is expected to recover as the bonds approach their maturity date or repricing date or if market yields for such investments decline. Accordingly, as of\nSeptember 30, 2024, we believe the declines in fair value are temporary and we do not believe any of the securities are impaired due to reasons of credit\nquality.\nDuring the third quarter of 2021, we began utilizing interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges to mitigate the effect of changing interest rates on\nthe fair values of $1.00 billion of fixed rate callable municipal securities held in the AFS portfolio. These swap agreements consist of a two year forward\nstart date and involve the payment of fixed interest rates with a weighted average rate of 1.21% in exchange for variable interest rates based on federal\nfunds rates, which became effective during late third quarter of 2023. Securities within these swap agreements have maturity dates varying between 2028\nand 2029. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the net amount included in interest income on investment securities in the consolidated\nstatements of income related to these swap agreements was $33.8 million.\nLOAN PORTFOLIO\nOur loan portfolio averaged $17.07 billion and $16.60 billion during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, total\nloans were $17.34 billion, an increase of $490.4 million from December 31, 2023. The increase in the average loan balance during the first nine months of\n2024 when compared to the same period in 2023 is primarily due to the continued widespread organic loan growth throughout our geographic markets over\nthe comparative period. The most significant components of the loan portfolio were loans to businesses (commercial loans, commercial real estate loans\nand agricultural loans) and individuals (consumer loans, credit card loans and single-family residential real estate loans).\nWe seek to manage our credit risk by diversifying our loan portfolio, determining that borrowers have adequate sources of cash flow for loan repayment\nwithout liquidation of collateral, obtaining and monitoring collateral, providing an appropriate allowance for credit losses and regularly reviewing loans\nthrough the internal loan review process. The loan portfolio is diversified by borrower, purpose, industry and geographic region. We seek to use\ndiversification within the loan portfolio to reduce credit risk, thereby minimizing the adverse impact on the portfolio, if weaknesses develop in either the\neconomy or a particular segment of borrowers. Collateral requirements are based on credit assessments of borrowers and may be used to recover the debt in\ncase of default. We use the allowance for credit losses as a method to value the loan portfolio at its estimated collectible amount. Loans are regularly\nreviewed to facilitate the identification and monitoring of deteriorating credits.\n62\nThe balances of loans outstanding at the indicated dates are reflected in Table 7, according to type of loan.\nTable 7: Loan Portfolio\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023\nConsumer:\nCredit cards $ 177,696 $ 191,204\nOther consumer 113,896 127,462\nTotal consumer 291,592 318,666\nReal estate:\nConstruction and development 2,796,378 3,144,220\nSingle family residential 2,724,648 2,641,556\nOther commercial 7,992,437 7,552,410\nTotal real estate 13,513,463 13,338,186\nCommercial:\nCommercial 2,467,384 2,490,176\nAgricultural 314,340 232,710\nTotal commercial 2,781,724 2,722,886\nOther 749,261 465,932\nTotal loans before allowance for credit losses $ 17,336,040 $ 16,845,670\nConsumer loans consist of credit card loans and other consumer loans. Consumer loans were $291.6 million at September 30, 2024, or 1.7% of total loans,\ncompared to $318.7 million, or 1.9% of total loans at December 31, 2023. The decrease in consumer loans from December 31, 2023, to September 30,\n2024, was primarily due to loan payoffs and pay downs within the credit card and other consumer portfolios during the period.\nReal estate loans consist of construction and development loans (“C&D”) loans, single-family residential loans and commercial real estate (“CRE”) loans.\nReal estate loans were $13.51 billion at September 30, 2024, or 78.0% of total loans, compared to $13.34 billion, or 79.2%, of total loans at December 31,\n2023, an increase of $175.3 million, or 1.3%. Our C&D loans decreased by $347.8 million, or 11.1%, single family residential loans increased by $83.1\nmillion, or 3.1%, and CRE loans increased by $440.0 million, or 5.8%. The changes among our real estate portfolio reflected our focus on maintaining\nconservative underwriting standards and structure guidelines while emphasizing prudent pricing discipline during the first nine months of 2024. We expect\nto continue to manage our C&D and CRE portfolio concentration by developing deeper relationships with our customers.\nCommercial loans consist of non-real estate loans related to business and agricultural loans. Total commercial loans were $2.78 billion at September 30,\n2024, or 16.0% of total loans, compared to $2.72 billion, or 16.2% of total loans at December 31, 2023, an increase of $58.8 million, or 2.2%. The increase\nin commercial loans was related to the increase in agricultural loans of $81.6 million, or 35.1%, primarily due to seasonality of the portfolio, which\nnormally peaks in the third quarter.\nOther loans mainly consist of mortgage warehouse lending and municipal loans. Mortgage volume experienced an increase in demand during the first nine\nmonths of 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023, and was coupled with continued organic growth in our municipal loans during the quarter, leading to\nan increase of $283.3 million in other loans.\nWhile loan growth was widespread throughout our geographic markets and was generally broad-based by loan type during the first nine months of 2024,\nloan growth during the first nine months of 2024 reflected moderating demand and increased payoff activity, as we focus on maintaining disciplined pricing\nand conservative underwriting standards given the current economic environment. Our commercial loan pipeline consisting of all commercial loan\nopportunities was $1.24 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to $948.2 million at December 31, 2023. Loans approved and ready to close at the end of\nthe quarter totaled $549.1 million.\n63\nASSET QUALITY\nNon-performing loans are comprised of (a) nonaccrual loans, (b) loans that are contractually past due 90 days and (c) other loans for which terms have been\nrestructured to provide a reduction or deferral of interest or principal, because of deterioration in the financial position of the borrower. Simmons Bank\nrecognizes income principally on the accrual basis of accounting. When loans are classified as nonaccrual, generally, the accrued interest is charged off and\nno further interest is accrued. Loans, excluding credit card loans, are placed on a nonaccrual basis either: (1) when there are serious doubts regarding the\ncollectability of principal or interest, or (2) when payment of interest or principal is 90 days or more past due and either (i) not fully secured or (ii) not in\nthe process of collection. If a loan is determined by management to be uncollectible, the portion of the loan determined to be uncollectible is then charged\nto the allowance for credit losses.\nWhen credit card loans reach 90 days past due and there are attachable assets, the accounts are considered for litigation. Credit card loans are generally\ncharged off when payment of interest or principal exceeds 150 days past due. The credit card recovery group pursues account holders until it is determined,\non a case-by-case basis, to be uncollectible.\nTotal non-performing assets increased $14.0 million from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. Nonaccrual loans increased by $17.5 million from\nDecember 31, 2023 and foreclosed assets held for sale and other real estate owned decreased $2.8 million as compared to December 31, 2023. The increase\nin nonaccrual assets was primarily due to two large loans being placed in nonaccrual status during the period. One is a $3.9 million non-owner occupied\nreal estate construction loan and the other is a $6.6 million non-owner occupied real estate loan to a business that was negatively impacted by the COVID-\n19 pandemic.\nFrom time to time, certain borrowers experience declines in income and cash flow. As a result, these borrowers seek to reduce contractual cash outlays, the\nmost prominent being debt payments. In an effort to preserve our net interest margin and earning assets, we are open to working with existing customers in\norder to maximize the collectability of the debt.\nWe have internal loan modification programs for borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. Modifications to borrowers experiencing financial\ndifficulties (“FDMs”) may include interest rate reductions, principal or interest forgiveness and/or term extensions. We primarily use interest rate reduction\nand/or payment modifications or extensions, with an occasional forgiveness of principal.\nThere were three loan modifications granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty during the nine month period ended September 30, 2024. Such\nmodifications included interest rate reductions and had a total period-end amortized cost basis of $795,000 at September 30, 2024.\nWe continue to maintain good asset quality compared to the industry and strong asset quality remains a primary focus of our strategy. The allowance for\ncredit losses as a percent of total loans was 1.35% as of September 30, 2024. Non-performing loans equaled 0.59% of total loans. Non-performing assets\nwere 0.38% of total assets, a 5 basis point increase from December 31, 2023. The allowance for credit losses was 229% of non-performing loans. Our\nannualized net charge-offs to average total loans ratio for the first nine months of 2024 was 0.20%. Annualized net credit card charge-offs to average total\ncredit card loans were 2.87% for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 2.20% during the full year 2023, and 186 basis points better than the most\nrecently published industry average charge-off ratio as reported by the Federal Reserve for all banks.\n64\nTable 8 presents information concerning non-performing assets, including nonaccrual loans at amortized cost and foreclosed assets held for sale.\nTable 8: Non-performing Assets\nSeptember 30, December 31, September 30,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 2023\nNonaccrual loans (1) $ 100,865 $ 83,325 $ 81,135\nLoans past due 90 days or more (principal or interest payments) 830 1,147 806\nTotal non-performing loans 101,695 84,472 81,941\nOther non-performing assets:\nForeclosed assets held for sale and other real estate owned 1,299 4,073 3,809\nOther non-performing assets 1,311 1,726 1,417\nTotal other non-performing assets 2,610 5,799 5,226\nTotal non-performing assets $ 104,305 $ 90,271 $ 87,167\nAllowance for credit losses to non-performing loans 229 % 267 % 267 %\nNon-performing loans to total loans 0.59 % 0.50 % 0.49 %\nNon-performing assets to total assets 0.38 % 0.33 % 0.32 %\n_______________________________________\n(1) Includes nonaccrual FDMs of approximately $818,000 and $282,000 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nThe interest income on nonaccrual loans is not considered material for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES\nThe allowance for credit losses is a reserve established through a provision for credit losses charged to expense which represents management’s best\nestimate of lifetime expected losses based on reasonable and supportable forecasts, quantitative factors, and other qualitative considerations.\nLoans with similar risk characteristics such as loan type, collateral type, and internal risk ratings are aggregated for collective assessment. We use\nstatistically-based models that leverage assumptions about current and future economic conditions throughout the contractual life of the loan. Expected\ncredit losses are estimated by either lifetime loss rates or expected loss cash flows based on three key parameters: probability-of-default (“PD”), exposure-\nat-default (“EAD”), and loss-given-default (“LGD”). Future economic conditions are incorporated to the extent that they are reasonable and supportable.\nBeyond the reasonable and supportable periods, the economic variables revert to a historical equilibrium at a pace dependent on the state of the economy\nreflected within the economic scenarios. We also include qualitative adjustments to the allowance based on factors and considerations that have not\notherwise been fully accounted for.\nLoans that have unique risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. These evaluations are typically performed on loans with a deteriorated\ninternal risk rating. For a collateral-dependent loan, our evaluation process includes a valuation by appraisal or other collateral analysis adjusted for selling\ncosts, when appropriate. This valuation is compared to the remaining outstanding principal balance of the loan. If a loss is determined to be probable, the\nloss is included in the allowance for credit losses as a specific allocation.\n65\nAn analysis of the allowance for credit losses on loans is shown in Table 9.\nTable 9: Allowance for Credit Losses\n(In thousands) 2024 2023\nBalance, beginning of year $ 225,231 $ 196,955\nLoans charged off:\nCredit card 4,808 3,803\nOther consumer 1,806 1,755\nReal estate 3,139 11,362\nCommercial 20,071 2,857\nTotal loans charged off 29,824 19,777\nRecoveries of loans previously charged off:\nCredit card 700 766\nOther consumer 1,117 1,020\nReal estate 1,210 1,601\nCommercial 1,336 1,783\nTotal recoveries 4,363 5,170\nNet loans charged off 25,461 14,607\nProvision for credit losses 33,453 36,199\nBalance, September 30, $ 233,223 $ 218,547\nLoans charged off:\nCredit card 1,500\nOther consumer 767\nReal estate 1,023\nCommercial 3,105\nTotal loans charged off 6,395\nRecoveries of loans previously charged off:\nCredit card 242\nOther consumer 518\nReal estate 785\nCommercial 309\nTotal recoveries 1,854\nNet loans charged off 4,541\nProvision for credit losses 11,225\nBalance, end of year $ 225,231\nProvision for Credit Losses\nThe amount of provision added to or released from the allowance during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and for the year\nended December 31, 2023, was based on management’s judgment, with consideration given to the composition and asset quality of the portfolio, historical\nloan loss experience, and assessment of current and expected economic forecasts and conditions. It is management’s practice to review the allowance on a\nmonthly basis, and after considering the factors previously noted, to determine the level of provision made to the allowance.\nAllowance for Credit Losses Allocation\nAs of September 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses reflected an increase of approximately $8.0 million from December 31, 2023, while total loans\nincreased by $490.4 million over the same nine month period. The allocation in each category within the allowance generally reflects the overall changes in\nthe loan portfolio mix.\n66\nThe increase in the allowance for credit losses during the first nine months of 2024 was primarily due to the loan growth experienced during the first three\nquarters of the year, as well as refreshed economic forecasts. Our allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2024 was considered appropriate given the\ncurrent economic environment and other related factors.\nThe following table sets forth the sum of the amounts of the allowance for credit losses attributable to individual loans within each category, or loan\ncategories in general. The table also reflects the percentage of loans in each category to the total loan portfolio for each of the periods indicated. The\nallowance for credit losses by loan category is determined by i) our estimated reserve factors by category including applicable qualitative adjustments and\nii) any specific allowance allocations that are identified on individually evaluated loans. The amounts shown are not necessarily indicative of the actual\nfuture losses that may occur within individual categories.\nTable 10: Allocation of Allowance for Credit Losses\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nAllowance % of Allowance % of\n(Dollars in thousands) Amount loans (1) Amount loans (1)\nCredit cards $ 6,007 1.0 % $ 5,868 1.1 %\nOther consumer 6,356 5.0 % 5,716 3.5 %\nReal estate 177,018 78.0 % 177,177 79.2 %\nCommercial 43,842 16.0 % 36,470 16.2 %\nTotal $ 233,223 100.0 % $ 225,231 100.0 %\nAllowance for credit losses to period-end loans 1.35 % 1.34 %\n_______________________________________\n(1) Percentage of loans in each category to total loans.\nDEPOSITS\nDeposits are our primary source of funding for earning assets and are primarily developed through our network of 234 financial centers as of September 30,\n2024. We offer a variety of products designed to attract and retain customers with a continuing focus on developing core deposits. Our core deposits consist\nof all deposits excluding time deposits of $250,000 or more and brokered deposits. As of September 30, 2024, core deposits comprised 77.2% of our total\ndeposits.\nWe continually monitor the funding requirements along with competitive interest rates in the markets we serve. Because of our community banking\nphilosophy, our executives in the local markets, with oversight by the Chief Deposit Officer, Asset Liability Committee and the Bank’s Treasury\nDepartment, establish the interest rates offered on both core and non-core deposits. This approach helps ensure that the interest rates being paid are\ncompetitively priced for each particular deposit product and structured to meet the funding requirements. We believe we are paying a competitive rate when\ncompared with pricing in those markets.\nWe manage our interest expense through deposit pricing. We believe that additional funds can be attracted and deposit growth can be accelerated through\ndeposit pricing if we experience increased loan demand or other liquidity needs. We can also utilize brokered deposits as an additional source of funding to\nmeet liquidity needs. We are continually monitoring and looking for opportunities to fairly reprice our deposits while remaining competitive in this current\nchallenging rate environment.\nOur total deposits as of September 30, 2024, were $21.94 billion, compared to $22.24 billion as of December 31, 2023. Noninterest bearing transaction\naccounts, interest bearing transaction accounts and savings accounts totaled $15.39 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to $15.80 billion at December\n31, 2023, a decrease of $412.6 million. Total time deposits increased $103.1 million to $6.55 billion at September 30, 2024, from $6.45 billion at December\n31, 2023. We had $3.36 billion and $2.90 billion of brokered deposits at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. We are continuing to\nrefine our product offerings to give customers flexibility of choice while maintaining the ability to adjust interest rates timely in the current rate\nenvironment.\n67\nOTHER BORROWINGS AND SUBORDINATED NOTES AND DEBENTURES\nOur total debt was $1.41 billion and $1.34 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The outstanding balance for September 30,\n2024 includes $1.03 billion in FHLB advances; $366.3 million in subordinated notes and unamortized debt issuance costs; and $17.9 million of other long-\nterm debt. FHLB advances outstanding at September 30, 2024 are primarily fixed rate, fixed term advances, which are due less than one year from\norigination and therefore are classified as short-term advances.\nIn March 2018, we issued $330.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.00% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes (“Notes”) at a public offering\nprice equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes. We incurred $3.6 million in debt issuance costs related to the offering. The Notes will\nmature on April 1, 2028 and are subordinated in right of payment to the payment of our other existing and future senior indebtedness, including all our\ngeneral creditors. The Notes are obligations of the Company only and are not obligations of, and are not guaranteed by, any of its subsidiaries.\nWe assumed Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes in an aggregate principal amount, net of premium adjustments, of $37.4 million in connection with\nthe Spirit acquisition in April 2022 (the “Spirit Notes”). The Spirit Notes will mature on July 31, 2030, and initially bear interest at a fixed annual rate of\n6.00%, payable quarterly, in arrears, to, but excluding, July 31, 2025. From and including July 31, 2025, to, but excluding, the maturity date or earlier\nredemption date, the interest rate will reset quarterly to an interest rate per annum equal to a benchmark rate, which is expected to be the then-current three-\nmonth Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (provided, that in the event the benchmark\nrate is less than zero, the benchmark rate will be deemed to be zero) plus 592 basis points, payable quarterly, in arrears.\nFor information about the regulatory capital treatment of the Notes and the Spirit Notes, see the section “&DSLWDO²5LVN\u0010%DVHG\u0003&DSLWDO.”\nCAPITAL\nOverview\nAt September 30, 2024, total capital was $3.53 billion. Capital represents shareholder ownership in the Company – the book value of assets in excess of\nliabilities. At September 30, 2024, our common equity to asset ratio was 12.94% compared to 12.53% at year-end 2023.\nCapital Stock\nOn February 27, 2009, at a special meeting, our shareholders approved an amendment to the Articles of Incorporation to establish 40,040,000 authorized\nshares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value. On April 27, 2022, our shareholders approved amendments to our Articles of Incorporation to remove an\n$80.0 million cap on the aggregate liquidation preference associated with the preferred stock and increase the number of authorized shares of our Class A\ncommon stock from 175,000,000 to 350,000,000.\nOn October 29, 2019, we filed Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (“October Amended Articles”) with the Arkansas Secretary of State. The\nOctober Amended Articles classified and designated Series D Preferred Stock, Par Value $0.01 Per Share (“Series D Preferred Stock”), out of our\nauthorized preferred stock. On November 30, 2021, we redeemed all of the Series D Preferred Stock, including accrued and unpaid dividends. On April 27,\n2022, our shareholders approved an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation to remove the classification and designation for the Series D Preferred\nStock. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no shares of preferred stock issued or outstanding.\nStock Repurchase Program\nIn January 2022, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program (“2022 Program”) under which we could repurchase up to $175.0 million\nof our Class A common stock currently issued and outstanding. Because the 2022 Program was set to terminate on January 31, 2024, our Board of\nDirectors authorized a new stock repurchase program in January 2024 (“2024 Program”) under which we may repurchase up to $175.0 million of our Class\nA common stock currently issued and outstanding. The 2024 Program will be executed in accordance with Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act\nof 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”) and will terminate on January 31, 2026 (unless terminated sooner).\n68\nUnder the 2024 Program, we may repurchase shares of our common stock through open market and privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. The\ntiming, pricing, and amount of any repurchases under the 2024 Program will be determined by management at its discretion based on a variety of factors,\nincluding, but not limited to, trading volume and market price of our common stock, corporate considerations, our working capital and investment\nrequirements, general market and economic conditions, and legal requirements. The 2024 Program does not obligate us to repurchase any common stock\nand may be modified, discontinued, or suspended at any time without prior notice. We anticipate funding for this 2024 Program to come from available\nsources of liquidity, including cash on hand and future cash flow.\nNo shares were repurchased during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024. During the three and nine month periods ended September\n30, 2023, we repurchased 1,128,962 shares at an average price of $17.69 and 2,257,049 shares at an average price per share of $17.72 under the 2022\nProgram.\nCash Dividends\nWe declared cash dividends on our common stock of $0.63 per share for the first nine months of 2024 compared to $0.60 per share for the first nine months\nof 2023, an increase of $0.03, or 5%. The timing and amount of future dividends are at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our\nconsolidated earnings, financial condition, liquidity and capital requirements, the amount of cash dividends paid to us by our subsidiaries, applicable\ngovernment regulations and policies and other factors considered relevant by our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors anticipates that we will\ncontinue to pay quarterly dividends in amounts determined based on the factors discussed above. However, there can be no assurance that we will continue\nto pay dividends on our common stock at the current levels or at all.\nParent Company Liquidity\nThe primary liquidity needs of the Parent Company are the payment of dividends to shareholders, the funding of debt obligations and cash needs for\nacquisitions. The primary sources for meeting these liquidity needs are the current cash on hand at the parent company and the future dividends received\nfrom Simmons Bank. Payment of dividends by Simmons Bank is subject to various regulatory limitations. For additional information regarding the parent\ncompany’s liquidity, see “/LTXLGLW\\\u00030DQDJHPHQW” and “0DUNHW\u00035LVN\u00030DQDJHPHQW” in Item 3 – Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nof this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We continually assess our capital and liquidity needs and the best way to meet them, including, without limitation,\nthrough capital raising in the market via stock or debt offerings.\nRisk-Based Capital\nThe Company and Simmons Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet\nminimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a\ndirect material effect on our financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, we must\nmeet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under\nregulatory accounting practices. Our capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk\nweightings and other factors. The Company and Simmons Bank must hold a capital conservation buffer composed of common equity Tier 1 capital above\nits minimum risk-based capital requirements. Failure to meet this capital conservation buffer would result in additional limits on dividends, other\ndistributions and discretionary bonuses. The Company’s management reviews regulatory capital levels on an ongoing basis in light of the size, composition\nand quality of the Company’s capital resources, and of trends and anticipated changes thereto.\nQuantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require us to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the table\nbelow) of total, Tier 1 and common equity Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined) and of Tier 1 capital (as defined)\nto average assets (as defined). Management believes that, as of September 30, 2024, we meet all capital adequacy requirements to which we are subject. As\nof the most recent notification from regulatory agencies, Simmons Bank was well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action.\nTo be categorized as well capitalized, the Company and Simmons Bank must maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based, common equity Tier 1\nrisk-based and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the table. There are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have\nchanged the institution’s categories.\n69\nThe Company’s risk-based capital ratios at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are presented in Table 11 below:\nTable 11: Risk-Based Capital\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023\nTier 1 capital:\nStockholders’ equity $ 3,528,833 $ 3,426,488\nCECL transition provision 30,873 61,746\nGoodwill and other intangible assets (1,388,549) (1,398,810)\nUnrealized loss on available-for-sale securities, net of income taxes 335,861 404,375\nTotal Tier 1 capital 2,507,018 2,493,799\nTier 2 capital:\nSubordinated notes and debentures 366,255 366,141\nSubordinated debt phase out (132,000) (66,000)\nQualifying allowance for credit losses and reserve for unfunded commitments 220,517 170,977\nTotal Tier 2 capital 454,772 471,118\nTotal risk-based capital $ 2,961,790 $ 2,964,917\nRisk weighted assets $ 20,790,941 $ 20,599,238\nAssets for leverage ratio $ 26,198,178 $ 26,552,988\nRatios at end of period:\nCommon equity Tier 1 ratio (CET1) 12.06 % 12.11 %\nTier 1 leverage ratio 9.57 % 9.39 %\nTier 1 risk-based capital ratio 12.06 % 12.11 %\nTotal risk-based capital ratio 14.25 % 14.39 %\nMinimum guidelines:\nCommon equity Tier 1 ratio (CET1) 4.50 % 4.50 %\nTier 1 leverage ratio 4.00 % 4.00 %\nTier 1 risk-based capital ratio 6.00 % 6.00 %\nTotal risk-based capital ratio 8.00 % 8.00 %\nRegulatory Capital Changes\nIn December 2018, the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) (collectively, the\n“agencies”) issued a final rule revising regulatory capital rules in anticipation of the adoption of ASU 2016-13 that provided an option to phase in over a\nthree year period on a straight line basis the day-one impact of the adoption on earnings and Tier 1 capital (the “CECL Transition Provision”).\nIn March 2020 and in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the agencies issued a new regulatory capital rule revising the CECL Transition Provision to\ndelay the estimated impact on regulatory capital stemming from the implementation of ASU 2016-13. The rule provided banking organizations that\nimplement CECL before the end of 2020 the option to delay for two years an estimate of CECL’s effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year\ntransition period (the “2020 CECL Transition Provision”). The Company elected to apply the 2020 CECL Transition Provision.\nThe Basel III Capital Rules define the components of capital and address other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions’ regulatory capital\nratios. The rules also address risk weights and other issues affecting the denominator in banking institutions’ regulatory capital ratios with a more risk-\nsensitive approach. The Basel III Capital Rules established risk-weighting categories depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0% for\nU.S. government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures.\nThe final rules included a new common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 4.5% and a common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer\nof 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. The rules also raised the minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets to 6.0% and require a minimum leverage\nratio of 4.0%.\n70\nPrior to December 31, 2017, Tier 1 capital included common equity Tier 1 capital and certain additional Tier 1 items as provided under the Basel III Capital\nRules. Qualifying subordinated debt of $234.3 million and $300.1 million is included as Tier 2 and total capital of the Company as of September 30, 2024\nand December 31, 2023, respectively.\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nSee the 5HFHQWO\\\u0003,VVXHG\u0003$FFRXQWLQJ\u00036WDQGDUGV\u0003section in Note 1, Preparation of Interim Financial Statements, in the accompanying Condensed Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report for details of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on\nthe Company’s ongoing financial position and results of operation.\nCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nCertain statements contained in this quarterly report may not be based on historical facts and should be considered “forward-looking statements” within the\nmeaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, those\nrelating to the Company’s future growth, completed acquisitions, revenue, expenses, assets, asset quality, profitability, earnings, accretion, dividends,\ncustomer service, lending capacity and lending activity, investment in digital channels, critical accounting policies and estimates, net interest margin,\nnoninterest revenue, noninterest expense, market conditions related to and the impact of the Company’s stock repurchase program, consumer behavior and\nliquidity, the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, income tax deductions, credit quality, the level of credit losses from lending commitments, net\ninterest revenue, interest rate sensitivity, repricing of loans and time deposits, loan loss experience, liquidity, the Company’s expectations regarding actions\nby the FHLB and other agencies, capital resources, market risk, plans for future and current investments in securities and investment portfolio strategies,\neffect of pending and future litigation, staffing initiatives, estimated cost savings associated with the Company’s early retirement program and Better Bank\nInitiative, acquisition strategy and activity, legal and regulatory limitations and compliance and competition.\nThese forward-looking statements are based on various assumptions and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and may not be realized due to a variety\nof factors, including, without limitation: changes in the Company’s operating, acquisition, or expansion strategy; the effects of future economic conditions\n(including unemployment levels and slowdowns in economic growth), governmental monetary and fiscal policies, including policies of the Federal\nReserve, as well as legislative and regulatory changes; general business conditions, as well as conditions within the financial markets, developments\nimpacting the financial services industry, such as bank failures or concerns involving liquidity; changes in real estate values; changes in interest rates and\nrelated governmental policies; changes in liquidity; inflation; changes in the level and composition of deposits, loan demand, deposit flows, credit quality\nand the values of loan collateral, securities and interest sensitive assets and liabilities; changes in credit quality; actions taken by the Company to manage\nits investment securities portfolio; changes in the securities markets generally or the price of the Company’s common stock; developments in information\ntechnology affecting the financial industry; changes in customer behaviors, including consumer spending, borrowing and saving habits; cyber threats,\nattacks or events, including at third-parties with which we rely on for key services; reliance on third parties for the provision of key services;

possible adverse rulings, judgements, settlements, fines and other outcomes of pending or future litigation or\ngovernment actions; market disruptions, including pandemics or significant health hazards, severe weather conditions, natural disasters, terrorist activities,\nfinancial crises, political crises, war and other military conflicts (including the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and between Israel\nand Hamas) or other major events, or the prospect of these events; the soundness of other financial institutions and indirect exposure related to the closings\nof other financial institutions and their impact on the broader market through other customers, suppliers and partners (or that the conditions which resulted\nin the liquidity concerns that led to the large regional bank failures during 2023 may also adversely impact, directly or indirectly, other financial institutions\nand market participants with which the Company has commercial or deposit relationships); the loss of key employees; increased unemployment; labor\nshortages; the Company’s ability to manage and successfully integrate its mergers and acquisitions and to fully realize cost savings and other benefits\nassociated with those transactions; the effects of government legislation; the effects of competition from other commercial banks, thrifts, mortgage banking\nfirms, consumer finance companies, credit unions, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market and other mutual funds and other\nfinancial institutions operating in our market area and elsewhere, including institutions operating regionally, nationally and internationally, together with\nsuch competitors offering banking products and services by mail, cell phone/tablet, telephone, computer and the Internet; the failure of assumptions\nunderlying the establishment of reserves for possible credit losses, fair value for loans, OREO, and other cautionary statements set forth elsewhere in this\nreport.\n71\nAdditional information on factors that might cause the Company’s results to differ materially from those disclosed in the forward-looking statements is\nincluded in the “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” sections of this quarterly\nreport, the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and related disclosures in other filings with the SEC, which are\navailable on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. Many of these factors are beyond our ability to predict or control, and actual results could differ materially\nfrom those in the forward-looking statements due to these factors and others. In addition, as a result of these and other factors, our past financial\nperformance should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.\nWe believe the assumptions and expectations that underlie or are reflected in our forward-looking statements are reasonable, based on information available\nto us on the date hereof. However, given the described uncertainties and risks, we cannot guarantee our future performance or results of operations or\nwhether our future performance will differ materially from the performance reflected in or implied by our forward-looking statements, and you should not\nplace undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date hereof, and we undertake no\nobligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, and all written or oral\nforward-looking statements attributable to us are expressly qualified in their entirety by this section.\nGAAP RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThe tables below present computations of adjusted earnings (net income excluding certain items {net branch right sizing costs, merger related costs, FDIC\nspecial assessment, loss (gain) on sale of securities, termination of vendor and software services, early retirement program costs and tax effect}) (non-\nGAAP), and adjusted diluted earnings per share (non-GAAP) as well as a computation of tangible book value per share (non-GAAP), tangible common\nequity to tangible assets (non-GAAP), adjusted noninterest income (non-GAAP), adjusted noninterest expense (non-GAAP), adjusted salaries and\nemployee benefits expense (non-GAAP), uninsured, non-collateralized deposits (non-GAAP) and the coverage ratio of uninsured, non-collateralized\ndeposits (non-GAAP). Adjusted items are included in financial results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP).\nThe Company has updated its calculation of certain non-GAAP financial measures to exclude the impact of gains or losses on the sale of AFS investment\nsecurities in light of the impact of the Company’s strategic AFS investment securities transactions during the fourth quarter of 2023 and has presented past\nperiods on a comparable basis.\nWe believe the exclusion of these certain items in expressing earnings and certain other financial measures, including “adjusted earnings,” provides a\nmeaningful basis for period-to-period and company-to-company comparisons, which management believes will assist investors and analysts in analyzing\nthe adjusted financial measures of the Company and predicting future performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are also used by management to\nassess the performance of the Company’s business because management does not consider these certain items to be relevant to ongoing financial\nperformance. Management and the Board of Directors utilize “adjusted earnings” (non-GAAP) for the following purposes:\n• Preparation of the Company’s operating budgets\n• Monthly financial performance reporting\n• Monthly “flash” reporting of consolidated results (management only)\n• Investor presentations of Company performance\nWe believe the presentation of “adjusted earnings” on a diluted per share basis (non-GAAP) provides a meaningful basis for period-to-period and\ncompany-to-company comparisons, which management believes will assist investors and analysts in analyzing the adjusted financial measures of the\nCompany and predicting future performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are also used by management to assess the performance of the\nCompany’s business, because management does not consider these certain items to be relevant to ongoing financial performance on a per share basis.\nManagement and the Board of Directors utilize “adjusted diluted earnings per share” (non-GAAP) for the following purposes:\n• Calculation of annual performance-based incentives for certain executives\n• Calculation of long-term performance-based incentives for certain executives\n• Investor presentations of Company performance\nWe have $1.422 billion and $1.433 billion total goodwill and other intangible assets for the periods ended September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively. Because our acquisition strategy has resulted in a high level of intangible assets, management believes useful calculations include tangible\nbook value per share (non-GAAP) and tangible common equity to tangible assets (non-GAAP).\nWe believe that presenting these non-GAAP financial measures permits investors and analysts to assess the performance of the Company on the same basis\nas that is applied by management and the Board of Directors.\n72\nNon-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. To mitigate these limitations, we\nhave procedures in place to identify and approve each item that qualifies as adjusted to ensure that the Company’s “adjusted” results are properly reflected\nfor period-to-period comparisons. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company, they\nhave limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP. In particular,\na measure of earnings that excludes certain items does not represent the amount that effectively accrues directly to stockholders (i.e., certain items are\nincluded in earnings and stockholders’ equity). Additionally, similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies may not be computed\nin the same or similar fashion.\nSee Table 12 below for the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude certain items for the periods presented.\nTable 12: Reconciliation of Adjusted Earnings (non-GAAP)\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, June 30, September 30,

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThe Company has leveraged its investment in Simmons Bank and depends upon the dividends paid to it, as the sole shareholder of Simmons Bank, as a\nprincipal source of funds for dividends to shareholders, stock repurchases and debt service requirements. At September 30, 2024, undivided profits of\nSimmons Bank were approximately $536.2 million, none of which were available for the payment of dividends to the Company without regulatory\napproval. In addition to dividends, other sources of liquidity for the Company are the sale of equity securities and the borrowing of funds.\nSubsidiary Bank\nGenerally speaking, Simmons Bank relies upon net inflows of cash from financing activities, supplemented by net inflows of cash from operating\nactivities, to provide cash used in investing activities. Typical of most banking companies, significant financing activities include: deposit gathering; use of\nshort-term borrowing facilities, such as federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements; and the issuance of long-term debt. Simmons Bank’s primary\ninvesting activities include loan originations and purchases of investment securities, offset by loan payoffs and investment cash flows and maturities.\nLiquidity represents an institution’s ability to provide funds to satisfy demands from depositors and borrowers by either converting assets into cash or\naccessing new or existing sources of incremental funds. A major responsibility of management is to maximize net interest income within prudent liquidity\nconstraints. Internal corporate guidelines have been established to constantly measure liquid assets as well as relevant ratios concerning earning asset levels\nand purchased funds. The management and Board of Directors of the subsidiary bank monitors these same indicators and makes adjustments as needed.\nLiquidity Management\nThe objective of our liquidity management is to access adequate sources of funding to ensure that cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers are\nmet in an orderly and timely manner. Sources of liquidity are managed so that reliance on any one funding source is kept to a minimum. Our liquidity\nsources are prioritized for both availability and time to activation.\nOur liquidity is a primary consideration in determining funding needs and is an integral part of asset/liability management. Pricing of the liability side is a\nmajor component of interest margin and spread management. Adequate liquidity is a necessity in addressing this critical task. There are seven primary and\nsecondary sources of liquidity available to the Company. The particular liquidity need and timeframe determine the use of these sources.\nThe first source of liquidity available to the Company is federal funds. Federal funds are available on a daily basis and are used to meet the normal\nfluctuations of a dynamic balance sheet. As of September 30, 2024, Simmons Bank had approximately $435.0 million in federal funds lines of credit from\nupstream correspondent banks that can be accessed, if and when needed. In order to ensure availability of these upstream funds we test these borrowing\nlines at least annually. Historical monitoring of these funds has made it possible for us to project seasonal fluctuations and structure our funding\nrequirements on a month-to-month basis.\nSecond, Simmons Bank has lines of credit available with the FHLB. While we use portions of those lines to match off longer-term mortgage loans, we also\nuse those lines to meet liquidity needs. Approximately $4.96 billion of these lines of credit are currently available, if needed, for liquidity.\nA third source of liquidity is that we have the ability to access large wholesale deposits from both the public and private sector to fund short-term liquidity\nneeds.\nA fourth source of liquidity is the retail deposits available through our network of financial centers throughout Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma,\nTennessee and Texas. Although this method can be a somewhat more expensive alternative to supplying liquidity, this source can be used to meet\nintermediate term liquidity needs.\nFifth, we use a laddered investment portfolio that ensures there is a steady source of intermediate term liquidity. These funds can be used to meet seasonal\nloan patterns and other intermediate term balance sheet fluctuations. Approximately 42.4% of the investment portfolio is classified as available-for-sale,\nand we may generate additional liquidity through opportunistic sales of investment securities. We also use securities held in the securities portfolio to\npledge when obtaining public funds.\nSixth, we have a network of downstream correspondent banks from which we can access debt to meet liquidity needs.\nFinally, we have the ability to access funds through the Federal Reserve Bank Discount Window.\n76\nWe believe the various sources available are ample liquidity for short-term, intermediate-term and long-term liquidity.\nMarket Risk Management\nMarket risk arises from changes in interest rates. We have risk management policies to monitor and limit exposure to market risk. In asset and liability\nmanagement activities, policies designed to minimize structural interest rate risk are in place. The measurement of market risk associated with financial\ninstruments is meaningful only when all related and offsetting on- and off-balance-sheet transactions are aggregated, and the resulting net positions are\nidentified.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nInterest rate risk represents the potential impact of interest rate changes on net income and capital resulting from mismatches in repricing opportunities of\nassets and liabilities over a period of time. A number of tools are used to monitor and manage interest rate risk, including simulation models and interest\nsensitivity gap analysis. Management uses simulation models to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and various balance sheet strategies on the\nlevel of the Company’s net income and capital. As a means of limiting interest rate risk to an acceptable level, management may alter the mix of floating\nand fixed-rate assets and liabilities, change pricing schedules and manage investment maturities during future security purchases, or enter into derivative\ncontracts such as interest rate swaps.\nThe simulation model incorporates management’s assumptions regarding the level of interest rates or balance changes for indeterminate maturity deposits\nfor a given level of market rate changes. These assumptions have been developed through anticipated pricing behavior. Key assumptions in the simulation\nmodels include the relative timing of prepayments, cash flows and maturities. These assumptions are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the model cannot\nprecisely estimate net interest income or precisely predict the impact of a change in interest rates on net income or capital. Actual results will differ from\nsimulated results due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and management strategies, among\nother factors.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the model simulations projected that 100 and 200 basis point increases in interest rates would result in a negative variance in net\ninterest income of 1.83% and 3.82%, respectively, relative to the base case over the next 12 months. Interest rate decreases of 100 and 200 basis points\nwould result in positive variances in net interest income of 1.59% and 2.62%, respectively, relative to the base case over the next 12 months. These results\nreflect a liability-sensitive balance sheet and are consistent with the Company’s shift toward short-term funding combined with relatively little change in\nthe mix of interest-earning assets. These are good faith estimates and assume that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at\neach period-end will remain constant over the relevant twelve month measurement period and that changes in market interest rates are instantaneous and\nsustained across the yield curve regardless of duration of pricing characteristics of specific assets or liabilities. Also, this analysis does not contemplate any\nactions that we might undertake in response to changes in market interest rates. We believe these estimates are not necessarily indicative of what actually\ncould occur in the event of immediate interest rate increases or decreases of this magnitude. As interest-bearing assets and liabilities reprice in different\ntime frames and proportions to market interest rate movements, various assumptions must be made based on historical relationships of these variables in\nreaching any conclusion. Since these correlations are based on competitive and market conditions, we anticipate that our future results will likely be\ndifferent from the foregoing estimates, and such differences could be material.\nThe table below presents our sensitivity to net interest income at September 30, 2024:\nTable 17: Net Interest Income Sensitivity\nInterest Rate Scenario % Change from Base\nUp 200 basis points (3.82)%\nUp 100 basis points (1.83)%\nDown 100 basis points 1.59%\nDown 200 basis points 2.62%\n77\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nManagement, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting\nOfficer, has reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e)\nunder the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer\nand Chief Accounting Officer have concluded that the Company’s current disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance\nlevels as of the end of the period covered by this report to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits\nunder the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such\ninformation is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief\nAccounting Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no\nevaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures will detect or uncover every situation\ninvolving the failure of persons within the Company or its subsidiary to disclose material information required to be set forth in the Company’s periodic\nreports.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, which materially affected,\nor are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nPart II: Other Information\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nThe information contained in Note 12, Contingent Liabilities, of the Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report\nis incorporated herein by reference.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nThere have been no material changes in the risk factors faced by the Company from those disclosed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nIn January 2022, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program (the “2022 Program”) under which we could repurchase up to\n$175.0 million of our Class A common stock currently issued and outstanding. Because the 2022 Program was set to terminate on January 31, 2024, our\nBoard of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program in January 2024 (“2024 Program”) under which we may repurchase up to $175.0 million of\nour Class A common stock currently issued and outstanding.

BUSINESS\nCompany Overview\nSimmons First National Corporation, an Arkansas corporation organized in 1968, is a financial holding company registered under the Bank Holding\nCompany Act of 1956, as amended. The terms “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Simmons First National Corporation and, where appropriate, its\nsubsidiaries. The Company is headquartered in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, and had total consolidated assets of $27.3 billion, total consolidated loans of $16.8\nbillion, total consolidated deposits of $22.2 billion and equity capital of $3.4 billion, each as of December 31, 2023. The Company, through its subsidiaries,\nprovides banking and other financial products and services in markets located in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas.\nWe seek to build shareholder value by, among other things, focusing on strong asset quality, maintaining strong capital, managing our liquidity position,\nimproving our operational efficiency and opportunistically growing our business, both organically and through mergers with and acquisitions of other\nfinancial institutions. Our business philosophy centers on building strong, deep customer relationships through excellent customer service and integrity in\nour operations. While we have grown in recent years into a regional financial institution and one of the largest bank/financial holding companies\nheadquartered in the State of Arkansas, we continue to emphasize, where practicable, a community-based mindset focused on local associates responding\nto local banking needs and making business decisions in the markets they serve. Those efforts, though, are buttressed by experienced, centralized support\nfunctions in select, critical areas. While we serve a variety of customers and industries, we are not dependent on any single customer or industry.\nSubsidiary Bank\nThe Company’s lead subsidiary, Simmons Bank (“Simmons Bank” or the “Bank”), is an Arkansas state-chartered bank that has been in operation since\n1903.\nSimmons Bank provides banking and other financial products and services to individuals and businesses using a network of approximately 234 financial\ncenters in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas. Simmons Bank offers commercial banking products and services to business and\nother corporate customers. Simmons Bank extends loans for a broad range of corporate purposes, including (among others) financing commercial real\nestate, construction of particular properties, commercial and industrial uses, acquisition and equipment financings, and other general corporate needs.\nSimmons Bank also engages in small business administration (“SBA”) and agricultural finance lending, and it offers corporate credit card products, as well\nas corporate deposit products and treasury management services.\nIn addition, Simmons Bank offers a variety of consumer banking products and services, including (among others) savings, time, and checking deposit\nproducts; ATM services; internet and mobile banking platforms; overdraft facilities; real estate, home equity, and other consumer loans and lines of credit;\nconsumer credit card products; and safe deposit boxes. Simmons Bank also maintains a networking arrangement with a third-party broker-dealer that offers\nbrokerage services to Simmons Bank customers, as well as a trust department that provides a variety of trust, investment, agency, and custodial services for\nindividual and corporate clients (including, among others, administration of estates and personal trusts as well as management of investment accounts).\nAdditionally, Simmons First Insurance Services, Inc. and Simmons First Insurance Services of TN, LLC are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Simmons Bank\nand are insurance agencies that offer various lines of personal and corporate insurance coverage to individual and commercial customers.\n5\nCommunity and Commercial Banking Strategy\nHistorically, the Company utilized separately chartered community bank subsidiaries to provide full-service banking products and services across our\nfootprint. During 2014, we consolidated all separately chartered banks into Simmons Bank in order to more effectively meet the increased regulatory\nburden facing banks, reduce certain operating costs, and more efficiently perform operational duties. To both effectively compete for and service the needs\nof different types of customers, Simmons Bank now operates using two main groups, a community banking group (which generally focuses on small-to-\nmid-size customer relationships) and a commercial banking group (which generally focuses on larger, more complex customers with intricate or unique\nbanking needs). Both of these groups are supported by Simmons Bank’s retail, private banking, trust and various operations divisions.\nGrowth Strategy\nOver the years, as we have expanded our markets and services, our growth strategy has evolved and diversified. We have used varying acquisition and\ninternal branching methods to enter key growth markets and increase the size of our footprint.\nSince 1990, we have completed 21 whole bank acquisitions, one trust company acquisition, five bank branch acquisitions, one bankruptcy (363)\nacquisition, four FDIC failed bank acquisitions and four Resolution Trust Corporation failed thrift acquisitions. The following summary provides additional\ndetails concerning our more recent acquisition activity.\nIn 2013, we completed the acquisition of Metropolitan National Bank (“Metropolitan” or “MNB”) from Rogers Bancshares, Inc. (“RBI”). The purchase\nwas completed through an auction of the MNB stock by the U. S. Bankruptcy Court as a part of the Chapter 11 proceeding of RBI. MNB, which was\nheadquartered in Little Rock, Arkansas, served central and northwest Arkansas and had total assets of $950 million. Upon completion of the acquisition,\nMNB and our Rogers, Arkansas chartered bank, Simmons First Bank of Northwest Arkansas were merged into Simmons Bank. As an in-market\nacquisition, MNB had significant branch overlap with our existing branch footprint. We completed the systems conversion for MNB on March 21, 2014,\nand simultaneously closed 27 branch locations that had overlapping footprints with other locations.\nOn August 31, 2014, we completed the acquisition of Delta Trust & Banking Corporation (“Delta Trust”), including its wholly-owned bank subsidiary,\nDelta Trust & Bank. Also headquartered in Little Rock, Arkansas, Delta Trust had total assets of $420 million. The acquisition further expanded Simmons\nBank's presence in south, central and northwest Arkansas and allowed us the opportunity to provide services that had not previously been offered with the\naddition of Delta Trust's insurance agency and securities brokerage service. We merged Delta Trust & Bank into Simmons Bank and completed the systems\nconversion on October 24, 2014. At that time, we also closed 4 branch locations with overlapping footprints.\nIn February 2015, we completed the acquisition of Liberty Bancshares, Inc. (“Liberty”), including its wholly-owned bank subsidiary, Liberty Bank. Liberty\nwas headquartered in Springfield, Missouri, served southwest Missouri and had total assets of $1.1 billion. The acquisition enhanced Simmons Bank’s\npresence not only in southwest Missouri, but also in the St. Louis and Kansas City metropolitan areas. The acquisition also allowed us the opportunity to\nprovide services that we had not previously offered in these areas such as trust and securities brokerage services. In addition, Liberty’s expertise in SBA\nlending enhanced our commercial offerings throughout our geographies. We merged Liberty Bank into Simmons Bank and completed the systems\nconversion in April 2015.\nAlso in February 2015, we completed the acquisition of Community First Bancshares, Inc. (“Community First”), including its wholly-owned bank\nsubsidiary, First State Bank. Community First was headquartered in Union City, Tennessee, served customers throughout Tennessee, and had total assets of\n$1.9 billion. The acquisition expanded our footprint into Tennessee and allowed us the opportunity to provide additional services to customers in this area\nand expand our community banking strategy. In addition, Community First’s expertise in SBA and consumer lending benefited our customers across each\nregion. We merged First State Bank into Simmons Bank and completed the systems conversion in September 2015.\nIn October 2015, we completed the acquisition of Ozark Trust & Investment Corporation (“Ozark Trust”), including its wholly-owned non-deposit trust\ncompany, Trust Company of the Ozarks. Headquartered in Springfield, Missouri, Ozark Trust had over $1 billion in assets under management and provided\na wide range of financial services for its clients including investment management, trust services, IRA rollover or transfers, successor trustee services and\npersonal representative and custodial services. As our first acquisition of a fee-only financial firm, Ozark Trust provided a new wealth management\ncapability that could be leveraged across the Company’s entire geographic footprint.\n6\nIn September 2016, we completed the acquisition of Citizens National Bank (“Citizens”), headquartered in Athens, Tennessee. Citizens had total assets of\n$585 million and strengthened our position in east Tennessee by nine branches. The acquisition expanded our footprint in east Tennessee and allowed us\nthe opportunity to provide additional services to customers in this area and expand our community banking strategy. We merged Citizens into Simmons\nBank and completed the systems conversion in October 2016.\nIn May 2017, we completed the acquisition of Hardeman County Investment Company, Inc. (“Hardeman”), headquartered in Jackson, Tennessee, including\nits wholly-owned bank subsidiary, First South Bank. We acquired approximately $463 million in assets and strengthened our position in the western\nTennessee market. We merged First South Bank into Simmons Bank and completed the systems conversion in September 2017. As part of the systems\nconversion, we consolidated or closed three existing Simmons Bank and two First South Bank branches due to overlapping footprint.\nIn October 2017, we completed the acquisition of First Texas BHC, Inc. (“First Texas”), headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, including its wholly-owned\nbank subsidiary, Southwest Bank. Southwest Bank had total assets of $2.4 billion. This acquisition allowed us to enter the Texas banking markets, and it\nalso strengthened our specialty product offerings in the areas of SBA lending and trust services. The systems conversion was completed in February 2018,\nat which time Southwest Bank was merged into Simmons Bank.\nAlso in October 2017, we completed the acquisition of Southwest Bancorp, Inc. (“OKSB”), including its wholly-owned bank subsidiary, Bank SNB.\nHeadquartered in Stillwater, Oklahoma, OKSB provided us with $2.7 billion in assets, allowed us additional entry into the Oklahoma, Texas and Colorado\nbanking markets, and strengthened our Kansas franchise and our product offerings in the healthcare and real estate industries. The systems conversion was\ncompleted in May 2018, at which time Bank SNB was merged into Simmons Bank.\nIn April 2019, we completed the acquisition of Reliance Bancshares, Inc. (“Reliance”), headquartered in Des Peres, Missouri (part of the greater St. Louis\nmetropolitan area), including its wholly-owned bank subsidiary, Reliance Bank. We acquired approximately $1.5 billion in assets and added 22 branches to\nthe Simmons Bank footprint, substantially enhancing our retail presence within the St. Louis market area. The systems conversion was completed in April\n2019, at which time Reliance Bank was merged into Simmons Bank.\nIn October 2019, we completed the acquisition of The Landrum Company (“Landrum”), headquartered in Columbia, Missouri, including its wholly-owned\nbank subsidiary, Landmark Bank. We acquired approximately $3.4 billion in assets and further strengthened our position in Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas.\nThe systems conversion was completed in February 2020, at which time Landmark Bank merged into Simmons Bank. In connection with the systems\nconversion, we closed five existing Landmark Bank branches.\nIn October 2021, we completed the acquisition of Landmark Community Bank (“Landmark”), headquartered in Collierville, Tennessee, as well as the\nacquisition of Triumph Bancshares, Inc. (“Triumph”), including its wholly-owned bank subsidiary, Triumph Bank, headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee.\nLandmark had total assets of $968.8 million, while Triumph provided us with $847.2 million in assets. These combined acquisitions allowed us to expand\nour existing footprint in Tennessee and to further enhance our scale in two of our key Tennessee growth markets – Memphis and Nashville. The systems\nconversions for both Landmark and Triumph Bank were completed in October 2021, at which time Landmark and Triumph Bank were merged into\nSimmons Bank.\nIn April 2022, we completed the acquisition of Spirit of Texas Bancshares, Inc. (“Spirit”), headquartered in Conroe, Texas, including its wholly-owned\nbank subsidiary, Spirit of Texas Bank SSB (“Spirit Bank”). We acquired approximately $3.1 billion in assets and further strengthened our position in Texas.\nThe systems conversion was completed in April 2022, at which time Spirit Bank merged into Simmons Bank.\nMerger and Acquisition Strategy\nMerger and acquisition activities have been an important part of the Company’s growth strategy. While we continue to consider strategic merger and\nacquisition opportunities if and as they arise, and while we continue to believe that current market and industry conditions will continue to cause various\nfinancial institutions to seek merger partners in the near-to-intermediate future, in the near term, we are also enhancing our focus on ensuring that we\ncapitalize on organic growth opportunities in many of the markets that we have had the fortune to enter through previous mergers and acquisitions.\nThrough our “Better Bank” initiative, we have also focused on evaluating and, where appropriate, enhancing our people, processes and systems so that we\nare able to more effectively and efficiently compete as an organization of the size and scale that we now have achieved.\n7\nTo the extent that a strategic merger and acquisition opportunity becomes of interest, we believe our community banking philosophy, access to capital and\nsuccessful merger and acquisition history would position us as a purchaser of choice for a community and regional bank seeking a strong partner.\nAs consolidations continue to unfold in the banking industry, the management of risk is an important consideration in how the Company evaluates and\nconsummates these transactions. The senior management teams of both the Company and Simmons Bank have extensive experience in acquiring banks,\nbranches and deposits and post-acquisition integration of operations. We believe this experience positions us to successfully acquire and integrate banks to\nthe extent a compelling strategic opportunity presents itself.\nThe process of merging or acquiring banking organizations is extremely complex; it requires a great deal of time and effort from both buyer and seller. The\nbusiness, legal, operational, organizational, accounting, and tax issues all must be addressed if the merger or acquisition is to be successful. Throughout the\nprocess, valuation is an important aspect of the decision-making process, from initial target analysis through integration of the entities. Merger and\nacquisition strategies are vitally important in order to derive the maximum benefit out of a potential deal.\nStrategic considerations that can cause an acquirer or a target institution to explore or support a merger or acquisition transaction include, among other\nthings:\n• Potentially retaining the target institution’s senior management and providing them with an appealing level of autonomy post-integration.\n• Encouraging acquired banks, their boards and their associates to maintain their community involvement, while empowering the banks to offer a\nbroader array of financial products and services. We believe this approach leads to enhanced profitability of the combined franchise after the acquisition.\n• Taking advantage of future opportunities that can be exploited when the two companies are combined. Companies need to position themselves to\ntake advantage of emerging trends in the marketplace.\n• Strengthening the bench. One company may have a major weakness (such as poor distribution or service delivery) whereas the other company has\nsome significant strength. By combining the two companies, each company fills in strategic gaps that are essential for long-term survival.\n• Acquiring human resources and intellectual capital can help improve innovative thinking and development within the Company.\n• Acquiring a regional or multi-state bank can provide the Company with access to emerging/established markets and/or increased products and\nservices.\n• Providing additional scale and market share within our existing footprint.\nLoan Risk Assessment\nAs part of our ongoing risk assessment and analysis, the Company utilizes credit policies and procedures, internal credit expertise and several internal\nlayers of review. The internal layers of ongoing review include Division Presidents, Division and Senior Credit Officers, the Chief Credit Officer and\nCorporate Credit Officers, an Executive Loan Committee, a Senior Credit Committee, and a Directors’ Credit Committee.\nAdditionally, the Company has an Asset Quality Review Committee comprised of management that meets quarterly to review the adequacy of the\nallowance for credit losses. The Committee reviews the status of past due, non-performing and other impaired loans, reserve ratios, and additional\nperformance indicators for Simmons Bank. The appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses is determined based upon the aforementioned\nperformance factors, and provision adjustments are made accordingly.\nThe Board of Directors reviews the adequacy of its allowance for credit losses on a periodic basis giving consideration to past due loans, non-performing\nloans, other impaired loans, and current economic conditions. Our loan review department monitors loan information monthly. In order to verify the\naccuracy of the monthly analysis of the allowance for credit losses, the loan review department performs a detailed review of loans across each product line\nand all divisions on an annual basis or more often if warranted. Additionally, we have instituted a Special Asset Committee for the purpose of reviewing\ncriticized loans in regard to collateral adequacy, workout strategies and proper reserve allocations.\n8\nCompetition\nThere is significant competition among commercial banks in our various market areas. In addition, we also compete with other providers of financial\nservices, such as savings and loan associations, credit unions, finance companies, securities firms, insurance companies, full service brokerage firms,\ndiscount brokerage firms and fintech companies. Some of our competitors have greater resources and, as such, may have higher lending limits and may\noffer other services that we do not provide. Some of our competitors operate only in digital channels, which may result in those competitors investing\ngreater resources in information technology and digital product and service delivery without the overhead associated with a branch network. We generally\ncompete on the basis of customer service and responsiveness to customer needs, available loan and deposit products, the rates of interest charged on loans,\nthe rates of interest paid for funds, and the availability and pricing of trust and brokerage services.\nNonbank competitors are increasingly offering products and services that traditionally were bank products. Many of these nonbank competitors are not\nsubject to the same extensive federal regulations that govern bank holding companies and federally insured banks, which may allow them to offer greater\nlending limits and certain products and services that the Company and its affiliates do not provide.\nPrincipal Offices and Available Information\nOur principal executive offices are located at 501 Main Street, Pine Bluff, Arkansas 71601, and our telephone number is (870) 541-1000. We also have\ncorporate offices located at 601 E. 3rd Street, Little Rock, Arkansas 72201. We maintain a website at www.simmonsbank.com. On this website under the\n,QYHVWRU\u00035HODWLRQV\u0003section, we make our filings with the SEC (including our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports\non Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended)\navailable free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. In addition, our website\ncontains other news and announcements about the Company and its subsidiaries. Our website and the information contained on, or that can be accessed\nthrough, our website are not deemed to be incorporated by reference in, and are not considered part of, this Annual Report.\nHuman Capital\nOur associates are a critical component of our success. Because our business depends on our ability to attract, develop, and retain highly qualified, skilled\nlending, operations, information technology, and other associates, as well as managers who are experienced and effective at leading their respective\ndepartments, we have implemented wide-ranging programs focused on identifying and recruiting new talent, as well as enhancing the skills, qualifications,\nand satisfaction of our current associate base. In recruiting, we employ a variety of strategies, including, among other things, the use of in-house recruiters,\nsearch firms, and employment agencies, designed to attract qualified and diverse candidates. Among other opportunities, we offer student internships and a\nbanker trainee program that provides recent graduates with the opportunity to gain insight into several Company departments. We believe our\ncompensation program, which, in addition to base and incentive compensation, includes health, retirement, and an array of other benefit plans and\nprograms, is competitive within the financial industry, and we periodically review our plans and programs, as well as market surveys, to help ensure that\nour compensation program is consistent with our level of performance and that we have a current understanding of peer practices.\nWe provide our associates a variety of professional development opportunities, including participation in industry conferences, instructor-led continuing\neducation and training sessions, as well as online training sessions that focus on industry, regulatory, business, and leadership topics. We offer mentorship\nopportunities through our “Simmons Sidekick” and “Ambassadors” programs, and we provide tuition reimbursement for associates to attend a higher\neducation facility to obtain bachelor’s and master’s degrees that are relevant to the finance industry and/or their positions within the Company. We seek to\npromote from within the Company when feasible and have established programs, such as our “Next Generation Leadership Program,” to help develop\nfuture leadership talent.\n9\nWe are committed to maintaining a strong culture that not only engages associates but also serves as a catalyst for growth. Our values-based culture is\nmemorialized in a set of “Culture Cornerstones” that are communicated to all associates and incorporated in various ways throughout our operations. We\nstrive for all six of our Culture Cornerstones - Better Together; Integrity; Passion; High Performance; Pursue Growth; and Build Loyalty - to be reflected in\neverything we do, including how we interact with each other, how we interact with our customers, and how we interact with our vendors and business\npartners. Our sixth Culture Cornerstone, Build Loyalty, was added in 2022 to provide a compelling and pervasive customer-first operational approach that\nis designed to produce exceptional internal and external customer experiences. In 2023, we continued our focus on our Culture Cornerstone of High\nPerformance by implementing extensive new training and programming to support leaders and associates. We are also committed to promoting our\nassociates’ well-being. Our wellness program, “Ultimate You,” assists associates in improving their level of physical, financial, and mental fitness through\nofferings such as discounted gym memberships, financial literacy training, channels for counseling, and health-focused challenges and contests. Finally, our\ninclusion program, “We Are Simmons,” celebrates and supports the unique perspectives, experiences, and backgrounds of our associates. We believe these\ndifferences help us better serve our customers and make us stronger as a whole. In connection with this program, we have introduced Employee Resource\nGroups for veterans, women, African Americans, and LGBTQIA+ associates.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company and its subsidiaries had approximately 3,007 full time equivalent associates. None of our associates are\nrepresented by any union or similar groups, and we have not experienced any labor disputes or strikes arising from any such organized labor groups. We\nconsider our relationship with our associates to be good and strive to operate with an “open door policy” where associate concerns and issues can be\ndiscussed anytime directly with leadership or human resources. We have been recognized with “Best Places to Work” awards in several of our markets.\nSUPERVISION AND REGULATION\nThe Company\nThe Company, as a bank holding company, is subject to both federal and state regulation. Under federal law, a bank holding company generally must obtain\napproval from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“FRB”) before acquiring ownership or control of the assets or stock of a bank or a\nbank holding company. Prior to approval of any proposed acquisition, the FRB will review the effect on competition of the proposed acquisition, as well as\nother regulatory issues.\nThe federal law generally prohibits a bank holding company from directly or indirectly engaging in non-banking activities. This prohibition does not\ninclude loan servicing, liquidating activities or other activities so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto. Bank holding companies,\nincluding the Company, which have elected to qualify as financial holding companies, are authorized to engage in financial activities. Financial activities\ninclude any activity that is financial in nature or any activity that is incidental or complimentary to a financial activity.\nAs a financial holding company, we are required to file with the FRB an annual report and such additional information as may be required by law. From\ntime to time, the FRB examines the financial condition of the Company and its subsidiaries. Bank holding companies are not permitted to engage in unsafe\nand unsound banking practices. The FRB, through civil and criminal sanctions, is authorized to exercise enforcement powers over bank holding companies\n(including financial holding companies) and non-banking subsidiaries, to limit activities that represent unsafe or unsound practices or constitute violations\nof law.\nFederal law also requires the Company to act as a source of financial and managerial strength for our bank subsidiary and to commit resources to support\nthat subsidiary. This support may be required by federal banking agencies even at times when a bank holding company may not have the resources to\nprovide the support. Further, if the FRB believes that a bank holding company’s activities, assets or affiliates represent a significant risk to the financial\nsafety, soundness or stability of its subsidiary bank, then the FRB could require that bank holding company to terminate the activities, liquidate the assets or\ndivest the affiliates. Federal banking agencies, including the FRB, may require these and other actions in support of a subsidiary bank even if such actions\nare not in the best interests of the bank holding company or its stockholders.\nWe are subject to certain laws and regulations of the State of Arkansas applicable to financial and bank holding companies, including examination and\nsupervision by the Arkansas Bank Commissioner. Under Arkansas law, a financial or bank holding company is prohibited from owning more than one\nsubsidiary bank if any subsidiary bank owned by the holding company has been chartered for less than five years and, further, requires the approval of the\nArkansas Bank Commissioner for any acquisition of more than 25% of the capital stock of any other bank located in the State of Arkansas. No bank\nacquisition may be approved if, after such acquisition, the holding company would control, directly or indirectly, banks having 25% of the total bank\ndeposits in the State of Arkansas, excluding deposits of other banks and public funds.\n10\nAdditionally, under federal and state law, acquisitions of the Company’s common stock above certain thresholds or in connection with certain governance\nrights or business relationships may be subject to certain regulatory restrictions, including prior notice and approval requirements, and investors in the\nCompany’s common stock are responsible for ensuring that they comply with these restrictions to the extent they are applicable.\nFederal legislation allows bank holding companies (including financial holding companies) from any state to acquire banks located in any state without\nregard to state law, provided that the holding company (1) is well capitalized, (2) is well managed, (3) would not control more than 10% of the insured\ndeposits in the United States or more than 30% of the insured deposits in such state, and (4) such bank has been in existence at least five years if so\nrequired by the applicable state law.\nThe principal source of the Company’s liquidity is dividends from Simmons Bank, the payment of which is subject to certain limitations imposed by\nfederal and state laws. The approval of the Arkansas Bank Commissioner is, for instance, required if the total of all dividends declared by an Arkansas state\nbank in any calendar year exceeds seventy-five percent (75%) of the total of its net profits, as defined, for that year combined with seventy-five percent\n(75%) of its retained net profits of the preceding year. Under the foregoing dividend restrictions, and while maintaining its “well capitalized” status, at\nDecember 31, 2023, Simmons Bank had approximately $54.4 million available for payment of dividends to the Company, without prior regulatory\napproval. While past dividends are not necessarily indicative of amounts that may be paid or available to be paid in future periods, net profits of Simmons\nBank and cash balances at the Company are projected to be sufficient to pay quarterly dividends on the Company’s common stock at current levels and\ninterest and principal on the Company’s debt as well as meet other liquidity needs.\nIn 2019, final rules were adopted that, among other things, eliminated a prior approval requirement in the Basel III Capital Rules (discussed below) for a\nbank holding company to repurchase shares of its common stock, provided that the bank holding company is well capitalized both before and after the\nproposed repurchase, well-managed, and not the subject of any unresolved supervisory issues. However, a bank holding company’s repurchases of shares\nof its common stock may, in certain circumstances, be subject to approval or notice requirements under other regulations, policies, or supervisory\nexpectations of the bank holding company’s regulators, may be discouraged by regulators in the form of supervisory feedback on the bank holding\ncompany’s regulatory capital levels or plan, and must comply with all applicable state and federal corporate and securities laws and regulations.\nSubsidiary Bank\nSimmons Bank is an Arkansas state-chartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve System through the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Due to\nthe Company’s typical acquisition process, there may be brief periods of time during which the Company may operate another subsidiary bank that the\nCompany acquired through a merger with a target bank holding company as a separate subsidiary while preparing for the merger and integration of that\nsubsidiary bank into Simmons Bank. However, it is the Company’s intent to generally maintain Simmons Bank as the Company’s sole subsidiary bank.\nThe lending powers of the subsidiary bank are generally subject to certain restrictions, including the amount which may be loaned to a single borrower. Our\nsubsidiary bank is a member of the FDIC, which provides insurance on deposits of each member bank up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance\nFund. For this protection, our bank pays a statutory assessment to the FDIC each year.\nFurthermore, as a member of the Federal Reserve System, our subsidiary bank is required by law to maintain reserves against its transaction deposits as\nrequired by the FRB. The reserves must be held in cash or with the FRB. Banks are permitted to meet this requirement by maintaining the specified amount\nas an average balance over a two-week period. During 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the FRB acting pursuant to the Federal Reserve Act reduced\nthe reserve requirements to zero until further notice. As a result, as of December 31, 2023, the Company’s reserve balances were zero.\nPursuant to federal laws and regulations, national and state-chartered banks may establish branches in their home states, as well as in other states.\nApplications to establish branches must be filed with the appropriate primary federal regulator and, where applicable, the bank’s state regulatory authority.\nAs an Arkansas state-chartered bank, our subsidiary bank files branch applications with both the FRB and the Arkansas State Bank Department.\nFederal laws and regulations also restrict banks, including our subsidiary bank, from establishing certain tying arrangements. In particular, subject to\ncertain exceptions, banks, including our subsidiary bank, are prohibited from extending credit, leasing or selling property, furnishing services, or varying\nprices on the condition that the customer obtain an additional product or service from the bank or its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor of the\nbank or its affiliates.\n11\nTransactions with Affiliates and Insiders\nUnder federal law, transactions between insured depository institutions and their affiliates are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve\nAct and its implementing regulation, Regulation W. In a bank holding company context, at a minimum, the parent holding company of a bank, any\ncompanies which are controlled by such parent holding company, and financial subsidiaries of the bank, are affiliates of the bank. Generally, Sections 23A\nand 23B of the Federal Reserve Act are intended to protect insured depository institutions from losses arising from transactions with non-insured affiliates\nby limiting the extent to which a bank or its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions with any one affiliate and with all affiliates of the bank in the\naggregate, and requiring that such transactions be on terms consistent with safe and sound banking practices.\nLoans to executive officers, directors, or any person who directly or indirectly, or acting through or in concert with one or more persons, owns, controls, or\nhas the power to vote more than 10% of any class of voting securities of a bank (“10% Shareholders”), are subject to Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the\nFederal Reserve Act and their corresponding regulations (Regulation O) and Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act relating to the prohibition on personal\nloans to executives (which exempts financial institutions in compliance with the insider lending restrictions of Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act).\nAmong other things, these loans must be made on terms substantially the same as those prevailing on transactions made to unaffiliated individuals, except\nthat such insiders may receive preferential loans made under a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to the bank's employees and does\nnot give preference to the insider over the employees, and certain extensions of credit to those persons must first be approved in advance by a disinterested\nmajority of the entire Board of Directors. Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and its implementing regulation, Regulation O, prohibits loans to any\ndirectors, executive officers, and principal stockholders and their related interests where the aggregate amount exceeds an amount equal to 15% of an\ninstitution’s unimpaired capital and surplus plus an additional 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus in the case of loans that are fully secured by readily\nmarketable collateral, or when the aggregate amount on all of the extensions of credit outstanding to all of these persons would exceed the Bank’s\nunimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. Section 22(g) of the Federal Reserve Act places additional limitations on loans to executive officers and\nidentifies limited circumstances in which the Bank is permitted to extend credit to executive officers.\nAs a result, our subsidiary bank is limited in its ability to make extensions of credit to the Company, investing in the stock or other securities of the\nCompany, and engaging in other affiliated financial transactions with the Company.\nPotential Enforcement Action for Bank Holding Companies and Banks\nEnforcement proceedings seeking civil or criminal sanctions may be instituted against any bank, any financial or bank holding company, any director,\nofficer, employee or agent of the bank or holding company, which is believed by the federal banking agencies to be violating any administrative\npronouncement or engaged in unsafe and unsound practices. In more serious cases, enforcement actions may include the issuance of directives to increase\ncapital; the issuance of formal and informal agreements; the imposition of civil monetary penalties; the issuance of a cease and desist order that can be\njudicially enforced; the issuance of removal and prohibition orders against officers, directors, and other institution-affiliated parties; the termination of a\nbank’s deposit insurance; the appointment of a conservator or receiver for a bank; and the enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining\norders based upon a judicial determination that the agency would be harmed if such equitable relief was not granted.\nRisk-Weighted Capital Requirements for the Company and the Subsidiary Bank\nEffective January 1, 2015, the Company and its subsidiary bank became subject to new capital regulations (“Basel III Capital Rules”) adopted by the\nFederal Reserve in July 2013 establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banks. The Basel III Capital Rules were fully implemented as\nof January 1, 2019. For a tabular summary of our risk-weighted capital ratios, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\nResults of Operations – Capital” and Note 23, Stockholders’ Equity, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Basel III Capital Rules include a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets (“CET1”) ratio of 4.5% and a common equity Tier 1 capital\nconservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. CET1 generally consists of common stock; retained earnings; accumulated other comprehensive\nincome; and certain minority interests, all subject to applicable regulatory adjustments and deductions. The Company and its subsidiary bank must hold a\ncapital conservation buffer composed of CET1 capital above its minimum risk-based capital requirements.\n12\nA banking organization’s qualifying total capital consists of two components: Tier 1 Capital and Tier 2 Capital. Tier 1 Capital is an amount equal to the\nsum of common stockholders’ equity, hybrid capital instruments (instruments with characteristics of debt and equity) in an amount up to 25% of Tier 1\nCapital, certain preferred stock and the minority interest in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. For bank holding companies and financial\nholding companies, goodwill (net of any deferred tax liability associated with that goodwill) may not be included in Tier 1 Capital. Identifiable intangible\nassets may be included in Tier 1 Capital for banking organizations, in accordance with certain further requirements. At least 50% of the banking\norganization’s total regulatory capital must consist of Tier 1 Capital.\nTier 2 Capital is an amount equal to the sum of the qualifying portion of the allowance for credit losses, certain preferred stock not included in Tier 1,\nhybrid capital instruments (instruments with characteristics of debt and equity), certain long-term debt securities and eligible term subordinated debt, in an\namount up to 50% of Tier 1 Capital. The eligibility of these items for inclusion as Tier 2 Capital is subject to certain additional requirements and limitations\nof the federal banking agencies.\nThe Basel III Capital Rules expanded the risk-weighting categories from the previous four Basel I-derived categories (0%, 20%, 50% and 100%) to a much\nlarger and more risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0% for U.S. government and agency\nsecurities, to 600% for certain equity exposures, and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories, including many residential mortgages\nand certain commercial real estate.\nAccordingly, under the fully-phased in Basel III Capital Rules, the capital standards applicable to the Company include an additional capital conservation\nbuffer of 2.5% of CET1, effectively resulting in minimum ratios inclusive of the capital conservation buffer of (1) CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least\n7.0%, (2) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.5%, and (3) Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 10.5%.\nIn August 2020, the FRB, along with the other federal bank regulatory agencies, adopted a final rule that allows the Company and the Bank to phase-in the\nimpact of adopting the Current Expected Credit Losses (or “CECL”) methodology up to two years, with a three-year period to phase out the cumulative\nbenefit to regulatory capital provided during the two-year delay.\nPrompt Corrective Action\nThe Basel III Capital Rules also affected the FDIC’s prompt correction action standards. Those standards seek to address problems associated with\nundercapitalized financial institutions and provide for five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly\nundercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized.\nFor purposes of prompt corrective action, to be:\n• ZHOO\u0003FDSLWDOL]HG, a bank must have a total risk based capital ratio of at least 10%, a Tier 1 risk based capital ratio of at least 8%, a CET1 risk based\ncapital ratio of at least 6.5%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5%;\n DGHTXDWHO\\\u0003FDSLWDOL]HG, a bank must have a total risk based capital ratio of at least 8%, a Tier 1 risk based capital ratio of at least 6%, a CET1 risk\nbased capital ratio of at least 4.5%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 4%;\n• XQGHUFDSLWDOL]HG, a bank would have a total risk based capital ratio of less than 8%, a Tier 1 risk based capital ratio of less than 6%, a CET1 risk\nbased capital ratio of less than 4.5%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 4%;\n VLJQLILFDQWO\\\u0003XQGHUFDSLWDOL]HG, a bank would have a total risk based capital ratio of less than 6%, a Tier 1 risk based capital ratio of less than 4%, a\nCET1 risk based capital ratio of less than 3%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 3%; and\n FULWLFDOO\\\u0003XQGHUFDSLWDOL]HG, a bank would have a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is less than or equal to 2%.\nInstitutions that fall into the latter three categories are subject to restrictions on their growth and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. There is\nalso a method by which an institution may be downgraded to a lower capital category based on supervisory factors other than capital. As of December 31,\n2023, Simmons Bank was “well capitalized” based on the aforementioned ratios.\n13\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (“FDICIA”), enacted in 1991, requires the FDIC to increase assessment rates for insured\nbanks and authorizes one or more “special assessments,” as necessary for the repayment of funds borrowed by the FDIC or any other necessary purpose. As\ndirected in FDICIA, the FDIC has adopted a transitional risk-based assessment system, under which the assessment rate for insured banks will vary\naccording to the level of risk incurred in the bank’s activities. The risk category and risk-based assessment for a bank is determined, in part, from its prompt\ncorrective action, as well capitalized, adequately capitalized or undercapitalized. Please refer to the section below titled )',&\u0003'HSRVLW\u0003,QVXUDQFH\u0003DQG\n$VVHVVPHQWV for more information.\nPursuant to the FDICIA and Federal Deposit Insurance Act (“FDIA”), the federal banking agencies must promptly mandate corrective actions by banks that\nfail to meet the capital and related requirements in order to minimize losses to the FDIC and the Deposit Insurance Fund. As of December 31, 2023, the\nBank was well capitalized under these regulations.\nThe federal banking agencies are also required by FDICIA to prescribe standards for banks and bank holding companies (including financial holding\ncompanies) relating to operations and management, asset quality, earnings, stock valuation and compensation. A bank or bank holding company that fails to\ncomply with such standards will be required to submit a plan designed to achieve compliance. If no plan is submitted or the plan is not implemented, the\nbank or holding company would become subject to additional regulatory action or enforcement proceedings.\nA variety of other provisions included in FDICIA may affect the operations of the Company and the subsidiary bank, including reporting requirements,\nregulatory standards for real estate lending, “truth in savings” provisions, and the requirement that a depository institution give 90 days prior notice to\ncustomers and regulatory authorities before closing any branch.\nDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act\nEnacted in 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”), significantly changed the regulation of financial\ninstitutions and the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act included provisions affecting large and small financial institutions alike, including\nseveral provisions that profoundly affected how community banks, thrifts, and small bank and thrift holding companies are regulated. Among other things,\nthese provisions relaxed rules regarding interstate branching, allow financial institutions to pay interest on business checking accounts, and revised capital\nrequirements on bank and thrift holding companies.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act also established the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (“CFPB”) as an independent entity within the Federal Reserve and\nprovided it with the authority to promulgate consumer protection regulations applicable to all entities offering consumer financial services or products,\nincluding banks. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act included a series of provisions covering mortgage loan origination standards affecting, among other\nthings, originator compensation, minimum repayment standards, and pre-payment penalties. The Dodd-Frank Act contained numerous other provisions\naffecting financial institutions of all types, many of which have an impact on our operating environment, including among other things, our regulatory\ncompliance costs. However, the Dodd-Frank Act does not prevent states from adopting stricter consumer protection standards than those promulgated by\nthe CFPB. State regulation of financial products and potential enforcement actions could also adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition,\nor operations.\nThe EGRRCPA\nIn May 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Reform, and Consumer Protection Act (“EGRRCPA”) was enacted, which, among other things, amended\ncertain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act as well as statutes administered by the FRB and the FDIC. The EGRRCPA provides targeted regulatory relief to\nfinancial institutions while preserving the existing framework under which U.S. financial institutions are regulated. The EGRRCPA relieves bank holding\ncompanies with less than $100 billion in assets, such as the Company, from the enhanced prudential standards imposed under Section 165 of the Dodd-\nFrank Act (including, but not limited to, resolution planning and enhanced liquidity and risk management requirements). Please see the section below titled\n,PSDFWV\u0003RI\u0003*URZWK for more information.\nIn addition to amending the Dodd Frank Act, the EGRRCPA also includes certain additional banking-related provisions, consumer protection provisions\nand securities law-related provisions. Many of the EGRRCPA’s changes were implemented through rules finalized by the federal banking agencies over the\ncourse of 2019. These rules and their enforcement are subject to the substantial regulatory discretion of the federal banking agencies.\n14\nVolcker Rule\nSection 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, commonly known as the “Volcker Rule,” restricts the ability of banking entities from: (i) engaging in “proprietary\ntrading” and (ii) investing in or sponsoring certain covered funds, subject to certain limited exceptions. Under the Volcker Rule, the term “covered funds” is\ndefined as any issuer that would be an investment company under the Investment Company Act but for the exemption in Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of that\nAct. There are also several exemptions from the definition of covered fund, including, among other things, loan securitizations, joint ventures, certain types\nof foreign funds, entities issuing asset-backed commercial paper, and registered investment companies. The EGRRCPA and the subsequently promulgated\ninter-agency agency rules have aimed at simplifying and tailoring certain requirements related to the Volcker Rule.\nBrokered Deposits\nSection 29 of the FDIA and the FDIC regulations promulgated thereunder limit the ability of any bank to accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposit\nunless it is well capitalized or, with the FDIC’s approval, adequately capitalized. However, as a result of the EGRRCPA, the FDIC has undertaken a\ncomprehensive review of its regulatory approach to brokered deposits, including reciprocal deposits, and interest rate caps applicable to banks that are less\nthan well capitalized. In December 2020, the FDIC issued a final rulemaking to modernize its brokered deposit regulations. Among other things, the final\nrule established a new framework for analyzing certain provisions of the “deposit broker” definition and established certain automatic “primary purpose”\nexemptions from the deposit broker definition, as well as revised certain interest rate restrictions that apply to less than well capitalized insured depository\ninstitutions. The final rule became effective April 1, 2021; and full compliance was required by January 1, 2022. Implementation of the final rule did not\nhave a material impact on our subsidiary bank.\nFDIC Deposit Insurance and Assessments\nOur customer deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) up to $250,000 per separately insured\ndepositor. Simmons Bank is required to pay deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF. Because Simmons Bank’s assets exceed $10 billion, its\ndeposit insurance assessment is based on a scoring system that examines the institution’s supervisory ratings and certain financial measures. The scoring\nsystem assesses risk measures to produce two scores, a performance score and a loss severity score, that are combined and converted to an initial\nassessment rate. The FDIC has the ability to make discretionary adjustments to the total score based upon significant risk factors not adequately captured in\nthe calculations.\nAs described above in the section titled 3RWHQWLDO\u0003(QIRUFHPHQW\u0003$FWLRQ\u0003IRU\u0003%DQN\u0003+ROGLQJ\u0003&RPSDQLHV\u0003DQG\u0003%DQNV, the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance\nupon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated\nany applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC.\nIn November 2023, the FDIC issued a final rule to implement a special assessment to recover losses to the DIF incurred as a result of recent bank failures\nand the FDIC’s use of the systemic risk exception to cover certain deposits that were otherwise uninsured. The special assessment was based on estimated\nuninsured deposits as of December 31, 2022 (excluding the first $5.0 billion) and will be assessed at a quarterly rate of 3.36 basis points, over eight\nquarterly assessment periods, beginning in the first quarter of 2024. As a result of this final rule, we accrued $10.5 million related to this assessment in the\nfourth quarter of 2023. This amount represents our current expectation of the full amount of the assessment based on our total uninsured deposits as of\nDecember 31, 2022. Under the final rule, the estimated loss pursuant to the systemic risk determination will be periodically adjusted, and the FDIC has\nretained the ability to cease collection early, extend the special assessment collection period and impose a final shortfall special assessment on a one-time\nbasis. The extent to which any such additional future assessments will impact our future deposit insurance expense is currently uncertain.\nCommunity Reinvestment Act\nThe Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (“CRA”) requires that federal banking agencies evaluate the record of each financial institution in meeting the\ncredit needs of the market areas they serve, including low and moderate-income (“LMI”) individuals and communities. These activities are also considered\nin connection with, among other things, applications for mergers, acquisitions and the opening of a branch or facility, and negative results of these\nevaluations could prevent us from engaging in these types of transactions. Simmons Bank received a “satisfactory” CRA rating during its most recent\nexam.\nIn October 2023, the federal prudential regulatory agencies adopted substantial revisions to the regulations implementing the CRA. The Company\ncontinues to assess the impact of the adopted changes to the CRA regulations.\n15\nUDAP and UDAAP\nFederal laws, including Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, prohibit financial institutions from engaging in unfair or deceptive acts or\npractices (“UDAP”) in or affecting commerce. The Dodd-Frank Act expanded regulation in this space to apply to unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or\npractices (“UDAAP”) and delegated to the CFPB supervision and enforcement authority for UDAAP with respect to our subsidiary bank and rulemaking\nauthority with respect to UDAAP. These laws have been used to, among other things, address certain problematic practices that may not fall directly within\nthe scope of other banking or consumer protection laws.\nFinancial Privacy and Data Security\nThe Company is subject to federal laws, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (“GLBA”), and certain state laws containing consumer privacy\nprotection and data security provisions. These federal and state laws, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, impose restrictions on our\nability to disclose non-public information concerning consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. These laws, rules and regulations also mandate the\ndistribution of privacy policies to consumers, as well as provide consumers an ability to prevent our disclosure of their information under certain\ncircumstances.\nIn addition, the GLBA requires that financial institutions, such as our subsidiary bank, implement comprehensive written information security programs\nthat include administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect consumer information and data. Further, pursuant to interpretive guidance issued\nunder the GLBA and certain state laws, financial institutions are also generally required to notify customers of security breaches that result in unauthorized\naccess to their nonpublic personal information.\nAlthough these laws and regulations impose compliance costs and create obligations and, in some cases, reporting obligations, and compliance with all of\nthe laws, regulations, and reporting obligations may require significant resources of the Company and our subsidiary bank, these laws and regulations do\nnot materially affect our products, services or other business activities.\nAnti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorism\nSimmons Bank is subject to the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of\n2001 (also known as the “PATRIOT Act”), the Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) and rules and regulations of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”).\nUnder Title III of the PATRIOT Act, all financial institutions are required to take certain measures to identify their customers, prevent money laundering,\nmonitor customer transactions, and report suspicious activity to U.S. law enforcement agencies. Financial institutions also are required to respond to\nrequests for information from federal banking agencies and law enforcement agencies. Information sharing among financial institutions for the above\npurposes is encouraged by an exemption granted to complying financial institutions from the privacy provisions of the GLBA and other privacy laws.\nAmong other things, Simmons Bank is required to establish an anti-money laundering (“AML”) program which includes the designation of a BSA officer,\nthe establishment and maintenance of BSA/AML training, the establishment and maintenance of BSA/AML policies and procedures, independent testing\nof the AML program, and compliance with customer due diligence requirements. Our subsidiary bank must also employ enhanced due diligence under\ncertain conditions. Compliance with BSA/AML requirements is routinely examined by regulators, and failure of a financial institution to meet its\nrequirements in combating AML and anti-terrorism activities could result in severe penalties for the institution, including, among other things, the inability\nto receive the requisite regulatory approvals for mergers and acquisition.\nFurther, OFAC administers economic sanctions imposed by the federal government that affect transactions with foreign countries, individuals, and others\n(as the “OFAC Rules”). The OFAC Rules target many countries as well as specially designated nationals and blocked persons (collectively, “SDNs”) and\ntake many different forms. Blocked assets (property and bank deposits) that are associated with such countries and SDNs cannot be paid out, withdrawn,\nset off, or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with the OFAC Rules can result in serious legal and reputational\nconsequences.\n16\nIn December 2020, the U.S. Congress enacted the National Defense Authorization Act (the “NDAA”) that, among other provisions, made significant\nupdates to the federal BSA/AML regulations that aim to eliminate the use of shell companies that facilitate the laundering of criminal proceeds. In\nDecember 2021, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) issued the first of three planned rules, which rule was adopted to implement a\nnational beneficial ownership reporting framework. In December 2023, FinCEN issued the second of the three planned rules, which rule was adopted to\nimplement protocols for access to and disclosure of beneficial ownership information. A subsequent rulemaking is expected to update the customer due\ndiligence requirements that apply to the Company and the Bank to be consistent with this framework. The Company and the Bank continue to monitor\nlegislative, regulatory and supervisory developments related thereto.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Dallas\nSimmons Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas (“FHLB-Dallas”), which is one of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks that\nprovide funding to their members for making housing loans as well as for affordable housing and community development loans. Each FHLB serves as a\nreserve, or central bank, for the members within its assigned region and makes loans to its members in accordance with policies and procedures established\nby the board of directors of that FHLB. As a member, Simmons Bank must purchase and maintain stock in FHLB-Dallas. At December 31, 2023, Simmons\nBank’s total investment in FHLB-Dallas was $58.2 million.\nIncentive Compensation\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal banking agencies and the SEC to establish joint regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentive-based payment\narrangements at specified regulated entities, including the Company and our subsidiary bank, with at least $1 billion in total consolidated assets that\nencourage inappropriate risks by providing an executive officer, employee, director, or principal shareholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits\nthat could lead to material financial loss to the entity. The federal banking agencies and the SEC most recently proposed such regulations in 2016, but the\nregulations have not yet been finalized. However, in late 2022, the SEC finalized a set of rules directing national securities exchanges to establish listing\nstandards regarding clawbacks of incentive-based executive compensation, which listing standards became effective in 2023. Specifically, Nasdaq\nimplemented listing standards that require listed companies to adopt clawback policies, or policies mandating the recovery of excess incentive\ncompensation earned by a current or former executive officer during the three fiscal years preceding the date the listed company is required to prepare an\naccounting restatement, including to correct an error that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left\nuncorrected in the current period. We adopted a compensation recovery policy pursuant to the Nasdaq listing standards and the policy is included as Exhibit\n97 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act also requires publicly traded companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation at least every three years\nand on so-called “golden parachute” payments in connection with approvals of mergers and acquisitions. The Company gives stockholders a non-binding\nvote on executive compensation annually.\nImpacts of Growth\nBecause the Company and Simmons Bank have exceeded $10 billion in assets, each of the Company and the Bank are subject to heightened requirements\n(as compared to smaller community banking organizations) that are imposed by various federal banking law and regulations.\nAmong other things, the Dodd-Frank Act, through the Durbin Amendment, and associated Federal Reserve regulations cap the interchange rate on debit\ncard transactions that can be charged by banks that, together with their affiliates, have at least $10 billion in assets at $0.21 per transaction plus five basis\npoints multiplied by the value of the transaction (plus, for a debit card issuer that meets certain fraud-prevention standards, a “fraud-prevention adjustment”\nof $0.01 per transaction). The cap goes into effect July 1st of the year following the year in which a bank reaches the $10 billion asset threshold. Simmons\nBank became subject to the interchange rate cap effective July 1, 2018. In October 2023, the Federal Reserve proposed lowering the maximum interchange\nfee, and the Company is monitoring developments related to the proposal and continuing to assess its potential impact.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company exceeded $15 billion in total assets, and the grandfather provisions applicable to its trust preferred securities no\nlonger apply, and trust preferred securities are no longer included as Tier 1 capital. Trust preferred securities and qualifying subordinated debt are included\nas total Tier 2 capital.\n17\nThe Dodd-Frank Act also previously required banks and bank holding companies with more than $10 billion in assets to adhere to certain enhanced\nprudential standards, including requirements to conduct annual stress tests, report the results to regulators and publicly disclose such results. However, as a\nresult of regulatory reform finalized following passage of the EGRRCPA, the Company and Simmons Bank are no longer required to conduct an annual\nstress test of capital under the Dodd-Frank Act. Further, as a result of passage of the EGRRCPA, bank holding companies with less than $100 billion in\nassets, such as the Company, are exempt from the resolution planning, enhanced liquidity standards, and risk management requirements imposed under\nSection 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act. In anticipation of becoming subject to these requirements, the Company and Simmons Bank had begun the necessary\npreparations, including undertaking a gap analysis, implementing enhancements to the audit and compliance departments, and investing in various\ninformation technology systems. Notwithstanding that federal banking agencies will not take action with respect to these enhanced prudential standards, the\nCompany and its subsidiary bank will continue to review their capital planning and risk management practices in connection with the regular supervisory\nprocesses of the FRB.\nAdditionally, the Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB and granted it supervisory authority over banks with total assets of more than $10 billion.\nSimmons Bank is subject to CFPB oversight with respect to its compliance with federal consumer financial laws. Simmons Bank continues to be subject to\nthe oversight of its other regulators with respect to matters outside the scope of the CFPB’s jurisdiction. The CFPB has broad rule-making, supervisory,\nexamination and enforcement authority, as well as expanded data collecting and enforcement powers, all of which impact the operations of Simmons Bank.\nFor example, in January 2024, the CFPB proposed rules that would subject (with certain exceptions) overdraft services provided by financial institutions\nwith more than $10 billion in assets to the provisions of the Truth in Lending Act and other consumer financial protection laws. The Company is currently\nevaluating the potential impact of the proposed rules and monitoring developments with respect thereto.\nPending Legislation\nBecause of concerns relating to, among other things, competitiveness and the safety and soundness of the banking industry, Congress and state legislatures\noften consider a number of wide-ranging proposals for altering the structure, regulation, and competitive relationships of the nation’s financial institutions\nand of those chartered in a particular state legislature’s jurisdiction. We cannot predict whether or in what form any proposals will be adopted or the extent\nto which our business may be affected.\nEffect of Governmental Monetary Policies\nThe FRB uses monetary policy tools to impact interest rates, credit market conditions and money market conditions, as well as to influence general\neconomic conditions, including employment, market interest and inflation rates. These policies can have a significant impact on the absolute levels and\ndistribution of deposits, loans and investment securities, as well as on market interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits and other borrowings.\nMonetary policies of the FRB have in the past had a significant effect on the operating results of bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks, such\nas the Company and Simmons Bank, and may have similar effects in the future.\n18\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information contained in this report, including the information contained in “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking\nStatements,” investors in our securities should carefully consider the factors discussed below. An investment in our securities involves risks. The factors\nbelow, among others, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital position, or cause our\nresults to differ materially from our historical results or the results expressed in or implied by our forward-looking statements. Additionally, investors\nshould not interpret the disclosure of a risk to imply that the risk has not already materialized.\nRisks Related to Market Interest Rates and Liquidity\n&KDQJHV\u0003LQ\u0003LQWHUHVW\u0003UDWHV\u0003DQG\u0003PRQHWDU\\\u0003SROLF\\\u0003FRXOG\u0003DGYHUVHO\\\u0003DIIHFW\u0003RXU\u0003SURILWDELOLW\\\u0011\nOur net income and cash flows depend to a significant extent on the difference between interest rates earned on interest-earning assets and the rates paid on\ninterest-bearing liabilities. These rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions and credit and\nmonetary policies of governmental authorities. Changes in the credit or monetary policies of governmental authorities, particularly the Federal Reserve,\ncould significantly impact market interest rates and our financial performance. For instance, changes in the nature of open market transactions in U.S.\ngovernment securities, the discount rate or the federal funds rate on bank borrowings, and reserve requirements against bank deposits, could lead to\nincreases in the costs associated with our business. In addition, such changes could influence the interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount\nof interest we pay on deposits. If the interest rates we pay on deposits increases at a faster rate than the interest we receive on loans and other investments,\nthen our net interest income could be adversely affected.

Financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other\nsystems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data,\ndisable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyber-attacks and other means.

These “denial-of-service” attacks\nhave not breached our data security systems, but require substantial resources to defend, and may affect customer satisfaction and behavior.\nDespite our efforts and those of our third party service providers to ensure the integrity of our systems, it is possible that we may not be able to anticipate or\nto implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not\nrecognized until launched, and because security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including persons who are involved with organized\ncrime or associated with external service providers or who may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments.

It is the FRB’s policy\nthat a bank holding company should stand ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial\nstress or adversity, such as during periods of significant loan losses, and that such holding company should maintain the financial flexibility and capital-\nraising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks if such a need were to arise.\nA bank holding company’s failure to meet its obligations to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks will generally be considered an unsafe and\nunsound banking practice or a violation of the FRB’s regulations, or both.

The CISO oversees our “information security\nteam” within our information technology department, which includes our identity and access management group, our security operations center group, and\nour security engineering and security architecture groups. These groups develop, deploy, monitor, and manage multiple processes, systems, and controls,\nincluding embedded controls within the technology we use, designed to help identify, protect against, detect, respond to, and recover from cybersecurity\nthreats and incidents.\nIn addition to our information security team, we also employ an IT risk and compliance director who has over 18 years of IT governance, risk, and\ncompliance experience and is responsible for the development, monitoring, and reporting of IT-related key risk indicators (“KRIs”), including KRIs related\nto cyber risks. Both our CISO and our IT risk and compliance director report to our chief information officer (“CIO”), who has more than 25 years of\ntechnology leadership experience, including leadership experience at global financial institutions, and is responsible, among other things, for oversight of\nour information technology environment, strategy, and security risks.\nAs part of our information security program, we undertake efforts to monitor new and emerging risks and evaluate the effectiveness and maturity of our\ncyber defenses through various means, including internal audits, targeted testing (including penetration testing), incident response exercises, maturity\nassessments, and industry benchmarking. In connection with these efforts, we use, on an as-needed basis, certain third-parties, including auditors,\nconsultants, and others, that have particular cyber expertise.\n31\nWe also maintain multiple groups that help oversee risks associated with our third-party service providers. These groups include (1) our third-party risk\nmanagement department, which facilitates reviews of certain third parties by our assurance providers, including our information security and business\ncontinuity teams, (2) our vendor council, which reviews contractual terms (including, at times, terms related to confidentiality and data protection) for\ncertain third-party relationships, and (3) our architecture review board, which reviews certain new business initiatives that may impact the Company’s\ntechnical and/or security architecture.\nOur information security program is one component of our broader enterprise risk management program. As such, KRIs related to cyber risk (which are a\nsubset of operational risk KRIs) are reported to, and overseen and monitored by, our enterprise risk management committee, which is comprised of senior\nexecutives of the Company. Additionally, we maintain an incident response framework that details the applicable teams, their functions, and guidelines\nwhen a cybersecurity incident occurs. The framework is designed to cover significant aspects of the incident including detection, containment, remediation,\nand post incident analysis. Various groups of senior executives help oversee responses to security incidents, including the data loss prevention team, the\ncore computer security incident response team, and the extended computer security incident response team.\nWhile we do not believe that our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition have been materially adversely affected by any\ncybersecurity incidents, cybersecurity threats are constant, and, like other financial institutions, we, as well as our customers, employees, and third-party\nservice providers, have experienced a significant increase in information security and cybersecurity risk in recent years and will likely continue to be the\ntarget of cyber-attacks. We continue to assess the risks and changes in the cyber environment, reasonably invest in enhancements to our cybersecurity\ncapabilities, and engage in industry and government forums to promote advancements in our cybersecurity capabilities.

Additionally, the audit committee of the board of directors receives and reviews internal audit reports concerning, among other things,\nmatters related to information security. Furthermore, the board of directors of Simmons Bank, the Company’s primary operating subsidiary, has established\nan information technology committee (“IT Committee”) that receives regular reports from the CISO and CIO concerning our information security program\nand cybersecurity matters. The CIO also reports IT KRIs, including those related to cyber risks, to the IT Committee. Significant security incidents are also\nreported by senior management to the IT Committee or its chairman, when warranted. The IT Committee chairman provides reports of the committee’s\nactivities to the board of directors of Simmons Bank. The Company’s board of directors, or the board of directors of Simmons Bank (as applicable), also\napproves information security-related policies, including the Acceptable Use Policy, Information Security Policy, IT Ransomware Policy, and Business\nContinuity Management Policy.\nWith respect to internal management, the CISO and CIO meet regularly to discuss the activities and operations of the information security team, and the\nCIO holds regular meetings with our chief executive officer to discuss cyber related matters, information technology issues, and cybersecurity threats. To\nenhance awareness, monitoring, and oversight of cybersecurity risks, management also uses the following internal committees (in addition to the enterprise\nrisk management committee discussed above): (1) the IT strategy and investment committee, which is comprised of senior executives and helps provide\noversight of the investment and strategic direction for the Company’s IT function, (2) the IT steering committee, which is comprised of leaders from\nvarious business units and helps provide oversight and direction for inter- and intra-departmental IT related initiatives, and (3) the vulnerability\nmanagement working group, which is comprised of IT leaders and helps establish appropriate roles, responsibilities, and escalation paths to resolve\ndepartment and enterprise vulnerabilities within service level agreements.\n32\nITEM 2.

[RESERVED]\n35\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis presents the more significant factors that affected our financial condition as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 and\nresults of operations for each of the years then ended. Refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”\nincluded in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 27, 2023 (the “2022 Form 10-K”) for a discussion and analysis of the more\nsignificant factors that affected the 2021 period, which are incorporated herein by reference. Certain immaterial reclassifications have been made to make\nprior periods comparable. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, notes thereto and other financial\ninformation appearing elsewhere in this report, as well as the cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements and the risks discussed in Item 1A of\nPart I of this Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOverview\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts\nreported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. While we base estimates on historical experience, current information and other factors\ndeemed to be relevant, actual results could differ from those estimates.\nWe consider accounting estimates to be critical to reported financial results if (i) the accounting estimate requires management to make assumptions about\nmatters that are highly uncertain and (ii) different estimates that management reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period,\nor changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, could have a material impact on our financial statements.\nThe accounting policies that we view as critical to us are those relating to estimates and judgments regarding (a) the determination of the adequacy of the\nallowance for credit losses, (b) acquisition accounting and valuation of loans, (c) the valuation of goodwill and the useful lives applied to intangible assets,\n(d) the valuation of stock-based compensation plans and (e) income taxes.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe allowance for credit losses is a reserve established through a provision for credit losses charged to expense, which represents management’s best\nestimate of lifetime expected losses based on reasonable and supportable forecasts, quantitative factors, and other qualitative considerations. The\nallowance, in the judgment of management, is necessary to reserve for expected credit losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio. Our allowance for\ncredit loss methodology includes reserve factors calculated to estimate current expected credit losses to amortized cost balances over the remaining\ncontractual life of the portfolio, adjusted for prepayments, in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) Topic 326-20, )LQDQFLDO\n,QVWUXPHQWV\u0003\u0010\u0003&UHGLW\u0003/RVVHV. Accordingly, the methodology is based on our reasonable and supportable economic forecasts, historical loss experience, and\nother qualitative adjustments. For further information see the section $OORZDQFH\u0003IRU\u0003&UHGLW\u0003/RVVHV below.\nOur evaluation of the allowance for credit losses is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates. The actual amounts of credit losses realized in the\nnear term could differ from the amounts estimated in arriving at the allowance for credit losses reported in the financial statements.\nIn the first quarter of 2023, we refined the estimation process by improving systems, models, processes, methodology, and assumptions used within the\ncalculation. After multiple parallel runs with the former process, it was determined that the changes did not and are not expected to result in material\ndifferences of results.\n36\nAcquisition Accounting, Loans\nWe account for our acquisitions under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 805, %XVLQHVV\u0003&RPELQDWLRQV, which requires the use of the\nacquisition method of accounting. All identifiable assets acquired, including loans, are recorded at fair value. The fair value for acquired loans at the time\nof acquisition is based on a variety of factors including discounted expected cash flows, adjusted for estimated prepayments and credit losses. In\naccordance with ASC 326, the fair value adjustment is recorded as premium or discount to the unpaid principal balance of each acquired loan. Loans that\nhave been identified as having experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination are purchased credit deteriorated\n(“PCD”) loans. The net premium or discount on PCD loans is adjusted by our allowance for credit losses recorded at the time of acquisition. The remaining\nnet premium or discount is accreted or amortized into interest income over the remaining life of the loan using a constant yield method. The net premium or\ndiscount on loans that are not classified as PCD (“non-PCD”), that includes credit and non-credit components, is accreted or amortized into interest income\nover the remaining life of the loan using a constant yield method. We then record the necessary allowance for credit losses on the non-PCD loans through\nprovision for credit losses expense.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Other intangible assets represent purchased assets\nthat also lack physical substance but can be separately distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights or because the asset is\ncapable of being sold or exchanged either on its own or in combination with a related contract, asset or liability. We perform an annual goodwill\nimpairment test, and more than annually if circumstances warrant, in accordance with ASC Topic 350, ,QWDQJLEOHV\u0003±\u0003*RRGZLOO\u0003DQG\u00032WKHU, as amended by\nASU 2011-08 – THVWLQJ\u0003*RRGZLOO\u0003IRU\u0003,PSDLUPHQW and ASU 2017-04 - ,QWDQJLEOHV\u0003±\u0003*RRGZLOO\u0003DQG\u00032WKHU. ASC Topic 350 requires that goodwill and\nintangible assets that have indefinite lives be reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if certain conditions occur. Our assessment depends on\nseveral assumptions which are dependent on market and economic conditions. Impairment losses on recorded goodwill, if any, will be recorded as\noperating expenses.\nTo quantitatively test goodwill for impairment, a present value of discounted cash flows calculation is completed and relies on several assumptions that\nhave a level of subjectivity and judgement. These assumptions are dependent on market and economic conditions. Key inputs to estimate terminal fair\nvalue of the Company include projected forecasts, noninterest expense savings and a pricing multiple based on a group of peer banks with similar\ncharacteristics. These inputs are discounted by the cost of equity, which includes assumptions involving our beta; equity risk, size and company premiums;\nand the 20-year treasury rate. Assumptions used in calculating the cost of equity are obtained from market and third-party data. Results are compared to\nbook value and no impairment was indicated as of December 31, 2023. Judgement is inherent in assessing goodwill for impairment. The various\nassumptions used in assessing goodwill for impairment involve uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially\nfrom those projected.\nStock-Based Compensation Plans\nWe have adopted various stock-based compensation plans. The plans provide for the grant of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock\nappreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance stock units, and stock awards. Pursuant to the plans, shares are reserved for\nfuture issuance by the Company upon exercise of stock options or awarding of restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance stock units or stock\nawards granted to directors, officers and other key employees.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to the federal income tax laws of the United States, and the tax laws of the states and other jurisdictions where we conduct business. Due to\nthe complexity of these laws, taxpayers and the taxing authorities may subject these laws to different interpretations. Management must make conclusions\nand estimates about the application of these innately intricate laws, related regulations, and case law. When preparing the Company’s income tax returns,\nmanagement attempts to make reasonable interpretations of the tax laws. Taxing authorities have the ability to challenge management’s analysis of the tax\nlaw or any reinterpretation management makes in its ongoing assessment of facts and the developing case law. Management assesses the reasonableness of\nits effective tax rate quarterly based on its current estimate of net income and the applicable taxes expected for the full year. On a quarterly basis,\nmanagement also reviews circumstances and developments in tax law affecting the reasonableness of deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for\ncontingent tax liabilities.\n37\n2023 Overview\nOur net income available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $175.1 million, or $1.38 diluted earnings per share,\ncompared to $256.4 million, or $2.06 diluted earnings per share, for the same period in 2022. Included in 2023 results were $32.7 million of certain items,\nnet of tax, that were primarily related to early retirement program costs, loss on sale of securities, a FDIC special assessment and branch right sizing\ninitiatives. Included in 2022 results were $42.4 million of certain items, net of tax, that were primarily related to our acquisitions, Day 2 accounting\nprovision in connection with acquisitions, gain on an insurance settlement related to a weather event, merger related costs and branch right sizing\ninitiatives. Adjusting for these certain items, adjusted earnings for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $207.7 million, or $1.64 adjusted diluted\nearnings per share, compared to $298.8 million, or $2.40 adjusted diluted earnings per share, in 2022. See *$$3\u00035HFRQFLOLDWLRQ\u0003RI\u00031RQ\u0010*$$3\u0003)LQDQFLDO\n0HDVXUHV for additional discussion and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures.\nThroughout 2023, significant turmoil within the financial services industry, which was fueled by the failure of certain regional banks that utilized\nspecialized business models as well as continued inflationary pressures and recessionary fears, resulted in industry concerns around the level of uninsured,\nnon-collateralized deposits, liquidity, capital and operations. Despite these challenges, which have seemed to abate slightly in the latter half of the year, we\nremain resolute in serving our customers’ financial needs while diligently focusing on maintaining strong asset quality, capital and liquidity positions, and\non strategies to improve our financial performance and maximize the value of our shareholders’ investment in the current rate environment. We believe that\nour liquidity is solid and that our capital is strong:\n• Deposits were relatively stable over the year, which highlights the granularity of our deposit base, as well as the long-term relationships we have\nwith many of our customers. Total deposits as of December 31, 2023 were $22.24 billion, compared to $22.55 billion as of December 31, 2022.\nUninsured deposits (excluding collateralized deposits and intercompany deposits) as of December 31, 2023 were approximately $4.75 billion, or\n21% of total deposits.\n• Capital levels were steady during the year, with all regulatory capital ratios remaining significantly above “well-capitalized” guidelines as of\nDecember 31, 2023 (see Table 18 in the 5LVN\u0003%DVHG\u0003&DSLWDO section below). As of December 31, 2023, our ratio of common equity to total assets\nwas 12.53%, the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets was 7.69% and our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 9.39%.\n• Key credit quality metrics as of December 31, 2023 also remained solid, with our nonperforming loan coverage ratio at 267% and our allowance\nfor credit losses as a percent of total loans ratio was 1.34%.\n• Significant liquidity position with a loan to deposit ratio of 76% as of December 31, 2023, compared to 72% as of December 31, 2022. Additional\nliquidity sources available to us as of December 31, 2023 totaled $11.22 billion and our uninsured, non-collateralized deposit coverage ratio was\n2.4x.\nSimmons Bank was named to )RUEHV magazine’s 2023 list of “World’s Best Banks” for the fourth consecutive year and recognized by )RUEHV¶\u0003as one of\n“America’s Best Midsize Employers” for 2023. We continue to work to expand our suite of digital solutions to provide an enhanced customer experience to\n“bank when you want, where you want.”\nDuring 2023, we completed our Better Bank Initiative, which focused on programs designed to enhance operational processes and increase capacity to\ncapitalize on organic growth opportunities, and achieved success across multiple fronts. We completed our early retirement program and extensive progress\nwas completed on other identified opportunities related to process improvements and streamlining or upgrading systems. As a result, we were able to\nachieve $18 million of annualized cost savings, compared to the original $15 million of annual cost savings we previously estimated.\nAsset quality metrics remain strong and reflect our conservative credit culture, as well as our focus on maintaining disciplined pricing and conservative\nunderwriting standards given the current economic environment. Total nonperforming loans as of December 31, 2023 were $84.5 million, as compared to\n$58.9 million at December 31, 2022. Non-performing assets as a percent of total assets were 0.33%, compared to 0.23% at December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively.\nStockholders’ equity as of December 31, 2023 was $3.43 billion, book value per share was $27.37 and tangible book value per common share was\n$15.92. Our ratio of common stockholders’ equity to total assets was 12.5% and the ratio of tangible common stockholders’ equity to tangible assets was\n7.7% at December 31, 2023. See *$$3\u00035HFRQFLOLDWLRQ\u0003RI\u00031RQ\u0010*$$3\u0003)LQDQFLDO\u00030HDVXUHV for additional discussion and reconciliations of non-GAAP\nmeasures. We repurchased approximately 2.3 million shares of our common stock during 2023.\n38\nTotal loans were $16.85 billion at December 31, 2023, an increase of $703.5 million, or 4.4%, from the same time in 2022. The increase in total loans\nduring the period primarily reflects diverse loan growth driven by increased activity throughout our geographic footprint. Our unfunded commitments\ndecreased to $4.17 billion at December 31, 2023, as compared to $5.64 billion at December 31, 2022. While unfunded commitments are considered a key\nindicator of future loan growth, the rapid increase in interest rates, coupled with softer economic conditions, have resulted in lower activity in our\ncommercial loan pipeline, which was $948.2 million as of December 31, 2023, compared to $1.12 billion at December 31, 2022.\nIn our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation in this Item 7, ³0DQDJHPHQW¶V\u0003'LVFXVVLRQ\u0003DQG\u0003$QDO\\VLV\u0003RI\u0003)LQDQFLDO\n&RQGLWLRQ\u0003DQG\u00035HVXOWV\u0003RI\u00032SHUDWLRQV\u000f´ we provide certain financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with US GAAP. We\nbelieve the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides a meaningful basis for period-to-period and company-to-company comparisons, which\nwe believe will assist investors and analysts in analyzing the core financial measures of the Company and predicting future performance. See the *$$3\n5HFRQFLOLDWLRQ\u0003RI\u00031RQ\u0010*$$3\u00030HDVXUHV section below for additional discussion and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures.\nSimmons First National Corporation is an Arkansas-based financial holding company that, as of December 31, 2023, has approximately $27.35 billion in\nconsolidated assets and, through its subsidiaries, conducts financial operations in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income, our principal source of earnings, is the difference between the interest income generated by earning assets and the total interest cost of\nthe deposits and borrowings obtained to fund those assets. Factors that determine the level of net interest income include the volume of earning assets and\ninterest bearing liabilities, yields earned and rates paid, the level of non-performing loans and the amount of noninterest bearing liabilities supporting\nearning assets. Net interest income is analyzed in the discussion and tables below on a fully taxable equivalent basis. The adjustment to convert certain\nincome to a fully taxable equivalent basis consists of dividing tax-exempt income by one minus the combined federal and state income tax rate of 26.135%.\nThe FRB sets various benchmark interest rates which influence the general market rates of interest, including the deposit and loan rates offered by financial\ninstitutions. Between December 2015 and December 2018, the FRB had been gradually raising benchmark interest rates. The FRB target for the federal\nfunds rate, which is the cost to banks of immediately available overnight funds, increased gradually from 0% - 0.50% in December 2015 to 2.25% - 2.50%\nover a three year period. The federal funds rate was flat until the FRB began to lower the rate in August 2019 and ultimately reduced it to 1.50% - 1.75% in\nOctober 2019. During March 2020, the Federal Open Market Committee (“FOMC”) of the FRB substantially reduced interest rates in response to the\neconomic crisis brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. The federal funds rate was cut to a range of 0% - 0.25%, where it remained throughout 2021 and\ninto early 2022. During March 2022, the FOMC began a series of rate increases in an effort to curb rising inflation. From early 2022 through 2023, the\nfederal funds rate range was increased on eleven occasions and ended 2023 with a range set at 5.25% - 5.50%. To date in 2024, rates have been held steady\nby the FOMC.\nOur loan portfolio is significantly affected by changes in the prime interest rate. The prime interest rate, which is the rate offered on loans to borrowers with\nstrong credit, also increased from 3.25% to 5.50% during the years 2015 through 2018. The prime interest rate remained flat until it began to decrease in\nJuly 2019 and was eventually reduced to 4.75% in October 2019. Similarly to the reduction in the federal funds rate, the prime rate was cut to 3.25% in\nmid-March of 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and remained unchanged throughout 2021 and into early 2022. Paralleling the federal funds\nrate, multiple increases by the Federal Reserve during 2022 and 2023 increased the prime rate to 8.50% as of the end of 2023. Markets anticipate potential\nrate cuts by the Federal Reserve during 2024.\nOur practice is to limit exposure to interest rate movements by maintaining a significant portion of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities in short-\nterm repricing. In the last several years, on average, approximately 41% of our loan portfolio and approximately 89% of our time deposits have repriced in\none year or less. Our current interest rate sensitivity shows that approximately 42% of our loans and 94% of our time deposits will reprice in the next year,\nlargely contributing to our liability-sensitive position at December 31, 2023.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $675.6 million, a decrease of $66.4 million, or 9.0%,\nover the same period in 2022. The decrease in net interest income was primarily the result of a $349.2 million increase in interest income, more than offset\nby a $415.6 million increase in interest expense.\n39\nThe increase in interest income primarily resulted from a $296.5 million increase in interest income on loans, coupled with an increase of $48.0 million in\ninterest income on investment securities. Regarding the increase in interest income on loans during 2023, the increase in loan volume resulted in an\nincrease of $117.6 million in interest income, while a 113 basis point increase in yield due to rising market rates resulted in a $178.9 million increase in\ninterest income during the year ended December 31, 2023. The loan yield for 2023 was 5.96%, compared to 4.83% for 2022. The increase in our loan\nvolume during 2023 was due to the Spirit acquisition in the second quarter of 2022, combined with solid organic loan growth over the comparative period.\nThe increase in interest income on investment securities reflects an increase of $66.0 million due to yield increases over the period of 132 basis points and\n9 basis points for our taxable and non-taxable investment security portfolios, respectively, which were a result of rising market interest rates. The increase\nin interest income on investment securities due to yield increases was mitigated by a $17.9 million decrease due to the decline in our investment portfolio\naverage balances which decreased by $861.5 million or 10.5%, as our portfolio experienced pay downs and maturities over the period, which was\nreinvested into our loan portfolio. Also contributing to the decrease in the average portfolio balance was a targeted sale of $241.1 million of lower-yielding\nAFS securities late in the fourth quarter of 2023, the proceeds of which we used to pay off higher-rate wholesale fundings.\nIncluded in interest income is the additional yield accretion recognized as a result of updated estimates of the cash flows of our loans acquired. Each\nquarter, we estimate the cash flows expected to be collected from the loans acquired, and adjustments may or may not be required. The cash flows estimate\nmay increase or decrease based on payment histories and loss expectations of the loans. The resulting adjustment to interest income is spread on a level-\nyield basis over the remaining expected lives of the loans. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, interest income included $8.8 million,\n$23.9 million and $22.1 million, respectively, for the yield accretion recognized on loans acquired.\nThe $415.6 million increase in interest expense is mostly due to the increase in our deposit account rates over the period, combined with the additional\ndeposit base from the Spirit acquisition and change in deposit mix as the market experiences a shift in consumer sentiment given the attractiveness of\nhigher yielding time deposits in the current higher interest rate environment. Interest expense increased $323.4 million due to the increase in rate of 212\nbasis points on interest-bearing deposit accounts and increased $50.5 million due to the increase in deposit volume over the period. Additionally, interest\nexpense increased $35.3 million due to the increase in rate of 302 basis points on other borrowings. We continually monitor and look for opportunities to\nfairly reprice our deposits while remaining competitive in this current challenging rate environment.\nOur net interest margin on a fully tax equivalent basis was 2.78% for the year ended December 31, 2023, down 39 basis points from 2022. The decrease in\nthe net interest margin was due to the rising deposit rate pressure and change in deposit mix previously discussed, mitigated by the overall increase in our\nearning assets average balances over the comparative periods which has improved interest income in the rising rate environment.\nOver the course of 2024, we anticipate moderating pressure on our margin due to several factors. We saw moderate organic loan growth during 2023, but\nour loan pipeline experienced decreased volume throughout the year. We expect further modest organic loan growth during 2024, subject to\nmacroeconomic uncertainties that may reduce or otherwise impact loan demand, with continued focus on maintaining prudent underwriting standards and\npricing discipline given projects surrounding near term future economic growth. We sold $241.1 million of low yield AFS securities late in the fourth\nquarter of 2023, and used sale proceeds to pay off higher rate wholesale fundings and we will continue to evaluate opportunities to optimize our balance\nsheet based on changing market conditions. Further, we have $1.0 billion of fixed rate callable municipal securities held in the AFS portfolio under swap\nagreements, which involve the payment of fixed interest rates with a weighted average of 1.21% in exchange for variable interest rates based on federal\nfunds rates that began in the third quarter of 2023. Additionally, while our most likely forecast embeds several rate cuts during 2024, there is still much\nuncertainty as to decisions that will be made by the FOMC and the risks present in the economy.\n40\nTables 1 and 2 reflect an analysis of net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively, as well as changes in fully taxable equivalent net interest margin for the years 2023 versus 2022 and 2022 versus 2021.\nTable 1: Analysis of Net Interest Margin\n)7(\u0003 \u0003)XOO\\\u00037D[DEOH\u0003(TXLYDOHQW\u0003XVLQJ\u0003DQ\u0003HIIHFWLYH\u0003WD[\u0003UDWH\u0003RI\u0003\u0015\u0019\u0011\u0014\u0016\u0018\b \u0003\nYears Ended December 31,\n(In thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nInterest income $ 1,210,161 $ 861,735 $ 671,061\nFTE adjustment 25,443 24,671 19,231\nInterest income - FTE 1,235,604 886,406 690,292\nInterest expense 560,035 144,419 79,529\nNet interest income - FTE $ 675,569 $ 741,987 $ 610,763\nYield on earning assets - FTE 5.09 % 3.79 % 3.27 %\nCost of interest bearing liabilities 2.99 % 0.84 % 0.52 %\nNet interest spread - FTE 2.10 % 2.95 % 2.75 %\nNet interest margin - FTE 2.78 % 3.17 % 2.89 %\nTable 2: Changes in Fully Taxable Equivalent Net Interest Margin\n(In thousands) 2023 vs. 2022 2022 vs. 2021\nIncrease due to change in earning assets $ 93,320 $ 147,423\nIncrease due to change in earning asset yields 255,878 48,691\nDecrease due to change in interest bearing liabilities (48,716) (3,274)\nDecrease due to change in interest rates paid on interest bearing liabilities (366,900) (61,616)\n(Decrease) increase in net interest income $ (66,418) $ 131,224\nTable 3 shows, for each major category of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, the average (computed on a daily basis) amount outstanding, the\ninterest earned or expensed on such amount and the average rate earned or expensed for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31,\n2023.

The level\nof provision to the allowance is based on management’s judgment, with consideration given to the composition, maturity and other qualitative\ncharacteristics of the portfolio, assessment of current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts, past due and non-performing loans and\nhistorical net credit loss experience. It is management’s practice to review the allowance on a monthly basis and, after considering the factors previously\nnoted, to determine the level of provision made to the allowance.\nDuring 2023, our provision for credit loss expense was $42.0 million, as compared to an expense of $14.1 million during 2022 and a recapture of $32.7\nmillion during 2021. The provision for credit loss expense during 2023 was impacted by several factors throughout the year, including a $47.4 million\nexpense related to loans and reflected loan growth, as well as the impact of updated economic assumptions, which was partially offset by a $16.3 million\nrelease from the reserve for unfunded commitments primarily due to a decline in unfunded commitments resulting from customers utilizing lines of credit\nduring the year. Additionally, provision expense related to AFS and HTM securities recorded during the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 was\n$9.1 million and $1.8 million, respectively, primarily due to decreases in the value of select corporate bonds in the investment securities portfolio.\n43\nThe provision for credit loss expense during 2022 was impacted by several factors throughout the year, including a $33.8 million Day 2 provision expense\nrequired for loans and unfunded commitments related to the Spirit acquisition, and an expense of $16.0 million related to the overall increase in unfunded\ncommitments during the year, primarily made up of commercial construction loans, which receive a higher reserve allocation than other loans. These\nexpenses were partially offset by a release of $16.0 million, which was driven by a reduction to certain industry specific qualitative factors for the\nrestaurant, hospitality, student housing and office space industries due to the improvement from pandemic related stresses. Further recapture during 2022\nwas driven by the planned exit of several large oil and gas relationships during the year, along with our improved asset credit quality metrics and improved\nMoody’s economic modeling scenarios.\nThe recapture of credit losses during 2021 was driven by improved credit quality metrics, improved macroeconomic factors, and a maturing and amortizing\nloan portfolio. This recapture was partially offset by $22.7 million in provision for credit loss expense for estimated lifetime credit losses for non-purchase\ncredit deteriorated loans acquired through the acquisitions of Landmark and Triumph during the fourth quarter.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income is principally derived from recurring fee income, which includes service charges, wealth management fees and debit and credit card\nfees. Noninterest income also includes income on the sale of mortgage loans, income from the increase in cash surrender values of bank owned life\ninsurance and gains (losses) from sales of securities.\nTotal noninterest income was $155.6 million in 2023, compared to $170.1 million in 2022 and $191.8 million in 2021. Noninterest income for 2023\ndecreased $14.5 million, or 8.5%, from 2022. Included in 2023 results was $20.6 million of a certain item related to the loss on the sale of securities during\nthe period. Included in 2022 results were $4.0 million of certain items, primarily made up of a $4.1 million gain on an insurance settlement related to a\nweather event that caused severe damage to one of our branch locations. Adjusting for these certain items, adjusted noninterest income for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 increased $10.1 million, or 6.1%, from the prior year. See the *$$3 5HFRQFLOLDWLRQ\u0003RI\u00031RQ\u0010*$$3\u00030HDVXUHV section for additional\ndiscussion and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures.\nThe majority of the decrease in noninterest income during 2023 was related to the loss on sale of securities as compared to 2022. During 2023, we sold\napproximately $247.9 million of investment securities resulting in a net loss of $20.6 million, while we realized a net loss of $278,000 related to the call of\nsecurities during 2022. The sale of securities during 2023 was primarily related to a strategic decision to sell low yield securities and use the proceeds to\npay off higher rate wholesale fundings, including both brokered deposits and FHLB advances.\nMortgage lending income decreased $2.8 million during 2023 due to the rising interest rate environment and softening market conditions throughout the\nyear, which continued to slow the demand for mortgage loans. We originated $428.0 million and $751.0 million in mortgage loans during 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively.\nThese decreases in noninterest income during 2023 were partially offset by an increase of $4.0 million in service charges on deposit accounts primarily\nattributable to a full period including the customer base from the Spirit acquisition and additional transactions due to the changes in customer spending\nhabits. Also included in 2023 results is a $4.0 million legal reserve recapture associated with litigation.\n44\nTable 5 shows noninterest income for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, as well as changes in 2023 from 2022 and in 2022\nfrom 2021.\nTable 5: Noninterest Income\n2023 2022\nYears Ended December 31, Change from Change from\n(Dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 2021 2022 2021\nService charges on deposit accounts $ 50,530 $ 46,527 $ 43,231 $ 4,003 8.6 % $ 3,296 7.6 %\nDebit and credit card fees 31,472 31,203 28,245 269 0.9 2,958 10.5\nWealth management fees 30,203 31,895 31,172 (1,692) (5.3) 723 2.3\nMortgage lending income 7,733 10,522 21,798 (2,789) (26.5) (11,276) (51.7)\nBank owned life insurance income 11,717 11,146 8,902 571 5.1 2,244 25.2\nOther service charges and fees 9,122 7,616 7,696 1,506 19.8 (80) (1.0)\nGain (loss) on sale of securities, net (20,609) (278) 15,498 (20,331) * (15,776) *\nGain on sale of branches — — 5,316 — — (5,316) *\nGain on insurance settlement — 4,074 — (4,074) * 4,074 *\nOther income 35,398 27,361 29,957 8,037 29.4 (2,596) (8.7)\nTotal noninterest income $ 155,566 $ 170,066 $ 191,815 $ (14,500) (8.5)% $ (21,749) (11.3)%\n_________________________\n*Not meaningful\nRecurring fee income (total service charges, wealth management fees, debit and credit card fees) for 2023 was $121.3 million, an increase of $4.1 million,\nor 3.5%, when compared to the 2022 amounts. The increase is primarily due to the increased consumer base provided by the Spirit acquisition. We expect\nservice charges to continue to moderate in early 2024 due to the elimination of returned item fees for consumer deposit accounts with insufficient funds\nimplemented during the third quarter of 2023. Overall, we expect flat to modest growth in noninterest income during 2024.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense consists of salaries and employee benefits, occupancy, equipment, foreclosure losses and other expenses necessary for our operations.\nManagement remains committed to controlling the level of noninterest expense through the continued use of expense control measures. We utilize an\nextensive profit planning and reporting system involving all subsidiaries. Based on a needs assessment of the business plan for the upcoming year, monthly\nand annual profit plans are developed, including manpower and capital expenditure budgets. These profit plans are subject to extensive initial reviews and\nmonitored by management monthly. Variances from the plan are reviewed monthly and, when required, management takes corrective action intended to\nensure financial goals are met. We also regularly monitor staffing levels at each subsidiary to ensure productivity and overhead are in line with existing\nworkload requirements.\nNoninterest expense for 2023 was $563.1 million, as compared to noninterest expense for 2022 of $566.7 million, a decrease of $3.7 million, or 0.7%,\ncompared to the prior period. Adjusted noninterest expense, which excludes branch right sizing, merger related costs, FDIC special assessment (for 2023\nonly), donation to Simmons First Foundation (for 2022 only) and early retirement program costs (for 2023 only), for the year ended December 31, 2023\nincreased $396,000, or 0.1%, from the prior year. See the *$$3 5HFRQFLOLDWLRQ\u0003RI\u00031RQ\u0010*$$3\u00030HDVXUHV section for additional discussion and\nreconciliations of non-GAAP measures.\nMerger related costs for 2023 and 2022 were $1.4 million and $22.5 million, respectively, and were primarily related to the Spirit acquisition.\nSalaries and employee benefits expense decreased slightly by $865,000 as compared to 2022, while adjusted salaries and employee benefits expense\ndecreased by $7.1 million as compared to 2022. The decrease in adjusted salaries and employee benefits expense reflects the successful execution of\nprograms as part of our Better Bank Initiative. Early retirement program costs during 2023 were $6.2 million.\n45\nDeposit insurance increased by $18.4 million as compared to 2022. Excluding the FDIC special assessment of $10.5 million levied to support the Deposit\nInsurance Fund following the failure of certain banks in 2023, deposit insurance increased by $7.9 million primarily due to an increased base rate related to\nchanges in the mix of deposits, coupled with the increase in deposits from the Spirit acquisition.\nAmortization of intangibles recorded for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022 was $16.3 million and $15.9 million, respectively. See Note 8,\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our\nintangibles.\nTable 6 below shows noninterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, as well as changes in 2023 from 2022 and\nin 2022 from 2021.\nTable 6: Noninterest Expense\n2023 2022\nYears Ended December 31, Change from Change from\n(Dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 2021 2022 2021\nSalaries and employee benefits $ 279,919 $ 286,982 $ 246,335 $ (7,063) (2.5)% $ 40,647 16.5 %\nEarly retirement program 6,198 — — 6,198 * — —\nOccupancy expense, net 46,741 44,321 38,797 2,420 5.5 5,524 14.2\nFurniture and equipment expense 20,741 20,665 19,890 76 0.4 775 3.9\nOther real estate and foreclosure expense 892 1,003 2,121 (111) (11.1) (1,118) (52.7)\nDeposit insurance 19,465 11,608 6,973 7,857 67.7 4,635 66.5\nFDIC special assessment 10,521 — — 10,521 * — —\nMerger related costs 1,420 22,476 15,911 (21,056) (93.7) 6,565 41.3\nOther operating expenses:\nProfessional services 19,612 19,138 18,921 474 2.5 217 1.2\nPostage 9,458 8,955 8,276 503 5.6 679 8.2\nTelephone 6,965 6,394 6,234 571 8.9 160 2.6\nCredit card expenses 13,243 12,243 11,112 1,000 8.2 1,131 10.2\nMarketing 24,008 28,870 22,234 (4,862) (16.8) 6,636 29.9\nSoftware and technology 42,530 40,906 40,608 1,624 4.0 298 0.7\nOperating supplies 2,591 2,556 2,766 35 1.4 (210) (7.6)\nAmortization of intangibles 16,306 15,915 13,494 391 2.5 2,421 17.9\nBranch right sizing expense 5,467 3,475 (537) 1,992 57.3 4,012 *\nOther expense 36,984 41,241 30,454 (4,257) (10.3) 10,787 35.4\nTotal noninterest expense $ 563,061 $ 566,748 $ 483,589 $ (3,687) (0.7)% $ 83,159 17.2 %\n_________________________\n*Not meaningful\nDue to our Better Bank Initiative and continuous efficiency improvements, we expect marginal growth in noninterest expense during 2024.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes for 2023 was $25.5 million, compared to $50.1 million in 2022 and $61.3 million in 2021. The effective income tax rates\nfor the years ended 2023, 2022 and 2021 were 12.7%, 16.4% and 18.4%, respectively. The decrease in the provision for income taxes during 2023 was\nprimarily due to tax exempt income having a larger favorable impact on the rate and lower state taxes in 2023, both driven by the one time charges to\nincome from the loss on sale of securities and the FDIC special assessment.\n46\nLoan Portfolio\nOur loan portfolio averaged $16.65 billion during 2023 and $14.42 billion during 2022. As of December 31, 2023, total loans were $16.85 billion,\ncompared to $16.14 billion on December 31, 2022, an increase of $703.5 million, or 4.4%. The increase in the overall loan balance during 2023 is\nprimarily due to widespread loan growth throughout our geographic markets during the year. The most significant components of the loan portfolio were\nloans to businesses (commercial loans, commercial real estate loans and agricultural loans) and individuals (consumer loans, credit card loans and single-\nfamily residential real estate loans).\nWe seek to manage our credit risk by diversifying our loan portfolio, determining that borrowers have adequate sources of cash flow for loan repayment\nwithout liquidation of collateral, obtaining and monitoring collateral, providing an appropriate allowance for credit losses and regularly reviewing loans\nthrough the internal loan review process. The loan portfolio is diversified by borrower, purpose, industry and geographic region. We seek to use\ndiversification within the loan portfolio to reduce credit risk, thereby minimizing the adverse impact on the portfolio, if weaknesses develop in either the\neconomy or a particular segment of borrowers. Collateral requirements are based on credit assessments of borrowers and may be used to recover the debt in\ncase of default. We use the allowance for credit losses as a method to value the loan portfolio at its estimated collectible amount. Loans are regularly\nreviewed to facilitate the identification and monitoring of deteriorating credits.\nConsumer loans consist of credit card loans and other consumer loans. Consumer loans were $318.7 million at December 31, 2023, or 1.9% of total loans,\ncompared to $349.8 million, or 2.2% of total loans at December 31, 2022. The decrease in consumer loans was primarily due to loan payoffs and pay\ndowns within the other consumer portfolio during the year. Our credit card portfolio has remained a stable source of lending.\nReal estate loans consist of construction and development (“C&D”) loans, single family residential loans and other commercial real estate (“CRE”) loans.\nReal estate loans were $13.34 billion at December 31, 2023, or 79.2% of total loans, compared to $12.58 billion, or 77.9% of total loans at December 31,\n2022, an increase of $756.9 million, or 6.0%. Our C&D loans increased by $577.6 million, or 22.5%, single family residential loans increased by $95.4\nmillion, or 3.7%, and CRE loans increased by $83.9 million, or 1.1%. The increases were due to diversified organic growth by type and geographic market\nduring the period. We expect to continue to manage our C&D and CRE portfolio concentration by developing deeper relationships with our customers.\nCommercial loans consist of non-real estate loans related to business and agricultural loans. Total commercial loans were $2.72 billion at December 31,\n2023, or 16.2% of total loans, compared to $2.84 billion, or 17.6% of total loans at December 31, 2022, a decrease of $115.0 million, or 4.1%. The decrease\nin non-real estate loans related to business of $142.1 million, or 5.4%, was partially offset by the increase in agricultural loans of $27.1 million, or 13.2%.\nOther loans mainly consists of mortgage warehouse lending and municipal loans. Mortgage volume experienced an increase in demand during 2023 as\ncompared to 2022, and was coupled with continued organic growth in our municipal loans during the period, leading to an increase of $92.8 million in\nother loans.\nWhile loan growth was widespread throughout our geographic markets and was generally broad-based by loan type during the period, loan growth during\nthe latter half of 2023 reflected moderating demand and increased payoff activity, as we focus on maintaining disciplined pricing and conservative\nunderwriting standards given the current uncertain economic environment. Our commercial loan pipeline consisting of all commercial loan opportunities\nwas $948.2 million at December 31, 2023, compared to $1.12 billion at December 31, 2022. The pipeline includes $416.0 million in loans approved and\nready to close at the end of the year.\n47\nThe balances of loans outstanding at the indicated dates are reflected in Table 7, according to type of loan.\nTable 7: Loan Portfolio\nYears Ended December 31,\n(In thousands) 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019\nConsumer:\nCredit cards $ 191,204 $ 196,928 $ 187,052 $ 188,845 $ 204,802\nOther consumer 127,462 152,882 168,318 202,379 249,694\nTotal consumer 318,666 349,810 355,370 391,224 454,496\nReal Estate:\nConstruction and development 3,144,220 2,566,649 1,326,371 1,596,255 2,236,861\nSingle family residential 2,641,556 2,546,115 2,101,975 1,880,673 2,442,064\nOther commercial 7,552,410 7,468,498 5,738,904 5,746,863 6,205,599\nTotal real estate 13,338,186 12,581,262 9,167,250 9,223,791 10,884,524\nCommercial:\nCommercial 2,490,176 2,632,290 1,992,043 2,574,386 2,495,516\nAgricultural 232,710 205,623 168,717 175,905 315,454\nTotal commercial 2,722,886 2,837,913 2,160,760 2,750,291 2,810,970\nOther 465,932 373,139 329,123 535,591 275,714\nTotal loans before allowance for credit losses $ 16,845,670 $ 16,142,124 $ 12,012,503 $ 12,900,897 $ 14,425,704\nTable 8 reflects the remaining maturities and interest rate sensitivity of loans at December 31, 2023.\nTable 8: Maturity and Interest Rate Sensitivity of Loans\nOver 1 year Over 5 years\n1 year through through Over\n(In thousands) or less 5 years 15 years 15 years Total\nConsumer $ 71,581 $ 243,638 $ 2,415 $ 1,032 $ 318,666\nReal estate 2,958,676 8,461,135 1,726,537 191,838 13,338,186\nCommercial 1,407,354 1,218,960 54,770 41,802 2,722,886\nOther 219,745 110,673 122,804 12,710 465,932\nTotal $ 4,657,356 $ 10,034,406 $ 1,906,526 $ 247,382 $ 16,845,670\nPredetermined rate\nConsumer $ 68,027 $ 124,085 $ 2,359 $ 811 $ 195,282\nReal estate 1,332,508 5,107,185 904,390 112,158 7,456,241\nCommercial 490,569 798,540 46,874 41,797 1,377,780\nOther 52,134 109,097 120,436 12,317 293,984\nTotal $ 1,943,238 $ 6,138,907 $ 1,074,059 $ 167,083 $ 9,323,287\nFloating rate\nConsumer $ 3,554 $ 119,553 $ 56 $ 221 $ 123,384\nReal estate 1,626,168 3,353,950 822,147 79,680 5,881,945\nCommercial 916,785 420,420 7,896 5 1,345,106\nOther 167,611 1,576 2,368 393 171,948\nTotal $ 2,714,118 $ 3,895,499 $ 832,467 $ 80,299 $ 7,522,383\n48\nAsset Quality\nNon-performing loans are comprised of (a) nonaccrual loans, (b) loans that are contractually past due 90 days and (c) other loans for which terms have been\nrestructured to provide a reduction or deferral of interest or principal, because of deterioration in the financial position of the borrower. Simmons Bank\nrecognizes income principally on the accrual basis of accounting. When loans are classified as nonaccrual, generally, the accrued interest is charged off and\nno further interest is accrued. Loans, excluding credit card loans, are placed on a nonaccrual basis either: (1) when there are serious doubts regarding the\ncollectibility of principal or interest, or (2) when payment of interest or principal is 90 days or more past due and either (i) not fully secured or (ii) not in the\nprocess of collection. If a loan is determined by management to be uncollectible, the portion of the loan determined to be uncollectible is then charged to\nthe allowance for credit losses.\nWhen credit card loans reach 90 days past due and there are attachable assets, the accounts are considered for litigation. Credit card loans are generally\ncharged off when payment of interest or principal exceeds 150 days past due. The credit card recovery group pursues account holders until it is determined,\non a case-by-case basis, to be uncollectible.\nTotal non-performing assets increased $27.8 million from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023. Nonaccrual loans increased by $24.9 million during\n2023, in addition to an increase in foreclosed assets held for sale of $1.2 million. The increase in nonaccrual assets was primarily due to an increase in\nnonaccrual loans within our commercial loan portfolio.\nNon-performing assets, including modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty (“FDMs”, formerly known as troubled debt restructurings, or\nTDRs) and acquired foreclosed assets, as a percent of total assets were 0.45% at December 31, 2023 compared to 0.23% at December 31, 2022.\nTotal non-performing assets decreased by $13.8 million from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022. Nonaccrual loans decreased by $9.8 million\nduring 2022, in addition to a decrease in foreclosed assets held for sale of $3.1 million. The decrease in nonaccrual loans was primarily due to an overall\nimprovement in economic conditions from pandemic related stresses.\nTotal non-performing assets decreased by $67.6 million from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021. Nonaccrual loans decreased by $54.7 million\nduring 2021, in addition to a decrease in foreclosed assets held for sale of $12.4 million. The decrease in nonaccrual loans was primarily due to an overall\nimprovement in economic conditions while the decrease in foreclosed assets held for sale and other real estate owned is primarily the result of the\ndisposition of one commercial building in the St. Louis area and the disposition of one piece of commercial land with net book values at the time of sale of\n$6.5 million and $2.8 million, respectively.\nTotal non-performing assets increased by $28.6 million from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020. Nonaccrual loans increased by $29.5 million\nduring 2020, partially offset by a decrease in foreclosed assets held for sale of $728,000. The increase in nonaccrual loans during 2020 is primarily related\nto one energy loan totaling $22.0 million which moved to nonaccrual during the fourth quarter of 2020. The remaining increase was related to various other\nCRE loans and commercial loan relationships.\nFrom time to time, certain borrowers experience declines in income and cash flow. As a result, these borrowers seek to reduce contractual cash outlays, the\nmost prominent being debt payments. In an effort to preserve our net interest margin and earning assets, we are open to working with existing customers in\norder to maximize the collectibility of the debt.\nWe have internal loan modification programs for borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. Modifications to borrowers experiencing financial\ndifficulties may include interest rate reductions, principal or interest forgiveness and/or term extensions. We primarily use interest rate reduction and/or\npayment modifications or extensions, with an occasional forgiveness of principal.\nThe financial effects of the modified loans made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty in the single family residential real estate and commercial\nportfolio were not significant during the year ended December 31, 2023 and did not significantly impact our determination of the allowance for credit\nlosses on loans during the year.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we modified one loan related to the other CRE portfolio, whereby the borrower was experiencing financial\ndifficulty at the time of modification. The modification allowed for two months of interest only payments with the remaining balance due at maturity. Upon\nmodification, a charge-off of $9.6 million was recorded in relation to this modified loan during 2023. As a result of the other CRE loan modified during the\nyear ended December 31, 2023 being collateral-dependent, the impact to our allowance for credit losses on loans was the difference between the fair value\nof the underlying collateral, adjusted for selling costs, and the remaining outstanding principal balance of the loan.\n49\nWe continue to maintain good asset quality, compared to the industry, and strong asset quality remains a primary focus for us. The allowance for credit\nlosses as a percent of total loans was 1.34% as of December 31, 2023. Non-performing loans equaled 0.50% of total loans. Non-performing assets were\n0.33% of total assets, a 10 basis point increase from December 31, 2022. The allowance for credit losses was 267% of non-performing loans. Our\nannualized net charge-offs to total loans for 2023 was 0.12%. Excluding credit cards, the annualized net charge-offs to total loans for the same period was\n0.09%. Annualized net credit card charge-offs to average total credit card loans were 2.20%, compared to 1.49% during 2022, and 129 basis points better\nthan the most recently published industry average charge-off ratio as reported by the Federal Reserve for all banks.\nWe do not own any securities backed by subprime mortgage assets, and offer no mortgage loan products that target subprime borrowers.\nTable 9 presents information concerning non-performing assets, including nonaccrual loans at amortized cost and foreclosed assets held for sale.\nTable 9: Non-performing Assets\nYears Ended December 31,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019\nNonaccrual loans (1) $ 83,325 $ 58,434 $ 68,204 $ 122,879 $ 93,330\nLoans past due 90 days or more (principal or interest payments) 1,147 507 349 578 856\nTotal non-performing loans 84,472 58,941 68,553 123,457 94,186\nOther non-performing assets:\nForeclosed assets held for sale and other real estate owned 4,073 2,887 6,032 18,393 19,121\nOther non-performing assets 1,726 644 1,667 2,016 1,964\nTotal other non-performing assets 5,799 3,531 7,699 20,409 21,085\nTotal non-performing assets $ 90,271 $ 62,472 $ 76,252 $ 143,866 $ 115,271\nPerforming FDMs (formerly TDRs) $33,577 $1,849 $4,289 $3,138 $5,887\nAllowance for credit losses to non-performing loans 267 % 334 % 300 % 193 % 72 %\nNon-performing loans to total loans 0.50 % 0.37 % 0.57 % 0.96 % 0.65 %\nNon-performing assets (including performing FDMs (formerly\nTDRs)) to total assets 0.45 % 0.23 % 0.33 % 0.66 % 0.57 %\nNon-performing assets to total assets 0.33 % 0.23 % 0.31 % 0.64 % 0.54 %\n_________________________\n(1) Includes nonaccrual FDMs (formerly known as TDRs) of approximately $282,000, $1.6 million, $2.7 million, $4.4 million and $1.6 million at\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThere was no interest income on nonaccrual loans recorded for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe allowance for credit losses is a reserve established through a provision for credit losses charged to expense which represents management’s best\nestimate of lifetime expected losses based on reasonable and supportable forecasts, quantitative factors, and other qualitative considerations.\nLoans with similar risk characteristics such as loan type, collateral type, and internal risk ratings are aggregated for collective assessment. We use\nstatistically-based models that leverage assumptions about current and future economic conditions throughout the contractual life of the loan. Expected\ncredit losses are estimated by either lifetime loss rates or expected loss cash flows based on three key parameters: probability-of-default (“PD”), exposure-\nat-default (“EAD”), and loss-given-default (“LGD”). Future economic conditions are incorporated to the extent that they are reasonable and supportable.\nBeyond the reasonable and supportable periods, the economic variables revert to a historical equilibrium at a pace dependent on the state of the economy\nreflected within the economic scenarios. We also include qualitative adjustments to the allowance based on factors and considerations that have not\notherwise been fully accounted for.\n50\nLoans that have unique risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. These evaluations are typically performed on loans with a deteriorated\ninternal risk rating. For a collateral-dependent loan, our evaluation process includes a valuation by appraisal or other collateral analysis adjusted for selling\ncosts, when appropriate. This valuation is compared to the remaining outstanding principal balance of the loan. If a loss is determined to be probable, the\nloss is included in the allowance for credit losses as a specific allocation.\nAdditional information related to net charge-offs is shown in Table 10.\nTable 10: Ratio of Net Charge-offs to Average Loans\nRatio of Net Charge-offs\n(Dollars in thousands) Net Charge-offs Average Loans to Average Loans\n2023\nCredit cards $ (4,295) $ 195,545 (2.20)%\nOther consumer (984) 136,865 (0.72)%\nReal estate (9,999) 13,050,414 (0.08)%\nCommercial (3,870) 2,815,006 (0.14)%\nOther — 449,740 — %\nTotal $ (19,148) $ 16,647,570 (0.12)%\n2022\nCredit cards $ (2,838) $ 190,119 (1.49)%\nOther consumer (679) 177,420 (0.38)%\nReal estate 2,794 11,157,499 0.03 %\nCommercial (11,897) 2,557,060 (0.47)%\nOther — 337,665 — %\nTotal $ (12,620) $ 14,419,763 (0.09)%\nAllowance for Credit Losses Allocation\nAs of December 31, 2023, the allowance for credit losses reflected an increase of approximately $28.3 million from December 31, 2022, while loans\nincreased $703.5 million over the same period. The allocation in each category within the allowance generally reflects the overall changes in the loan\nportfolio mix.\nThe increase in the allowance for credit losses during 2023 was predominantly due to the loan growth experienced during the year, as well as refreshed\neconomic forecasts. Our allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2023 was considered appropriate given the current economic environment and other\nrelated factors.\n51\nThe following table sets forth the sum of the amounts of the allowance for credit losses attributable to individual loans within each category, or loan\ncategories in general. The table also reflects the percentage of loans in each category to the total loan portfolio for each of the periods indicated. The\nallowance for credit losses by loan category is determined by i) our estimated reserve factors by category including applicable qualitative adjustments and\nii) any specific allowance allocations that are identified on individually evaluated loans. The amounts shown are not necessarily indicative of the actual\nfuture losses that may occur within individual categories.\nTable 11: Allocation of Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nAllowance % of loans Allowance % of loans Allowance % of loans\n(Dollars in thousands) Amount (1) Amount (1) Amount (1)\nCredit cards $ 5,868 1.1% $ 5,140 1.2% $ 3,987 1.6%\nOther consumer 5,716 3.5% 6,614 3.2% 4,617 4.1%\nReal estate 177,177 79.2% 150,795 78.0% 179,270 76.3%\nCommercial 36,470 16.2% 34,406 17.6% 17,458 18.0%\nTotal $ 225,231 100.0% $ 196,955 100.0% $ 205,332 100.0%\nAllowance for credit losses to period-end loans 1.34 % 1.22 % 1.71 %\n_________________________\n(1) Percentage of loans in each category to total loans.\nInvestments and Securities\nOur securities portfolio is the second largest component of earning assets and provides a significant source of revenue. Securities within the portfolio are\nclassified as either held-to-maturity (“HTM”) or available-for-sale (“AFS”).\nHTM securities, which include any security for which we have the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity, are carried at historical cost adjusted for\namortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. Premiums and discounts are amortized and accreted, respectively, to interest income using the\nconstant effective yield method over the security’s estimated life. Prepayments are anticipated for mortgage-backed and SBA securities. Premiums on\ncallable securities are amortized to their earliest call date.\nAFS securities, which include any security for which we have no immediate plan to sell but which may be sold in the future, are carried at fair\nvalue. Realized gains and losses, based on specifically identified amortized cost of the individual security, are included in other income. Unrealized gains\nand losses are recorded, net of related income tax effects, in stockholders’ equity. Premiums and discounts are amortized and accreted, respectively, to\ninterest income using the constant effective yield method over the estimated life of the security. Prepayments are anticipated for mortgage-backed and SBA\nsecurities. Premiums on callable securities are amortized to their earliest call date.\nOur philosophy regarding investments is conservative based on investment type and maturity. Investments in the portfolio primarily include U.S. Treasury\nsecurities, U.S. Government agencies, mortgage-backed securities and municipal securities. Our general policy is not to invest in derivative type\ninvestments or high-risk securities, except for collateralized mortgage-backed securities for which collection of principal and interest is not subordinated to\nsignificant superior rights held by others.\nHTM and AFS investment securities were $3.73 billion and $3.15 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2023, compared to the HTM amount of $3.76\nbillion and AFS amount of $3.85 billion at December 31, 2022. We will continue to look for opportunities to maximize the value of the investment\nportfolio.\nAs of December 31, 2023, $527.9 million, or 7.7%, of our total portfolio was invested in obligations of U.S. government agencies and U.S. Treasury\nsecurities. Our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2023 also included $2.65 billion, or 38.5%, of tax-exempt obligations of state and political\nsubdivisions. A portion of the state and political subdivision debt obligations are rated bonds, primarily issued in states in which we are located, and are\nevaluated on an ongoing basis. There are no securities of any one state or political subdivision issuer exceeding ten percent of our stockholders’ equity at\nDecember 31, 2023.\n52\nWe had approximately $3.10 billion, or 45.1%, of our total portfolio invested in mortgaged-backed securities at December 31, 2023. These mortgage-\nbacked securities were issued by agencies of the U.S. government.\nDuring the quarters ended June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, we transferred, at fair value, $1.99 billion and $500.8 million, respectively, of securities\nfrom the AFS portfolio to the HTM portfolio. As of December 31, 2023, the related remaining combined net unrealized losses of $126.4 million in\naccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) will be amortized over the remaining life of the securities. No gains or losses on these securities were\nrecognized at the time of transfer.\nAdditionally, during the third quarter of 2021, we began utilizing interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges to mitigate the effect of changing\ninterest rates on the fair values of $1.0 billion of fixed rate callable municipal securities held in the AFS portfolio. These swap agreements consist of a two\nyear forward start date and involve the payment of fixed interest rates with a weighted average of 1.21% in exchange for variable interest rates based on\nfederal funds rates, which became effective during the late third quarter of 2023. Securities within these swap agreements have maturity dates varying\nbetween 2028 and 2029. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the net amount included in interest income on investment securities in the consolidated\nstatements of income related to these swap agreements was $11.9 million.\nThe adoption of ASU 2016-13 at the beginning of 2020 required us to replace the existing impairment models for financial assets, which includes\ninvestment securities. Under this model, an estimate of expected credit losses that represents all contractual cash flows that is deemed uncollectible over the\ncontractual life of the financial asset must be recorded. During 2023, we recorded $9.1 million of provision for credit losses related to AFS securities due to\nisolated corporate bonds within the portfolio. We charged-off $7.0 million directly related to one corporate bond, which was deemed uncollectible in the\nperiod, while the remaining isolated bonds were sold or experienced price recovery on previous impairments prior to the end of the period. Based upon our\nanalysis of the underlying risk characteristics of the AFS portfolio, including credit ratings and other qualitative factors, no allowance for credit losses\nrelated to AFS securities was deemed necessary at December 31, 2023 and 2022. Our allowance for credit losses related to HTM securities was $3.2\nmillion and $1.4 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAn allowance for credit losses related to mortgage-backed securities and U.S. government agencies was not recorded as of December 31, 2023 due to those\nsecurities being explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government, are highly rated by major rating agencies and have a long history of no credit\nlosses. See Note 3, Investment Securities, in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our\nallowance for credit losses on investment securities held.\nWe had no gross realized gains and $20.6 million of gross realized losses from the sale of securities during the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to\n$46,000 of gross realized gains and $324,000 of gross realized losses from the call of securities during the year ended December 31, 2022. We sold\napproximately $247.9 million of investment securities during 2023, while no securities were sold during 2022. Securities sold during 2023 were in large\npart related to a strategic decision to sell low yield securities and use the proceeds to pay off higher rate wholesale fundings, including both brokered\ndeposits and FHLB advances.\nWe have the ability and intent to hold the securities classified as HTM until they mature, at which time we expect to receive full value for the securities.\nThe contractual terms of those investments do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than the amortized cost bases of the investments.\nWe expect the cash flows from principal maturities of securities to provide flexibility to fund future loan growth or reduce wholesale funding. Furthermore,\nas of December 31, 2023, we also have the ability to hold the securities classified as AFS for a period of time sufficient for a recovery of amortized cost,\nwe do not have an immediate intent to sell the securities classified as AFS, and we believe the accounting standard of “more likely than not” has not been\nmet regarding whether we would be required to sell any of the AFS securities before recovery of amortized cost. During 2024, we will continue to evaluate\ntargeted sales of AFS securities based on prevailing market conditions and our funding and liquidity positions. The unrealized losses during 2023 are\nlargely due to increases in market interest rates over the yields available at the time the underlying securities were purchased. The fair value is expected to\nrecover as the bonds approach their maturity date or repricing date or if market yields for such investments decline. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2023,\nwe believe the declines in fair value detailed in the table below are temporary and we do not believe any of the securities are impaired due to reasons of\ncredit quality.\n53\nTable 12 presents the amortized cost, fair value and allowance for credit losses on investment securities for each of the years indicated.\nTable 12: Investment Securities\nAllowance Gross Gross\nfor Credit Net Carrying Unrealized Unrealized Estimated Fair\n(In thousands) Amortized Cost Losses Amount Gains (Losses) Value\nHeld-to-maturity\nDecember 31, 2023\nU.S. Government agencies $ 453,121 $ — $ 453,121 $ — $ (89,203) $ 363,918\nMortgage-backed securities 1,161,694 — 1,161,694 354 (107,834) 1,054,214\nState and political subdivisions 1,858,680 (2,006) 1,856,674 284 (369,509) 1,487,449\nOther securities 256,007 (1,208) 254,799 — (25,010) 229,789\nTotal HTM $ 3,729,502 $ (3,214) $ 3,726,288 $ 638 $ (591,556) $ 3,135,370\nDecember 31, 2022\nU.S. Government agencies $ 448,012 $ — $ 448,012 $ — $ (102,558) $ 345,454\nMortgage-backed securities 1,190,781 — 1,190,781 227 (118,960) 1,072,048\nState and political subdivisions 1,861,102 (110) 1,860,992 56 (446,198) 1,414,850\nOther securities 261,199 (1,278) 259,921 — (29,040) 230,881\nTotal HTM $ 3,761,094 $ (1,388) $ 3,759,706 $ 283 $ (696,756) $ 3,063,233\nAmortized Allowance for Gross Unrealized Gross Unrealized Estimated Fair\n(In thousands) Cost Credit Losses Gains (Losses) Value\nAvailable-for-sale\nDecember 31, 2023\nU.S. Treasury $ 2,285 $ — $ — $ (31) $ 2,254\nU.S. Government agencies 74,460 — 35 (1,993) 72,502\nMortgage-backed securities 2,138,652 — 8 (198,353) 1,940,307\nState and political subdivisions 1,035,147 — 187 (132,541) 902,793\nOther securities 259,165 — — (24,868) 234,297\nTotal AFS $ 3,509,709 $ — $ 230 $ (357,786) $ 3,152,153\nDecember 31, 2022\nU.S. Treasury $ 2,257 $ — $ — $ (60) $ 2,197\nU.S. Government agencies 191,498 — 103 (7,322) 184,279\nMortgage-backed securities 2,809,319 — 20 (266,437) 2,542,902\nState and political subdivisions 1,056,124 — 250 (185,300) 871,074\nOther securities 272,215 — — (19,813) 252,402\nTotal AFS $ 4,331,413 $ — $ 373 $ (478,932) $ 3,852,854\n54\nTable 13 reflects the amortized cost and estimated fair value of securities at December 31, 2023, by contractual maturity and the weighted average yields\n(for tax-exempt obligations on a fully taxable equivalent basis, assuming a 26.135% tax rate) of such securities.

We offer a variety of products designed to attract and retain customers with a continuing focus on developing core deposits. Our core deposits consist\nof all deposits excluding time deposits of $250,000 or more and brokered deposits. As of December 31, 2023, core deposits comprised 79.2% of our total\ndeposits.\nWe continually monitor the funding requirements along with competitive interest rates in the markets we serve. Because of our community banking\nphilosophy, our executives in the local markets, with oversight by the Chief Deposit Officer, Asset Liability Committee and the Bank’s Treasury\nDepartment, establish the interest rates offered on both core and non-core deposits. This approach ensures that the interest rates being paid are\ncompetitively priced for each particular deposit product and structured to meet the funding requirements. We believe we are paying a competitive rate when\ncompared with pricing in those markets.\n55\nWe manage our interest expense through deposit pricing. We believe that additional funds can be attracted and deposit growth can be accelerated through\ndeposit pricing if we experience increased loan demand or other liquidity needs. We can also utilize brokered deposits as an additional source of funding to\nmeet liquidity needs. We are continually monitoring and looking for opportunities to fairly reprice our deposits while remaining competitive in this current\nchallenging rate environment.\nOur total deposits as of December 31, 2023, were $22.24 billion, a decrease of $303.1 million from December 31, 2022. Noninterest bearing transaction\naccounts, interest bearing transaction accounts and savings accounts totaled $15.80 billion at December 31, 2023, compared to $17.78 billion at\nDecember 31, 2022, a decrease of $1.98 billion. Total time deposits increased $1.68 billion to $6.45 billion at December 31, 2023, from $4.77 billion at\nDecember 31, 2022. We had $2.90 billion and $2.75 billion of brokered deposits at December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively. Our\nuninsured deposits as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $4.75 billion and $5.63 billion, respectively.\nThe change in the mix of deposits at December 31, 2023 as compared to December 31, 2022 reflects increased market competition and consumer migration\ntoward higher rate deposits, principally certificates of deposit, given the rapid increase in interest rates that has occurred over the past year. We are\ncontinuing to refine our product offerings to give customers flexibility of choice while maintaining the ability to adjust interest rates timely in the current\nrate environment.\nTable 14 reflects the classification of the average deposits and the average rate paid on each deposit category which is in excess of 10 percent of average\ntotal deposits for the three years ended December 31, 2023.\nTable 14: Average Deposit Balances and Rates\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nAverage Average Rate Average Average Rate Average Average Rate\n(In thousands) Amount Paid Amount Paid Amount Paid\nNoninterest bearing transaction accounts $ 5,201,384 — % $ 5,827,160 — % $ 4,836,839 — %\nInterest bearing transaction and savings deposits 11,033,263 2.17 % 12,253,164 0.51 % 10,638,665 0.18 %\nTime deposits 6,038,640 3.87 % 3,094,747 1.16 % 2,804,851 0.77 %\nTotal $ 22,273,287 2.12 % $ 21,175,071 0.47 % $ 18,280,355 0.23 %\nOur maturities of time deposits not covered by deposit insurance at December 31, 2023 are presented in Table 15.\nTable 15: Maturities of Time Deposits Not Covered by Deposit Insurance\nDecember 31, 2023\n(In thousands) Balance Percent\nMaturing\nThree months or less $ 678,976 61.5 %\nOver 3 months to 6 months 183,868 16.7 %\nOver 6 months to 12 months 189,657 17.2 %\nOver 12 months 50,622 4.6 %\nTotal $ 1,103,123 100.0 %\n56\nFederal Funds Purchased and Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase\nFederal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase were $68.0 million at December 31, 2023, as compared to $160.4 million at\nDecember 31, 2022.\nWe have historically funded our growth in earning assets through the use of core deposits, large certificates of deposits from local markets, brokered\ndeposits, FHLB borrowings and Federal funds purchased. Management anticipates that these sources will provide necessary funding in the foreseeable\nfuture.\nOther Borrowings and Subordinated Debentures\nOur total debt was $1.34 billion and $1.23 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The outstanding balance for December 31, 2023 includes\n$953.2 million in FHLB advances; $366.1 million in subordinated notes and unamortized debt issuance costs; and $19.1 million of other long-term debt.\nFHLB advances outstanding at December 31, 2023, which increased as compared to December 31, 2022 due to a strategic decision to utilize short-term\nborrowings to elevate our liquidity position given the macroeconomic environment during the year, are primarily fixed rate, fixed term advances, which are\ndue less than one year from origination and therefore are classified as short-term advances.\nA summary of information related to our FHLB short-term advances, consisting of fixed rate, fixed term advances, is presented in Table 16.\nTable 16: Short-Term Borrowings\nDecember 31,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nAmount outstanding at year-end $ 950,000 $ 835,000 $ —\nWeighted-average interest rate at year-end 5.40 % 4.20 % — %\nMaximum amount outstanding at any month-end during the year $ 1,350,000 $ 1,300,000 $ —\nAverage amount outstanding during the year $ 1,149,387 $ 1,124,314 $ —\nWeighted-average interest rate for the year 5.20 % 2.08 % — %\nDuring the third quarter of 2022, we redeemed the five issuances of trust preferred securities which had an outstanding aggregate principal amount of\n$56.2 million. We recorded a loss of $365,000 related to the early retirement of debt, which represented the unamortized purchase discounts associated with\nthe previously acquired trust preferred securities.\nIn March 2018, we issued $330.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.00% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes (“Notes”) at a public offering\nprice equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes. We incurred $3.6 million in debt issuance costs related to the offering. The Notes will\nmature on April 1, 2028 and are subordinated in right of payment to the payment of our other existing and future senior indebtedness, including all our\ngeneral creditors. The Notes are obligations of the Company only and are not obligations of, and are not guaranteed by, any of its subsidiaries.\nWe assumed Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes in an aggregate principal amount, net of premium adjustments, of $37.4 million in connection with\nthe Spirit acquisition in April 2022 (the “Spirit Notes”). The Spirit Notes will mature on July 31, 2030, and initially bear interest at a fixed annual rate of\n6.00%, payable quarterly, in arrears, to, but excluding, July 31, 2025. From and including July 31, 2025, to, but excluding, the maturity date or earlier\nredemption date, the interest rate will reset quarterly to an interest rate per annum equal to a benchmark rate, which is expected to be the then-current three-\nmonth Secured Overnight Financing Rate, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (provided, that in the event the benchmark rate is less\nthan zero, the benchmark rate will be deemed to be zero) plus 592 basis points, payable quarterly, in arrears.\n57\nAggregate annual maturities of long-term debt at December 31, 2023 are presented in Table 17.\nTable 17: Maturities of Long-Term Debt\nAnnual Maturities\nYear (In thousands)\n2024 $ 1,822\n2025 1,822\n2026 1,824\n2027 1,920\n2028 332,210\nThereafter 48,909\nTotal $ 388,507\nCapital\nOverview\nAt December 31, 2023, total capital was $3.43 billion. Capital represents shareholder ownership in the Company – the book value of assets in excess of\nliabilities. At December 31, 2023, our common equity to asset ratio was 12.53% compared to 11.91% at year-end 2022.\nCapital Stock\nOn February 27, 2009, at a special meeting, our shareholders approved an amendment to the Articles of Incorporation to establish 40,040,000 authorized\nshares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value. On April 27, 2022, our shareholders approved an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation to remove an $80.0\nmillion cap on the aggregate liquidation preference associated with the preferred stock and increase the number of authorized shares of our Class A\ncommon stock from 175,000,000 to 350,000,000.\nOn October 29, 2019, we filed Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (“October Amended Articles”) with the Arkansas Secretary of State. The\nOctober Amended Articles classified and designated Series D Preferred Stock, Par Value $0.01 Per Share (“Series D Preferred Stock”), out of our\nauthorized preferred stock. On November 30, 2021, we redeemed all of the Series D Preferred Stock, including accrued and unpaid dividends. On April 27,\n2022, our shareholders approved an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation to remove the classification and designation for the Series D Preferred\nStock. As of December 31, 2023, there were no shares of preferred stock issued or outstanding.\nOn March 31, 2021, we filed a shelf registration with the SEC. The shelf registration statement provides increased flexibility and more efficient access to\nraise capital from time to time through the sale of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, depository shares, warrants, purchase contracts, purchase\nunits, subscription rights, units or a combination thereof, subject to market conditions. Specific terms and prices are determined at the time of any offering\nunder a separate prospectus supplement that we are required to file with the SEC at the time of the specific offering.\nStock Repurchase Program\nOn October 22, 2019, we announced a stock repurchase program (the “2019 Program”) under which we could repurchase up to $60.0 million of our Class\nA Common Stock currently issued and outstanding. On March 5, 2020, we announced an amendment to the 2019 Program that increased the maximum\namount that could be repurchased under the 2019 Program from $60.0 million to $180.0 million. Effective July 23, 2021, our Board of Directors approved\nanother amendment to the 2019 Program that increased the amount of our Class A common stock that may be repurchased from a maximum of\n$180.0 million to a maximum of $276.5 million and extended the term of the 2019 Program from October 31, 2021, to October 31, 2022.\nDuring January 2022, we substantially exhausted the repurchase capacity under the 2019 Program. As a result, our Board of Directors authorized a new\nstock repurchase program in January 2022 (“2022 Program”) under which we may repurchase up to $175.0 million of our Class A common stock currently\nissued and outstanding. Because the 2022 Program was set to terminate on January 31, 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase\nprogram in January 2024 (“2024 Program”) under which we may repurchase up to $175.0 million of our Class A common stock currently issued and\noutstanding.\n58\nDuring 2023, we repurchased 2,257,049 shares at an average price of $17.72 per share under the 2022 Program. During 2022, we repurchased 513,725\nshares at an average price of $31.25 per share under the 2019 Program and 3,919,037 shares at an average price of $24.26 per share under the 2022\nProgram, respectively. The 2022 Program repurchases were all completed during the second and third quarters of 2022.\nUnder the 2024 Program, we may repurchase shares of our common stock through open market and privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. The\ntiming, pricing, and amount of any repurchases under the 2024 Program will be determined by management at its discretion based on a variety of factors,\nincluding, but not limited to, trading volume and market price of our common stock, corporate considerations, our working capital and investment\nrequirements, general market and economic conditions, and legal requirements. The 2024 Program does not obligate us to repurchase any common stock\nand may be modified, discontinued, or suspended at any time without prior notice. We anticipate funding for the 2024 Program to come from available\nsources of liquidity, including cash on hand and future cash flow.\nCash Dividends\nWe declared cash dividends on our common stock of $0.80 per share for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, compared to $0.76 per share for the\ntwelve months ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $0.04, or 5%. The timing and amount of future dividends are at the discretion of our Board of\nDirectors and will depend upon our consolidated earnings, financial condition, liquidity and capital requirements, the amount of cash dividends paid to us\nby our subsidiaries, applicable government regulations and policies and other factors considered relevant by our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors\nanticipates that we will continue to pay quarterly dividends in amounts determined based on the factors discussed above. However, there can be no\nassurance that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock at the current levels or at all.\nParent Company Liquidity\nThe primary liquidity needs of Simmons First National Corporation (the Parent Company) are the payment of dividends to shareholders, the funding of\ndebt obligations and cash needs for acquisitions. The primary sources for meeting these liquidity needs are the current cash on hand at the parent company\nand the future dividends received from Simmons Bank. Payment of dividends by Simmons Bank is subject to various regulatory limitations. The Company\ncontinually assesses its capital and liquidity needs and the best way to meet them, including, without limitation, through capital raising in the market via\nstock or debt offerings. See Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk”, for additional information regarding the parent\ncompany’s liquidity, which is incorporated herein by reference. The redemption of our trust preferred securities during the third quarter of 2022 did not\nhave a meaningful impact on the Parent Company’s liquidity.\nRisk-Based Capital\nThe Company and Simmons Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet\nminimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a\ndirect material effect on our financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, we must\nmeet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under\nregulatory accounting practices. Our capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk\nweightings and other factors.\nQuantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require us to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the table\nbelow) of total, Tier 1 and common equity Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined) and of Tier 1 capital (as defined)\nto average assets (as defined). Management believes that, as of December 31, 2023, we met all capital adequacy requirements to which we are subject.\nAs of the most recent notification from regulatory agencies, Simmons Bank was well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective\naction. To be categorized as well capitalized, the Company and Simmons Bank must maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based, common equity\nTier 1 risk-based and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the table. There are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have\nchanged the bank’s categories.\n59\nOur risk-based capital ratios at December 31, 2023 and 2022 are presented in Table 18 below:\nTable 18: Risk-Based Capital\nDecember 31,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2023 2022\nTier 1 capital:\nStockholders’ equity $ 3,426,488 $ 3,269,362\nCECL transition provision 61,746 92,619\nGoodwill and other intangible assets (1,398,810) (1,412,667)\nUnrealized loss on available-for-sale securities, net of income taxes 404,375 517,560\nTotal Tier 1 capital 2,493,799 2,466,874\nTier 2 capital:\nSubordinated notes and debentures 366,141 365,989\nSubordinated debt phase out (66,000) —\nQualifying allowance for credit losses and reserve for unfunded commitments 170,977 115,627\nTotal Tier 2 capital 471,118 481,616\nTotal risk-based capital $ 2,964,917 $ 2,948,490\nRisk weighted assets $20,599,238 $20,738,727\nAssets for leverage ratio $26,552,988 $26,407,061\nRatios at end of year:\nCommon equity Tier 1 ratio (CET1) 12.11 % 11.90 %\nTier 1 leverage ratio 9.39 % 9.34 %\nTier 1 risk-based capital ratio 12.11 % 11.90 %\nTotal risk-based capital ratio 14.39 % 14.22 %\nMinimum guidelines:\nCommon equity Tier 1 ratio (CET1) 4.50 % 4.50 %\nTier 1 leverage ratio 4.00 % 4.00 %\nTier 1 risk-based capital ratio 6.00 % 6.00 %\nTotal risk-based capital ratio 8.00 % 8.00 %\nRegulatory Capital Changes\nIn December 2018, the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) (collectively, the\n“agencies”) issued a final rule revising regulatory capital rules in anticipation of the adoption of ASU 2016-13 that provided an option to phase in over a\nthree year period on a straight line basis the day-one impact of the adoption on earnings and Tier 1 capital (the “CECL Transition Provision”).\nIn March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the agencies issued a new regulatory capital rule revising the CECL Transition Provision to delay\nthe estimated impact on regulatory capital stemming from the implementation of ASU 2016-13. The rule provides banking organizations that implement\nCECL before the end of 2020 the option to delay for two years an estimate of CECL’s effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition\nperiod (the “2020 CECL Transition Provision”). The Company elected to apply the 2020 CECL Transition Provision.\nThe Basel III Capital Rules define the components of capital and address other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions’ regulatory capital\nratios. The rules also address risk weights and other issues affecting the denominator in banking institutions’ regulatory capital ratios with a more risk-\nsensitive approach. The Basel III Capital Rules established risk-weighting categories depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0% for\nU.S. government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures.\n60\nThe final rules included a new common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 4.5% and a common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer\nof 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. The rules also raised the minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets to 6.0% and require a minimum leverage\nratio of 4.0%.\nPrior to December 31, 2017, Tier 1 capital included common equity Tier 1 capital and certain additional Tier 1 items as provided under the Basel III Capital\nRules. The Tier 1 capital for the Company consisted of common equity Tier 1 capital and trust preferred securities. The Basel III Capital Rules include\ncertain provisions that require trust preferred securities to be phased out of qualifying Tier 1 capital when assets surpass $15 billion. As of December 31,\n2017, the Company exceeded $15 billion in total assets and the grandfather provisions applicable to its trust preferred securities no longer apply and trust\npreferred securities are no longer included as Tier 1 capital. All of the Company’s trust preferred securities were redeemed during the third quarter of 2022.\nQualifying subordinated debt of $300.1 million is included as Tier 2 and total capital of the Company as of December 31, 2023.\nLiquidity\nIn the normal course of business we have entered into a number of contractual obligations and have made commitments to make future payments. Refer to\nthe accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for the expected timing of such payments as of December 31, 2023.\nExamples of these commitments include but are not limited to long-term debt financing (Note 12, Other Borrowings and Subordinated Debentures),\noperating lease obligations (Note, 6, Right-of-Use Lease Assets and Lease Liabilities), time deposits with stated maturity dates (Note 9, Time Deposits),\nand unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit (Note 19, Commitments and Credit Risk).\nGAAP Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe tables below present computations of adjusted earnings (net income excluding certain items {gain on sale of branches, early retirement program costs,\nloss from early retirement of TruPS, gain on sale of intellectual property, gain on insurance settlement, donation to Simmons First Foundation, merger\nrelated costs, FDIC special assessment, loss (gain) on sale of securities, net branch right sizing costs, and the Day 2 CECL Provision}) (non-GAAP) and\nadjusted diluted earnings per share (non-GAAP) as well as a computation of tangible book value per common share (non-GAAP), tangible common equity\nto tangible assets (non-GAAP), adjusted noninterest income (non-GAAP), adjusted noninterest expense (non-GAAP), adjusted salaries and employee\nbenefits expense (non-GAAP) and the coverage ratio of uninsured, non-collateralized deposits (non-GAAP). Adjusted items are included in financial\nresults presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP). The Company has updated its calculation of certain non-GAAP\nfinancial measures to exclude the impact of gains or losses on the sale of AFS investment securities in light of the impact of the Company’s strategic AFS\ninvestment securities transactions during the fourth quarter of 2023 and has presented past periods on a comparable basis.\nWe believe the exclusion of these certain items in expressing earnings and certain other financial measures, including “adjusted earnings,” provides a\nmeaningful basis for period-to-period and company-to-company comparisons, which management believes will assist investors and analysts in analyzing\nthe adjusted financial measures of the Company and predicting future performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are also used by management to\nassess the performance of the Company’s business because management does not consider these certain items to be relevant to ongoing financial\nperformance. Management and the Board of Directors utilize “adjusted earnings” (non-GAAP) for the following purposes:\n• Preparation of the Company’s operating budgets\n• Monthly financial performance reporting\n• Monthly “flash” reporting of consolidated results (management only)\n• Investor presentations of Company performance\nWe believe the presentation of “adjusted earnings” on a diluted per share basis (non-GAAP) provides a meaningful basis for period-to-period and\ncompany-to-company comparisons, which management believes will assist investors and analysts in analyzing the adjusted financial measures of the\nCompany and predicting future performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are also used by management to assess the performance of the\nCompany’s business, because management does not consider these certain items to be relevant to ongoing financial performance on a per share\nbasis. Management and the Board of Directors utilize “adjusted diluted earnings per share” (non-GAAP) for the following purposes:\n• Calculation of annual performance-based incentives for certain executives\n• Calculation of long-term performance-based incentives for certain executives\n• Investor presentations of Company performance\n61\nWe have $1.43 billion and $1.45 billion total goodwill and other intangible assets for the periods ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Because\nour acquisition strategy has resulted in a high level of intangible assets, management believes useful calculations include tangible book value per common\nshare (non-GAAP) and tangible common equity to tangible assets (non-GAAP).\nWe believe that presenting these non-GAAP financial measures will permit investors and analysts to assess the performance of the Company on the same\nbasis as that is applied by management and the Board of Directors.\nNon-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. To mitigate these limitations, we\nhave procedures in place to identify and approve each item that qualifies as adjusted to ensure that the Company’s “adjusted” results are properly reflected\nfor period-to-period comparisons. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company, they\nhave limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP. In particular,\na measure of earnings that excludes certain items does not represent the amount that effectively accrues directly to stockholders (i.e., certain items are\nincluded in earnings and stockholders’ equity). Additionally, similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies may not be computed\nin the same or similar fashion.\nDuring 2023, adjusted items primarily consisted of net branch right sizing costs of $5.5 million, mainly due to branch closures across our footprint during\nthe year, $6.2 million in early retirement program costs related to our Better Bank Initiative, and a $20.6 million loss on sale of securities due to the\nstrategic sale of AFS securities during the year. Additionally, we recorded $10.5 million related to a FDIC special assessment levied to support the Deposit\nInsurance Fund following the failure of certain banks in 2023. The net after-tax impact of all adjusted items on net income was $32.7 million, or a $0.26\nimpact on diluted earnings per share.\nDuring 2022, adjusted items primarily consisted of $33.8 million of Day 2 provision expense required for loans and unfunded commitments related to the\nSpirit acquisition, merger-related costs of $22.5 million, primarily related to the Spirit acquisition, and net branch right sizing costs of $3.6 million, mainly\ndue to branch closures across our footprint during the year. Additionally, we had a gain on insurance settlement of $4.1 million related to a weather event\nthat caused severe damage to one of our branch locations. The net after-tax impact of all adjusted items was $42.4 million, or $0.34 per diluted earnings per\nshare.\nDuring 2021, adjusted items primarily consisted of $22.7 million of Day 2 provision expense required for loans related to the Landmark and Triumph\nacquisitions, $15.9 million of merger-related costs, related to the Landmark and Triumph acquisitions and $15.5 million of gains related to the sale of\nsecurities. Additionally, we had total gains on sale of branches of $5.3 million due to the Illinois Branch Sale. The net after-tax impact of these items was\n$12.5 million, or $0.11 per diluted earnings per share.\n62\nSee Table 19 below for the reconciliation of adjusted earnings, which exclude certain items

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nLiquidity and Market Risk Management\nParent Company\nThe Company has leveraged its investment in its subsidiary bank and depends upon the dividends paid to it, as the sole shareholder of the subsidiary bank,\nas a principal source of funds for dividends to shareholders, stock repurchases and debt service requirements. At December 31, 2023, undivided profits of\nSimmons Bank were approximately $622.9 million, of which approximately $54.4 million was available for the payment of dividends to the Company\nwithout regulatory approval. In addition to dividends, other sources of liquidity for the Company are the sale of equity securities and the borrowing of\nfunds.\nSubsidiary Bank\nGenerally speaking, the Company’s subsidiary bank relies upon net inflows of cash from financing activities, supplemented by net inflows of cash from\noperating activities, to provide cash used in investing activities. Typical of most banking companies, significant financing activities include: deposit\ngathering; use of short-term borrowing facilities, such as federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements; and the issuance of long-term debt. The\nsubsidiary bank’s primary investing activities include loan originations and purchases of investment securities, offset by loan payoffs and investment cash\nflows and maturities.\nLiquidity represents an institution’s ability to provide funds to satisfy demands from depositors and borrowers by either converting assets into cash or\naccessing new or existing sources of incremental funds. A major responsibility of management is to maximize net interest income within prudent liquidity\nconstraints. Internal corporate guidelines have been established to constantly measure liquid assets as well as relevant ratios concerning earning asset levels\nand purchased funds. The management and Board of Directors of the subsidiary bank monitor these same indicators and makes adjustments as needed.\nLiquidity Management\nThe objective of our liquidity management is to access adequate sources of funding to ensure that cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers are\nmet in an orderly and timely manner. Sources of liquidity are managed so that reliance on any one funding source is kept to a minimum. Our liquidity\nsources are prioritized for both availability and time to activation.\nOur liquidity is a primary consideration in determining funding needs and is an integral part of asset/liability management. Pricing of the liability side is a\nmajor component of interest margin and spread management. Adequate liquidity is a necessity in addressing this critical task. There are seven primary and\nsecondary sources of liquidity available to the Company. The particular liquidity need and timeframe determine the use of these sources.\nThe first source of liquidity available to the Company is federal funds. Federal funds are available on a daily basis and are used to meet the normal\nfluctuations of a dynamic balance sheet. As of December 31, 2023, the Bank had approximately $510.0 million in federal funds lines of credit from\nupstream correspondent banks that can be accessed, when needed. In order to ensure availability of these upstream funds we test these borrowing lines at\nleast annually. Historical monitoring of these funds has made it possible for us to project seasonal fluctuations and structure our funding requirements on a\nmonth-to-month basis.\nSecond, Simmons Bank has lines of credit available with the Federal Home Loan Bank. While we use portions of those lines to match off longer-term\nmortgage loans, we also use those lines to meet liquidity needs. Approximately $5.4 billion of these lines of credit are currently available, if needed, for\nliquidity.\nA third source of liquidity is that we have the ability to access large wholesale deposits from both the public and private sector to fund short-term liquidity\nneeds.\nA fourth source of liquidity is the retail deposits available through our network of financial centers throughout Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma,\nTennessee and Texas. Although this method can be a somewhat more expensive alternative to supplying liquidity, this source can be used to meet\nintermediate term liquidity needs.\nFifth, we use a laddered investment portfolio that ensures there is a steady source of intermediate term liquidity. These funds can be used to meet seasonal\nloan patterns and other intermediate term balance sheet fluctuations. Approximately 45.8% of the investment portfolio is classified as available-for-sale,\nand we may generate additional liquidity through opportunistic sales of investment securities. We also use securities held in the securities portfolio to\npledge when obtaining public funds.\n66\nSixth, we have a network of downstream correspondent banks from which we can access debt to meet liquidity needs.\nFinally, we have the ability to access funds through the Federal Reserve Bank Discount Window.\nWe believe the various sources available are ample liquidity for short-term, intermediate-term and long-term liquidity.\nMarket Risk Management\nMarket risk arises from changes in interest rates. We have risk management policies to monitor and limit exposure to market risk. In asset and liability\nmanagement activities, policies designed to minimize structural interest rate risk are in place. The measurement of market risk associated with financial\ninstruments is meaningful only when all related and offsetting on- and off-balance-sheet transactions are aggregated, and the resulting net positions are\nidentified.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nInterest rate risk represents the potential impact of interest rate changes on net income and capital resulting from mismatches in repricing opportunities of\nassets and liabilities over a period of time. A number of tools are used to monitor and manage interest rate risk, including simulation models and interest\nsensitivity gap analysis. Management uses simulation models to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and various balance sheet strategies on the\nlevel of the Company’s net income and capital. As a means of limiting interest rate risk to an acceptable level, management may alter the mix of floating\nand fixed-rate assets and liabilities, change pricing schedules, manage investment maturities during future security purchases, or enter into derivative\ncontracts such as interest rate swaps.\nThe simulation model incorporates management’s assumptions regarding the level of interest rates or balance changes for indeterminate maturity deposits\nfor a given level of market rate changes. These assumptions have been developed through anticipated pricing behavior. Key assumptions in the simulation\nmodels include the relative timing of prepayments, cash flows and maturities. These assumptions are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the model cannot\nprecisely estimate net interest income or precisely predict the impact of a change in interest rates on net income or capital. Actual results will differ from\nsimulated results due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and management strategies, among\nother factors.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the model simulations projected that 100 and 200 basis point increases in interest rates would result in negative variances in net\ninterest income of 2.72% and 5.57%, respectively, relative to the base case over the next 12 months. Interest rate decreases of 100 and 200 basis points\nwould result in positive variances in net interest income of 2.18% and 5.36%, respectively, relative to the base case over the next 12 months. These results\nreflect a liability-sensitive balance sheet and are consistent with the Company’s shift toward short-term funding combined with relatively little change in\nthe mix of interest-earning assets. These are good faith estimates and assume that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at\neach year-end will remain constant over the relevant twelve month measurement period and that changes in market interest rates are instantaneous and\nsustained across the yield curve regardless of duration of pricing characteristics of specific assets or liabilities. Also, this analysis does not contemplate any\nactions that we might undertake in response to changes in market interest rates. We believe these estimates are not necessarily indicative of what actually\ncould occur in the event of immediate interest rate increases or decreases of this magnitude. As interest-bearing assets and liabilities reprice in different\ntime frames and proportions to market interest rate movements, various assumptions must be made based on historical relationships of these variables in\nreaching any conclusion. Since these correlations are based on competitive and market conditions, we anticipate that our future results will likely be\ndifferent from the foregoing estimates, and such differences could be material.\nThe table below presents our sensitivity to net interest income at December 31, 2023.\nTable 24: Net Interest Income Sensitivity\nInterest Rate Scenario % Change from Base\nUp 200 basis points (5.57)%\nUp 100 basis points (2.72)%\nDown 100 basis points 2.18 %\nDown 200 basis points 5.36 %\n67\nITEM 8.

The Company’s internal control over financial\nreporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of\nthe Company’s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBecause of inherent limitations, internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Accordingly, even those systems\ndetermined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making this assessment,\nmanagement used the criteria set forth in ,QWHUQDO\u0003&RQWURO\u0003±\u0003,QWHJUDWHG\u0003)UDPHZRUN\u0003 \u0015\u0013\u0014\u0016\u0003HGLWLRQ \u0003LVVXHG\u0003E\\\u0003WKH\u0003&RPPLWWHH\u0003RI\u00036SRQVRULQJ\u00032UJDQL]DWLRQV\u0003RI\nWKH\u00037UHDGZD\\\u0003&RPPLVVLRQ\u0003 &262). Based on this assessment, management has determined that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as\nof December 31, 2023 is effective based on the specified criteria.\nFORVIS, LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements of the Company included in this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023.\nThe report, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,\n2023, immediately follows.\n69\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders, Board of Directors and Audit Committee\nSimmons First National Corporation\nPine Bluff, Arkansas\nOpinion on the Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Simmons First National Corporation’s (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria\nestablished in ,QWHUQDO\u0003&RQWURO\u0003±\u0003,QWHJUDWHG\u0003)UDPHZRUN \u0003 \u0015\u0013\u0014\u0016 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria\nestablished in\u0003,QWHUQDO\u0003&RQWURO\u0003±\u0003,QWHJUDWHG\u0003)UDPHZRUN \u0003 \u0015\u0013\u0014\u0016 issued by COSO.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated financial\nstatements of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and our report dated\nFebruary 27, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal\ncontrol over financial reporting, included in the accompanying 0DQDJHPHQW¶V\u00035HSRUW\u0003RQ\u0003,QWHUQDO\u0003&RQWURO\u00032YHU\u0003)LQDQFLDO\u00035HSRUWLQJ. Our responsibility is to express\nan opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.\nWe are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance\nabout whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists and testing and\nevaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we\nconsidered necessary in the circumstances.

A company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of\nfinancial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of\nunauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with\nthe policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nFORVIS, LLP\n/s/ FORVIS, LLP\nLittle Rock, Arkansas\nFebruary 27, 2024\n70\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders, Board of Directors and Audit Committee\nSimmons First National Corporation\nPine Bluff, Arkansas\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Simmons First National Corporation (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and\n2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year\nperiod ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial\nstatements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the\nresults of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s\ninternal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in ,QWHUQDO\u0003&RQWURO\u0003±\u0003,QWHJUDWHG\u0003)UDPHZRUN\u0003 \u0015\u0013\u0014\u0016 issued\nby the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and our report dated February 27, 2024, expressed an unqualified\nopinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial\nstatements based on our audits.\nWe are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S.\nfederal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing\nprocedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to\nthose risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also\nincluded evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\nfinancial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were\ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial\nstatements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way\nour opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing\nseparate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n$OORZDQFH\u0003IRU\u0003&UHGLW\u0003/RVVHV\nThe Company’s loan portfolio totaled $16.85 billion as of December 31, 2023 and the allowance for credit losses on loans was $225.2 million. The\nCompany’s unfunded loan commitments totaled $4.2 billion, with an allowance for credit losses of $25.6 million. The Company’s available-for-sale and\nheld-to-maturity securities portfolios totaled $6.88 billion as of December 31, 2023, and the allowance for credit losses on securities was $3.2 million.\nTogether these amounts represent the allowance for credit losses (“ACL”). As more fully described in Notes 1, 3 and 5 to the Company’s consolidated\nfinancial statements:\n• For loans receivable, the ACL is a contra-asset valuation account, calculated in accordance with Topic 326 that is deducted from the amortized\ncost basis of loans to present the net amount expected to be collected.\n• For unfunded loan commitments, the ACL is a liability account calculated in accordance with Topic 326, reported as a component of accrued\ninterest and other liabilities.\n• For securities, the ACL is a contra-valuation account that is deducted from the recorded basis of the securities.\n71\nThe amount of each allowance account represents management’s best estimate of current expected credit losses on those financial instruments considering\nall available information from internal and external sources, relevant to assessing exposure to credit loss over the contractual term of the instrument. Loans\nwith similar risk characteristics are aggregated into homogenous segments for assessment. Expected credit losses are estimated by either lifetime loss rates\nor expected cash flows based on three key parameters: probability of default (PD), exposure-at-default (EAD) or loss given default (LGD). The estimates\ninclude economic forecasts over the reasonable and supportable forecast period based on projected performance of economic variables that have a\nstatistical relationship.\nManagement qualitatively adjusts its model results for risk factors that were not considered within the modeling processes but were still relevant in\nassessing the expected credit losses within the loan pools. In some cases, management determined that an individual loan exhibited unique characteristics\nwhich differentiated the loan from other loans with the identified loan pools. In such cases the loans were evaluated for expected credit losses on an\nindividual basis and excluded from the collective evaluation.\nAuditing management’s estimate of the ACL involved a high degree of subjectivity due to the nature of the qualitative factor adjustments included in the\nACL and complexities due to the implementation of the PD, EAD or LGD models. Management’s identification and measurement of the qualitative factor\nadjustments is highly judgmental.\nThe primary procedures we performed as of December 31, 2023 to address this critical audit matter included:\n• Obtained an understanding of the Company’s process for establishing the ACL\n• Evaluated and tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls over the reliability and accuracy of the data used to calculate and estimate\nthe various components of the ACL including:\n◦ Loan data completeness and accuracy\n◦ Grouping of loans by segment\n◦ Model inputs utilized including PD, LGD, remaining life and prepayment speed\n◦ Approval of model assumptions selected\n◦ Establishment of qualitative factors\n◦ Loan risk ratings\n• Tested the mathematical accuracy of the calculation of the ACL\n• Performed reviews of individual credit files to evaluate the reasonableness of loan credit risk ratings\n• Tested internally prepared loan reviews to evaluate the reasonableness of the loan credit risk ratings\n• Tested the completeness and accuracy of inputs utilized in the calculation of the ACL\n• Evaluated the qualitative adjustments to the ACL including assessing the basis for adjustments and the reasonableness of the significant\nassumptions\n• Tested the reasonableness of specific reserves on individually reviewed loans\n• Evaluated credit quality trends in delinquencies, non-accruals, charge-offs and loan risk ratings\n• Evaluated the overall reasonableness of the ACL and compared to trends identified within peer groups\n• Tested estimated utilization rate of unfunded loan commitments\n• Reviewed documentation prepared to assess the methodology utilized by a third party performing the ACL calculation for securities for\nreasonableness\n• Evaluated the accuracy and completeness of Accounting Standards Update 2016-13\u000f\u0003)LQDQFLDO\u0003,QVWUXPHQWV\u0003\u0010\u0003&UHGLW\u0003/RVVHV\u0003 7RSLF\u0003\u0016\u0015\u0019 disclosures\nin the consolidated financial statements.\n*RRGZLOO\nAs reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2023, the Company’s goodwill was $1.32 billion. As disclosed in Note 8\nto the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment require the\nperformance of an interim impairment assessment.\nAuditing management’s impairment tests of goodwill was complex and highly judgmental due to the calculation relying on several assumptions that have a\nlevel of subjectivity and judgment. These assumptions are dependent on market and economic conditions. Key inputs to estimate terminal fair value of the\nCompany include projected forecasts, noninterest expense savings and a pricing multiple based on a group of peer banks with similar characteristics. These\ninputs are discounted by the cost of equity, which includes assumptions involving the Company’s beta; equity risk, size and company premiums; and the\n20-year treasury rate. Assumptions used in calculating the cost of equity are obtained from market and third-party data.\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s goodwill assessment process. For example,\nwe tested the controls over the Company’s review of the significant assumptions utilized in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit.\n72\nTo test the fair values of the reporting unit, our audit procedures included, among others, assessing methodologies, testing the significant assumptions\ndescribed above, and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used by the Company. Our testing procedures over the significant\nassumptions included, among others, comparing forecasted revenue to current industry and economic trends. We assessed the historical accuracy of\nmanagement’s estimates by comparing past projections to actual performance and assessed the sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate\nthe changes in the fair value of the reporting unit resulting from changes in the assumptions. We also involved an internal valuation professional to assist in\nevaluating the Company’s models, valuation methodology, and significant assumptions used in the fair value estimates.\nFORVIS,

POLICIES\nNature of Operations and Principles of Consolidation\nSimmons First National Corporation (“Company”) is a Mid-South financial holding company headquartered in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, and the parent\ncompany of Simmons Bank, an Arkansas state-chartered bank that has been in operation since 1903 (“Simmons Bank” or the “Bank”). Simmons First\nInsurance Services, Inc. and Simmons First Insurance Services of TN, LLC are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Simmons Bank and are insurance agencies\nthat offer various lines of personal and corporate insurance coverage to individual and commercial customers. The Company, through its subsidiaries,\noffers, among other things, consumer, real estate and commercial loans; checking, savings and time deposits; and specialized products and services (such as\ncredit cards, trust and fiduciary services, investments, agricultural finance lending, equipment lending, insurance and Small Business Administration\n(“SBA”) lending) from approximately 234 financial centers as of December 31, 2023, located throughout market areas in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri,\nOklahoma, Tennessee and Texas.\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. Significant intercompany accounts and transactions have\nbeen eliminated in consolidation.\nSimmons Bank is an Arkansas state-chartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve System through the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Due to\nthe Company’s typical acquisition process, there may be brief periods of time during which the Company may operate another subsidiary bank that the\nCompany acquired through a merger with a target bank holding company as a separate subsidiary while preparing for the merger and integration of that\nsubsidiary bank into Simmons Bank. However, it is the Company’s intent to generally maintain Simmons Bank as the Company’s sole subsidiary bank.\nOperating Segments\nOperating segments are components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is regularly evaluated by the chief\noperating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company is organized with community and commercial\nbanking groups. Each of these groups provide one or more similar banking services, including such products and services as loans; time deposits, checking\nand savings accounts; treasury management; and credit cards. Loan products include consumer, real estate, commercial, agricultural, equipment, warehouse\nlending and SBA lending. The individual banking groups have similar operating and economic characteristics. While the chief operating decision maker\nmonitors the revenue streams of the various products, services, branch locations, divisions and groups, operations are managed, financial performance is\nevaluated, and management makes decisions on how to allocate resources, on a Company-wide basis. Accordingly, the respective groups are considered by\nmanagement to be aggregated into one reportable operating segment.\nThe Company also considers its trust, investment and insurance services to be operating segments. Information on these segments is not reported separately\nsince they do not meet the quantitative thresholds under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 280-10-50-12.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\namounts of assets, liabilities, income items and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The estimates and assumptions used in the\naccompanying consolidated financial statements are based upon management’s evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances as of the date of the\nconsolidated financial statements and actual results may differ from these estimates. Such estimates include, but are not limited to, the Company’s\nallowance for credit losses.\n79\nMaterial estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change relate to the determination of the allowance for credit losses, the valuation of\nacquired loans, valuation of goodwill and subsequent impairment analysis, stock-based compensation plans and income taxes. Management obtains third\nparty valuations to assist in valuing certain aspects of these material estimates, as appropriate, including independent appraisals for significant properties in\nconnection with the determination of the allowance for credit losses and the fair value of acquired loans. Assumptions used in the goodwill impairment\nanalysis involve internally projected forecasts, coupled with market and third-party data. These material estimates could change as a result of the\nuncertainty in current macroeconomic conditions and other factors that are beyond the Company’s control and could cause actual results to differ materially\nfrom those projected.\nReclassifications\nVarious items within the accompanying consolidated financial statements for previous years have been reclassified to provide more comparative\ninformation. These reclassifications were not material to the consolidated financial statements.\nCash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. For purposes of the consolidated\nstatements of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents are considered to include cash and noninterest bearing balances due from banks, interest bearing\nbalances due from banks and federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell. At December 31, 2023, nearly all of the interest-\nbearing and noninterest bearing deposits were uninsured with nearly all of these balances held at the Federal Reserve Bank.\nInvestment Securities\nHeld-to-maturity securities (“HTM”), which include any security for which the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity, are\ncarried at historical cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. Premiums and discounts are amortized and accreted,\nrespectively, to interest income using the constant effective yield method over the estimated life of the security. Prepayments are anticipated for mortgage-\nbacked and SBA securities. Premiums on callable securities are amortized to their earliest call date.\nAvailable-for-sale securities (“AFS”), which include any security for which the Company has no immediate plan to sell but which may be sold in the\nfuture, are carried at fair value. Realized gains and losses, based on specifically identified amortized cost of the individual security, are included in other\nincome. Unrealized gains and losses are recorded, net of related income tax effects, in stockholders’ equity. Premiums and discounts are amortized and\naccreted, respectively, to interest income using the constant effective yield method over the estimated life of the security. Prepayments are anticipated for\nmortgage-backed and SBA securities. Premiums on callable securities are amortized to their earliest call date.\nTrading securities, if any, which include any security held primarily for near-term sale, are carried at fair value. Gains and losses on trading securities are\nincluded in other income.\nAllowance for Credit Losses - Investment Securities\nAllowance for Credit Losses - HTM Securities - The Company measures expected credit losses on HTM securities on a collective basis by major security\ntype, with each type sharing similar risk characteristics. The estimate of expected credit losses considers historical credit loss information that is adjusted\nfor current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The Company has made the election to exclude accrued interest receivable on HTM\nsecurities from the estimate of credit losses and report accrued interest separately on the consolidated balance sheets.\n80\nAllowance for Credit Losses - AFS Securities - For AFS securities in an unrealized loss position, the Company first evaluates whether it intends to sell, or\nwhether it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of these criteria regarding\nintent or requirement to sell is met, the AFS security amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. If the criteria is not met, the\nCompany is required to assess whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or noncredit-related factors. If the assessment indicates a\ncredit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the\npresent value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists, and an allowance for credit loss is recorded\nthrough income as a component of provision for credit loss expense. If the assessment indicates that a credit loss does not exist, the Company records the\ndecline in fair value through other comprehensive income, net of related income tax effects. The Company has made the election to exclude accrued\ninterest receivable on AFS securities from the estimate of credit losses and report accrued interest separately on the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in\nthe allowance for credit losses are recorded as provision for (or reversal of) credit loss expense. Losses are charged against the allowance when\nmanagement believes the uncollectibility of an AFS security is confirmed or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met.\nMortgage Loans Held For Sale\nMortgage Loans Held for Sale are carried at fair value which is determined on an aggregate basis. Adjustments to fair value are recognized monthly and\nreflected in earnings. The Company regularly sells mortgages into the capital markets to mitigate the effects of interest rate volatility during the period from\nthe time an interest rate lock commitment (“IRLC”) is issued until the IRLC funds creating a mortgage loan held for sale and its subsequent sale into the\nsecondary/capital markets. Loan sales are typically executed on a mandatory basis. Under a mandatory commitment, the Company agrees to deliver a\nspecified dollar amount with predetermined terms by a certain date. Generally, the commitment is not loan specific, and any combination of loans can be\ndelivered into the outstanding commitment provided the terms fall within the parameters of the commitment. Upon failure to deliver, the Company is\nsubject to fees based on market movement.\nThe IRLCs are derivative instruments; their fair values at December 31, 2023 and 2022 were not material. Gains and losses resulting from sales of\nmortgage loans are recognized when the respective loans are sold to correspondent lenders, investors or aggregators. Gains and losses are determined by\nthe difference between the sale price and the carrying amount in the loans sold, net of discounts collected, or premiums paid. Hedge instruments are,\nlikewise, carried at fair value and associated gains/losses are realized at time of settlement.\nLoans\nLoans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or pay-offs are reported at their amortized cost basis,\nwhich is the unpaid principal balance outstanding, net of unearned income, deferred loan fees and costs, premiums and discounts associated with\nacquisition date fair value adjustments on acquired loans, and any direct principal charge-offs. The Company has made a policy election to exclude accrued\ninterest from the amortized cost basis of loans and report accrued interest separately from the related loan balance on the consolidated balance sheets.\nFor loans amortized at cost, interest income is accrued based on the unpaid principal balance. Loan origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs,\nas well as premiums and discounts, are deferred and amortized as a level yield adjustment over the respective term of the loan.\nThe accrual of interest on loans, except on certain government guaranteed loans, is discontinued at the time the loan is 90 days past due unless the credit is\nwell-secured and in process of collection. Past due status is based on contractual terms of the loan. In all cases, loans are placed on non-accrual or charged\noff at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful.\nDiscounts and premiums on purchased residential real estate loans are amortized to income using the interest method over the remaining period to\ncontractual maturity, adjusted for anticipated prepayments. Discounts and premiums on purchased consumer loans are recognized over the expected lives of\nthe loans using methods that approximate the interest method.\nFurther information regarding accounting policies related to past due loans, non-accrual loans, and modifications to borrowers experiencing financial\ndifficulty is presented in Note 5, Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses. Additionally, for discussion of the Company’s accounting for acquired loans, see\n$FTXLVLWLRQ\u0003$FFRXQWLQJ\u000f\u0003/RDQV later in this section.\n81\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe allowance for credit losses is a reserve established through a provision for credit losses charged to expense which represents management’s best\nestimate of lifetime expected losses based on reasonable and supportable forecasts, quantitative factors, and other qualitative considerations.\nLoans with similar risk characteristics such as loan type, collateral type, and internal risk ratings are aggregated for collective assessment. The Company\nuses statistically-based models that leverage assumptions about current and future economic conditions throughout the contractual life of the loan. Expected\ncredit losses are estimated by either lifetime loss rates or expected loss cash flows based on three key parameters: probability-of-default (“PD”), exposure-\nat-default (“EAD”), and loss-given-default (“LGD”). Future economic conditions are incorporated to the extent that they are reasonable and supportable.\nBeyond the reasonable and supportable periods, the economic variables revert to a historical equilibrium at a pace dependent on the state of the economy\nreflected within the economic scenarios. The Company also includes qualitative adjustments to the allowance based on factors and considerations that have\nnot otherwise been fully accounted for.\nLoans that have unique risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. These evaluations are typically performed on loans with a deteriorated\ninternal risk rating. For a collateral-dependent loan, our evaluation process includes a valuation by appraisal or other collateral analysis adjusted for selling\ncosts, when appropriate. This valuation is compared to the remaining outstanding principal balance of the loan. If a loss is determined to be probable, the\nloss is included in the allowance for credit losses as a specific allocation.\n5HVHUYH\u0003IRU\u00038QIXQGHG\u0003&RPPLWPHQWV\nIn addition to the allowance for credit losses, the Company has established a reserve for unfunded commitments, classified in other liabilities, representing\nexpected credit losses over the contractual period for which the Company is exposed to credit risk resulting from a contractual obligation to extend credit.\nThis reserve is maintained at a level management believes to be sufficient to absorb losses arising from unfunded loan commitments. The adequacy of the\nreserve for unfunded commitments is determined quarterly based on methodology similar to the methodology for determining the allowance for credit\nlosses. The allowance for credit loss is reported as a component of accrued interest and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Adjustments to\nthe allowance are reported in the income statement as a component of the provision for credit losses.\nAcquisition Accounting, Loans\nThe Company accounts for its acquisitions under ASC Topic 805, %XVLQHVV\u0003&RPELQDWLRQV, which requires the use of the acquisition method of accounting.\nAll identifiable assets acquired, including loans, are recorded at fair value. The fair value for acquired loans at the time of acquisition is based on a variety\nof factors including discounted expected cash flows, adjusted for estimated prepayments and credit losses. In accordance with ASC 326, the fair value\nadjustment is recorded as premium or discount to the unpaid principal balance of each acquired loan. Loans that have been identified as having experienced\na more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination is a purchased credit deteriorated (“PCD”) loan. The net premium or discount on\nPCD loans is adjusted by the Company’s allowance for credit losses recorded at the time of acquisition. The remaining net premium or discount is accreted\nor amortized into interest income over the remaining life of the loan using a constant yield method. The net premium or discount on loans that are not\nclassified as PCD (“non-PCD”), that includes credit and non-credit components, is accreted or amortized into interest income over the remaining life of the\nloan using a constant yield method. The Company then records the necessary allowance for credit losses on the non-PCD loans through provision for credit\nlosses expense.\nFor further discussion of the Company’s acquisition and loan accounting, see Note 2, Acquisitions, and Note 5, Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses.\nTrust Assets\nTrust assets (other than cash deposits) held by the Company in fiduciary or agency capacities for its customers are not included in the accompanying\nconsolidated balance sheets since such items are not assets of the Company.\n82\nPremises and Equipment\nDepreciable assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is charged to expense using the straight-line method over the estimated\nuseful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are capitalized and amortized by the straight-line method over the terms of the respective leases or the\nestimated useful lives of the improvements, whichever is shorter. Right-of-use lease assets are operating leases with a term greater than one year and are\nincluded in premises and equipment.\nForeclosed Assets Held For Sale\nAssets acquired by foreclosure or in settlement of debt and held for sale are valued at estimated fair value less estimated cost to sell as of the date of\nforeclosure. Management evaluates the value of foreclosed assets held for sale periodically and any decreases in the fair value are charged to other expense.\nBank Owned Life Insurance\nThe Company maintains bank-owned life insurance policies on certain current and former employees and directors, which are recorded at their cash\nsurrender values as determined by the insurance carriers. The appreciation in the cash surrender value of the policies is recognized as a component of\nnoninterest income in the Company’s consolidated statements of income.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Other intangible assets represent purchased assets\nthat also lack physical substance but can be separately distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights or because the asset is\ncapable of being sold or exchanged either on its own or in combination with a related contract, asset or liability. The Company performs an annual goodwill\nimpairment test, and more than annually if circumstances warrant, in accordance with ASC Topic 350, ,QWDQJLEOHV\u0003±\u0003*RRGZLOO\u0003DQG\u00032WKHU\u000f\u0003as amended by\nAccounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2011-08 - 7HVWLQJ\u0003*RRGZLOO\u0003IRU\u0003,PSDLUPHQW. ASC Topic 350 requires that goodwill and intangible assets that have\nindefinite lives be reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently if certain conditions occur. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over\nthe estimated life of the asset, and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying value may not be\nrecoverable. Impairment losses on recorded goodwill, if any, will be recorded as operating expenses.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company may enter into derivative contracts for the purposes of managing exposure to interest rate risk to meet the financing needs of its customers. A\nderivative instrument is a financial tool which derives its value from the value of some other financial instrument, or variable index, including certain\nhedging instruments embedded in other contracts. These products are primarily designed to reduce interest rate risk for either the Company or its customers\nwho proactively manage these risks.\nThe Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. In an effort to meet the financing needs of its customers and mitigate the impact of\nchanging interest rates on the fair value of AFS securities, the Company has entered into fair value hedges. Fair value hedges include interest rate swap\nagreements on fixed rate loans and fixed rate callable AFS securities. To qualify for hedge accounting, derivatives must be highly effective at reducing the\nrisk associated with the exposure being hedged and must be designated as a hedge at the point of inception of the derivative contract.\nFor derivatives designated as hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of the hedged item, the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of\nchange together with the offsetting loss or gain of the hedging instrument. The fair value hedges are considered to be highly effective and any hedge\nineffectiveness was deemed not material. Fair value adjustments related to cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income and are\nreclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction is reflected in earnings.\n83\nSecurities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase\nThe Company sells securities under agreements to repurchase to meet customer needs for sweep accounts. At the point funds deposited by customers\nbecome investable, those funds are used to purchase securities owned by the Company and held in its general account with the designation of Customers’\nSecurities. A third party maintains control over the securities underlying overnight repurchase agreements. The securities involved in these transactions are\ngenerally U.S. Treasury or Federal Agency issues. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase generally mature on the banking day following that on\nwhich the investment was initially purchased and are treated as collateralized financing transactions which are recorded at the amounts at which the\nsecurities were sold plus accrued interest. Interest rates and maturity dates of the securities involved vary and are not intended to be matched with funds\nfrom customers.\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\nASC Topic 606, 5HYHQXH\u0003IURP\u0003&RQWUDFWV\u0003ZLWK\u0003&XVWRPHUV, applies to all contracts with customers to provide goods or services in the ordinary course of\nbusiness. However, Topic 606 specifically does not apply to revenue related to financial instruments, guarantees, insurance contracts, leases, or\nnonmonetary exchanges. Given these scope exceptions, interest income recognition and measurement related to loans and investments securities, the\nCompany’s two largest sources of revenue, are not accounted for under Topic 606. Also, the Company does not use Topic 606 to account for gains or losses\non its investments in securities, loans, and derivatives due to the scope exceptions.\nCertain revenue streams, such as service charges on deposit accounts, gains or losses on the sale of Other Real Estate Owned (“OREO”), and trust income,\nfall under the scope of Topic 606 and the Company must recognize revenue at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to\nbe entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. Topic 606 is applied using five steps: 1) identify the contract with the customer, 2)\nidentify the performance obligations in the contract, 3) determine the transaction price, 4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in\nthe contract, and 5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.\nThe Company has evaluated the nature of all contracts with customers that fall under the scope of Topic 606 and determined that further disaggregation of\nrevenue from contracts with customers into categories was not necessary. There has not been significant revenue recognized in the current reporting periods\nresulting from performance obligations satisfied in previous periods. In addition, there has not been a significant change in timing of revenues received\nfrom customers.\nA description of performance obligations for each type of contract with customers is as follows:\nService charges on deposit accounts – The Company’s primary source of funding comes from deposit accounts with its customers. Customers pay certain\nfees to access their cash on deposit including, but not limited to, non-transactional fees such as account maintenance, dormancy or statement rendering fees,\nand certain transaction-based fees such as ATM, wire transfer, overdraft or returned check fees. The Company generally satisfies its performance\nobligations as services are rendered. The transaction prices are fixed, and are charged either on a periodic basis or based on activity.\nSale of OREO – In the normal course of business, the Company will enter into contracts with customers to sell OREO, which has generally been foreclosed\nupon by the Company. The Company generally satisfies its performance obligation upon conveyance of property from the Company to the customer,\ngenerally by way of an executed agreement. The transaction price is fixed, and on occasion the Company will finance a portion of the proceeds the\ncustomers uses to purchase the property. These properties are generally sold without recourse or warranty.\nWealth Management Fees – The Company enters into contracts with its customers to manage assets for investment, and/or transact on their accounts. The\nCompany generally satisfies its performance obligations as services are rendered. The management fee is a fixed percentage-based fee calculated upon the\naverage balance of assets under management and is charged to customers on a monthly basis.\nBankcard Fee Income – Periodic bankcard fees, net of direct origination costs, are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the period the fee\nentitles the cardholder to use the card.\n84\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with income tax accounting guidance in ASC Topic 740, ,QFRPH\u00037D[HV. The income tax accounting\nguidance results in two components of income tax expense: current and deferred. Current income tax expense reflects taxes to be paid or refunded for the\ncurrent period by applying the provisions of the enacted tax law to the taxable income or excess of deductions over revenues. The Company determines\ndeferred income taxes using the liability (or balance sheet) method. Under this method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is based on the tax effects of\nthe differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and enacted changes in tax rates and laws are recognized in the period in which they\noccur.\nDeferred income tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. Deferred tax assets are recognized if it is more\nlikely than not, based on the technical merits, that the tax position will be realized or sustained upon examination. The term more likely than not means a\nlikelihood of more than 50 percent; the terms examined and upon examination also include resolution of the related appeals or litigation processes, if any. A\ntax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a\ngreater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. The\ndetermination of whether or not a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold considers the facts, circumstances and information\navailable at the reporting date and is subject to management’s judgment. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of\nevidence available, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nThe Company files consolidated income tax returns with its subsidiaries.\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per share are computed based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during each year. Diluted earnings per share are\ncomputed using the weighted average common shares and all potential dilutive common shares outstanding during the period.\nThe computation of per share earnings is as follows:\n(In thousands, except per share data) 2023 2022 2021\nNet income available to common stockholders $ 175,057 $ 256,412 $ 271,109\nAverage common shares outstanding 126,338 123,958 109,577\nAverage potential dilutive common shares 438 512 621\nAverage diluted common shares 126,776 124,470 110,198\nBasic earnings per share $ 1.39 $ 2.07 $ 2.47\nDiluted earnings per share $ 1.38 $ 2.06 $ 2.46\nThere were 410,490 stock options excluded from the year ended December 31, 2023 earnings per share calculation due to the related stock option exercise\nprice exceeding the average market price of the Company’s stock. There were no stock options excluded from the earnings per share calculations for the\nyears ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 due to the average market price of the Company’s stock exceeding the related stock option exercise price.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company has adopted various stock-based compensation plans. The plans provide for the grant of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options,\nstock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance stock units. Pursuant to the plans, shares are reserved for future\nissuance by the Company, upon exercise of stock options or awarding of performance or bonus shares granted to directors, officers and other key\nemployees. In accordance with ASC Topic 718, &RPSHQVDWLRQ\u0003±\u00036WRFN\u0003&RPSHQVDWLRQ, the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant\nusing the Black-Scholes option-pricing model that uses various assumptions. This model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, changes to\nwhich can materially affect the fair value estimate. For additional information, see Note 15, Employee Benefit Plans.\n85\nNOTE 2: ACQUISITIONS\nSpirit of Texas Bancshares, Inc.\nOn April 8, 2022, the Company completed its merger with Spirit of Texas Bancshares, Inc. (“Spirit”) pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of\nMerger dated as of November 18, 2021 (“Spirit Agreement”), at which time Spirit merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the\nsurviving corporation. The Company issued 18,275,074 shares of its common stock valued at approximately $464.9 million as of April 8, 2022, plus\n$1,393,508.90 in cash, in exchange for all outstanding shares of Spirit capital stock (and common stock equivalents) to effect the merger.\nPrior to the acquisition, Spirit, headquartered in Conroe, Texas, conducted banking business through its subsidiary bank, Spirit of Texas Bank SSB, from 35\nbranches located primarily in the Texas Triangle - consisting of Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, San Antonio and Austin metropolitan areas - with additional\nlocations in the Bryan-College Station, Corpus Christi and Tyler metropolitan areas, along with offices in North Central and South Texas. Including the\neffects of the acquisition method accounting adjustments, the Company acquired approximately $3.11 billion in assets, including approximately\n$2.29 billion in loans (inclusive of loan discounts), and approximately $2.72 billion in deposits.\nGoodwill of $174.1 million was recorded as a result of the transaction. The merger strengthened the Company’s position in the Texas market and brought\nforth additional opportunities in the Company’s current footprint, which gave rise to the goodwill recorded.

Otherwise, the\ncarrying amount of these assets was deemed to be a reasonable estimate of fair value.\n89\n/RDQV\u0003DFTXLUHG – Fair values for loans were based on a discounted cash flow methodology that considered factors including the type of loan and related\ncollateral, classification status, fixed or variable interest rate, term of loan and whether or not the loan was amortizing, and current discount rates. The\ndiscount rates used for loans are based on current market rates for new originations of comparable loans and include adjustments for liquidity concerns. The\ndiscount rate does not include a factor for credit losses as that has been included in the estimated cash flows. Loans were grouped together according to\nsimilar characteristics and were treated in the aggregate when applying various valuation techniques. See Note 5, Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses,\nin the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to purchased financial assets with credit deterioration.\n3UHPLVHV\u0003DQG\u0003HTXLSPHQW – Bank premises and equipment were acquired with an adjustment to fair value, which represents the difference between the\nCompany’s current analysis of property and equipment values completed in connection with the acquisition and book value acquired.\n%DQN\u0003RZQHG\u0003OLIH\u0003LQVXUDQFH – Bank owned life insurance is carried at its current cash surrender value, which is the most reasonable estimate of fair value.\n*RRGZLOO – The consideration paid as a result of the acquisition exceeded the fair value of the assets acquired, resulting in an intangible asset, goodwill.\nGoodwill established prior to the acquisitions, if applicable, was written off.\n&RUH\u0003GHSRVLW\u0003LQWDQJLEOH – This intangible asset represents the value of the relationships that the acquired banks had with their deposit customers. The fair\nvalue of this intangible asset was estimated based on a discounted cash flow methodology that gave appropriate consideration to expected customer\nattrition rates, cost of the deposit base and the net maintenance cost attributable to customer deposits. Any core deposit intangible established prior to the\nacquisitions, if applicable, was written off.\n2WKHU\u0003DVVHWV – The fair value adjustment results from certain assets whose value was estimated to be more or less than book value, such as certain prepaid\nassets, receivables and other miscellaneous assets. Otherwise, the carrying amount of these assets was deemed to be a reasonable estimate of fair value.\n'HSRVLWV – The fair values used for the demand and savings deposits that comprise the transaction accounts acquired, by definition equal the amount\npayable on demand at the acquisition date. The Company performed a fair value analysis of the estimated weighted average interest rate of the certificates\nof deposits compared to the current market rates and recorded a fair value adjustment for the difference when material.\n6HFXULWLHV\u0003VROG\u0003XQGHU\u0003DJUHHPHQW\u0003WR\u0003UHSXUFKDVH – The carrying amount of securities sold under agreement to repurchase is a reasonable estimate of fair value\nbased on the short-term nature of these liabilities.\n\u0003\n2WKHU\u0003ERUURZLQJV – The fair value of other borrowings is estimated based on borrowing rates currently available to the Company for borrowings with\nsimilar terms and maturities.\n6XERUGLQDWHG\u0003GHEHQWXUHV\u0003± The fair value of subordinated debentures is estimated based on borrowing rates currently available to the Company for\nborrowings with similar terms and maturities.\n$FFUXHG\u0003LQWHUHVW\u0003DQG\u0003RWKHU\u0003OLDELOLWLHV – The fair value adjustment results from certain liabilities whose value was estimated to be more or less than book\nvalue, such as certain accounts payable and other miscellaneous liabilities. The adjustment also establishes a liability for unfunded commitments equal to\nthe fair value of that liability at the date of acquisition. The carrying amount of accrued interest and the remainder of other liabilities was deemed to be a\nreasonable estimate of fair value.\n90\nNOTE 3: INVESTMENT SECURITIES\nHeld-to-maturity (“HTM”) securities, which include any security for which the Company has both the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity, are\ncarried at historical cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. Premiums and discounts are amortized and accreted,\nrespectively, to interest income using the constant effective yield method over the security’s estimated life. Prepayments are anticipated for mortgage-\nbacked and SBA securities. Premiums on callable securities are amortized to their earliest call date.\nAvailable-for-sale (“AFS”) securities, which include any security for which the Company has no immediate plan to sell but which may be sold in the\nfuture, are carried at fair value. Realized gains and losses, based on specifically identified amortized cost of the individual security, are included in other\nincome. Unrealized gains and losses are recorded, net of related income tax effects, in stockholders’ equity, further discussed below. Premiums and\ndiscounts are amortized and accreted, respectively, to interest income using the constant effective yield method over the estimated life of the security.\nPrepayments are anticipated for mortgage-backed and SBA securities. Premiums on callable securities are amortized to their earliest call date.\nDuring the quarters ended June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, the Company transferred, at fair value, $1.99 billion and $500.8 million, respectively, of\nsecurities from the AFS portfolio to the HTM portfolio. As of December 31, 2023, the related remaining combined net unrealized losses of $126.4 million\nin accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) will be amortized over the remaining life of the securities.

A portion of the unrealized losses were related to the Company’s MBS, which are issued\nand guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored entities and agencies, and the Company’s state and political subdivision securities, specifically investments\nin insured fixed rate municipal bonds for which the issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments under the contractual terms of the\nsecurities.\n92\nFurthermore, the decline in fair value for each of the above AFS securities is attributable to the rates for those investments yielding less than current market\nrates. Management does not believe any of the securities are impaired due to reasons of credit quality. Management believes the declines in fair value for\nthe securities are temporary. Management does not have the immediate intent to sell the securities, and management believes the accounting standard of\n“more likely than not” has not been met regarding whether the Company would be required to sell any of the AFS securities before recovery of amortized\ncost.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nAll MBS held by the Company are issued by U.S. government-sponsored entities and agencies. These securities are either explicitly or implicitly\nguaranteed by the U.S. government, are highly rated by major rating agencies and have a long history of no credit losses. Accordingly, no allowance for\ncredit losses has been recorded for these securities.\nRegarding securities issued by state and political subdivisions and other HTM securities, the adequacy of the reserve for credit loss is determined quarterly\nbased on methodology similar to the methodology for determining the allowance for credit losses on loans. The methodology considers, but is not limited\nto: (i) issuer bond ratings, (ii) issuer geography, (iii) whether issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments under the contractual terms of\nthe securities, (iv) probability-weighted multiple scenario forecasts, and (v) the issuers’ size.\nThe following table details activity in the allowance for credit losses by investment security type for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 on the\nCompany’s HTM and AFS securities held.\nState and Political\n(In thousands) Subdivisions Other Securities Total\nDecember 31, 2023\nHeld-to-maturity\nBeginning balance, January 1, 2023 $ 110 $ 1,278 $ 1,388\nProvision for credit loss expense 824 1,002 1,826\nNet increase (decrease) in allowance on previously impaired securities 1,072 (1,072) —\nEnding balance, December 31, 2023 $ 2,006 $ 1,208 $ 3,214\nAvailable-for-sale\nBeginning balance, January 1, 2023 $ — $ — $ —\nProvision for credit loss expense — 12,800 12,800\nReduction due to sales — (2,078) (2,078)\nSecurities charged-off — (7,000) (7,000)\nNet decrease in allowance on previously impaired securities — (3,722) (3,722)\nEnding balance, December 31, 2023 $ — $ — $ —\nDecember 31, 2022\nHeld-to-maturity\nBeginning balance, January 1, 2022 $ 1,197 $ 82 $ 1,279\nProvision for credit loss expense — — —\nNet increase (decrease) in allowance on previously impaired securities (1,180) 1,180 —\nRecoveries 93 16 109\nEnding balance, December 31, 2022 $ 110 $ 1,278 $ 1,388\nBased upon the Company’s analysis of the underlying risk characteristics of its AFS portfolio, including credit ratings and other qualitative factors, as\npreviously discussed, the provision for credit losses related to AFS securities recorded during the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 was\n$9.1 million.

Accordingly, no allowance for credit losses has been recorded for these securities as there is\nno current expectation of credit losses related to these securities.\nIncome earned on securities for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, is as follows:\n(In thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nTaxable:\nHeld-to-maturity $ 44,093 $ 33,778 $ 4,208\nAvailable-for-sale 99,085 60,659 54,768\nNon-taxable:\nHeld-to-maturity 40,612 36,516 16,047\nAvailable-for-sale 23,128 27,250 36,670\nTotal $ 206,918 $ 158,203 $ 111,693\nThe amortized cost and estimated fair value by maturity of securities are shown in the following table as of December 31, 2023.

No securities were sold during 2022. Securities sold in 2023 were in large part related to a strategic decision by the Company to sell low yield\nsecurities and use the proceeds to pay off higher rate wholesale fundings, including both brokered deposits and Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”)\nadvances, while the securities sold during 2021 were part of a strategic plan to realize gains on securities with projected calls within the short-term period.\nThe net losses on the sale and call of securities in 2023 and 2022 as compared to 2021 reflect the rising interest rate environment experienced over the\ncomparative period. There were no gross realized gains and approximately $20.6 million of gross realized losses from the sale of securities during the year\nended December 31, 2023. There were approximately $46,000 of gross realized gains and $324,000 of gross realized losses from the call of securities\nduring the year ended December 31, 2022. There were approximately $15.9 million of gross realized gains and $422,000 of gross realized losses from the\nsale of securities during the year ended December 31, 2021. The income tax expense/benefit related to security gains/losses was 26.135% of the gross\namounts in 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nThe Company has entered into various fair value hedging transactions to mitigate the impact of changing interest rates on the fair value of AFS securities.\nSee Note 21, Derivative Instruments, for disclosure of the gains and losses recognized on derivative instruments and the cumulative fair value hedging\nadjustments to the carrying amount of the hedged securities.\nNOTE 4: OTHER ASSETS AND OTHER LIABILITIES HELD FOR SALE\nIllinois Branch Sale\nOn November 30, 2020, Simmons Bank entered into a Branch Purchase and Assumption Agreement (the “Citizens Equity Agreement”) with Citizens\nEquity First Credit Union (“CEFCU”).\nOn March 12, 2021, CEFCU completed its purchase of certain assets and assumption of certain liabilities (the “Illinois Branch Sale”) associated with four\nSimmons Bank locations in the Metro East area of Southern Illinois, near St. Louis (collectively, the “Illinois Branches”). Pursuant to the terms of the\nCitizens Equity Agreement, CEFCU assumed certain deposit liabilities and acquired certain loans, as well as cash, personal property and other fixed assets\nassociated with the Illinois Branches. The loan and deposit balances of the Illinois Branches were $354,000 and $137.9 million, respectively.\nDuring 2021, the Company recognized a gain on sale of $5.3 million related to the Illinois Branches.\nSpirit Acquisition\nIn connection with the acquisition of Spirit, the Company acquired a portfolio of loans which were identified as held for sale by the acquired bank prior to\nthe completion of the acquisition. These loans were valued at $35.2 million, net of fair value discounts, at the date of acquisition with no remaining balance\nas of December 31, 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2023, there were no outstanding other assets and other liabilities held for sale.\n95\nNOTE 5: LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company’s loan portfolio was $16.85 billion, compared to $16.14 billion at December 31, 2022. The various categories of loans\nare summarized as follows:\n(In thousands) 2023 2022\nConsumer:\nCredit cards $ 191,204 $ 196,928\nOther consumer 127,462 152,882\nTotal consumer 318,666 349,810\nReal estate:\nConstruction and development 3,144,220 2,566,649\nSingle family residential 2,641,556 2,546,115\nOther commercial 7,552,410 7,468,498\nTotal real estate 13,338,186 12,581,262\nCommercial:\nCommercial 2,490,176 2,632,290\nAgricultural 232,710 205,623\nTotal commercial 2,722,886 2,837,913\nOther 465,932 373,139\nTotal loans $ 16,845,670 $ 16,142,124\nThe above table presents total loans at amortized cost. The difference between amortized cost and unpaid principal balance is primarily premiums and\ndiscounts associated with acquisition date fair value adjustments on acquired loans as well as deferred origination costs and fees totaling $6.7 million and\n$26.4 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAccrued interest on loans, which is excluded from the amortized cost of loans held for investment, totaled $77.1 million and $65.4 million at December 31,\n2023 and 2022, respectively, and is included in interest receivable on the consolidated balance sheets.\n/RDQ\u00032ULJLQDWLRQ\u00125LVN\u00030DQDJHPHQW – The Company seeks to manage its credit risk by diversifying its loan portfolio, determining that borrowers have\nadequate sources of cash flow for loan repayment without liquidation of collateral; obtaining and monitoring collateral; and providing an adequate\nallowance for credit losses by regularly reviewing loans through the internal loan review process. The loan portfolio is diversified by borrower, purpose and\nindustry. The Company seeks to use diversification within the loan portfolio to reduce its credit risk, thereby minimizing the adverse impact on the\nportfolio if weaknesses develop in either the economy or a particular segment of borrowers. Collateral requirements are based on credit assessments of\nborrowers and may be used to recover the debt in case of default.\n&RQVXPHU – The consumer loan portfolio consists of credit card loans and other consumer loans. Credit card loans are diversified by geographic region to\nreduce credit risk and minimize any adverse impact on the portfolio. Although they are regularly reviewed to facilitate the identification and monitoring of\ncreditworthiness, credit card loans are unsecured loans, making them more susceptible to economic downturns that result in increased\nunemployment. Other consumer loans include direct installment loans and account overdrafts. Loans in this portfolio segment are sensitive to\nunemployment and other key consumer economic measures.\n5HDO\u0003HVWDWH – The real estate loan portfolio consists of construction and development loans (“C&D”), single family residential loans and commercial\nloans. C&D and commercial real estate (“CRE”) loans can be particularly sensitive to valuation of real estate. CRE cycles are inevitable. The long planning\nand production process for new properties and rapid shifts in business conditions and employment create an inherent tension between supply and demand\nfor commercial properties. While general economic trends often move individual markets in the same direction over time, the timing and magnitude of\nchanges are determined by other forces unique to each market. CRE cycles tend to be local in nature and longer than other credit cycles. Factors\ninfluencing the CRE market are traditionally different from those affecting residential real estate markets; thereby making predictions for one market based\non the other difficult. Additionally, submarkets within CRE – such as office, industrial, apartment, retail and hotel – also experience different cycles,\nproviding an opportunity to lower the overall risk through diversification across types of CRE loans. Management realizes that local demand and supply\nconditions will also mean that different geographic areas will experience cycles of different amplitude and length. The Company monitors these loans\nclosely.\n96\n&RPPHUFLDO – The commercial loan portfolio includes commercial and agricultural loans, representing loans to commercial customers and farmers for use\nin normal business or farming operations to finance working capital needs, equipment purchases or other expansion projects. Paycheck Protection Program\n(“PPP”) loans are also included in the commercial loan portfolio. Collection risk in this portfolio is driven by the creditworthiness of the underlying\nborrowers, particularly cash flow from customers’ business or farming operations. The Company continues its efforts to keep loan terms short, reducing the\nnegative impact of upward movement in interest rates. Term loans are generally set up with one or three year balloons, and the Company has instituted a\npricing mechanism for commercial loans. It is standard practice to require personal guaranties on commercial loans for closely-held or limited liability\nentities.\n3D\\FKHFN\u00033URWHFWLRQ\u00033URJUDP\u0003/RDQV\u0003\u0010\u0003The Company originated loans pursuant to multiple PPP appropriations of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and\nEconomic Security Act which provided 100% federally guaranteed loans for small businesses to cover up to 24 weeks of payroll costs and assistance with\nmortgage interest, rent and utilities. Notably, these small business loans may be forgiven by the SBA if borrowers maintain their payrolls and satisfy certain\nother conditions. PPP loans have a zero percent risk-weight for regulatory capital ratios. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the total outstanding balance\nof PPP loans was $4.8 million and $8.9 million, respectively.\n2WKHU – The other loan portfolio includes mortgage warehouse loans, representing warehouse lines of credit to mortgage originators for the disbursement of\nnewly originated 1-4 family residential loans. Also included in the other loan portfolio are loans to public sector customers, including state and local\ngovernments.\n1RQDFFUXDO\u0003DQG\u00033DVW\u0003'XH\u0003/RDQV – Loans are considered past due if the required principal and interest payments have not been received as of the date such\npayments were due. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when, in management’s opinion, the borrower may be unable to meet payment obligations as\nthey become due, as well as when required by regulatory provisions. Loans may be placed on nonaccrual status regardless of whether or not such loans are\nconsidered past due. When interest accrual is discontinued, all unpaid accrued interest is reversed. Interest income is subsequently recognized only to the\nextent cash payments are received in excess of principal due. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually\ndue are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.\nThe amortized cost basis of nonaccrual loans segregated by class of loans are as follows:\n(In thousands) 2023 2022\nConsumer:\nCredit cards $ 487 $ 349\nOther consumer 589 433\nTotal consumer 1,076 782\nReal estate:\nConstruction and development 2,457 2,799\nSingle family residential 27,209 22,319\nOther commercial 11,960 14,998\nTotal real estate 41,626 40,116\nCommercial:\nCommercial 39,886 17,356\nAgricultural 734 177\nTotal commercial 40,620 17,533\nOther 3 3\nTotal $ 83,325 $ 58,434\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, nonaccrual loans for which there was no related allowance for credit losses had an amortized cost of $3.2 million and\n$16.9 million, respectively.

Modifications to borrowers experiencing financial\ndifficulties may include interest rate reductions, principal or interest forgiveness and/or term extensions. The Company primarily uses interest rate\nreduction and/or payment modifications or extensions, with an occasional forgiveness of principal.\nThe following table presents a summary of the amortized cost basis of loan modifications granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, segregated\nby class of loans and type of loan modification, for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nPercent of Percent of\nTotal Class Total Class\n(Dollars in thousands) Rate Reduction of Loans Term Extension of Loans\nReal estate:\nSingle family residential $ 79 — %$ — — %\nOther commercial — — % 30,493 0.40 %\nTotal real estate 79 30,493\nCommercial:\nCommercial — — % 746 0.03 %\nTotal commercial — 746\nTotal $ 79 $ 31,239\nThe financial effects of the modified loans made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty in the single family residential real estate and commercial\nportfolio were not significant during the year ended December 31, 2023 and did not significantly impact the Company’s determination of the allowance for\ncredit losses on loans during the year.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company modified one loan for a borrower experiencing financial difficulty related to the CRE portfolio,\nwhereby the modification allowed for two months of interest only payments with the remaining balance due at maturity. Upon modification, a charge-off of\n$9.6 million was recorded in relation to this modified loan during 2023. As a result of this CRE loan modified during the year ended December 31, 2023\nbeing collateral-dependent, the impact to the Company’s allowance for credit losses on loans was the difference between the fair value of the underlying\ncollateral, adjusted for selling costs, and the remaining outstanding principal balance of the loan.\nThe Company closely monitors the performance of loans that are modified to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. Loans modified during the year\nended December 31, 2023 were all current at December 31, 2023, with no loans in past due status. Additionally, there were no modified loans for which a\npayment default occurred during the year ended December 31, 2023 and were modified within twelve months prior to default. In relation to loans modified\nto borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, the Company defines a payment default as a payment received more than 90 days after its due date.\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had $2.5 million and $3.0 million, respectively, of consumer mortgage loans secured by residential real\nestate properties for which formal foreclosure proceedings are in process. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had $506,000 and $853,000,\nrespectively, of OREO secured by residential real estate properties.\n7URXEOHG\u0003'HEW\u00035HVWUXFWXULQJV\u0003 3ULRU\u0003WR\u0003WKH\u0003DGRSWLRQ\u0003RI\u0003$68\u0003\u0015\u0013\u0015\u0015\u0010\u0013\u0015\nWhen the Company restructured a loan to a borrower that was experiencing financial difficulty and granted a concession that it would not otherwise\nconsider, a “troubled debt restructuring” (“TDR”) resulted, and the Company classified the loan as a TDR. The Company granted various types of\nconcessions, primarily interest rate reduction and/or payment modifications or extensions, with an occasional forgiveness of principal.\nOnce an obligation was restructured because of such credit problems, it continued to be considered a TDR until paid in full; or, if an obligation yielded a\nmarket interest rate and no longer has any concession regarding payment amount or amortization, then it was not considered a TDR at the beginning of the\ncalendar year after the year in which the improvement had taken place. The Company returned TDRs to accrual status only if (1) all contractual amounts\ndue were reasonably expected to be repaid within a prudent period and (2) repayment was in accordance with the contract for a sustained period, typically\nat least six months.\n99\nTDRs were individually evaluated for expected credit losses. The Company assessed the exposure for each modification, either by the fair value of the\nunderlying collateral or the present value of expected cash flows, and determined if a specific allowance for credit losses was needed.\nThe following table presents a summary of TDRs segregated by class of loans as of December 31, 2022.\nAccruing TDR Loans Nonaccrual TDR Loans Total TDR Loans\n(Dollars in thousands) Number Balance Number Balance Number Balance\nDecember 31, 2022\nReal estate:\nSingle-family residential 24 $ 1,849 12 $ 1,589 36 $ 3,438\nTotal real estate 24 1,849 12 1,589 36 3,438\nCommercial:\nCommercial — — 1 33 1 33\nTotal commercial — — 1 33 1 33\nTotal 24 $ 1,849 13 $ 1,622 37 $ 3,471\nThe following table presents loans that were restructured as TDRs during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nModification Type\nFinancial\nBalance Change in Impact\nNumber of Prior Balance at Maturity Change in on Date of\n(Dollars in thousands) Loans to TDR December 31, Date Rate Restructure\nYear Ended December 31, 2022\nReal estate:\nSingle-family residential 4 $ 760 $ 730 $ — $ 730 $ —\nTotal real estate 4 $ 760 $ 730 $ — $ 730 $ —\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company modified four loans with a recorded investment of $760,000 prior to modification which were\ndeemed TDRs. The restructured loans were modified by reducing the interest rate on the loan. No specific reserve was recorded with respect to these\nTDRs. Also, there was no immediate financial impact from the restructuring of these loans, as it was not considered necessary to charge-off interest or\nprincipal on the date of restructure.\nAdditionally, there was one loan with an outstanding balance of $7,800 considered a TDR for which a payment default occurred during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. The Company defines a payment default as a payment received more than 90 days after its due date.\nThere were no TDRs with pre-modification loan balances for which OREO was received in full or partial satisfaction of the loans during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022.\n100\n&UHGLW\u00034XDOLW\\\u0003,QGLFDWRUV – As part of the on-going monitoring of the credit quality of the Company’s loan portfolio, management tracks certain credit\nquality indicators including trends related to (i) the weighted-average risk rating of commercial and real estate loans, (ii) the level of classified commercial\nand real estate loans, (iii) net charge-offs, (iv) non-performing loans (see details above) and (v) the general economic conditions of the Company’s local\nmarkets.\nThe Company utilizes a risk rating matrix to assign a risk rate to each of its commercial and real estate loans. Risk ratings are updated on an ongoing basis\nand are subject to change by continuous loan monitoring processes including lending management monitoring, executive management and board\ncommittee oversight, and independent credit review. A description of the general characteristics of the risk ratings is as follows:\n• 3DVV\u0003 ([FHOOHQW – This category includes loans which are virtually free of credit risk. Borrowers in this category represent the highest credit quality\nand greatest financial strength.\n• 3DVV\u0003 *RRG - Loans under this category possess a nominal risk of default. This category includes borrowers with strong financial strength and superior\nfinancial ratios and trends. These loans are generally fully secured by cash or equivalents (other than those rated “excellent”).\n• 3DVV\u0003 $FFHSWDEOH\u0003±\u0003$YHUDJH - Loans in this category are considered to possess a normal level of risk. Borrowers in this category have satisfactory\nfinancial strength and adequate cash flow coverage to service debt requirements. If secured, the perfected collateral should be of acceptable quality and\nwithin established borrowing parameters.\n• 3DVV\u0003 0RQLWRU - Loans in the Watch (Monitor) category exhibit an overall acceptable level of risk, but that risk may be increased by certain conditions,\nwhich represent “red flags”. These “red flags” require a higher level of supervision or monitoring than the normal “Pass” rated credit. The borrower\nmay be experiencing these conditions for the first time, or it may be recovering from weakness, which at one time justified a higher rating. These\nconditions may include: weaknesses in financial trends; marginal cash flow; one-time negative operating results; non-compliance with policy or\nborrowing agreements; poor diversity in operations; lack of adequate monitoring information or lender supervision; questionable management\nability/stability.\n• 6SHFLDO\u00030HQWLRQ - A loan in this category has potential weaknesses that deserve management’s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential\nweaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the institution’s credit position at some future date. Special\nMention loans are not adversely classified (although they are “criticized”) and do not expose an institution to sufficient risk to warrant adverse\nclassification. Borrowers may be experiencing adverse operating trends or an ill-proportioned balance sheet. Non-financial characteristics of a Special\nMention rating may include management problems, pending litigation, a non-existent or ineffective loan agreement or other material structural\nweakness, and/or other significant deviation from prudent lending practices.\n 6XEVWDQGDUG - A Substandard loan is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral\npledged, if any. Loans so classified must have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses, that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. The loans are\ncharacterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. This does not imply ultimate loss\nof the principal, but may involve burdensome administrative expenses and the accompanying cost to carry the loan.\n• 'RXEWIXO - A loan classified Doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in a substandard loan except that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation\nin full (on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values) highly questionable and improbable. Doubtful borrowers are usually in default,\nlack adequate liquidity or capital, and lack the resources necessary to remain an operating entity. The possibility of loss is extremely high, but because\nof specific pending events that may strengthen the asset, its classification as loss is deferred. Pending factors include: proposed merger or acquisition;\nliquidation procedures; capital injection; perfection of liens on additional collateral; and refinancing plans. Loans classified as Doubtful are placed on\nnonaccrual status.\n /RVV - Loans classified Loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as bankable assets is not warranted. This\nclassification does not mean that the loans has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off this\nbasically worthless loan, even though partial recovery may be affected in the future. Borrowers in the Loss category are often in bankruptcy, have\nformally suspended debt repayments, or have otherwise ceased normal business operations. Loans should be classified as Loss and charged-off in the\nperiod in which they become uncollectible.\n101\nThe Company monitors credit quality in the consumer portfolio by delinquency status. The delinquency status of loans is updated daily. A description of\nthe delinquency credit quality indicators is as follows:\n• &XUUHQW\u0003- Loans in this category are either current in payments or are under 30 days past due. These loans are considered to have a normal level of risk.\n• \u0016\u0013\u0010\u001b \u0003'D\\V\u00033DVW\u0003'XH - Loans in this category are between 30 and 89 days past due and are subject to the Company’s loss mitigation process. These\nloans are considered to have a moderate level of risk.\n• \u0013\u000e\u0003'D\\V\u00033DVW\u0003'XH - Loans in this category are 90 days or more past due and are placed on nonaccrual status. These loans have been subject to the\nCompany’s loss mitigation process and foreclosure and/or charge-off proceedings have commenced.\nThe Company uses a dual risk rating scale that utilizes quantitative models and qualitative factors (“score cards”) to assist in determining the appropriate\nrisk rating for its commercial loans. This dual risk rating methodology incorporates a “probability of default” analysis which utilizes quantified metrics\nsuch as loan terms and financial performance, as well as a “loss given default” analysis which utilizes collateral values and economics of the market,\namong other attributes. Model outputs are reviewed and analyzed to ensure the projected risk levels are commensurate with underwriting and credit leader\nexpectations. The risk rating scale includes Probability of Default levels of 1 – 16 and Loss Given Default levels of A – I. The scale allows for more\ngranular recognition of risk and diversification of grading among traditional Pass grades.\nThe following is a reconciliation between the expanded risk rating scale and the Company’s traditional risk rating segments utilized within the commercial\nloan classes presented in the credit quality indicator tables.\n• 3DVV - Includes loans with an expanded risk rating of 1 through 11. Loans with a risk rating of 10 and 11 equate to loans included on management’s\n“watch list” and is intended to be utilized on a temporary basis for pass grade borrowers where a significant risk-modifying action is anticipated in the\nnear term.\n• 6SHFLDO\u00030HQWLRQ -

The allowance, in the judgment of management, is necessary to reserve for expected loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio. The\nCompany’s allowance for credit loss methodology includes reserve factors calculated to estimate current expected credit losses to amortized cost balances\nover the remaining contractual life of the portfolio, adjusted for prepayments, in accordance with ASC Topic 326-20, )LQDQFLDO\u0003,QVWUXPHQWV\u0003\u0010\u0003&UHGLW\n/RVVHV. Accordingly, the methodology is comprised of two components: individual assessments on loans with unique risk characteristics and collective\nassessments for loans that share similar risk characteristics. Loans with similar risk characteristics such as loan type, collateral type, and internal risk\nratings are aggregated for collective assessment. The Company uses statistically-based models that leverage assumptions about current and future economic\nconditions throughout the contractual life of the loan. Expected credit losses are estimated by either lifetime loss rates or expected loss cash flows based on\nthree key parameters: probability-of-default (“PD”), exposure-at-default (“EAD”), and loss-given-default (“LGD”). Future economic conditions are\nincorporated to the extent that they are reasonable and supportable. Beyond the reasonable and supportable periods, the economic variables revert to a\nhistorical equilibrium at a pace dependent on the state of the economy reflected within the economic scenarios. To determine the best estimate of credit\nlosses as of December 31, 2023, the Company utilized a probability-weighted, multiple-scenario approach consisting of Baseline, Upside (S1), and\nDownside (S3) scenarios published by Moody’s Analytics in December 2023 that was updated to reflect the U.S. economic outlook. The Company also\nincludes qualitative adjustments to the allowance based on factors and considerations that have not otherwise been fully accounted for. These factors may\ninclude but are not limited to portfolio trends and considerations, other economic considerations, policy actions, concentration risk, or imprecision risk.\nLoans with similar risk characteristics such as loan type, collateral type, and internal risk ratings are aggregated into homogeneous segments for\nassessment. Reserve factors are based on estimated probability of default and loss given default for each segment. The estimates are determined based on\neconomic forecasts over the reasonable and supportable forecast period based on projected performance of economic variables that have a statistical\nrelationship with the historical loss experience of the segments.\nLoans that have unique risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. These evaluations are typically performed on loans with a deteriorated\ninternal risk rating. For a collateral-dependent loan, the Company’s evaluation process includes a valuation by appraisal or other collateral analysis adjusted\nfor selling costs, when appropriate. This valuation is compared to the remaining outstanding principal balance of the loan. If a loss is determined to be\nprobable, the loss is included in the allowance for credit losses as a specific allocation.\nLoans for which the repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of collateral and where the borrower is experiencing\nfinancial difficulty had an amortized cost of $144.6 million and $70.9 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, as further detailed in the\ntable below.

The provision expense for the period ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to the loan growth experienced during\nthe period, as well as the impact of updated economic assumptions.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, provision expense related to loans was recaptured during the year for a variety of factors including a release of\n$16.0 million driven by improvements in certain industry specific qualitative factors for the restaurant, hospitality, student housing and office space\nindustries due to lower pandemic related stresses. The remaining recapture during 2022 was driven by the planned exit of several large oil and gas\nrelationships during the year, along with the Company’s improved asset credit quality metrics, which combined with improved Moody’s economic\nmodeling scenarios, more than offset the $30.3 million Day 2 provision expense required for loans acquired by the Company in the Spirit acquisition.\n107\n5HVHUYH\u0003IRU\u00038QIXQGHG\u0003&RPPLWPHQWV\nIn addition to the allowance for credit losses, the Company has established a reserve for unfunded commitments, classified in other liabilities.

The reserve for unfunded\ncommitments was $25.6 million and $41.9 million, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 respectively. The adequacy of the reserve for unfunded\ncommitments is determined quarterly based on methodology similar to the methodology for determining the allowance for credit losses. During 2023,\n$16.3 million was released from the reserve for unfunded commitments primarily due to a decline in unfunded commitments resulting from customers\nutilizing lines of credit during the year. During 2022, an adjustment to the reserve for unfunded commitments resulted in an expense of $16.0 million due to\nthe overall increase in unfunded commitments, primarily made up of commercial construction loans, which receive a higher reserve allocation than other\nloans. Additionally, an adjustment to the reserve for unfunded commitments resulted in an expense of $3.5 million which was due to the Day 2 provision\nexpense required for unfunded commitments related to the Spirit acquisition. These adjustments were included in the provision for credit losses in the\nstatement of income. No adjustment was made to the reserve for unfunded commitments during 2021 as it was considered sufficient to cover any loss\nexpectations.\n3URYLVLRQ\u0003IRU\u0003&UHGLW\u0003/RVVHV\nProvision for credit losses is determined by the Company as the amount to be added to the allowance for credit loss accounts for various types of financial\ninstruments including loans, securities and off-balance-sheet credit exposure after net charge-offs have been deducted to bring the allowance to a level\nwhich, in management's best estimate, is necessary to absorb expected credit losses over the lives of the respective financial instruments.\nThe components of provision for credit losses for the years ended December 31 were as follows:\n(In thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nProvision for credit losses related to:\nLoans $ 47,424 $ (5,379) $ (31,209)\nUnfunded commitments (16,300) 19,453 —\nSecurities - HTM 1,826 — (1,183)\nSecurities - AFS 9,078 — (312)\nTotal $ 42,028 $ 14,074 $ (32,704)\n3XUFKDVHG\u0003&UHGLW\u0003'HWHULRUDWHG\u0003/RDQV\nPurchased loans that reflect a more-than-insignificant deterioration of credit from origination are considered PCD.

At lease commencement, the lease contract is reviewed to determine whether the contract is a\nfinance lease or an operating lease; a lease liability is recognized on a discounted basis, related to the Company’s obligation to make lease payments; and a\nright-of-use asset is also recognized related to the Company’s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. The Company accounts\nfor lease and non-lease components (such as taxes, insurance and common area maintenance costs) separately as such amounts are generally readily\ndeterminable under the lease contracts. Lease payments over the expected term are discounted using the Company’s FHLB advance rates for borrowings of\nsimilar term. If it is reasonably certain that a renewal or termination option will be exercised, the effects of such options are included in the determination\nof the expected lease term. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; the Company recognizes lease expense\nfor these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nThe Company’s leases are classified as operating leases with a term, including expected renewal or termination options, greater than one year, and are\nrelated to certain office facilities and office equipment. The following table presents information as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 related to the\nCompany’s right-of-use lease assets, included in premises and equipment, and lease liabilities, included in accrued interest and other liabilities.\n(Dollars in thousands) 2023 2022\nRight-of-use lease assets $ 67,267 $ 46,845\nLease liabilities 68,788 47,850\nWeighted average remaining lease term 8.81 years 6.69 years\nWeighted average discount rate 3.52 % 2.41 %\nOperating lease cost for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $15.7 million, $14.2 million, and $11.5 million, respectively.\n109\nThe Company’s remaining undiscounted minimum lease payments on operating leases as of December 31, 2023 are as follows:\nYear (In thousands)\n2024 $ 13,064\n2025 11,212\n2026 10,147\n2027 7,732\n2028 6,792\nThereafter 33,044\nTotal undiscounted minimum lease payments 81,991\nLess: Net present value adjustment 13,203\nLease liability included in other liabilities $ 68,788\nNOTE 7: PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT\nPremises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.

If the implied fair value of goodwill is lower than its\ncarrying amount, goodwill impairment is indicated, and goodwill is written down to its implied fair value. Subsequent increases in goodwill value are not\nrecognized in the financial statements. Goodwill totaled $1.32 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022. Goodwill increased $1.2 million during the year\nended December 31, 2023 primarily due to the continued assessment of the fair value and assumed tax position of the Spirit acquisition.\nGoodwill impairment was neither indicated nor recorded in 2023, 2022 or 2021. During March of 2023, the Company’s share price began to decline as\nmarkets in the United States (“US”) responded to the sudden collapse of two US banks. As a result of the decrease in the Company’s market capitalization,\nthe Company performed an interim goodwill impairment qualitative assessment during the first quarter of 2023 and concluded that it was more likely-than-\nnot that the fair value of goodwill continued to exceed its carrying value and therefore, goodwill was not impaired. During the second quarter of 2023, the\nCompany performed an annual goodwill impairment analysis and concluded that it is more likely-than-not that the fair value of goodwill continues to\nexceed its carrying value and therefore, goodwill was not impaired. Additionally, the Company performed interim goodwill impairment assessments during\nthe third and fourth quarters of 2023 and concluded no impairment existed during the periods.\nDuring 2022, the Company performed an annual goodwill impairment analysis and concluded no impairment existed. Additionally during 2022, the\nCompany’s share price declined as markets in the United States responded to record inflation and other economic pressures. As a result of the effect on\nshare price, the Company performed interim goodwill impairment assessments during the second, third and fourth quarters of 2022 and concluded no\nimpairment existed during the periods.\n110\nWhile the goodwill impairment analysis indicated no impairment at December 31, 2023, the Company’s assessment depends on several assumptions which\nare dependent on market and economic conditions, and future changes in those conditions could impact the Company’s assessment in the future.\nCore deposit premiums represent the value of the relationships that acquired banks had with their deposit customers and are amortized over periods ranging\nfrom 10 years to 15 years and are periodically evaluated, at least annually, as to the recoverability of their carrying value. Other intangible assets represent\nthe value of other acquired relationships, including relationships with trust and wealth management customers, and are being amortized over various\nperiods ranging from 8 years to 15 years.\nChanges in the carrying amount and accumulated amortization of the Company’s core deposit premiums and other intangible assets at December 31, 2023\nand 2022 were as follows:\n(In thousands) 2023 2022\nCore deposit premiums:\nBalance, beginning of year $ 116,016 $ 93,862\nAcquisitions(1) — 36,500\nAmortization (14,672) (14,346)\nBalance, end of year 101,344 116,016\nBooks of business and other intangibles:\nBalance, beginning of year 12,935 12,373\nAcquisitions(2) — 2,131\nAmortization (1,634) (1,569)\nBalance, end of year 11,301 12,935\nTotal other intangible assets, net $ 112,645 $ 128,951\n_________________________\n(1) A core deposit premium of $36.5 million was recorded during 2022 as part of the Spirit acquisition.

Benefits from tax positions should be recognized in the\nfinancial statements only when it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority that\nwould have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured at the largest\namount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Tax positions that previously failed to meet the more-\nlikely-than-not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Previously\nrecognized tax positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be derecognized in the first subsequent financial\nreporting period in which that threshold is no longer met. ASC Topic 740 also provides guidance on the accounting for and disclosure of unrecognized tax\nbenefits, interest and penalties. The Company has no history of expiring net operating loss carryforwards and is projecting significant pre-tax and financial\ntaxable income in future years. The Company expects to fully realize its deferred tax assets in the future.\nThe amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease in the future for various reasons including adding amounts for current tax year positions,\nexpiration of open income tax returns due to the statutes of limitation, changes in management’s judgment about the level of uncertainty, status of\nexaminations, litigation and legislative activity and the addition or elimination of uncertain tax positions.\nSection 382 of the Internal Revenue Code imposes an annual limit on the ability of a corporation that undergoes an “ownership change” to use its U.S. net\noperating losses to reduce its tax liability. The Company has engaged in four tax-free reorganization transactions in which acquired net operating losses are\nlimited pursuant to Section 382. In total, approximately $39.4 million of federal net operating losses subject to the IRC Section 382 annual limitation are\nexpected to be utilized by the Company. All of the acquired net operating loss carryforwards are expected to be fully utilized by 2036.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction. The Company’s U.S. federal income tax returns are open and subject to examinations\nfrom the 2020 tax year and forward. The Company’s various state income tax returns are generally open from the 2020 and later tax return years based on\nindividual state statute of limitations.\nNOTE 11: SECURITIES SOLD UNDER AGREEMENTS TO REPURCHASE\nThe Company utilizes securities sold under agreements to repurchase to facilitate the needs of its customers and to facilitate secured short-term funding\nneeds. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are stated at the amount of cash received in connection with the transaction. The Company monitors\ncollateral levels on a continuous basis. The Company may be required to provide additional collateral based on the fair value of the underlying securities.\nSecurities pledged as collateral under repurchase agreements are maintained with the Company’s safekeeping agents.\nThe gross amount of recognized liabilities for repurchase agreements was $67.6 million and $152.4 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe remaining contractual maturity of the securities sold under agreements to repurchase in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2023 and\n2022 is presented in the following tables.\nRemaining Contractual Maturity of the Agreements\nOvernight and Greater than\n(In thousands) Continuous Up to 30 Days 30-90 Days 90 Days Total\nDecember 31, 2023\nRepurchase agreements:\nU.S. Government agencies $ 67,569 $ — $ — $ — $ 67,569\nDecember 31, 2022\nRepurchase agreements:\nU.S. Government agencies $ 152,403 $ — $ — $ — $ 152,403\n114\nNOTE 12: OTHER BORROWINGS AND SUBORDINATED NOTES AND DEBENTURES\nDebt at December 31, 2023 and 2022 consisted of the following components:\n(In thousands) 2023 2022\nOther Borrowings\nFHLB advances, net of discount, due 2024 to 2033, 4.56% to 5.68%, secured by real estate loans $ 953,222 $ 838,487\nOther long-term debt 19,144 20,809\nTotal other borrowings 972,366 859,296\nSubordinated Notes and Debentures\nSubordinated notes payable, due 4/1/2028, fixed-to-floating rate (fixed rate of 5.00% through 3/31/2023, floating rate\nof 2.15% above the three month LIBOR rate, reset quarterly)(1) 330,000 330,000\nSubordinated notes payable, net of premium adjustments, due 7/31/2030, fixed-to-floating rate (fixed rate of 6.00%\nthrough 7/30/2025, floating rate of 5.92% above the three month SOFR rate, reset quarterly) 37,171 37,285\nUnamortized debt issuance costs (1,030) (1,296)\nTotal subordinated notes and debentures 366,141 365,989\nTotal other borrowings and subordinated debt $ 1,338,507 $ 1,225,285\n_________________________\n(1) The Company transitioned from the three month London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) to the three month Secured Overnight Financing Rate\n(“SOFR”), plus a comparable spread adjustment of 26.16 basis points, beginning with interest accrued on the notes from and after October 1, 2023.\nIn March 2018, the Company issued $330.0 million in aggregate principal amount, of 5.00% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes (“Notes”) at a\npublic offering price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes. The Company incurred $3.6 million in debt issuance costs related to the\noffering during March 2018. The Notes will mature on April 1, 2028 and initially bore interest at a fixed rate of 5.00% per annum, payable semi-annually\nin arrears. From and including April 1, 2023 to, but excluding, the maturity date or the date of earlier redemption, the interest rate resets quarterly to an\nannual interest rate equal to the “then-current three month LIBOR rate” plus 215 basis points, payable quarterly in arrears, and the Company transitioned\nfrom the “then-current three month LIBOR rate” to the “three month SOFR, plus a comparable spread adjustment of 26.16 basis points,” beginning with\ninterest accrued on the Notes from and after October 1, 2023. The Notes will be subordinated in right of payment to the payment of the Company’s other\nexisting and future senior indebtedness, including all of its general creditors. The Notes are obligations of the Company only and are not obligations of, and\nare not guaranteed by, any of its subsidiaries. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes to repay certain outstanding\nindebtedness. The Notes qualify for Tier 2 capital treatment.\nThe Company assumed subordinated debt in an aggregate principal amount, net of premium adjustments, of $37.4 million in connection with the Spirit\nacquisition in April 2022 (the “Spirit Notes”). The Spirit Notes will mature on July 31, 2030, and initially bear interest at a fixed annual rate of 6.00%,\npayable quarterly, in arrears, to, but excluding, July 31, 2025. From and including July 31, 2025, to, but excluding, the maturity date or earlier redemption\ndate, the interest rate will reset quarterly to an interest rate per annum equal to a benchmark rate, which is expected to be the then-current three-month\nSOFR rate, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (provided, that in the event the benchmark rate is less than zero, the benchmark rate\nwill be deemed to be zero) plus 592 basis points, payable quarterly, in arrears.\nThe Company had total FHLB advances of $953.2 million and $838.5 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which are primarily fixed rate,\nfixed term advances, which are due less than one year from origination and therefore are classified as short-term advances by the Company. At\nDecember 31, 2023, the FHLB advances outstanding were secured by mortgage loans and investment securities totaling approximately $6.94 billion and\nthe Company had approximately $5.40 billion of additional advances available from the FHLB.\n115\nDuring the third quarter of 2022, the Company redeemed the five issuances of trust preferred securities which had an outstanding aggregate principal\namount of $56.2 million. The Company recorded a loss of $365,000 related to the early retirement of debt, which represented the unamortized purchase\ndiscounts associated with the previously acquired trust preferred securities. Each of the trusts was a statutory business trust organized for the sole purpose\nof issuing trust securities and investing the proceeds thereof in junior subordinated debentures of the Company, the sole asset of each trust. The preferred\nsecurities of each trust represented preferred beneficial interests in the assets of the respective trusts and were subject to mandatory redemption upon\npayment of the junior subordinated debentures held by the trust. The common securities of each trust were wholly-owned by the Company. The trust\npreferred securities were tax-advantaged issues that qualified for inclusion as Tier 2 capital.\nThe Company’s long-term debt primarily includes subordinated debt and other notes payable. Aggregate annual maturities of long-term debt at\nDecember 31, 2023, are as follows:\nYear (In thousands)\n2024 $ 1,822\n2025 1,822\n2026 1,824\n2027 1,920\n2028 332,210\nThereafter 48,909\nTotal $ 388,507\nNOTE 13: CAPITAL STOCK\nOn February 27, 2009, at a special meeting, the Company’s shareholders approved an amendment to the Articles of Incorporation to establish 40,040,000\nauthorized shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value. On April 27, 2022, the Company’s shareholders approved an amendment to the Company’s Articles\nof Incorporation to remove an $80.0 million cap on the aggregate liquidation preference associated with the preferred stock and increase the number of\nauthorized shares of the Company’s Class A common stock from 175,000,000 to 350,000,000.\nOn October 29, 2019, the Company filed Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (“October Amended Articles”) with the Arkansas Secretary of\nState. The October Amended Articles classified and designated Series D Preferred Stock, Par Value $0.01 Per Share (“Series D Preferred Stock”), out of\nthe Company’s authorized preferred stock. On November 30, 2021, the Company redeemed all of the Series D Preferred Stock, including accrued and\nunpaid dividends. On April 27, 2022, the Company’s shareholders approved an amendment to the Company’s Articles of Incorporation to remove the\nclassification and designation for the Series D Preferred Stock. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no shares of preferred stock issued or\noutstanding.\nOn March 31, 2021, the Company filed a shelf registration with the SEC. The shelf registration statement provides increased flexibility and more efficient\naccess to raise capital from time to time through the sale of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, depository shares, warrants, purchase contracts,\npurchase units, subscription rights, units or a combination thereof, subject to market conditions. Specific terms and prices are determined at the time of any\noffering under a separate prospectus supplement that the Company is required to file with the SEC at the time of the specific offering.\nEffective July 23, 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors approved an amendment to the Company’s stock repurchase program originally established in\nOctober 2019 (“2019 Program”) that increased the amount of the Company’s Class A common stock that may be repurchased under the 2019 Program\nfrom a maximum of $180.0 million to a maximum of $276.5 million and extended the term of the 2019 Program from October 31, 2021, to October 31,\n2022.\nDuring January 2022, the Company substantially exhausted the repurchase capacity under the 2019 Program. As a result, the Company’s Board of\nDirectors authorized a new stock repurchase program in January 2022 (“2022 Program”) under which the Company may repurchase up to $175.0 million of\nits Class A common stock currently issued and outstanding. Because the 2022 Program was set to terminate on January 31, 2024, the Company’s Board of\nDirectors authorized a new stock repurchase program in January 2024 (“2024 Program”) under which the Company may repurchase up to $175.0 million of\nits Class A common stock currently issued and outstanding.\n116\nDuring 2023, the Company repurchased 2,257,049 shares at an average price of $17.72 per share under the 2022 Program. Market conditions and the\nCompany’s capital needs will drive decisions regarding additional, future stock repurchases. During 2022, the Company repurchased 513,725 shares at an\naverage price of $31.25 per share under the 2019 Program and 3,919,037 shares at an average price of $24.26 per share under the 2022 Program,\nrespectively. The 2022 Program repurchases were all completed during the second and third quarters of 2022.\nUnder the 2024 Program, which replaced the 2022 Program, the Company may repurchase shares of its common stock through open market and privately\nnegotiated transactions or otherwise. The timing, pricing, and amount of any repurchases under the 2024 Program will be determined by the Company’s\nmanagement at its discretion based on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, trading volume and market price of the Company’s common stock,\ncorporate considerations, the Company’s working capital and investment requirements, general market and economic conditions, and legal requirements.\nThe 2024 Program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any common stock and may be modified, discontinued, or suspended at any time without\nprior notice. The Company anticipates funding for this 2024 Program to come from available sources of liquidity, including cash on hand and future cash\nflow.\nNOTE 14: TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, Simmons Bank had extensions of credit to executive officers and directors and to companies in which Simmons Bank’s\nexecutive officers or directors were principal owners in the amount of $3.2 million at December 31, 2023 and $3.7 million at December 31, 2022.\n(In thousands) 2023 2022\nBalance, beginning of year $ 3,672 $ 6,216\nNew extensions of credit 100 180\nRepayments (565) (2,724)\nBalance, end of year $ 3,207 $ 3,672\nIn management’s opinion, such loans and other extensions of credit, deposits and vendor contracts (which were not material) were made in the ordinary\ncourse of business and were made on substantially the same terms (including interest rates and collateral) as those prevailing at the time for comparable\ntransactions with unrelated persons or through a competitive bid process. Further, in management’s opinion, these extensions of credit did not involve more\nthan the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features.\n117\nNOTE 15: EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS\nRetirement Plans\nThe Company offers a qualified 401(k) Plan in which the Company makes matching contributions to encourage employees to save money for their\nretirement. The 401(k) Plan covers substantially all employees. Under the terms of the 401(k) Plan, employees may defer a portion of their eligible pay, up\nto the maximum allowed by I.R.S. regulation, and the Company matches 100% of the first 3% of compensation and 50% of the next 2% of compensation\nfor a total match of 4% of eligible pay for each participant who defers 5% or more of his or her eligible pay. Additionally, the Company may make profit-\nsharing contributions to the 401(k) Plan which are allocated among participants based upon 401(k) Plan compensation without regard to participant\ncontributions. Contribution expense to the plan totaled $11.9 million, $13.0 million and $13.9 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe Company also provides deferred compensation agreements with certain active and retired officers. The agreements provide monthly payments of\nretirement compensation for either stated periods or for the life of the participant. There was a $316,000 benefit to income related to the plans for 2023.\nThis benefit was primarily due to a reduction in the present value of the liability resulting from a significant increase in the discount factor used, as\ncompared to previous years. The Company also reversed the accrued unvested liability during 2023 related to a former participant. The charges to income\nfor the plans were $2.2 million for 2022 and $2.7 million for 2021. Such charges reflect the straight-line accrual over the employment period of the present\nvalue of benefits due each participant, as of their full eligibility date, using an appropriate discount factor.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nThe Company established an Employee Stock Purchase Plan in 2015 which generally allows participants to make contributions of up to $25,000 per year,\nfor the purpose of acquiring the Company’s common stock. At the end of each plan year, full shares of the Company’s stock are purchased for each\nemployee based on that employee’s contributions. The Company has issued both general and special stock offerings under the plan. Substantially all\nemployees are eligible for the general stock offering, under which full shares of the Company’s stock are purchased for an amount equal to 95% of their\nfair market value at the end of the plan year, or, if lower, 95% of their fair market value at the beginning of the plan year.\nThe special stock offering is available to substantially all non-highly compensated employees with at least six months of service, and these employees may\nallocate up to $10,000 to this offering. Under the special stock offering, full shares of the Company’s stock are purchased for an amount equal to 85% of\ntheir fair market value at the end of the plan year, or, if lower, 85% of their fair market value at the beginning of the plan year.\nStock-Based Compensation Plans\nThe Company’s Board of Directors has adopted various stock-based compensation plans. The plans provide for the grant of incentive stock options,\nnonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance stock units. Pursuant to the plans,\nshares are reserved for future issuance by the Company upon exercise of stock options or awards of restricted stock, restricted stock units, or performance\nstock units granted to directors, officers and other key employees.\nStock-based compensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards is based on the grant date fair value. For all awards except stock option\nawards, the grant date fair value is the market value per share as of the grant date. For stock option awards, the fair value is estimated at the date of grant\nusing the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. This model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, changes to which can materially affect the\nfair value estimate. Additionally, there may be other factors that would otherwise have a significant effect on the value of employee stock options granted\nbut are not considered by the model. Accordingly, while management believes that the Black-Scholes option-pricing model provides a reasonable estimate\nof fair value, the model does not necessarily provide the best single measure of fair value for the Company’s employee stock options.\n118\nThe fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model that uses various assumptions. Expected\nvolatility is based on historical volatility of the Company’s stock and other factors. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and\nemployee termination within the valuation model. The expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and\nrepresents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is\nbased on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant, and are based partially on historical\nexperience.\nThe table below summarizes the transactions under the Company’s active stock compensation plans at December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, and changes\nduring the years then ended:\nStock Options Non-vested Stock Awards Non-vested Stock Units\nOutstanding Outstanding Outstanding (1)\nWeighted Weighted Weighted\nAverage Average Average\nNumber of Exercise Number of Grant-Date Number of Grant-Date\n(Shares in thousands) Shares Price Shares Fair Value Shares Fair Value\nBalance, December 31, 2020 658 $ 22.48 5 $ 22.35 1,032 $ 24.53\nGranted — — — — 674 28.94\nStock options exercised (185) 22.42 — — — —\nStock awards/units vested (earned) — — (3) 22.48 (434) 25.61\nForfeited/expired — — — — (87) 25.86\nBalance, December 31, 2021 473 22.50 2 22.20 1,185 26.51\nGranted — — — — 719 26.42\nStock options exercised (3) 13.30 — — — —\nStock awards/units vested (earned) — — (2) 22.20 (609) 26.30\nForfeited/expired — — — — (98) 25.68\nBalance, December 31, 2022 470 22.56 — — 1,197 26.63\nGranted — — — — 798 21.15\nStock options exercised (1) 10.65 — — — —\nStock awards/units vested (earned) — — — — (490) 24.73\nForfeited/expired (22) 22.87 — — (232) 24.81\nBalance, December 31, 2023 447 $ 22.56 — $ — 1,273 $ 24.23\nExercisable, December 31, 2023 447 $ 22.56\n_________________________\n(1) All stock units (including performance stock units).\n119\nThe following table summarizes information about stock options under the plans outstanding at December 31, 2023:\nOptions Outstanding Options Exercisable\nWeighted\nAverage Weighted Weighted\nNumber Remainin g Average Number Average\nof Shares Contractual Exercise of Shares Exercise\nRange of Exercise Prices (In thousand s) Life (Years) Price (In thousand s) Price\n$ 20.29 — $ 20.29 47 0.90 $20.29 47 $20.29\n22.20 — 22.20 51 1.24 22.20 51 22.20\n22.75 — 22.75 274 1.46 22.75 274 22.75\n23.51 — 23.51 68 1.89 23.51 68 23.51\n24.07 — 24.07 7 1.71 24.07 7 24.07\n$ 20.29 — $ 24.07 447 1.45 $22.56 447 $22.56\nThe table below summarizes the Company’s performance stock unit activity for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021:\n(In thousands) Performance Stock Units\nNon-vested, December 31, 2020 222\nGranted 171\nVested (earned) (57)\nForfeited (5)\nNon-vested, December 31, 2021 331\nGranted 184\nVested (earned) (149)\nForfeited (14)\nNon-vested, December 31, 2022 352\nGranted 302\nVested (earned) (72)\nForfeited (90)\nNon-vested, December 31, 2023 492\nStock-based compensation expense was $12.2 million in 2023, $15.3 million in 2022 and $15.9 million in 2021. Stock-based compensation expense is\nrecognized ratably over the requisite service period for all stock-based awards. There was no unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to\nstock options at December 31, 2023. Unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to non-vested stock awards and stock units was $14.5\nmillion at December 31, 2023.

The guidance also establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use\nof unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC Topic 820 describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:\n• /HYHO\u0003\u0014\u0003,QSXWV – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n• /HYHO\u0003\u0015\u0003,QSXWV – Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for\nsimilar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for\nsubstantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\n• /HYHO\u0003\u0016\u0003,QSXWV – Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or\nliabilities.\nIn general, fair value is based upon quoted market prices, where available. If such quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally\ndeveloped models that primarily use, as inputs, observable market-based parameters. Valuation adjustments may be made to ensure that financial\ninstruments are recorded at fair value. These adjustments may include amounts to reflect counterparty credit quality and the Company’s creditworthiness,\namong other things, as well as unobservable parameters. Any such valuation adjustments are applied consistently over time. The Company’s valuation\nmethodologies may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. While management\nbelieves the Company’s valuation methodologies are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or\nassumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Furthermore,\nthe reported fair value amounts have not been comprehensively revalued since the presentation dates, and therefore, estimates of fair value after the balance\nsheet date may differ significantly from the amounts presented herein. A more detailed description of the valuation methodologies used for assets and\nliabilities measured at fair value, as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy, is set forth below.\nFollowing is a description of the inputs and valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis and recognized in the\naccompanying consolidated balance sheets, as well as the general classification of such assets pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.\n$YDLODEOH\u0010IRU\u0010VDOH\u0003VHFXULWLHV – Where quoted market prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation\nhierarchy. Level 1 securities would include highly liquid government bonds, mortgage products and certain other financial products. Other securities\nclassified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value utilizing Level 2 inputs. For these securities, the Company obtains fair value measurements from an\nindependent pricing service. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S.\nTreasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the security’s terms and\nconditions, among other things. In order to ensure the fair values are consistent with ASC Topic 820, the Company periodically checks the fair values by\ncomparing them to another pricing source, such as Bloomberg. The availability of pricing confirms Level 2 classification in the fair value hierarchy. The\nthird-party pricing service is subject to an annual review of internal controls. In certain cases where Level 1 or Level 2 inputs are not available, securities\nare classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy. The Company’s investment in U.S. Treasury securities, if any, is reported at fair value utilizing Level 1\ninputs. The remainder of the Company’s available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value utilizing Level 2 inputs.\n0RUWJDJH\u0003ORDQV\u0003KHOG\u0003IRU\u0003VDOH – Mortgage loans held for sale are reported at fair value on an aggregate basis. Adjustments to fair value are recognized\nmonthly and reflected in earnings. In determining the fair value of loans held for sale, the Company may consider outstanding investor commitments,\ndiscounted cash flow analyses with market assumptions or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. Such loans are classified within\neither Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Where assumptions are made using significant unobservable inputs, such loans held for sale are\nclassified as Level 3. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the aggregate fair value of mortgage loans held for sale exceeded their cost.\n'HULYDWLYH\u0003LQVWUXPHQWV – The Company’s derivative instruments are reported at fair value utilizing Level 2 inputs. The Company obtains fair value\nmeasurements from dealer quotes.\n122\nThe following table sets forth the Company’s financial assets by level within the fair value hierarchy that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis\nas of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nFair Value Measurements\nQuoted Prices in\nActive Markets for Significant Other Significant\nIdentical Assets Observable Inputs Unobservable Inputs\n(In thousands) Fair Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nDecember 31, 2023\nAvailable-for-sale securities\nU.S. Treasury $ 2,254 $ 2,254 $ — $ —\nU.S. Government agencies 72,502 — 72,502 —\nMortgage-backed securities 1,940,307 — 1,940,307 —\nState and political subdivisions 902,793 — 902,793 —\nOther securities 234,297 — 234,297 —\nMortgage loans held for sale 9,373 — — 9,373\nDerivative asset 130,271 — 130,271 —\nDerivative liability (27,584) — (27,584) —\nDecember 31, 2022\nAvailable-for-sale securities\nU.S. Treasury $ 2,197 $ 2,197 $ — $ —\nU.S. Government agencies 184,279 — 184,279 —\nMortgage-backed securities 2,542,902 — 2,542,902 —\nState and political subdivisions 871,074 — 871,074 —\nOther securities 252,402 — 252,402 —\nMortgage loans held for sale 3,486 — — 3,486\nDerivative asset 139,323 — 139,323 —\nDerivative liability (34,440) — (34,440) —\nCertain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, the instruments are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis\nbut are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances.

Fair value of the loan is determined by establishing an allowance for credit loss for any exposure based on the valuation of the underlying\ncollateral. The valuation of the collateral is determined by either an independent third-party appraisal or other collateral analysis. Discounts can be made by\nthe Company based upon the overall evaluation of the independent appraisal. Collateral-dependent loans are classified within Level 3 of the fair value\nhierarchy due to the unobservable inputs used in determining their fair value such as collateral values and the borrower’s underlying financial condition.\nCollateral values supporting the individually assessed loans are evaluated quarterly for updates to appraised values or adjustments due to non-current\nvaluations.\n)RUHFORVHG\u0003DVVHWV\u0003DQG\u0003RWKHU\u0003UHDO\u0003HVWDWH\u0003RZQHG – Foreclosed assets and other real estate owned are reported at fair value, less estimated costs to sell. At\nforeclosure, if the fair value, less estimated costs to sell, of the real estate acquired is less than the Company’s recorded investment in the related loan, a\nwrite-down is recognized through a charge to the allowance for credit losses. Additionally, valuations are periodically performed by management and any\nsubsequent reduction in value is recognized by a charge to income. The fair value of foreclosed assets and other real estate owned is estimated using Level\n3 inputs based on unobservable market data.\n123\nThe significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) used in the fair value measurement of collateral for collateral-dependent loans and foreclosed assets primarily\nrelate to the specialized discounting criteria applied to the borrower’s reported amount of collateral. The amount of the collateral discount depends upon the\ncondition and marketability of the collateral, as well as other factors which may affect the collectability of the loan. Management’s assessment of the\nsignificance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset. It is reasonably\npossible that a change in the estimated fair value for instruments measured using Level 3 inputs could occur in the future. As the Company’s primary\nobjective in the event of default would be to liquidate the collateral to settle the outstanding balance of the loan, collateral that is less marketable would\nreceive a larger discount.\nThe following table sets forth the Company’s assets by level within the fair value hierarchy that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022.\nFair Value Measurements Using\nQuoted Prices in\nActive Markets for Significant Other Significant\nIdentical Assets Observable Inputs Unobservable Inputs\n(In thousands) Fair Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nDecember 31, 2023\nIndividually assessed loans (1) (2) (collateral-dependent) $ 144,604 $ — $ — $ 144,604\nForeclosed assets and other real estate owned (1) 3,646 — — 3,646\nDecember 31, 2022\nIndividually assessed loans (1) (2) (collateral-dependent) $ 70,926 $ — $ — $ 70,926\nForeclosed assets and other real estate owned (1) 2,418 — — 2,418\n______________________\n(1) These amounts represent the resulting carrying amounts on the consolidated balance sheets for collateral-dependent loans and foreclosed assets and\nother real estate owned for which fair value re-measurements took place during the period.\n(2) Identified reserves of $18.7 million and $5.2 million were related to collateral-dependent loans for which fair value re-measurements took place\nduring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nASC Topic 825, )LQDQFLDO\u0003,QVWUXPHQWV, requires disclosure in annual and interim financial statements of the fair value of financial assets and financial\nliabilities, including those financial assets and financial liabilities that are not measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis or nonrecurring basis.\nThe following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments not previously disclosed.\n&DVK\u0003DQG\u0003FDVK\u0003HTXLYDOHQWV – The carrying amount for cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value (Level 1).\n,QWHUHVW\u0003EHDULQJ\u0003EDODQFHV\u0003GXH\u0003IURP\u0003EDQNV – The fair value of interest bearing balances due from banks – time is estimated using a discounted cash flow\ncalculation that applies the rates currently offered on deposits of similar remaining maturities (Level 2).\n+HOG\u0010WR\u0010PDWXULW\\\u0003VHFXULWLHV – Fair values for held-to-maturity securities equal quoted market prices, if available, such as for highly liquid government\nbonds (Level 1). If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are estimated based on quoted market prices of similar securities. For these securities,\nthe Company obtains fair value measurements from an independent pricing service. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include\ndealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds,\ncredit information and the security’s terms and conditions, among other things (Level 2). In certain cases where Level 1 or Level 2 inputs are not available,\nsecurities are classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy.\n124\n/RDQV – The fair value of loans is estimated by discounting the future cash flows, using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers\nwith similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities. Additional factors considered include the type of loan and related collateral, variable or\nfixed rate, classification status, remaining term, interest rate, historical delinquencies, loan to value ratios, current market rates and remaining loan balance.\nThe loans were grouped together according to similar characteristics and were treated in the aggregate when applying various valuation techniques.

In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques.\nThose techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows.

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as\nlong as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses\nand may require payment of a fee. Since a portion of the commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not\nnecessarily represent future cash requirements. Each customer’s creditworthiness is evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if\ndeemed necessary, is based on management’s credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, inventory,\nproperty, plant and equipment, commercial real estate and residential real estate.\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding commitments to extend credit aggregating approximately $738.2 million and $4.17 billion for credit\ncard commitments and other loan commitments, respectively. At December 31, 2022, the Company had outstanding commitments to extend credit\naggregating approximately $696.7 million and $5.64 billion for credit card commitments and other loan commitments, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had outstanding commitments to originate fixed-rate mortgage loans of approximately $16.6 million and\n$21.1 million respectively. The commitments extend over varying periods of time with the majority being disbursed within a thirty-day period.\nStandby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees\nare primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond financing and similar transactions. The credit\nrisk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers. The Company had total outstanding letters\nof credit amounting to $54.2 million and $44.4 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, with terms ranging from 9 months to 15 years. At\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had no deferred revenue under standby letter of credit agreements.\nThe Company has purchased letters of credit from the FHLB as security for certain public deposits. The amount of the letters of credit was $580.8 million\nand $265.7 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and they expire in less than one year from issuance.\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company did not have concentrations of 5% or more of the investment portfolio in bonds issued by a single municipality.\nNOTE 20: NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nInvestment-Income Taxes - In March 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2023-02, ,QYHVWPHQWV\u0010(TXLW\\\u00030HWKRG\u0003DQG\n-RLQW\u00039HQWXUHV\u0003 7RSLF\u0003\u0016\u0015\u0016 \u0003$FFRXQWLQJ\u0003IRU\u0003,QYHVWPHQWV\u0003LQ\u00037D[\u0003&UHGLW\u00036WUXFWXUHV\u00038VLQJ\u0003WKH\u00033URSRUWLRQDO\u0003$PRUWL]DWLRQ\u00030HWKRG (“ASU 2023-02”), that\nintroduced the option to apply the proportional amortization method to account for investments made primarily for the purpose of receiving income tax\ncredits and other income tax benefits when certain requirements are met. The proportional amortization method results in the cost of the investment being\namortized in proportion to the income tax credits and other income tax benefits received, with the amortization of the investment and the income tax credits\nbeing presented net in the income statement as a component of income tax expense (benefit). ASU 2023-02 is effective for public business entities for\nfiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 31, 2023, with early adoption permitted.

This ASU\namends the guidance in ASU 2017-12 that, among other things, established the “last-of-layer” method for making the fair value hedge accounting for these\nportfolios more accessible. ASU 2022-01 renames that method the “portfolio layer” method and expands the scope of this guidance to allow entities to\napply the portfolio layer method to portfolios of all financial assets, including both prepayable and nonprepayable financial assets. This scope expansion is\nconsistent with the FASB’s efforts to simplify hedge accounting and allows entities to apply the same method to similar hedging strategies. ASU 2022-01\nwas effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2022, with early\nadoption permitted.

On March 5, 2021, the U.K. Financial\nConduct Authority (“FCA”) announced that the majority of LIBOR rates will no longer be published after December 31, 2021. Effective January 1, 2022,\nthe ICE Benchmark Administration Limited, the administrator of the LIBOR, ceased the publication of one-week and two-month USD LIBOR and as of\nJune 30, 2023, ceased the publications of the remaining tenors of USD LIBOR (one, three, six and 12-month).\nOther interest rates used globally could also be discontinued for similar reasons. ASU 2020-04 provides optional expedients and exceptions to contracts,\nhedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform. The main provisions for contract modifications include optional relief by\nallowing the modification as a continuation of the existing contract without additional analysis and other optional expedients regarding embedded features.\nOptional expedients for hedge accounting permits changes to critical terms of hedging relationships and to the designated benchmark interest rate in a fair\nvalue hedge and also provides relief for assessing hedge effectiveness for cash flow hedges. Companies are able to apply ASU 2020-04 immediately;\nhowever, the guidance will only be available for a limited time (generally through December 31, 2022). The Company formed a LIBOR Transition Team in\n2020, has created standard LIBOR replacement language for new and modified loan notes, and is monitoring the remaining loans with LIBOR rates\nmonthly to ensure progress in updating these loans with acceptable LIBOR replacement language or converting them to other interest rates. During 2021,\nthe Company did not offer LIBOR-indexed rates on loans which it originated, although it did participate in some shared credit agreements originated by\nother banks subject to the Company’s determination that the LIBOR replacement language in the loan documents met the Company’s standards. Pursuant\nto the Joint Regulatory Statement on LIBOR transition issued in October 2021, the Company’s policy, as of January 1, 2022, is not to enter into any new\nLIBOR-based credit agreements and not extend, renew, or modify prior LIBOR credit agreements without requiring conversion of the agreements to other\ninterest rates.

All derivative instruments are carried at fair value.\nDerivative contracts involve the risk of dealing with institutional derivative counterparties and their ability to meet contractual terms. Institutional\ncounterparties must have an investment grade credit rating and be approved by the Company’s asset/liability management committee. In arranging these\nproducts for its customers, the Company assumes additional credit risk from the customer and from the dealer counterparty with whom the transaction is\nundertaken. Credit risk exists due to the default credit risk created in the exchange of the payments over a period of time. Credit exposure on interest rate\nswaps is limited to the net favorable value and interest payments of all swaps with each counterparty. Access to collateral in the event of default is\nreasonably assured. Therefore, credit exposure may be reduced by the amount of collateral pledged by the counterparty.\n+HGJH\u00036WUXFWXUHV\nThe Company will seek to enter derivative structures that most effectively address the risk exposure and structural terms of the underlying position being\nhedged. The term and notional principal amount of a hedge transaction will not exceed the term or principal amount of the underlying exposure. In\naddition, the Company will use hedge indices which are the same as, or highly correlated to, the index or rate on the underlying exposure. Derivative credit\nexposure is monitored on an ongoing basis for each customer transaction and aggregate exposure to each counterparty is tracked. The Company has set a\nmaximum outstanding notional contract amount at 10% of the Company’s assets.\n)DLU\u00039DOXH\u0003+HGJHV\nFor derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting loss or\ngain on the hedged asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current earnings. The gain or loss on the derivative instrument is\npresented on the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item. During the third quarter of 2021, the Company began utilizing\ninterest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges to mitigate the effect of changing interest rates on the fair values of fixed rate callable AFS securities.\nThe hedging strategy converts the fixed interest rates to variable interest rates based on federal funds rates. The two year forward start date for these swaps\noccurred during late third quarter of 2023 and involves the payment of fixed interest rates with a weighted average of 1.21% in exchange for variable\ninterest rates based on federal funds rates.

The counterparty contracts are identical to\ncustomer contracts in terms of notional amounts, interest rates, and maturity dates, except for a fixed pricing spread or fee paid to the Company by the\ndealer counterparty. These interest rate swaps carry varying degrees of credit, interest rate and market or liquidity risks.

The\nCompany has served as an intermediary on energy derivative products between the Company’s borrowers and dealers. The Company will only enter into\nback-to-back trades, thus maintaining a balanced book between the dealer and the borrower.\nThe energy hedging risk exposure to the Company’s customer would increase as energy prices for crude oil and natural gas rise. As prices decrease,\nexposure to the exchange would increase. These risks are mitigated by customer credit underwriting policies and establishing a predetermined hedge line\nfor each borrower and by monitoring the exchange margin.\nDuring the second quarter of 2023, the Company’s remaining energy hedge swap contracts expired and there were no outstanding notional values related to\nthese contracts as of December 31, 2023. The outstanding notional value as of December 31, 2022 for energy hedging Customer Sell to Company swaps\nwere $2.6 million and the corresponding Company Sell to Dealer swaps were $2.6 million and the corresponding net fair value of the derivative asset and\nderivative liability was $49,000. Currently, the Company generally does not intend to offer hedging services to any remaining energy related customers.\n131\nNOTE 22: CONTINGENT LIABILITIES\nIn the ordinary course of its operations, the Company and its subsidiaries are parties to various legal proceedings incidental to the conduct of its business,\nincluding proceedings based on breach of contract claims, lender liability claims, and other ordinary-course claims, some of which seek substantial relief or\ndamages.\nThe Company establishes reserves for legal proceedings when potential losses become probable and can be reasonably estimated. While the ultimate\nresolution (including amounts thereof) of any legal proceedings cannot be determined at this time, based on information presently available and after\nconsultation with legal counsel, management believes that the ultimate outcome in such proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will not have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the Company’s business, consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. It is possible, however, that future\ndevelopments could result in an unfavorable outcome for or resolution of any of these proceedings, which may be material to the Company’s results of\noperations for a given fiscal period.\nNOTE 23: STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nSimmons Bank, the Company’s subsidiary bank, is subject to legal limitations on dividends that can be paid to the parent company without prior approval\nof the applicable regulatory agencies. The approval of the Commissioner of the Arkansas State Bank Department is required if the total of all dividends\ndeclared by an Arkansas state bank in any calendar year exceeds seventy-five percent (75%) of the total of its net profits, as defined, for that year combined\nwith seventy-five percent (75%) of its retained net profits of the preceding year. At December 31, 2023, Simmons Bank had approximately $54.4 million\navailable for payment of dividends to the Company, without prior regulatory approval. Past dividends are not necessarily indicative of amounts that may be\npaid, or available to be paid, in future periods.\nThe Company’s bank subsidiary is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet\nminimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a\ndirect material effect on the Company’s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action,\nthe Company and its bank subsidiary must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities and certain off-\nbalance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Company’s capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative\njudgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.\nThe risk-based capital guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board and the Arkansas State Bank Department include the definitions for (1) a well-capitalized\ninstitution, (2) an adequately-capitalized institution, and (3) an undercapitalized institution. Under the Basel III Rules effective January 1, 2015, the criteria\nfor a well-capitalized institution are: a 5% “Tier l leverage capital” ratio, an 8% “Tier 1 risk-based capital” ratio, 10% “total risk-based capital” ratio; and a\n6.5% “common equity Tier 1 (CET1)” ratio. CET1 generally consists of common stock; retained earnings; accumulated other comprehensive income and\ncertain minority interests; all subject to applicable regulatory adjustments and deductions.\nThe Company and Simmons Bank must hold a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% composed of CET1 capital above its minimum risk-based capital\nrequirements. Failure to meet this capital conservation buffer would result in additional limits on dividends, other distributions and discretionary bonuses.\nQuantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Company to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the\ntable below) of total, Tier 1 and common equity Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined) and of Tier 1 capital (as\ndefined) to average assets (as defined). As of December 31, 2023, the Company and its subsidiary bank met all capital adequacy requirements under the\nBasel III Capital Rules and exceeded the fully phased in capital conservation buffer.\nAs of the most recent notification from regulatory agencies, Simmons Bank was well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective\naction. To be categorized as well capitalized, the Company and the Bank must maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based, common equity Tier 1\nrisk-based and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the table. There are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have\nchanged these categories.\n132\nThe Company’s and the Bank’s actual capital amounts and ratios are presented in

Garner\nDavid W. Garner\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer\nSimmons First National Corporation\nCompensation Clawback Policy\nAdopted July 27, 2023\nPurpose\nThe Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Simmons First National Corporation (the “Corporation”) believes that it is in the best interest of the\nCorporation and its shareholders to maintain a culture that emphasizes integrity and accountability and that reinforces the Corporation’s compensation\nphilosophy. The Board has therefore adopted this compensation clawback policy (the “Policy”) which provides for the recoupment, under certain\nconditions, of incentive-based compensation in the event of an accounting restatement. This Policy is intended to comply with Section 10D of\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Act”), the rules promulgated thereunder by the Securities and Exchange Commission,\nand the listing standards of Nasdaq (collectively, the “Applicable Rules”), and will be interpreted consistent therewith.\nApplicability and Effective Date\nThis Policy is effective July 27, 2023 (the “Effective Date”) and is applicable to all Incentive-Based Compensation (as defined below) received by\nExecutive Officers (as defined below) in connection with service as an Executive Officer. The Policy will be administered by the Compensation Committee\nof the Board (the “Committee”), and references to the Board will be deemed to be references to the Committee. Any determination made by the Board\nunder this Policy will be final and binding on all affected individuals. Each Executive Officer shall be required to execute the acknowledgement in\nAppendix A of this Policy as soon as practicable after the later of (i) the Effective Date and (ii) the date on which the employee is designated as an\nExecutive Officer; provided, however, that failure to execute such acknowledgement shall have no impact on the enforceability of this Policy.\nRestatement Clawback\nIn the event the Corporation is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement (as defined below), any Executive Officer who received Excess\nCompensation (as defined below) during the three (3) completed fiscal years preceding the date the Corporation is required to prepare an Accounting\nRestatement (the “Look-Back Period”) shall be required to repay or forfeit such Excess Compensation reasonably promptly. For purposes of this Policy:\nIncentive-Based Compensation is deemed received during the fiscal year during which the applicable financial reporting measure, stock price and/or total\nshareholder return measure, upon which the payment is based, is achieved, even if the grant or payment occurs after the end of such period.\nMethod of Repayment, Conditions for Non-Recovery\nThe Board shall have discretion to determine the appropriate means of recovery of Excess Compensation, which may include, without limitation, direct\npayment in a lump sum from the Executive Officer, recovery over time, cancellation of outstanding awards, the reduction of future pay and/or awards,\nand/or any other method which the Board determines is advisable to achieve reasonably prompt recovery of Excess Compensation. At the direction of the\nBoard, the Corporation shall take reasonable actions to recover Excess Compensation from any applicable Executive Officer.\nThe Board may determine that repayment of Excess Compensation (or a portion thereof) is not required only where it determines that recovery would be\nimpracticable and one of the following circumstances exists: (i) the direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the\namount to be recovered, provided the Corporation has (A) made a reasonable attempt to recover such Incentive-Based Compensation, (B) documented such\nreasonable attempt, and (C) provided such documentation to Nasdaq; (ii) recovery would violate home country law where the law was adopted prior to\nNovember 28, 2022, provided the Corporation has (A) obtained an opinion of home country counsel acceptable to Nasdaq that recovery would result in\nsuch violation and (B) provided such opinion to the Nasdaq; or (iii) recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which\nbenefits are broadly available to employees of the Corporation, to fail to meet the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(13) or 26 U.S.C. 411(a) and the\nregulations thereunder.\nNo Fault Application, No Indemnification\nRecovery of compensation under this Policy is on a “no fault” basis, meaning that it will occur regardless of whether the Executive Officer engaged in\nmisconduct or was otherwise directly or indirectly responsible, in whole or in part, for the Accounting Restatement. No Executive Officer may be\nindemnified by the Corporation, or any of its affiliates, from losses arising from the application of this Policy.\nDefinitions\nFor purposes of this Policy, the following definitions will apply:\n“Accounting Restatement” means an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Corporation with any financial reporting\nrequirement under securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is\nmaterial to the previously issued financial statements, or that corrects an error that is not material to previously issued financial statements but would result\nin a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period.\nChanges to financial statements that do not constitute an Accounting Restatement include, without limitation, retroactive: (i) application of a\nchange from one generally accepted accounting principle to another generally accepted accounting principle; (ii) revisions to reportable segment\ninformation due to a change in internal organization; (iii) reclassification due to a discontinued operation; (iv) application of a change in reporting entity,\nsuch as from a reorganization of entities under common control; (v) adjustments to provisional amounts in connection with a prior business combination;\nand (vi) revisions for stock splits, reverse stock splits, stock dividends, or other changes in capital structure.\n“Excess Compensation” means any amount of Incentive-Based Compensation received by an Executive Officer that exceeds the amount of\nIncentive-Based Compensation that otherwise would have been received had it been determined based on the Accounting Restatement, computed without\nregard to any taxes paid. For Incentive Compensation based on stock price or total shareholder return, where the amount to be recovered is not subject to\nmathematical recalculation directly from information in the Accounting Restatement, the amount to be recovered shall be based on a reasonable estimate of\nthe effect of the Accounting Restatement on the stock price or total shareholder return, as applicable, and the Corporation shall retain documentation of the\ndetermination of such estimate and provide such documentation to Nasdaq if so required by the Applicable Rules.\n“Executive Officer” means an individual who is, or was during the Look-Back Period, an executive officer of the Corporation within the meaning\nof Rule 10D-1(d) under the Act.\n“Incentive-Based Compensation” means any compensation that is granted, earned or vested based wholly or in part on stock price, total\nshareholder return, and/or the attainment of (i) any financial reporting measure(s) that are determined and presented in accordance with the accounting\nprinciples using in preparing the Corporation’s financial statements and/or (ii) any other measures that are derived in whole or in part from such measures.\nCompensation that does not constitute “Incentive-Based Compensation” includes, without limitation, equity incentive awards for which the grant\nis not contingent upon achieving any financial reporting measure performance goal and that vest exclusively upon completion of a specified employment\nperiod, without any performance condition, and bonus awards that are discretionary or based on subjective goals or goals unrelated to financial reporting\nmeasures.\nAdministration, Amendment, and Termination\nThis Policy will be enforced and appropriate proxy disclosures and exhibit filings will be made in accordance with the Applicable Rules and any other\napplicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and applicable Nasdaq listing standards.\nThe Board will have the authority to (i) exercise all of the powers granted to it under the policy, (ii) construe, interpret, and implement this Policy, and (iii)\nmake all determinations necessary or advisable in administering this policy.\nIn addition, the Board may amend this policy, from time to time in its discretion, and shall amend this Policy, as it deems necessary, to reflect changes in\napplicable law. The Board may terminate this Policy at any time. Any such amendment (or provision thereof) or termination shall not be effective if such\namendment or termination would (after taking into account any actions taken by the Corporation contemporaneously with such amendment or termination)\ncause the Corporation to violate the Applicable Rules.\nIn the event of any conflict or inconsistency between this Policy and any other policies, plans, or other materials of the Corporation, this Policy will govern.\nThis Policy will be deemed to be automatically updated to incorporate any requirement of law, the SEC, exchange listing standard, rule or regulation\napplicable to the Corporation.\n* * *\nAppendix A:\nSimmons First National Corporation\nCompensation Clawback Policy\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe undersigned acknowledges and agrees that the undersigned (i) is, and will be, subject to the Compensation Clawback Policy\nto which this acknowledgement is appended (as may be amended, the “Policy”), and (ii) will abide by the terms of the Policy,\nincluding by returning Excess Compensation pursuant to whatever method the Board determines is advisable to achieve\nreasonably prompt recovery of such Excess Compensation, as prescribed under the Policy.\nCapitalized terms used but not defined in this Acknowledgement have the meaning set forth in the Policy.\nPrint Name\nSignature\nDate"

Makris III, Secretary\nPine Bluff, Arkansas\nMarch 20, 2024\nANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS\nSIMMONS FIRST NATIONAL CORPORATION\nP. O. Box 7009\nPine Bluff, Arkansas 71611\nPROXY STATEMENT\nMeeting to be held on April 23, 2024\nProxy and Proxy Statement furnished on or about March 20, 2024\nThe enclosed proxy is solicited on behalf of the Board of Directors (“Board”) of Simmons First\nNational Corporation (“Company”) for use at the annual meeting of the shareholders of the Company to\nbe held on Tuesday, April 23, 2024, at 8:00 a.m. Central Time, in the auditorium of the Company’s Little\nRock, Arkansas, corporate offices (601 E. 3rd Street, Little Rock, Arkansas 72201) or at any\npostponements or adjournments thereof. When such proxy is properly executed and submitted, the shares\nrepresented by it will be voted at the meeting in accordance with any directions noted thereon, or if no direction\nis indicated, will be voted “For” all of the director nominees in Proposal 2 and “For” Proposals 1, 3, 4, and 5.\nImportant Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials\nfor the Shareholder Meeting To Be Held on April 23, 2024:\nThe Notice, Proxy Statement, and Annual Report on Form 10 -K\nare available at www.edocumentview.com/sfnc.\nREVOCABILITY OF PROXY\nAny shareholder giving a proxy has the power to change or revoke it at any time before it is voted.\nCOSTS AND METHOD OF SOLICITATION\nThe costs of soliciting proxies will be borne by the Company. In addition to the use of the mails,\nsolicitation may be made by employees of the Company by telephone, electronic communications, and personal\ninterview. These persons will receive no compensation other than their regular salaries, but they will be\nreimbursed by the Company for their actual expenses incurred in such solicitations.\nOUTSTANDING SECURITIES AND VOTING RIGHTS\nAt the meeting, holders of the Class A Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the\n“Common Stock”) will be entitled to one vote, in person or by proxy, for each share of Common Stock owned\nof record as of the close of business on February 20, 2024. On that date, the Company had 125,327,180 shares\nof Common Stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the meeting. 4,428,038 of such shares were held by the\ntrust division of Simmons Bank (“Bank”) in a fiduciary capacity, of which 155,586 shares cannot be voted by\nthe Bank at the meeting.\nAll actions requiring a vote of the shareholders must be taken at a meeting at which a quorum is present in\nperson or by proxy. A quorum consists of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote upon a matter.\nWith respect to each of Proposals 1, 3, 4, and 5, approval requires that the votes cast “for” the proposal exceed\nthe votes cast “against” it.\nWith respect to Proposal 2, the Company’s articles of incorporation and by-laws provide that, in an\n“uncontested election,” which is an election in which the number of nominees for director is less than or equal\nto the number of directors to be elected, a nominee for director shall be elected by a majority of the votes cast\nby the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote thereon. This means\nthat the votes cast “for” a director nominee must exceed the votes cast “against” such nominee. If an incumbent\nnominee does not receive the required votes for election at the meeting, the Company’s by-laws require that the\ndirector immediately tender his or her resignation to the Board. The Board, through a process managed by the\nBoard’s Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (“NCGC”), will consider whether to accept the\ndirector’s offer of resignation and will publicly disclose its decision.\n1\nTo be elected in a “contested election,” which is an election in which the number of nominees for director\nis greater than the number of directors to be elected, a nominee for director must receive a plurality of the votes\ncast by the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote thereon.\nAll proxies submitted will be tabulated by Computershare, the transfer agent for the Common Stock.\nThe enclosed proxy card also provides a method for shareholders to abstain from voting on each matter\npresented. By abstaining with respect to any of Proposals 1 through 5, shares will not be voted either “for” or\n“against” the subject proposal but will be counted for quorum purposes. Abstentions, therefore, will not affect\nthe outcome of the vote on any of Proposals 1 through 5. While there may be instances in which a shareholder\nmay wish to abstain from voting on any particular matter, the Board encourages all shareholders to vote their\nshares in their best judgment and to participate in the voting process to the fullest extent possible.\nIf your shares are held in a brokerage account or by another nominee, you are considered the “beneficial\nowner” of shares held in “street name,” and these proxy materials have been forwarded to you by your broker or\nother nominee (the “record holder”) along with a voting instruction form. As the beneficial owner, you have the\nright to direct your record holder how to vote your shares, and the record holder is required to vote your shares\nin accordance with your instructions. A “broker non-vote” occurs when a nominee holding shares for a\nbeneficial owner does not vote on a particular proposal because the nominee has not received a voting\ninstruction from the beneficial owner and does not have discretionary voting power with respect to that item.\nDue to various regulatory requirements, brokers or other nominees may not exercise discretionary voting power\non the election of directors, executive compensation or other non-routine matters. While brokers or other\nnominees might still be permitted to exercise discretionary voting power for Proposal 4 (the ratification of\nFORVIS, LLP as our independent auditor), brokers and other nominees may not exercise discretionary voting\npower for Proposals 1 through 3 (number of directors, election of directors, and approval of executive\ncompensation), and the Company believes that brokers and other nominees may not exercise discretionary\nvoting power for Proposal 5 (approval of the Simmons First National Corporation Second Amended and\nRestated 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan). As a result, if you do not provide specific voting instructions to\nyour record holder, the record holder may not vote your shares on Proposals 1 through 3 or Proposal 5.\nAccordingly, it is particularly important that you provide voting instructions to your broker or other nominee so\nthat your shares may be voted on the matters presented at the meeting.\nIf your shares are treated as a broker non-vote, your shares will be counted in the number of shares\nrepresented for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present. However, broker non-votes will not be\nincluded in vote totals (neither “for” nor “against”). Therefore, with respect to Proposals 1 through 5, broker\nnon-votes will not affect the outcome of the vote.\nIn the event a shareholder executes the proxy but does not mark the proxy to vote (or abstain) on any one\nor more of the proposals, the proxy will be voted “For” all of the director nominees in Proposal 2 and “For”\nProposals 1, 3, 4, and 5, as applicable. Further, if any matter, other than the matters shown on the proxy, is\nproperly presented at the meeting which may be acted upon without special notice under Arkansas law, the\nproxy solicited hereby confers discretionary authority to the named proxies to vote in their sole discretion with\nrespect to such matters, as well as other matters incident to the conduct of the meeting. On the date of the\nmailing of this proxy statement, the Board has no knowledge of any such other matter which will come before\nthe meeting. To obtain directions to attend the annual meeting of shareholders and vote in person, please contact\nEd Bilek, Director of Investor and Media Relations, at investorrelations@simmonsbank.com or 501-263-7483.\n2\nSECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS\nThe following table sets forth (except as otherwise indicated, as of January 31, 2024) (1) all persons\nknown to management who own, beneficially or of record, more than 5% of the outstanding Common Stock,\n(2) the number of shares of Common Stock owned by the named executive officers in the Summary\nCompensation Table, (3) the number of shares of Common Stock owned by each current director and director\nnominee (as reported by each director and nominee), and (4) the number of shares of Common Stock owned by\nall current directors and current executive officers as a group.\nShares Owned Percent of\nName and Address of Beneficial Owner Beneficially[a] Class[b]\nBlackRock, Inc.[c]\n50 Hudson Yard s\nNew York, New Y ork 10001 18,043,806 14.40%\nThe Vanguard Group[d]\n100 Vanguard Blvd.\nMalvern, PA 19355 15,207,448 12.13%\nDimensional Fund Advisors LP[e]\n6300 Bee Cave Road\nBuilding One\nAustin, TX 78 746 6,566,353 5.24%\nGeorge A.

(Retailer of Gasoline Products and\nConvenience Store Merchandise)\nCommittees and Related Matters\nDuring 2023, the Board maintained and utilized the following committees: Executive Committee, Audit\nCommittee, Compensation Committee, NCGC, and Risk Committee.\nDuring 2023, the Audit Committee was composed of Robert L. Shoptaw (Chair), Jay D. Burchfield, Steve\nCossé, Edward Drilling, Eugene Hunt, Jerry Hunter, Scott McGeorge, Julie Stackhouse, and Mindy West. The\nBoard has determined that Messrs. Shoptaw and Cossé, along with Ms. West, constitute financial experts on the\nAudit Committee. This committee provides assistance to the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities concerning\naccounting and reporting practices by regularly reviewing the adequacy of the internal and external auditors, the\ndisclosure of the financial affairs of the Company and its subsidiaries, the control systems of management and\ninternal accounting controls. During 2023, this committee met 9 times.\nThe Compensation Committee, which was composed of Jay Burchfield (Chair), Steve Cossé, Jerry\nHunter, Susan Lanigan, Scott McGeorge, Robert L. Shoptaw, and Mindy West, met 9 times during 2023.\nThe NCGC, which was composed of Susan Lanigan (Chair), Steve Cossé, Jerry Hunter, Robert\nL. Shoptaw, and Mindy West, met 3 times during 2023.\nThe Risk Committee, which was composed of Mark C. Doramus (Chair), Dean Bass, Jay D. Burchfield,\nMarty Casteel, William Clark, Steve Cossé, Edward Drilling, Eugene Hunt, Jerry Hunter, Susan Lanigan,\nGeorge Makris, Jr., Scott McGeorge, Tom Purvis, Robert L. Shoptaw, Julie Stackhouse, Russ Teubner, and\nMindy West, met 4 times during 2023.\nThe Company encourages all Board members to attend the annual shareholders’ meeting. Historically, the\ndirectors of the Company and its subsidiaries are introduced and acknowledged at the annual shareholders’\nmeeting. All seventeen of the directors who stood for election at the 2023 annual shareholders’ meeting\nattended the Company’s 2023 annual shareholders’ meeting.\nThe Board met 7 times during 2023, including regular and special meetings. All incumbent directors\nattended at least 75% of the aggregate of all meetings of the Board and all meetings of the committees on\nwhich, and during the time period in which, they served.\n13\nBoard Leadership Structure\nThe Company’s Corporate Governance Principles do not mandate the separation of the offices of\nChairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. During recent history, and, indeed, over the last several\ndecades (except for certain brief periods), the offices of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\nwere held by the same person. However, effective January 1, 2023, the Board decided to separate these roles,\nappointing George Makris, Jr. as Executive Chairman and Chairman of the Board and Bob Fehlman as Chief\nExecutive Officer. The Board believes that it is in the best interest of the Company to provide flexibility in the\nCompany’s leadership structure to address differences in the Company’s operating environment as well as\ndifferences in the experience, skills, and capabilities of the executive management team serving the Company\nfrom time to time. The Board believes that the separation of the roles of Chairman of the Board and Chief\nExecutive Officer promote a variety of significant goals, including, among others, continuity of board\nleadership, enhanced focus on strategic business initiatives, and effective succession planning. While the Board\nbelieves the separation of the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer positions is currently in the\nCompany’s and shareholders’ best interests, the Board is authorized to combine these positions should\ncircumstances change in the future.\nIn addition, in an effort to strengthen independent oversight of management and to provide for more open\ncommunication, Steve Cossé has served as Chair of the Executive Committee and as Lead Director for a\nnumber of years. Following the separation of the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer roles in\n2023, Mr. Cossé has continued to serve as Lead Director and Chair of the Executive Committee. Mr. Cossé, as\nindependent Lead Director, chairs executive sessions of the Board conducted without management. These\nsessions are generally held in connection with regularly scheduled Board meetings. Management also\nperiodically meets with the Lead Director to discuss Board and Executive Committee agenda items, and the\nLead Director serves as a liaison between the Chairman of the Board and the independent directors.\nCodes of Ethics\n&RGH\u0003RI\u0003(WKLFV\u0003²\u0003*HQHUDO. The Company has adopted a general Code of Ethics applicable to all\ndirectors, advisory directors, officers, and associates of the Company. The Code of Ethics is designed to\npromote conducting the business of the Company in accordance with the highest ethical standards of conduct\nand to promote the ethical handling of conflicts of interest, full and fair disclosure, and compliance with laws,\nrules, and regulations. Additionally, under the Code of Ethics, directors, advisory directors, officers, and\nassociates who learn of a business opportunity in the course of their service for the Company generally cannot\nappropriate that opportunity for themselves or for others, but must allow the Company to take advantage of the\nopportunity. The Company’s Code of Ethics is designed to provide guidance and resources to help ensure that:\n• The Company and its directors, advisory directors, officers, and associates comply with applicable\nlaws and regulations;\n• The Company’s assets are used efficiently and appropriately;\n• Confidential and proprietary information is protected;\n• The Company’s directors, advisory directors, officers, and associates comply with the Company’s\nInsider Trading Policy, as well as the laws, rules, and regulations that regulate transactions in the\nCompany’s stock;\n• Inappropriate gifts or favors are not accepted; and\n• Actual or perceived conflicts of interest are appropriately addressed.\nAny material departure from a provision of the Code of Ethics by a director, advisory director, officer, or\nassociate may be waived by the Ethics Committee (in the case of an officer or associate (other than an executive\nofficer)) or the NCGC (in the case of a director, advisory director, or executive officer) and shall, as appropriate,\nbe reported to the Board, and any such waiver will be promptly disclosed on its website to the extent required\nby applicable law, rule, or regulation. The Company will disclose any amendments with respect to its Code of\nEthics on its website.\n&RGH\u0003RI\u0003(WKLFV\u0003IRU\u0003)LQDQFH\u0003*URXS. The Board has adopted a separate Finance Group Code of Ethics that\nsupplements the Code of Ethics and applies to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer,\nChief Accounting Officer, Controller and all other officers and associates in the Finance and Accounting,\nTreasury,\n14\nand Tax Departments of the Company and its subsidiaries. To the extent required by applicable law, rule, or\nregulation, the Company will disclose any amendments or waivers with respect to its Finance Group Code of\nEthics on its website.\nBoth of these Codes of Ethics may be found on the Company’s website at ZZZ\u0011VLPPRQVEDQN\u0011FRP within\nthe “Investor Relations” page under “ESG — Governance — Governance Documents”.\nTransactions with Related Persons\nFrom time to time, the Bank and such other banking subsidiaries of the Company as are, or may have\nbeen, in operation from time to time, have made loans and other extensions of credit to directors, officers,\nemployees, members of their immediate families, and certain other related interests; and from time to time\ndirectors, officers, employees, members of their immediate families, and certain other related interests have\nplaced deposits with these banks. These loans, extensions of credit, and deposits were made in the ordinary\ncourse of business on substantially the same terms (including interest rates and collateral) as those prevailing at\nthe time for comparable transactions with other persons not related to the Company and did not involve more\nthan the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features. The Company generally considers\nbanking relationships with directors and their affiliates to be immaterial and as not affecting a director’s\nindependence so long as the terms of the credit relationship are similar to those with other comparable\nborrowers not related to the Company.\nIn assessing the impact of a credit relationship on a director’s independence, the Company deems any\nextension of credit which complies with Federal Reserve Regulation O to be consistent with director\nindependence. The Company believes that normal, arm’s-length banking relationships entered into in the\nordinary course of business do not affect a director’s independence.\nRegulation O requires such loans to be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and\ncollateral, and following credit-underwriting procedures that are no less stringent than those prevailing at the\ntime for comparable transactions by the subsidiary bank of the Company with other persons not related to the\nCompany. Such loans also may not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable\nfeatures. Additionally, no event of default may have occurred, nor may any such loans be classified or disclosed\nas non-accrual, past due, restructured, or a potential problem loan. The Company’s Board will review any credit\nto a director or his or her affiliates that is criticized by internal loan review or a bank regulatory agency in order\nto determine the impact that such classification may have on the director’s independence.\nAn immediate family member of George A. Makris, Jr., Executive Chairman and Chairman of the Board,\nis employed by the Company. In 2023, Mr. Makris, Jr.’s son, George A. Makris III, served as Executive Vice\nPresident, General Counsel, and Secretary and received cash and equity compensation as set forth in the\nSummary Compensation Table. Such compensation is determined on a basis consistent with the Company’s\nhuman resources policies and is reviewed and approved by the Compensation Committee.\nAn immediate family member of Matthew Reddin, who served as Executive Vice President and Chief\nBanking Officer until July 2023, is employed by the Company. In 2023, Mr. Reddin’s sister, Caroline Butler,\nserved as a Senior Vice President of the Bank and received cash and equity compensation consisting of\napproximately $295,918. Such compensation is determined on a basis consistent with the Company’s human\nresources policies and was reviewed by the Compensation Committee.\nPolicies and Procedures for Approval of Related Party Transactions\nRelated party transactions may present potential or actual conflicts of interest and create the appearance\nthat Company decisions are based on considerations other than the best interest of the Company and its\nshareholders. The Company’s Code of Ethics and Related Party Transactions Policy address matters concerning\nrelated party business dealings. Management carefully reviews all proposed related party transactions, other\nthan routine banking transactions, to determine if the transaction is on terms comparable to terms that could be\nobtained in an arm’s-length transaction with an unrelated third party. Management reports to the NCGC on\nproposed material related party transactions. Upon the presentation of a proposed related party transaction to the\nNCGC, the related party is excused from participation in discussion and voting on the matter. The NCGC (or, as\napplicable, the Compensation Committee) also periodically reviews ongoing related party transactions.\n15\nRole of Board in Risk Oversight\nThe Board has responsibility for the oversight of risk management. The Board, either as a whole or\nthrough its committees, regularly discusses with management the Company’s major risk exposures, their\npotential impact on the Company, and the steps being taken to monitor and manage them.\nWhile the Board is ultimately responsible for risk oversight, the Board committees assist the Board in\nfulfilling its oversight responsibilities in certain areas of risk. In particular, the Risk Committee assists the Board\nin assessing and managing the various risks of the Company (including, among others, asset, liability, liquidity,\nand credit risks, as well as certain risks associated with fraud, third-party vendors, cybersecurity, and\ninformation technology). To aid the Risk Committee in its responsibilities, Company management has formed\nan Enterprise Risk Management Committee of senior executives and has allocated responsibilities for the\nadministration of the risk management program to the Company’s chief risk officer. The Board has adopted a\ncharter for the Risk Committee that outlines its particular duties. During 2023, due to the importance of risk\noversight to the Company and the continued maturation of the Company’s risk management program, the Risk\nCommittee was a “committee of the whole,” with all directors serving as members. Based on the current\nmaturation of the Company’s risk management program, the Board has determined that, beginning in 2024, the\nRisk Committee will be comprised of a subset of directors.\nThe Audit Committee, composed of independent directors, focuses on financial risk exposures, including\ninternal controls, and discusses with management, the internal auditors, and the independent registered public\naccountants the Company’s policies with respect to financial risk assessment and management, including risks\nrelated to fraud and liquidity. The Compensation Committee, also composed of independent directors, focuses\non the oversight of risks associated with compensation policies and programs.\nEnvironmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) Considerations\nThe Company, along with its subsidiaries, is committed to enhancing the communities that we serve and\nmaintaining an organization that operates with integrity. The Company’s Board is responsible for overseeing the\nbusiness and affairs of the Company, including matters that relate to ESG considerations. Certain ESG topics\nare overseen by particular Board committees, including corporate governance matters, which are overseen by\nthe NCGC, and human resources matters, including matters related to our corporate culture, which are overseen\nby the Compensation Committee.

Shoptaw, and Mindy West. The Board appoints each member of the NCGC and has determined that each\nmember is, and each member who served during 2023 was, independent in accordance with the NASDAQ\nlisting rules. A function of the NCGC regarding nominations is to identify and recommend individuals to be\npresented for election or re-election as directors of the Company.\nDirector Nominations and Qualifications\nThe Board is responsible for recommending nominees for directors to the shareholders for election at the\nannual shareholders’ meeting. The Board has delegated the identification and evaluation of proposed director\nnominees to the NCGC. The NCGC charter, which is available for review within the “Investor Relations” page\nof the Company’s web site, www.simmonsbank.com (under “ESG — Governance — Governance Documents”),\nthe Company’s by-laws, and certain corporate governance principles and procedures govern the nominations\nand criteria for proposing or recommending proposed nominees for election and re-election to the Board and its\nsubsidiaries.\nThe identification of potential directors and the evaluation of existing and potential directors is a\ncontinuing responsibility of the NCGC. The NCGC has not retained any third party to assist it in performing its\nduties. A proposed director may be recommended to the Board at any time; however, director nominations by\nshareholders must be made in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Company’s by-laws and described\nin this proxy statement under the heading “3URSRVDOV\u0003IRU\u0003\u0015\u0013\u0015\u0018\u0003$QQXDO\u00030HHWLQJ.”\n19\nThe NCGC has not set any minimum qualifications for a proposed nominee to be eligible for\nrecommendation to be elected as a director of the Company. The corporate governance principles provide that\nthe NCGC shall consider the following criteria, without any specified priority or weighting, in evaluating\nproposed nominees for director:\n• Type of business interests\n• Geographic location of residence and business\ninterests • Business and financial expertise\n• Age • Leadership profile\n• Community involvement • Personal and professional ethics and integrity\n• Ability to think independently • Equity ownership in the Company\n• Ability to fit with the Company’s corporate\nculture\nThe NCGC has no specific quotas for diversity. In evaluating potential nominees to serve as a director for\nthe Company or the Bank, under the criteria set forth above, the NCGC seeks nominees with diverse business\nand professional experience, skills, and gender, age, place of residence, and ethnic/racial backgrounds, as\nappropriate, in light of the current composition of the boards. Additionally, the NCGC seeks geographical\ndiversity and insights into its local and regional markets by primarily seeking potential director nominees who\nreside within the markets in which the Company has a significant business presence.\nRecommendations from Shareholders\nThe NCGC will consider individuals recommended by shareholders for service as a director with respect\nto elections to be held at an annual meeting. In order for the NCGC to consider nominating a shareholder-\nrecommended individual for election at the annual meeting, the shareholder must recommend the individual in\nsufficient time for consideration and action by the NCGC. While no specific deadline has been set for notice of\nsuch recommendations, recommendations provided to the NCGC by a shareholder on or before November 15,\n2024 (for the 2025 Annual Meeting of Shareholders) should provide adequate time for consideration and action\nby the NCGC prior to the December 31, 2024, anticipated deadline for reporting proposed nominations to the\nBoard. Recommendations submitted after such date will be considered by the NCGC, but no assurance can be\nmade that such consideration will be completed and committee action taken by the NCGC in time for the next\nannual shareholders’ meeting.\nThe Chairman of the Board, other directors, and executive officers may also recommend director\ncandidates to the NCGC. The committee will evaluate individuals recommended by shareholders, the Chairman\nof the Board, other directors, and executive officers against the same criteria, described above, used to evaluate\nother nominees.\nAnnual Self-Evaluations\nBoard effectiveness remains a key area of focus for us. In furtherance of that goal and in accordance with\nthe Company’s Corporate Governance Principles, the Board, with the oversight of the NCGC, undertakes\nannual Board and committee self-evaluation processes that involve each director completing detailed\nquestionnaires that assist in the assessment of the performance of the Board, its committees, and their members.\nThe NCGC reports its findings to the Board following completion of the evaluations and oversees any needed\nfollow-up action.\nCompensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation\nDuring 2023, the Compensation Committee was composed of Jay Burchfield (Chair), Steve Cossé, Jerry\nHunter, Susan Lanigan, Scott McGeorge, Robert L. Shoptaw, and Mindy West, none of whom were employed\nby the Company. In addition, none of the committee members were formerly officers of the Company.\nCompensation Committee Processes and Procedures\nDecisions regarding the compensation of the executive officers are generally made by the Compensation\nCommittee, which has adopted a charter that is available for review within the “Investor Relations” page of the\nCompany’s web site, www.simmonsbank.com (under “ESG — Governance — Governance Documents”).\nSpecifically, the Compensation Committee has strategic responsibility for a broad range of issues, including\n20\nthe Company’s compensation program to compensate key management employees effectively and in a manner\nconsistent with the Company’s stated compensation strategy and the requirements of the appropriate regulatory\nbodies. The Board appoints each member of the Compensation Committee and has determined that each\nmember is, and each member who served during 2023 was, independent in accordance with the NASDAQ\nlisting rules.\nThe Compensation Committee oversees the administration of executive compensation plans, including the\ndesign, performance measures and award opportunities for the executive incentive programs and certain\nemployee benefits, subject to final action by the Board in certain cases. Typically, during the first quarter of\neach calendar year, the committee undertakes a specific review focusing on performance and awards for the\nmost recently completed fiscal year and the completion of the process of setting the performance goals for the\nincentive compensation programs for the current year.\nTo assist in meeting the objectives outlined above, Pearl Meyer & Partners, LLC, a compensation and\nbenefits consulting firm, has been retained to advise the Compensation Committee on a regular basis concerning\nthe Company’s compensation programs. The committee engaged the consultant to provide general\ncompensation consulting services, including executive and director compensation. In addition, the consultant\nmay perform special compensation projects and consulting services upon request by the Compensation\nCommittee or Company.\nThe Board, upon approval and recommendation from the Compensation Committee, determines and\napproves all compensation and awards to the CEO and Executive Chairman. The Compensation Committee\nreviews the performance of the CEO and Executive Chairman and reviews and approves compensation of the\nother executive officers. The CEO and/or Executive Chairman also review the performance and compensation\nof the other executive officers, including the other named executive officers, and report any significant issues or\ndeficiencies, and make recommendations, to the Compensation Committee. The members of the Company’s\nhuman resources department assist in such reviews. The human resources department regularly reviews the\ncompensation classification system of the Company, which determines the compensation of all employees of the\nCompany and its affiliates. The Company’s compensation program is based in part on market data. The\nCompensation Committee also acts upon the proposed grants of stock-based compensation recommended by the\nCEO and/or Executive Chairman for other executive officers and, as applicable, other employees of the\nCompany and its affiliates.\nIn determining the amount of executive officer compensation each year, the Compensation Committee\nreviews competitive market data from the banking industry as a whole and the peer group specifically. It makes\nspecific compensation decisions and grants based on a review of such data, Company performance, and\nindividual performance and circumstances. For performance-based incentives, the Compensation Committee\nsets performance targets using management’s internal business plan, industry and market conditions, and other\nfactors.\nRole of Compensation Consultants\nThe Company periodically engages compensation consultants to aid in the review of its compensation\nprograms. From time to time, the Company engages compensation consultants to provide national and regional\ngeneral statistical information regarding compensation within the banking industry. The data reviewed may\ninclude base salary, bonus, incentive programs, equity compensation, retirement, and other benefits. This\ninformation is used to validate the Company’s classification of positions and salaries within its compensation\npolicies.\nThe Compensation Committee also uses compensation consultants to evaluate its executive and director\ncompensation programs. Presently, the consultant assists such reviews by providing data regarding market\npractices and making specific recommendations for changes to plan and award design and policies consistent\nwith the Company’s stated philosophies and objectives.\nThe Compensation Committee assessed the relationships between Pearl Meyer & Partners, LLC, the\nCompany, the Compensation Committee and the executive officers of the Company for conflicts of interest. In\nthis assessment, the Compensation Committee reviewed the criteria set forth in the SEC’s Reg. 240.10C-1(b)(4)\n(i)-(vi), NASDAQ Rule 5605(d)(3)(D)(i)-(vi) and such other criteria as it deemed appropriate. The\nCompensation Committee did not identify any conflicts of interest for Pearl Meyer & Partners, LLC.\n21\nExecutive Officers\nThe Board elects executive officers at least annually. All of the executive officers shown in the table\nbelow have been officers of the Company and/or the Bank for at least five years, except for Messrs. Brogdon\nand Hobbs and Ms. Madea.

In addition, this\nsection includes discussion of the 2023 compensation for Matthew S. Reddin, who served as an executive\nofficer until his separation from service on July 5, 2023, and Chad Rawls, who served as an executive officer\nuntil July 2023 (Mr. Rawls remains employed by Simmons Bank but, following an internal reorganization, is no\nlonger an executive officer). These eight persons are referred to throughout this discussion as the “named\nexecutive officers” or “NEOs.” This discussion focuses on compensation and practices relating to the\nCompany’s most recently completed fiscal year and certain changes to such compensation and practices going\nforward.\nThe Company believes that the performance of each of the executive officers has the potential to impact\nthe profitability of the Company, in both the short term and the long term. Therefore, the Company places\nsignificant emphasis on the design and administration of its executive compensation program.\nCommittee\nThe compensation program for the Company is designed and administered by the Compensation\nCommittee (also referred to as “Committee” for purposes of this discussion). For 2023, the members of this\nCommittee were Jay Burchfield (Chair), Steve Cossé, Jerry Hunter, Susan Lanigan, Scott McGeorge, Robert\nL. Shoptaw, and Mindy West.\nExecutive Compensation Philosophy\nThe Company seeks to provide executive compensation packages that are significantly connected to the\nCompany’s overall financial and operational performance, the increase in shareholder value, the success of the\nCompany, and the performance of the individual executive. The main principles of this strategy include the\nfollowing:\n• attract and retain highly effective and competent executive leadership,\n• encourage a high level of performance from the individual executive,\n• align compensation incentives with the performance of the overall Company and/or the business unit\nmost directly impacted by the executive’s leadership and performance,\n• enhance shareholder value, and\n• improve the overall performance of the Company.\nThe Compensation Committee strives to meet these objectives while maintaining market competitive\ncompensation levels and ensuring that the Company makes efficient use of its shares, has predictable expense\nrecognition, and operates within the Company’s risk profile.\nPeer Comparison\nIn determining the amount of executive officer compensation each year, the Compensation Committee\nreviews competitive market data from the banking industry as a whole and a specific peer group of comparably\nsized banking organizations. The Committee uses this peer group of banking organizations for comparison in\nsetting executive compensation practices and levels of base salary, incentives, and benefits.\nPrior to setting the peer group, the Committee obtains the recommendation of its compensation consultant\non the makeup of its peer group. For 2023, the compensation consultant conducted a review of publicly-traded\nregional banks and recommended a peer group of banks with assets between approximately $12.7 billion to\n$56.4 billion (approximately 0.5 to 2.1 times the Company’s asset size at the time of the peer group analysis)\nlocated in the states of Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Indiana, Missouri, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee,\nTexas, and Virginia.\n23\nThe Compensation Committee adopted the peer group as recommended by its compensation consultant. For our\ncompensation analysis for 2023, the peer group consisted of 20 banking organizations; the name and ticker\nsymbol for the members of the peer group are set forth below:\nAmeris Bancorp (ABCB) Atlantic Union Bankshares Corporation (AUB)\nBank OZK (OZK) BOK Financial Corporation (BOKF)\nCadence Bank (CADE) Commerce Bancshares, Inc. (CBSH)\nFB Financial Corporation (FBK) Hancock Whitney Corporation (HWC)\nHeartland Financial USA, Inc. (HTLF) Home BancShares, Inc. (HOMB)\nIndependent Bank Group, Inc. (IBTX) Old National Bancorp (ONB)\nPinnacle Financial Partners, Inc. (PNFP) Prosperity Bancshares, Inc. (PB)\nRenasant Corp. (RNST) SouthState Corporation (SSB)\nSynovus Financial Corp. (SNV) Trustmark Corp. (TRMK)\nUMB Financial Corp. (UMBF) United Community Banks, Inc. (UCBI)\nThe Committee believes the peer group was indicative of the market in which the Company competed for\nthe employment and retention of executive management in 2023, as such institutions were of similar size and\nhad similar numbers of employees, product offerings and geographic scope.\nThe executive salary and incentive programs are generally targeted to the peer group median for each\ncompensation category in order to be competitive in the market. In cases where an executive’s experiences or\nperformance warrant, the Company may exceed the peer group median. The Company’s incentive programs are\nanalyzed with similar programs of the peer group. The incentive programs are designed for the emphasis of\nperformance-based compensation.\nThe Committee attempts to make compensation decisions consistent with the foregoing objectives and\nconsiderations, including, in particular, market levels of compensation necessary to attract, retain, and motivate\nthe executive officers. Therefore, the aggregate wealth accumulated or realizable by an executive from past\ncompensation grants is considered but not determinative in setting compensation or making additional grants.\nDecisions Regarding Composition of Total Direct Compensation\nThe Company’s executive compensation program consists of a mix of separate components that seek to\nalign the executives’ incentives with increasing shareholder value. For 2023, the Company’s executive incentive\ncompensation program included both non-equity and equity incentive compensation (except in the cases of\nGeorge Makris, Jr., the Company’s executive chairman, whose incentive compensation program includes only\nequity incentive compensation; Mr. Reddin, the Company’s previous chief banking officer, who, due to the\ntiming of his separation from service in July 2023, did not receive a non-equity incentive award; and C. Daniel\nHobbs, the Company’s chief financial officer, who, due to the timing of his hiring in December 2023, did not\nparticipate in any incentive compensation program for 2023). The Company established target allocations of\nnon-equity incentive compensation for participating executive officers. For 2023, for the CEO, the Board set a\ntarget allocation of potential non-equity incentive compensation at 100% of salary. For all participating\nexecutive officers other than the CEO, the Compensation Committee set targets for potential non-equity\nincentive compensation based upon the executive’s scope and performance ranging from 40% to 100% of\nsalary. The Company also established target allocations of equity incentive compensation for all participating\nexecutive officers. For 2023, for the CEO, the Board set a target allocation of potential equity incentive\ncompensation at 135% of salary. For all participating executive officers other than the CEO, the Compensation\nCommittee (or, in the case of the executive chairman, the Board) set targets for potential equity incentive\ncompensation based upon the executive’s scope and performance ranging from 45% to 200% of salary. If\nperformance goals are achieved at the threshold level, the annual grants for equity incentive compensation to\nsuch executives will vest at 75% of target. If performance goals are achieved at the target level, the annual\ngrants for equity incentive compensation to such executives will vest at 100% of target. If performance goals\nare achieved at the maximum level, the annual grants for equity incentive compensation to such executives will\nvest at 150% of target. In recent years, the annual grants for equity incentive compensation have consisted of\nrestricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, performance share unit awards and/or stock options as\nspecified by the Compensation Committee.\n24\nThe compensation of the named executive officers for 2023 was allocated as follows (exclusive, for the\navoidance of doubt, of any bonuses, payments, and/or equity grants received by certain executive officers in\nconnection with their hiring (in the case of Mr. Hobbs), promotion (in the case of Messrs. Fehlman, Brogdon,\nand Rawls), or separation from service (in the case of Mr. Reddin)):\n• Base Salaries plus Bonus: ranges from approximately 34% to 100% of total direct compensation.\n• Cash Incentive Plan: ranges from 0% to approximately 19% of total direct compensation (for 2023,\nmost of these amounts were paid in the discretion of the Compensation Committee (or Board, as\napplicable)).\n• Equity Incentives: ranges from approximately 0% to 66% of total direct compensation.\n“Total direct compensation” means annual base salaries plus bonus plus non-equity and equity incentive\ncompensation, excluding non-recurring, special purpose grants, payments, or bonuses (including, for the\navoidance of doubt, bonuses for the successful completion of mergers and acquisitions). The foregoing\npercentages are based on the grant date fair value of annual compensation (calculated in accordance with\nAccounting Standards Codification Topic 718, Compensation — Stock Compensation). Please refer to the\ndiscussion of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, Compensation — Stock Compensation, which\nprecedes the 2023 Summary Compensation Table, below.\nThe Company emphasizes market practices in the design and administration of its executive\ncompensation program. The Compensation Committee’s philosophy is that incentive pay should generally\nconstitute a significant component of total direct compensation. The executive compensation program utilizes\nstock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance share units, although no stock\noptions or restricted stock awards were issued during 2023. Equity incentive performance measures generally\nshould promote shareholder return and earnings growth, and the plan design should be based upon a direct\nconnection between performance measures, the participant’s ability to influence such measures, and the award\nlevels.\nConsistent with the recommendation of the compensation consultant, the Compensation Committee\nincluded restricted stock units and performance share unit awards as components of the 2023 incentive\ncompensation program.\nExecutive Compensation Program Overview\nThe Company takes shareholder feedback on its compensation programs very seriously. The Company\nappreciates that approximately 95% of shares that voted on the Company’s “say-on-pay” proposal at the 2023\nAnnual Meeting of Shareholders approved the 2022 compensation of the named executive officers, as disclosed\nin the 2023 proxy statement, and the Compensation Committee views this as an indication that the Company\nhas been generally effective in implementing its compensation philosophy and objectives. Nevertheless, the\nCompensation Committee recognizes that executive pay practices and governance continue to evolve, and the\nCompensation Committee is committed to continually evaluating the Company’s practices in this area,\nincluding through the use of advisors, to help ensure that they support the Company’s overall strategic goals.\nThe four primary components of the Company’s executive compensation program are:\n• base salary and bonus,\n• non-equity incentives,\n• equity incentives, and\n• benefits.\n\u0014\u0011\u0003%DVH\u00036DODU\\\u0003DQG\u0003%RQXV\nBase salary is designed to provide competitive levels of compensation to executives based upon their\nexperience, duties, and scope of responsibility. The Company pays base salaries because it provides a basic\nlevel of compensation and is necessary to recruit and retain executives. The Company may use annual base\nsalary adjustments to reflect an individual’s performance or changed responsibilities and to offset cost of living\nincreases. Base salary levels are also used as a benchmark for the amount of incentive compensation\nopportunity provided to an executive. For example, participation in the cash incentive plan (“CIP”) is set within\na range of base salary based upon the executive’s scope of responsibility and the executive’s performance.\n25\nAs discussed above, the Company’s executive compensation program emphasizes targeting the total\namount of compensation to peer group practices with a mix of compensation, including a significant component\nof incentive compensation. At lower executive levels, base salaries represent a larger proportion of total\ncompensation; but at senior executive levels, total compensation contains a larger component of incentive\ncompensation opportunities.\nIn certain years, the Company has issued one-time, discretionary bonuses in special situations, such as in\nconnection with onboarding a new (or promoting an existing) executive or certain mergers and acquisitions.\nWhile the Company does not have a practice of routinely utilizing discretionary bonuses as a significant part of\nthe executive compensation program, the Company does believe that such compensation may be appropriate in\nspecial situations, such as the Company’s successful merger and acquisition activities. In addition, in\nrecent years, competition among financial institutions for key personnel has increased, and, in the Company’s\nexperience, one-time bonuses can be an important and effective tool for recruiting and retaining key personnel\nwho may have other employment opportunities. As a result, the Committee continues to believe the Company\nshould be able to award one-time bonuses where special circumstances warrant and further believes that such\nuse of these types of bonuses is consistent with the practices of many of the Company’s peers (and, again, is\nimportant to maintaining competitive pay practices at the Company). During 2023, the Company issued a cash\nsigning bonus in the amount of $225,000 to C. Daniel Hobbs, the Company’s chief financial officer, in\nconnection with his hiring.\n\u0015\u0011\u00031RQ\u0010(TXLW\\\u0003,QFHQWLYHV\nThe Company uses the CIP as a short-term incentive to encourage achievement of its annual performance\ngoals. The CIP focuses on the achievement of annual financial and operating goals. The CIP is designed to:\n• support strategic business objectives,\n• promote the attainment of specific financial and operating goals for the Company and the executive,\n• reward achievement of specific performance objectives, and\n• encourage teamwork.\nThe CIP is designed to provide executives with market competitive compensation based upon their scope\nof responsibility. The size of an executive’s CIP award is influenced by these factors, market practices,\nCompany performance, and individual performance. The Compensation Committee generally sets the annual\nCIP award for an executive to provide an incentive at the market median for expected levels of performance. All\nof the named executive officers (except Messrs. Makris, Jr., Reddin, and Hobbs) participated in the CIP in 2023.\nAwards earned under the CIP are contingent upon employment with the Company through the end of the\napplicable performance period, except for payments made in the event of death, retirement, or disability.\nThe ultimate amount paid to an executive under the CIP is a function of four variables:\n• the executive’s target award;\n• the metrics (and their associated goals) set for the Company;\n• the payout amounts established by the Compensation Committee which generally correspond to\nThreshold, Target, and Maximum levels of performance; and\n• the Compensation Committee’s determination of the extent to which the goals were met and its\nexercise of any discretionary adjustments.\nFor 2023, company-wide adjusted pre-provision net revenue (“PPNR”) and adjusted efficiency ratio\n(“ER”) were approved as the performance metrics for the CIP for Messrs. Fehlman, Brogdon, Makris III, and\nMassanelli. For Mr. Rawls, PPNR, as well as commercial loan asset quality factors (“AQ Factors”), were\napproved as the performance metrics for the CIP for 2023. The Committee developed corresponding threshold,\ntarget, and maximum performance levels for the PPNR and ER metrics. The Committee also set target annual\nincentive opportunities for each participating named executive officer, measured as a percentage of base salary.\nThreshold and maximum payout opportunities, at 50% and 200% of target, were established for the PPNR and\nER metrics. No portion of the annual incentive payout was guaranteed. If threshold PPNR or threshold ER\nperformance levels were not achieved, no payouts would be made under the CIP for that plan metric.\nAdditionally, for Mr. Rawls, the AQ Factors were\n26\ndeemed to be “make or miss,” with a set payout for performance that met or exceeded the target goal and no\npayout if performance did not meet the target goal. To incent CIP participants to make decisions that have\npositive long-term impact on the Company, even at the expense of short-term results, and to prevent unusual\ngains and losses from having too great an impact on plan payouts, the Compensation Committee retained\ndiscretion to exclude items impacting comparability from company-wide results and adjust actual results for\nspecific items that occurred during the plan year. In addition, the final payouts for certain officers were eligible\nfor negative adjustments based on the actual expenses incurred by their respective departments as compared to\nbudgeted amounts, and the final payouts for all participating named executive officers (except Mr. Rawls) were\neligible for negative adjustments based on certain company-wide asset quality metrics. Further, the\nCompensation Committee reserved the right to adjust the amount payable under the CIP in accordance with any\nstandard or on any other basis as the Compensation Committee may determine. The 2023 CIP design was\ngenerally consistent with the design used in 2022.\nThe Compensation Committee generally sets the performance measures in the first half of each year based\non management’s confidential business plan and budget for the coming year, which typically includes planned\nrevenue growth, cost management and profit goals. The Committee also sets threshold, target, and maximum\nperformance levels where applicable. Maximum performance levels reflect ambitious goals which can only be\nattained when business results are exceptional. Threshold performance levels for the components are usually set\nbased on an analysis of the budget for the coming year or as a percentage of target.\nThe Compensation Committee also assesses actual performance relative to pre-set levels and, in doing so,\ndetermines the amount of any final award payment. In determining final awards and in evaluating performance,\nthe Committee considers adjustments to GAAP net income and other corporate performance measures for\nunplanned, unusual, non-recurring, or other appropriate items.\nEach participant in the CIP is allocated a targeted incentive as a percentage of his or her base salary which\nis payable if and to the extent the Company’s performance satisfies the Target performance level for each\ncomponent under the CIP (or, for the AQ Factors for Mr. Rawls, if the Company’s performance meets or\nexceeds the target goal), subject to Committee adjustment. The table below shows the targeted benefit for the\nparticipating named executive officers for 2023.\nTargeted Benefit Targeted Benefit\nExecutive Name & Title (% of Base Salary ) ($)\nRobert A. Fehlman, Chief Executive Officer 100.00% $750,000\nJames M. Brogdon, President 100.00% $550,000\nGeorge A. Makris III, EVP 50.00% $185,000\nStephen C. Massanelli, SEVP 50.00% $181,000\nChad D. Rawls, EVP 45.00% $150,750\nFor the participating named executive officers (except Mr. Rawls), the identification and weighting of the\nCIP components was uniform and limited to PPNR and ER. For Mr. Rawls, the identification and weighting of\nthe CIP components included PPNR (weighted at 50%) and AQ Factors (weighted at 50%). For certain other\nbusiness executives participating in the plan, the applicable CIP components included other individualized\nperformance criteria related to the executive’s duties or performance components within the business line the\nexecutive manages. Further, the weighting of the CIP components may vary among the other participants in the\nCIP. The weighting of the CIP components for the named executive officers participating in the CIP in 2023\nwas as follows:\nWeighting Weighting\nComponent (participating NEOs ex cept Rawls) (Rawls)\nAdjusted Pre-Provision Net Revenue 50% 50%\nAdjusted Efficiency Ratio 50% 0%\nCommercial Loan Asset Quality Factors 0% 50%\n27\nEach of PPNR and ER has three performance levels that help determine the participant’s payout for that\ncomponent: Threshold, Target and Maximum. Absent exercise of Committee discretion, no payout is earned for\na component if the Company’s performance is below the Threshold. The Company’s performance at the\nThreshold level for a component entitles the participant to 50% of the participant’s targeted benefit times the\nweighting factor for such component. The Company’s performance at the Target level for a component entitles\nthe participant to 100% of the participant’s targeted benefit times the weighting factor for such component. The\nCompany’s performance at the Maximum level entitles the participant to 200% of the participant’s targeted\nbenefit times the weighting factor for such component. Performance in excess of the Maximum does not entitle\nthe participant to a benefit in excess of the maximum benefit times the weighting of that component. If the\nperformance with respect to any component is in excess of the Threshold but less than the Maximum, then the\nparticipant’s entitlement is a prorated percentage computed based upon the Company’s actual performance in\nproportion to the closest performance level for that component.\nThe PPNR component was based upon the Company’s 2023 “adjusted pre-provision net revenue” (net\ninterest income plus noninterest income minus noninterest expense, then adjusted for certain items (on a pre-tax\nbasis), including merger related costs, branch rightsizing costs, early retirement program costs, gain/loss on sale\nof securities, gain on insurance settlement, and FDIC special assessment). For the participating named executive\nofficers, this component was allocated 50% of the participant’s targeted CIP benefit. The performance levels for\n2023 were set by the Compensation Committee considering 2022 results and the Company’s budget for 2023.\nThe PPNR target was set at $410,000,000. The threshold level was set at $369,000,000, and the maximum was\nset at $451,000,000. If 2023 PPNR was below the threshold, there would be no PPNR entitlement (absent the\nexercise of Committee discretion).\nThe ER component was based upon the Company’s adjusted efficiency ratio for 2023. “Adjusted\nefficiency ratio” means non-interest expense (excluding non-recurring items, foreclosed property expense,\namortization of intangibles and goodwill impairments) divided by the sum of net interest income (fully taxable\nequivalent) plus non-interest revenues (excluding gains from securities and non-recurring items). For the\nparticipating named executive officers except Mr. Rawls, this component was allocated 50% of the participant’s\ntargeted CIP benefit (the allocation for Mr. Rawls was 0%). The Committee established a Threshold, Target, and\nMaximum for the ER of the Company. The performance levels for 2023 were set by the Compensation\nCommittee based upon the Company’s internal operating goals and 2023 budget. The Threshold, Target, and\nMaximum were set at 59.4%, 55.4%, and 51.4%, respectively. If 2023 ER was below the threshold, there would\nbe no ER entitlement (absent the exercise of Committee discretion).\nIn addition, for Mr. Rawls, the AQ Factors component was allocated 50% of Mr. Rawls’ targeted CIP\nbenefit and was based upon the following with respect to the commercial loan portfolio:\nAsset Quality Factor (Commercial Loan Portfolio) Target Goal (Commercial Loan Portfolio)\nLoans Past Due 30-89 Days (Excluding Non-Accruals) Less than or Equal to 0.10%\nCriticized Loans to Total Loans Less than or Equal to 3.00%\nNon-Performing Loan Ratio Less than or Equal to 0.40%\nCharge-Offs to Total Loans Less than or Equal to 0.20%\nEach of the above factors was weighted 10% of the targeted benefit allocation attributable to the AQ\nFactors component except for “Charge-Offs to Total Loans,” which had a weighting of 20%. The AQ Factors\nwere deemed to be “make or miss,” with a set payout for performance that met or exceeded the target goal and\nno payout if performance did not meet the target goal.\nEach of the AQ Factors met or exceeded its target goal except “Criticized Loans to Total Loans,” for\nwhich performance did not meet the target goal.\nHowever, threshold performance for the PPNR and ER components was not achieved. As a result, none of\nthe participating named executive officers except Mr. Rawls qualified for payment of a CIP benefit based upon\nthe CIP components previously discussed.\n28\nIn determining the final CIP payout, however, after consultation with its compensation consultant and the\nExecutive Chairman, the Compensation Committee (and, in the case of Mr. Fehlman, the Board) exercised its\ndiscretion, as permitted under the CIP, to allow for a payment to the participating named executive officers (as\nwell as certain other members of management) for 2023. In determining that the use of discretion for 2023 was\nwarranted, the committee considered a variety of factors, including, among others, the outstanding performance\nof the participating named executive officers and other members of management in responding timely and\neffectively to the challenges faced by the Company and the banking industry in general during 2023, the\nfinancial and operational performance of the Company during 2023 amidst those challenges, the Company’s\ncompensation philosophy which includes a commitment to fairness and appropriate flexibility when\ncircumstances require, and the influence of our compensation practices on our ability to attract and retain\nqualified executive leadership. In particular, the Compensation Committee found the following items\nrepresentative of exemplary performance during 2023:\n• 6XFFHVVIXO\u0003([HFXWLRQ\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003%HWWHU\u0003%DQN\u0003,QLWLDWLYH: During 2023, the Company executed its Better\nBank Initiative, a program designed to evaluate and enhance various aspects of the Company’s people,\nprocesses, and systems.

The major components of the LTIP are non-qualified stock\noptions, restricted stock awards (“RSAs”), restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance share units\n(“PSUs”) that are settled in shares of Common Stock based on results over a three-year performance period.\nDuring 2023, shareholders approved the Simmons First National Corporation 2023 Stock and Incentive Plan\n(the “2023 Plan”). As a result, following the date of the 2023 Annual Meeting, LTIP awards are granted under\nthe 2023 Plan. As with the 2015 Plan, the 2023 Plan includes non-qualified stock options, RSAs, RSUs and\nPSUs as available award types.\nNo stock options or RSAs were granted in 2023. PSUs reward the achievement over a 3-year performance\nperiod of specified financial performance criteria specified in the PSU at the time of the grant. Achievement of a\nthreshold level of performance results in a payout equal to 50% of each participant’s approved target\nopportunity. Target performance results in a payout equal to 100% of the targeted opportunity. The maximum\nnumber of shares that can be earned for each of these performance measures is 200% of the targeted number of\nPSUs. The ultimate value of performance shares, which are paid in stock, is also impacted directly by stock\nprice appreciation or depreciation\n30\nover the performance period. Dividend equivalents are paid at the conclusion of the performance period based\non the number of shares actually earned during the applicable performance period. If the performance with\nrespect to any component is in excess of the Threshold and less than the Maximum, then the participant’s\nentitlement is a prorated percentage computed based upon the Company’s actual performance in proportion to\nthe closest performance level for that component. RSUs generally vest in approximately equal installments over\nthree years after the date of grant.\nFor the three-year performance period commencing in 2023 (“2025 Performance Period”), the allocation\nof the equity vehicles under the LTIP is 50% in RSUs and 50% in PSUs (valued at target). Performance does not\nincrease the payout on the portion of the incentive allocated to RSUs, while performance above the Target may\nincrease the payout on PSUs up to 200% of the Target payout level, thereby providing an approximate overall\nlimitation on the LTIP benefits of 150% of Target payout.\nWhen performance-based grants of restricted stock are utilized, the Compensation Committee identifies\nthe specific components of the Company’s financial performance to be used in determining the grants. The\ncomponents are weighted to emphasize the current strategic focus of the Company. The Compensation\nCommittee sets Threshold, Target, and Maximum performance levels for each component which if satisfied will\nentitle the participant to 50%, 100%, and 200%, respectively, of the participant’s targeted benefit attributable to\nthat component. The Company’s performance at the Threshold level for a component entitles the participant to\n50% of the Participant’s target benefit times the weighting factor for such component. The Company’s\nperformance at the Target level for a component entitles the participant to 100% of the Participant’s target\nbenefit times the weighting factor for such component. The Company’s performance at the Maximum level\nentitles the participant to 200% of the Participant’s target benefit times the weighting factor for such component.\nPerformance in excess of the Maximum does not entitle the participant to a benefit in excess of the maximum\ntarget benefit times the weighting of that component. If the performance with respect to any component is in\nexcess of the Threshold and less than the Maximum, then the participant’s entitlement is a prorated percentage\ncomputed based upon the Company’s actual performance in proportion to the closest performance level for that\ncomponent. In determining final awards and in evaluating performance, the Committee considers adjustments to\nGAAP net income and other corporate performance measures for unplanned, unusual, non-recurring, or other\nappropriate items.\n\u0015\u0013\u0015\u0018\u00033HUIRUPDQFH\u00033HULRG\u0003*UDQW\nThe equity incentive granted for the 2025 Performance Period (three-year period 2023-2025) consists of\n50% RSUs and 50% PSUs. The RSUs granted for the 2025 Performance Period are time vested in\napproximately equal installments on the first, second, and third anniversary of the grant date. For the 2025\nPerformance Period, the PSUs were granted to the equity incentive plan participants in January 2023 and will be\npayable in early 2026 after certification of the results of the 2025 Performance Period by the Compensation\nCommittee or, in the case of Messrs.

The weighting of each criterion for\neach of the participating named executive officers is as follows:\nCriterion Weighting\nTBV Growth Ranking 50%\nTSR Ranking 50%\nThe TBV Growth ranking criterion compares the Company’s three-year tangible book value per share\ngrowth during the 2025 Performance Period with the three-year tangible book value per share growth for each\nof the other financial institutions contained in the Company’s peer group used for the Company’s 2023\ncompensation analysis (“Peer Group”). “Tangible book value per share” means the Company’s tangible\ncommon stockholders’ equity (which is the Company’s total common stockholders’ equity minus intangible\nassets) divided by the number of Company shares of common stock outstanding. For the TBV Growth ranking\ncriterion, if the Company’s three-year TBV Growth ranks at the 50th percentile of the financial institutions\ncontained in the Peer Group, target performance for the criterion will be achieved. If the Company’s three-year\nTBV Growth ranks at the 25th percentile of the financial institutions contained in the Peer Group, threshold\nperformance for the criterion will be achieved. If the Company’s three-year TBV Growth ranks at or above the\n75th percentile of the financial institutions contained in the Peer Group, maximum performance for the criterion\nwill be achieved. If the Company’s three-year TBV Growth ranks below the 25th percentile of the financial\ninstitutions contained in the Peer Group, there will be no TBV Growth entitlement (absent exercise of\nCommittee discretion).\nThe TSR ranking criterion compares the TSR for the Company during the relevant performance period\n(which, for the 2023 PSU grants, is the 2025 Performance Period) with the TSR for each of the other financial\ninstitutions contained in the KBW Regional Banking Index (“Index”) during the same period. The TSR for the\nCompany and each of the other financial institutions in the Index are calculated using the first twenty and the\nlast twenty trading days during the relevant performance period (which, again, for the 2023 PSU grants, is the\n2025 Performance Period). For the TSR ranking criterion, if the Company’s TSR ranks at the 50th percentile of\nthe financial institutions contained in the Index, target performance for the criterion will be achieved. If the\nCompany’s TSR ranks at the 25th percentile of the financial institutions contained in the Index, threshold\nperformance for the criterion will be achieved. If the Company’s TSR ranks at or above the 75th percentile of the\nfinancial institutions contained in the Index, maximum performance for the criterion will be achieved. If the\nCompany’s TSR ranks below the 25th percentile of the financial institutions contained in the Index, there will be\nno TSR entitlement (absent exercise of Committee discretion).\nThe PSU payout percentage will (absent exercise of Committee discretion) be the sum of (1) the payout\npercentage for the TBV Growth entitlement multiplied by .50 and (2) the payout percentage for the TSR\nentitlement multiplied by .50; provided that in no event may the PSU payout percentage exceed 200% of the\ntarget.\n2025 Performance Period Performance Criteria\nThreshold Target Maximum\nCriterion (50%) (100%) (200%)\nTBV Growth Ranking 25th Percentile 50th Percentile 75th Percentile\nTSR Ranking 25th Percentile 50th Percentile 75th Percentile\nIn addition, the Compensation Committee periodically utilizes time-vested restricted stock grants in the\nform of RSAs or RSUs (in addition, or as an alternative, to PSUs) in connection with hiring or promoting\nexecutives within the Company and as equity incentives for senior officers below the executive level. During\n2023, 347 Company associates received time-vested RSU grants.\nPlease refer to the section below, “Other Guidelines and Procedures Affecting Executive Compensation”\nfor additional information regarding the Company’s practices when granting stock options and RSUs.\n32\n3HUIRUPDQFH\u0003RI\u0003\u0015\u0013\u0015\u0014\u0003368V\nAs previously described in the Company’s proxy statement for the Company’s 2022 annual shareholders’\nmeeting, as part of the LTIP established by the Compensation Committee in 2021, PSUs with a three-year\nperformance period ending on December 31, 2023 (“2023 Performance Period”) were granted to each of the\nnamed executive officers except Mr. Hobbs (“2021 PSUs”). The performance criteria for the 2021 PSUs\nincluded the Company’s core return on average assets ranking for the 2023 Performance Period (“Core ROAA\nRanking”), which was allocated a 30% weighting, the Company’s core return on tangible common equity\nranking for the 2023 Performance Period (“Core ROTCE Ranking”), which was allocated a 35% weighting, and\nthe Company’s TSR ranking for the 2023 Performance Period (“2023 TSR Ranking”), which was allocated a\n35% weighting. Core ROAA means the Company’s core earnings (net income adjusted to exclude non-core\nitems, including items related to the sale of branches, branch right sizing, the Company’s early retirement\nprogram, and merger-related costs) divided by the average total assets for the period. Core ROTCE means the\nCompany’s core earnings (net income adjusted to exclude non-core items, including items related to the sale of\nbranches, branch right sizing, the Company’s early retirement program, and merger-related costs) adjusted by\nthe amortization of intangibles divided by the average common stockholders’ equity less the average intangible\nassets (goodwill and other intangibles) for the period.\nFor each of the Core ROAA Ranking, Core ROTCE Ranking, and 2023 TSR Ranking, the threshold,\ntarget, and maximum performance levels were 25th percentile, 50th percentile, and 75th percentile, respectively.\nThe Committee certified Core ROAA Ranking attainment at the 24th percentile, which was below the threshold\nperformance level; Core ROTCE Ranking attainment at the 32.3 percentile, which exceeded the threshold but\nwas less than the target performance level; and 2023 TSR Ranking attainment at the 2nd percentile, which was\nbelow the threshold performance level.\nThus, the aggregate payout (taking into account the weightings of the performance criteria) for the 2021\nPSUs was 22.61% of the target benefit.\nPerformance Table for 2021 PSUs\nThreshold Target Maximum 2023 2023\nBenefit Level[1] 50% 100% 200% Result s Benefit L evel\nCore ROAA Ranking 25th Percentile 50th Percentile 75th Percentile 24th Percentile 0%\nCore ROTCE Ranking 25th Percentile 50th Percentile 75th Percentile 32.3 Percentile 64.6%\n2023 TSR Ranking 25th Percentile 50th Percentile 75th Percentile 2nd Percentile 0%\nAggregate Benefit[2] 22.61%\n________________________\n[1] The percentage shown is the percentage of the target benefit for a performance criterion earned for\nperformance of the criterion at the designated level.\n[2] The percentage shown is the percentage of the target benefit earned for performance of the above three\nperformance criteria at the designated levels based upon a 30% weighting for Core ROAA Ranking, a 35%\nweighting for Core ROTCE Ranking, and a 35% weighting for 2023 TSR Ranking.\n\u0017\u0011\u0003%HQHILWV\nA. Profit Sharing and Employee Stock Ownership Plan\nThe Company previously offered a combination profit sharing and employee stock ownership plan. This\nplan was open to substantially all of the employees of the Company including the named executive officers. The\nplan and the contributions to the plan were designed to provide for retirement benefits to employees and allow\nthe employees of the Company to participate in the ownership of stock in the Company. During 2016, the\nCompany terminated this plan and merged it into the Company’s 401(k) Plan.\nB. 401(k) Plan and Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nThe Company offers a qualified 401(k) Plan in which it makes matching contributions to encourage\nemployees to save money for their retirement. Additionally, the Company may make profit-sharing\ncontributions to the plan which are allocated among participants based upon plan compensation without regard\nto participant\n33\ncontributions. This plan, and the contributions to it, enhance the range of benefits offered to executives and\nenhance the Company’s ability to attract and retain employees. Under the terms of the 401(k) Plan, employees\nmay defer a portion of their eligible pay, up to the maximum allowed by I.R.S. regulation, and the Company\nmatches 100% of the first 3% of eligible compensation and 50% of the next 2% of eligible compensation for a\ntotal match of 4% of eligible pay for each participant who defers 5% or more of his or her eligible pay.\nAdditionally, for 2023, the Compensation Committee approved a discretionary contribution of 1.32% of\naggregate associate compensation into the 401(k) Plan based upon the Company’s performance, which is\nexpected to be made in the first quarter of 2024. Account balances under the 401(k) Plan are fully vested at all\ntimes.\nAdditionally, under the current Simmons First National Corporation First Amended and Restated 2015\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan, the Company offers a convenient method for eligible employees of the\nCompany and its subsidiaries to purchase shares of Common Stock at a favorable price through payroll\ndeductions. As described below in Proposal 5, the Company is seeking shareholder approval to amend and\nrestate the current plan to increase the number of offerings, to increase the aggregate number of shares reserved\nfor issuance, and to extend the term of the plan.\nC. Perquisites and Other Benefits\nHistorically, perquisites and other benefits have represented a small part of the overall compensation\npackage and generally are offered only after consideration of business need. The Compensation Committee\nannually reviews the perquisites and other personal benefits that are provided to senior management. The\nprimary perquisites include cell phone stipends, club memberships, and certain relocation and moving expenses.\nIn some cases, the Company, rather than (or in addition to) administering separate perquisite programs for\nparticular officers, will provide a cash stipend to an executive officer to cover the approximate costs of such\nitems. The stipends are taxable income to the officers who receive them and are generally uniform in amount for\nofficers with similar duties and responsibilities.\nIn addition, the Company has purchased bank owned life insurance on the lives of certain of the named\nexecutive officers and has entered into split dollar life insurance agreements with each of the participating\nnamed executive officers that provide a defined, lump sum life insurance benefit upon the death of the officer to\nsuch officer’s designated beneficiary or estate. The Company also permits executive officers (and directors) to\nuse Company aircraft for personal purposes, provided that those executives (and directors) reimburse the\nCompany for the Company’s incremental cost of such use (with certain exceptions). All executive officers and\ndirectors who used the Company aircraft for personal purposes during 2023 reimbursed the Company for the\nCompany’s incremental cost of such use.\nD. Post-Termination Compensation\nDeferred Compensation Arrangements. In 2023, the Company maintained certain non-qualified deferred\ncompensation arrangements designed to provide supplemental retirement pay from the Company to certain of\nthe executive officers. Five of the named executive officers had such agreements with the Company during\n2023. The Deferred Compensation Agreements for Messrs. Makris, Jr., Brogdon, Fehlman, Makris III, and\nReddin are non-qualified defined benefit type plans (although Mr. Reddin’s plan was forfeited upon his\nseparation from service from the Company). The Company bears the entire cost of benefits under these plans.\nThe Company provides these retirement benefits in order to attract and retain executives. The amounts payable\nto the participants under these plans are determined by each plan’s benefit formula, which is described in the\nsection of this proxy statement titled “Pension Benefits Table.” In January 2024, the Company entered into a\ndeferred compensation arrangement with Mr. Hobbs that is consistent with the arrangements discussed in this\nparagraph.\nAdditionally, in 2017, the Company adopted the Simmons First National Corporation Deferred\nCompensation Plan (“NQDC Plan”). The NQDC Plan is as a non-qualified deferred compensation plan in the\nform of an excess contribution plan primarily open to executive officers and other highly compensated\nindividuals whose compensation exceeds the annual tax code limit on compensation that can be taken into\naccount for purposes of contributions to the Company’s 401(k) Plan. Under the NQDC Plan, participants may\nmake contributions of up to 90% of Plan Compensation on a nonqualified basis. The Company’s matching\ncontribution under the plan is limited to 4% of Excess Compensation, provided the executive officer has elected\na deferral rate on Excess Compensation of at least 5% for the year. “Plan Compensation” includes base salary,\nbonus, commissions and cash\n34\nincentive pay; and “Excess Compensation” is the amount of Plan Compensation that exceeds the compensation\nlimits under the federal tax laws applicable to qualified retirement plans. Additionally, for 2023, the\nCompensation Committee approved a discretionary contribution of 1.32% of participating associates’ eligible\ncompensation into the NQDC Plan based upon the Company’s performance, which is expected to be made in\nthe first quarter of 2024.\nThe NQDC Plan provides for discretionary non-elective Company contributions to the accounts of the\nparticipants, as well. Benefits under the NQDC Plan are fully vested at all times and are payable only upon\nseparation from service according to the 409A compliant distribution election made by the executive officer\nupon election to participate in the plan.\nChange in Control Agreements. The Company has entered into Change in Control Agreements (“CIC\nAgreements”) with certain members of senior management of the Company and its subsidiaries, including each\nof the named executive officers (although Mr. Reddin’s CIC Agreement was terminated in connection with his\nseparation from service in July 2023, and Mr. Hobbs’s CIC Agreement was executed in January 2024). The\nCompany entered into the CIC Agreements because the banking industry has been consolidating for a number\nof years, and it does not want its executives distracted by a rumored or actual change in control. Further, if a\nchange in control should occur, the Company wants its executives to be focused on the business of the\norganization and the interests of shareholders. In addition, it is important that the executives can react neutrally\nto a potential change in control and not be influenced by personal financial concerns. The Company believes the\nCIC Agreements are consistent with market practice and assist the Company in retaining its executive talent.\nThe level of benefits for the named executive officers ranges from two to three times certain elements of their\ncompensation which the Compensation Committee believes is competitive with the banking industry as a whole\nand specifically with the designated peer group.\nUpon a change in control, followed by a termination of the executive’s employment by the Company\nwithout “Cause” or by the executive after a “Trigger Event” within a specified time, the CIC Agreements\nrequire the Company to pay or provide the following to the executive:\n• a lump sum payment equal to two or three times the sum of the executive’s base salary (the highest\namount in effect anytime during the twelve months preceding the executive’s termination date) and the\nexecutive’s incentive compensation (calculated as the higher of the target CIP for the year of\ntermination or the average of the executive’s last two years of actual CIP awards); and\n• only in the case of Mr. Fehlman, up to three years of additional coverage under the Company’s health,\ndental, life and long-term disability plans, as well as a payment to reimburse the executive for any\nexcise taxes on severance benefits that are considered excess parachute payments under Sections 280G\nand 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the “Code”) plus income and employment taxes\non such tax gross up as well as interest and penalties imposed by the IRS.\nIn addition, upon a change in control, all outstanding stock options vest immediately and all restrictions\non restricted stock lapse. Restricted stock units vest if the employee is terminated within one year of the change\nin control. In the case of PSUs, if the change in control occurs after the first nine months of the applicable\nperformance period then the PSU will vest and be payable at the target benefit level, with the remaining portion\nof the PSU terminated. Also, any CIP benefits become payable at the target benefit level and are pro-rated for\nthe period elapsed. Further, upon a change in control, the requirement under the deferred compensation\nagreements for Messrs. Makris, Jr., Brogdon, Fehlman, Makris III, Hobbs, and Reddin (while Mr. Reddin’s\nagreement was in effect) that the participant remain employed until retirement age (age 60 for Messrs. Fehlman,\nBrogdon, Makris III, Hobbs, and Reddin, and age 65 for Mr. Makris, Jr.) is void, and the benefit is immediately\nvested.\nThe Company believes that CIC Agreements should encourage retention of the executives during the\nnegotiation and following a change in control transaction, compensate executives who are displaced by a\nchange in control and not serve as an incentive to increase an executive’s personal wealth. Therefore, the CIC\nAgreements require that there be both a change in control and an involuntary termination without “Cause” or a\nvoluntary termination within six months after a “Trigger Event” which is often referred to as a “double-trigger.”\nThe double-trigger ensures that the Company will become obligated to make payments under the CIC\nAgreements only if the executive is actually or constructively discharged as a result of the change in control.\n35\nAfter a prior review of the existing CIC Agreements, the Company adopted a policy not to approve any\nnew CIC Agreements containing a single trigger or a tax gross-up feature or any amendments to existing CIC\nAgreements to implement a single trigger or tax gross-up feature. The Compensation Committee reviews the\nchange in control arrangements annually and makes adjustments from time to time to ensure that they are\nconsistent with its compensation philosophies, current market practices, and assigned duties and responsibilities.\nOther Payments and Awards\nDuring 2023, the Company issued a severance payment in the amount of $1,000,000 to Matthew\nS. Reddin in connection with his termination without cause and in exchange for a customary, general waiver and\nrelease of claims, as well as post-employment covenants with respect to confidential information, non-\ncompetition, and non-solicitation of certain customers and employees.\nTo incent Mr. Hobbs to join the Company, in December 2023, the Company issued Mr. Hobbs an award\nof 21,000 RSUs (having a grant-date fair value of $356,580), which will vest on a pro-rata basis over five years.\nAdditionally, in connection with the promotions of Mr. Fehlman to chief executive officer and Mr. Brogdon to\npresident and chief financial officer that became effective on January 1, 2023, the Company issued Messrs.\nFehlman and Brogdon 17,521 and 13,141 PSUs, respectively (and having grant-date fair values of $400,705 and\n$291,862, respectively) (collectively, the “Promotional PSUs”). The Promotional PSUs are structured in the\nsame manner as those PSUs discussed in the section of this proxy statement captioned “2025 Performance\nPeriod Grant” above. Further, in connection with Mr. Rawls’ transition from chief credit officer to chief\ncommercial banking officer that was effective during 2023, the Company issued Mr. Rawls 3,000 RSUs (having\na grant-date fair value of $51,060), of which 25% vest on the first anniversary of the grant, 25% vest on the\nsecond anniversary of the grant, and 50% vest on the third anniversary of the grant.\nOther Guidelines and Procedures Affecting Executive Compensation\nStock-Based Compensation Procedures Regarding Compensation Committee and Board Approval. The\nCompensation Committee approves all grants of stock-based compensation, except that any proposed stock-\nbased compensation to the CEO or the Executive Chairman is originated and recommended by the\nCompensation Committee and then submitted to the Board for approval. Grants to the CEO or the Executive\nChairman may or may not occur simultaneously with grants to other executives. Prospective grants of stock-\nbased compensation to other executives are proposed to the Compensation Committee by the CEO and/or the\nExecutive Chairman. The Committee considers, modifies, if necessary, and acts upon the proposed grants.\nStock-Based Compensation Procedures Regarding Timing and Pricing of Awards. The Company’s\npolicy is to make grants of stock options only at current market prices. Historically, the exercise price of stock\noptions was set at the closing stock price on the day prior to the date of grant. Options granted under the 2023\nPlan (if any) will have the exercise price set at the closing stock price on the date of the grant. The Company\ndoes not grant “in-the-money” options or options with exercise prices below market value at the time of the\ngrant. The Company’s general policy is to consider equity grants at scheduled meetings of the Compensation\nCommittee, and such grants are either effective on the approval date or a specified future date. For performance-\nbased grants, based upon the Company’s results for the prior year, the Committee has typically approved such\ngrants in January or February pursuant to authority delegated to it by the Board. The Company may make grants\nat other times throughout the year, upon due approval of the Compensation Committee or the Board, in\nconnection with grants to the CEO, the Executive Chairman, or to other executives in non-routine situations,\nsuch as the hiring, promotion or retention of an executive officer or in connection with an acquisition\ntransaction.\nThe Company schedules grants of equity awards at generally consistent times throughout the year. The\nCompany does not time or plan the release of material, non-public information for the purpose of affecting the\nvalue of executive compensation.\nRole of Executive Officers in Determining Executive Compensation. The Compensation Committee\noversees the administration of executive compensation plans, including the design, performance measures and\naward opportunities for the executive incentive programs, and certain employee benefits, subject to final action\nby the Board in certain cases. The Board, upon approval and recommendation from the Compensation\nCommittee, determines and approves all compensation and awards to the CEO and the Executive Chairman.\nThe\n36\nCompensation Committee determines and approves all compensation and awards to the other executive officers.\nThe Committee reviews the performance and compensation of the CEO and the Executive Chairman. The CEO,\nthe Executive Chairman, and/or the President, with the assistance of the associates in the Company’s Human\nResources Department, review the performance and compensation of the other executive officers, including the\nother named executive officers, and provide their perspectives and report any significant issues or deficiencies\nto the Committee. The Human Resources Department regularly reviews the unified compensation classification\nprogram of the Company which sets the compensation of all employees of the Company and its affiliates. The\nCompany’s executive compensation decisions are based in part on peer data provided by the compensation\nconsultant. Executive officers generally do not otherwise determine or make recommendations on the amount or\nform of executive compensation.\nAdjustments to Incentive Compensation as a Result of Financial Inaccuracies. The Board has adopted a\ncompensation clawback policy which provides for the recoupment, under certain conditions, of certain\nincentive-based compensation (as defined in the policy) in the event of an accounting restatement (as defined in\nthe policy). The Company’s cash and equity incentive plans, including the 2023 Plan, incorporate the\ncompensation clawback policy into all awards under the plans.\nShare Ownership Guidelines. The Company encourages directors and executive officers to be\nshareholders. The Company believes that share ownership by directors and executives is a contributing factor to\nenhanced long-term corporate performance. Although the directors and named executive officers (other than\nMr. Hobbs) already have an equity stake in the Company (as reflected in the beneficial ownership information\ncontained in this Proxy Statement), the Company has adopted share ownership guidelines for directors and\ncertain officers.\nMembers of the Company’s board of directors are required to own shares of Common Stock with a value\nequal to at least three times the annual equity retainer paid to the director for service on the board, and directors\nare generally given five years to comply with the stock ownership requirement. Directors are not required to\npurchase shares to reach this guideline but are restricted (with limited exceptions) from liquidating shares\nreceived as equity-based compensation until the ownership guideline is satisfied.\nOfficers designated as executive vice president or above are subject to minimum stock ownership\nrequirements. The minimum stock ownership requirement for the Chief Executive Officer and the Executive\nChairman is the number of shares and certain other equity instruments which, when valued in accordance with\nthe stock ownership guidelines, equals five (5) times his or her base salary, while the requirement for all other\ncovered officers is the number of shares and certain other equity instruments which, when valued in accordance\nwith the stock ownership guidelines, equals three (3) times his or her base salary. Compliance will be tested\nannually based upon the officer’s salary as of January 1 of such year. Officers will be given five (5) years to\ncomply with the stock ownership guidelines, after which time, if they are in noncompliance, they will be\nrestricted (with limited exceptions) from liquidating certain shares received as equity-based compensation until\nthe ownership guidelines are satisfied.\nTax Considerations\nThe Company regularly analyzes the tax effects of various forms of compensation and the potential for\nexcise taxes to be imposed on the executive officers which might have the effect of frustrating the Company’s\ncompensation objectives. The following provisions of the Code have been considered.\nSection 162(m). Section 162(m) of the Code provides that compensation in excess of $1 million paid for\nany year to a corporation’s chief executive officer and the four other highest paid executive officers at the end of\nsuch year will not be deductible for federal income tax purposes. The Compensation Committee currently\nbelieves, however, that it is generally in the Company’s best interest for the Compensation Committee to retain\nflexibility to develop appropriate compensation programs and establish appropriate compensation levels. As a\nresult, the Compensation Committee awards compensation that is not fully deductible under\nSection 162(m) when it believes it is in the best interest of the Company to do so, as it has done in recent years\nwith respect to the named executive officers’ compensation.\nSections 280G and 4999. The Company provides the named executive officers with change in control\nagreements as described in the section of this proxy statement titled “Changes in Control.” One of the change in\ncontrol agreements provides for tax protection in the form of a gross-up payment to reimburse the executive for\nany excise tax under Code Section 4999 as well as any additional income and employment taxes resulting from\nsuch reimbursement. Code Section 4999 imposes a 20% non-deductible excise tax on the recipient of an “excess\nparachute\n37\npayment” and Code Section 280G disallows the tax deduction to the payor of any amount of an excess\nparachute payment that is contingent on a change in control. A payment as a result of a change in control must\nexceed three times the executive’s base amount in order to be considered an excess parachute payment, and then\nthe excise tax is imposed on the parachute payments that exceed the executive’s base amount. The intent of the\ntax gross-up is to provide a benefit without a tax penalty to the executive who is displaced in the event of a\nchange in control. The Company believes the provision of tax protection for excess parachute payments for one\nof its executive officers is consistent with the historic market practice within the banking industry, is a valuable\nincentive in retaining executives and is consistent with the objectives of the Company’s overall executive\ncompensation program (as previously discussed, though, the Company no longer provides for “gross-up”\npayments in new change in control agreements).\nSummary\nIn summary, the Company believes this mix of salary, formula-based cash incentives for short-term\nperformance, and equity-based compensation for long-term performance motivates the Company’s management\nteam to produce strong returns for shareholders. Further, in the view of the Compensation Committee, the\noverall compensation program appropriately balances the interests and needs of the Company in operating its\nbusiness with appropriate employee rewards based on enhancing shareholder value.\nCompensation Committee Report\nThe Compensation Committee reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis\nincluded in this Proxy Statement with management. Based on such review and discussion, the Compensation\nCommittee recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this\nProxy Statement for filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nSubmitted by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.\n6XVDQ\u0003/DQLJDQ\u000f\u0003&KDLU -D\\\u0003'\u0011\u0003%XUFKILHOG 6WHYHQ\u0003$\u0011\u0003&RVVp\n-HUU\\\u0003+XQWHU 5REHUW\u0003/\u0011\u00036KRSWDZ 0LQG\\\u0003:HVW\nRELATIONSHIP OF COMPENSATION POLICIES AND PRACTICES TO RISK MANAGEMENT\nThe Company intends that total compensation and each of its components, including base salary, bonus,\nincentive compensation (if applicable), retirement and other benefits should be market competitive and\nconsistent with the Company’s performance goals. The Company seeks to attract, retain, develop and reward\nhigh performing associates who are committed to the Company’s success. Base salaries are set based upon the\njob classification, and incentive compensation (if applicable) is based on Company and individual performance.\nThe Company has not identified any compensation practice or policy that presents risks that are\nreasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company strives to ensure that its\ncompensation programs do not create inappropriate risks for the Company. As a part of its general review of the\nCompany’s compensation programs, the Compensation Committee:\n• Reviews with management the Company’s employee compensation plans to take reasonable steps to\nidentify and limit any unnecessary risks that these plans pose to the Company;\n• Reviews with management the compensation plans for the named executive officers and makes\nreasonable efforts to ensure that these plans do not encourage the named executive officers to take\nunnecessary and excessive risks; and\n• Reviews with management the Company’s compensation programs to help identify and revise any\nfeatures in the compensation programs that would encourage the misstatement or manipulation of the\nCompany’s financial information or reported earnings to enhance employee compensation.\nThe reviews include consideration of risks in all compensation programs and factors designed to mitigate\nrisks in such programs. The Company has a compensation clawback policy which provides for the recoupment,\nunder certain conditions, of certain incentive-based compensation (as defined in the policy) in the event of an\naccounting restatement (as defined in the policy). The Company’s cash and equity incentive plans, including the\n2023 Plan, incorporate the compensation clawback policy into all awards under the plans.\n38\nSUMMARY OF COMPENSATION AND OTHER PAYMENTS TO THE NAMED\nEXECUTIVE OFFICERS\nOverview The following sections provide a summary of cash and certain other amounts paid for the year\nended December 31, 2023, to the named executive officers. Except where noted, the information in the\nSummary Compensation Table generally pertains to compensation to the named executive officers for the year\nended December 31, 2023. The compensation disclosed below is presented in accordance with SEC regulations.\nAccording to those regulations, the Company is required in some cases to include:\n• amounts paid in previous years;\n• amounts that may be paid in future years, including amounts that will be paid only upon the occurrence\nof certain events, such as a change in control of the Company or the satisfaction of certain performance\nrequirements;\n• amounts paid to the named executive officers which might not be considered “compensation” (for\nexample, distributions of deferred compensation earned in prior years, and at-market earnings,\ndividends or interest on such amounts);\n• an assumed value for share-based compensation equal to the fair value of the grant as presumed under\naccounting regulations, even though such value presumes the option will not be forfeited or exercised\nbefore the end of its 10-year life, and even though the actual realization of cash from the award\ndepends on whether the stock price appreciates above its price on the date of grant, whether the\nexecutive will continue his employment with the Company and when the executive chooses to exercise\nthe option; and\n• the increase in present value of future pension payments, even though such increase is not cash\ncompensation paid this year and even though the actual pension benefits will depend upon a number of\nfactors, including when the executive retires, his compensation at retirement and in some cases the\nnumber of years the executive lives following his retirement.\nTherefore, you are encouraged to read the following tables closely. The narratives preceding the tables\nand the footnotes accompanying each table are important parts of each table. Also, you are encouraged to read\nthis section in conjunction with the discussion above at “Compensation Discussion and Analysis.”\n\u0015\u0013\u0015\u0016\u00036800$5<\u0003&203(16$7,21\u00037$%/(\nThe following table provides information concerning the compensation of the named executive officers\nfor (as applicable) 2021, 2022, and 2023, the most recently completed fiscal year. The column “Salary”\ndiscloses the amount of base salary paid to the named executive officer for each year. The column “Bonus”\ndiscloses cash amounts paid to named executive officers as discretionary bonuses. In the columns “Stock\nAwards” and “Option Awards,” SEC regulations require the disclosure of the award of stock or options at the\ngrant date fair value measured in dollars and calculated in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification\nTopic 718, Compensation — Stock Compensation (“Topic 718”). For restricted stock and PSUs, the Topic 718\nfair value per share is based on the closing price of the stock on the date of grant. For stock options, the\nTopic 718 fair value per share is based on certain assumptions which are explained in Note 15 to the Company’s\nfinancial statements which are included in the annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 27,\n2024. The amounts shown in the Summary Compensation Table include the fair value of the option grants, RSU\ngrants and PSU grants in the year of grant, without regard to any deferred vesting. Please also refer to the\nsecond table in this Proxy Statement, “Grants of Plan-Based Awards”.\nRSAs may vest on a single date or may vest on multiple dates over an extended period after the date of\ngrant. RSAs are conditioned on the participant’s continued employment with the Company and may also have\nadditional restrictions, including performance conditions. Restricted stock allows the participant to vote and\nreceive dividends prior to vesting.\nRSUs are a contingent right to receive shares of the Company’s stock upon satisfaction of certain vesting\ncriteria. RSUs may vest on a single date or may vest on multiple dates over an extended period after the date of\ngrant. RSUs are conditioned on the participant’s continued employment with the Company and may also have\nadditional restrictions, including performance conditions. RSUs do not allow the participant to vote or receive\n39\ndividends prior to vesting. While no dividends are paid on the shares underlying the RSUs, the RSU program\nmay provide for a cash bonus after vesting in an amount equal to the dividends which would have been earned\non the shares during the period from grant until issuance.\nPSUs represent the right to receive a share of stock upon the Company’s satisfaction of certain specified\nperformance criteria. The performance period for the PSUs is generally three years but may be shorter. The\nPSUs typically vest after the end of the performance period following certification by the Compensation\nCommittee at which time the shares earned under the PSU, if any, are paid to the participant. PSUs are\nconditioned on the participant’s continued employment with the Company and satisfaction of specified\nperformance criteria but may have additional restrictions. PSUs do not allow the participant to vote the\nunderlying shares. While no dividends are paid on the shares underlying the PSUs, the PSU program may\nprovide for a cash bonus after vesting in an amount equal to the dividends which would have been earned on the\nshares during the performance period.\nThe column “Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation” discloses the dollar value of all earnings for\nservices performed during the fiscal year pursuant to awards under non-equity incentive plans, including the\nCIP (except as otherwise indicated). Whether an award is included with respect to any particular fiscal year\ndepends on whether the relevant performance measure was satisfied during the fiscal year. For example, the CIP\nawards are annual awards and the payments under those awards are made based upon the achievement of\nfinancial results measured as of December 31 of each fiscal year; accordingly, the amount reported for CIP\ncorresponds to the fiscal year for which the award was earned even though such payment was made after the\nend of such fiscal year.\nThe column “Change in Pension Value and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings,” discloses the\nsum of the dollar value of (1) the aggregate change in the actuarial present value of the named executive\nofficer’s accumulated benefit under all defined benefit and actuarial pension plans (including supplemental\nplans) in effect during the indicated years; and (2) any above-market or preferential earnings on nonqualified\ndeferred compensation, including on nonqualified defined contribution plans. The annual increase in the present\nvalue of the benefits for the named executive officers under their deferred compensation plans is disclosed in\nthis column.\nThe column “All Other Compensation” discloses the sum of the dollar value of:\n• perquisites and other personal benefits, or property, unless the aggregate amount of such compensation\nis less than $10,000;\n• all “gross-ups” or other amounts reimbursed during the fiscal year for the payment of taxes, if any;\n• amounts paid or which became due related to termination, severance or a change in control, if any;\n• the contributions to vested and unvested defined contribution plans;\n• any life insurance premiums paid during the year for the benefit of a named executive officer; and\n• any dividends paid on unvested shares of restricted stock.\n40\n2023 SUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE\nChange in\nPension\nValue and\nNonqualified\nNon-Equity Deferred\nStock Option Incentive Plan Compensatio n All Other\nName and Salary Bonus[a] Awards Awards Compensation Earnings Compensation Total\nPrincipal Position Year ($) ($) ($)[b] ($)[b] ($) ($) ($)[c] ($)\nRobert 2023 $ 750,000 $268,004 $1,414,990 $0 $ 0 $393,300 $ 95,114 $2,921,407\nA.

Reddin was established\nin 2017 and was designed to work with the other retirement arrangements of the Company, on an aggregated\nbasis with Social Security benefits, to provide a targeted level of benefits for Mr. Reddin. The Reddin Plan\nrequired Mr. Reddin to remain in the employ of the Company until he attains age 60 to be eligible to receive\nbenefits under the agreement, provided that in the event of a change in control the benefits were to be fully\nvested. The Reddin Plan provided a benefit upon normal retirement at or after age 60, or upon death or\ndisability prior to age 60, a monthly sum equal to one twelfth (1/12) of thirty percent (30%) of the final average\ncompensation (the average compensation paid to him by the Company for the most recent five consecutive\ncalendar years). The benefit payments would have begun on the first day of the seventh month following\nretirement, death or disability and continued for 180 consecutive months. Compensation for purposes of the\nReddin Plan included salary, bonus and short-term incentive compensation programs (CIP), but excludes equity\ncompensation plans (stock options, RSAs,\n48\nRSUs and PSUs) and long-term incentive compensation programs. Because Mr. Reddin separated from service\nwith the Company in July 2023 without meeting the qualifications necessary to receive a benefit, Mr. Reddin is\nno longer eligible to receive any benefit under the Reddin Plan.\n2023 PENSION BENEFITS\nPresent\nNumber of Value of th e Payments\nYears Credite d Accumulated During Las t\nService Benefit Fiscal Year\nName Plan Name (#) ($) ($)\nGeorge A.

The NQDC Plan is an excess contribution\nplan primarily open to executive officers and other highly compensated individuals whose compensation\nexceeds the annual tax code limit on compensation that can be taken into account for purposes of contributions\nto the Company’s 401(k) Plan. Under the NQDC Plan, participants may make contributions of up to 90 percent\nof Plan Compensation on a nonqualified basis. The Company’s matching contribution under the plan is limited\nto four percent (4%) of Excess Compensation, provided the Executive Officer has elected a deferral rate on\nExcess Compensation of at least five percent (5%) for the year. “Plan Compensation” includes base salary,\nbonus, commissions and cash incentive pay; and “Excess Compensation” is the amount of Plan Compensation\nthat exceeds the compensation limits under the federal tax laws applicable to qualified retirement plans.\nThe NQDC Plan provides for discretionary non-elective Company contributions to the accounts of the\nparticipants at the discretion of the Company. For 2023, the Company made a discretionary contribution at a\nformula rate of 1.32% of 2023 Plan Compensation reduced by the amount of the discretionary contribution to\nthe 401(k) Plan based upon the same formula rate. The Company matching and discretionary contributions were\ncredited to the accounts in the first quarter of 2024 but are reflected in the “Aggregate Balance at December 31,\n2023” column in the table below. See footnote [d] to the table below.\nThe assets of the NQDC Plan are held in an irrevocable trust.

However,\nin accordance with SEC regulations, no amounts to be provided to a named executive officer under any\narrangement which does not discriminate in scope, terms, or operation in favor of the executive officers and\nwhich are available generally to all salaried employees are reported.\n50\nFor the purpose of the quantitative disclosure in the following table, and in accordance with SEC\nregulations, the termination is assumed to have taken place on the last business day of the Company’s most\nrecently completed fiscal year, and the price per share of the Common Stock is the closing market price as of\nthat date — $19.84.\nCash Payments. None of the named executive officers presently has an employment agreement which\nguarantees him employment for any period of time. Therefore, any post-termination payments of salary or\nseverance to any named executive officer would be provided only if offered under any Company broad-based\nseverance plan in the event of a reduction in force or other termination by the Company without cause which is\ndiscretionary in nature or pursuant to a Change in Control Agreement (“CIC Agreement”).\nThe Company has entered into CIC Agreements with certain executives of the Company and the\nsubsidiary bank pursuant to which the Company would pay certain salary benefits. As of December 31, 2023,\nthe Company had CIC Agreements with Messrs. Makris, Jr., Fehlman, Brogdon, Makris III, Rawls, and\nMassanelli (Mr. Hobbs did not enter into a CIC Agreement until January 2024). The Company would make\nsuch payments only if there is a change in control and if the Company terminates an executive without “Cause”\nwithin twenty-four months of a CIC or the executive resigns within six months after a “Trigger Event.” The\nCompany will pay an amount up to three times, in the case of Mr. Makris, Jr., and two times for all other named\nexecutive officers, the sum of (1) highest annual base salary for the previous twelve months and (2) the greater\nof the projected target annual incentive to be paid under the CIP for the current year, or the average CIP bonus\npaid to the executive over the preceding two years. The termination compensation is payable in cash within\n30 business days following the termination, unless the participant is a Specified Employee, as defined in\nSection 409A of the Code, in which case the termination compensation shall be payable on the first day of the\nseventh month after termination.\nThe CIC Agreement for Mr. Fehlman will also provide the executive with continuing coverage under the\nCompany’s medical, dental, life insurance, and long-term disability plans for three years following the change\nin control date. Additionally, if Mr. Fehlman is over 55 years of age, the CIC Agreement allows the executive,\nat his election, to continue medical, dental, and life insurance coverage after the initial three-year period, at the\nexecutive’s cost, if the executive is not then eligible to be covered by a similar program maintained by the\ncurrent employer of the executive or the executive’s spouse. Finally, the CIC Agreement for Mr. Fehlman\nrequires the Company to make a tax “gross-up” payment in the event any of the foregoing benefits subject the\nexecutive to the excise tax on excess parachute payments as determined under Sections 280G and 4999 of the\nCode (notably, the Company no longer provides for “gross-up” payments in new CIC agreements). Please also\nrefer to the discussion of the CIC Agreements above at “Compensation Discussion and Analysis.”\nAccelerated Vesting of Incentives. The Company has provided and continues to provide equity and non-\nequity incentives to the named executive officers through the Company’s executive stock incentive plans,\nincluding the 2023 Plan and the 2015 Plan (provided that the Company now only provides new incentives\nthrough the 2023 Plan), and the CIP. Please also refer to the discussion of equity and non-equity incentives\nabove at “Compensation Discussion and Analysis.”\nEquity Incentives — Stock Options. Unvested stock options vest upon the named executive officer’s\ndeath or disability or upon the officer’s involuntary termination of service within one year after a change in\ncontrol. Further, unvested stock options vest upon the retirement of a named executive officer after age 65 or\nafter age 62 with ten years of service. Upon any other termination, the executive forfeits his unvested stock\noptions, unless the Compensation Committee takes specific action to vest some or all of the unvested options.\nThe value of accelerated options was calculated by multiplying the number of shares times the difference\nbetween the closing price of the Common Stock on the last business day of 2023 and the exercise price of the\noptions. Please refer to the discussions above at “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” for more information\nabout stock options.\nEquity Incentives — Restricted Stock Units. Upon the retirement (after age 65 or after age 62 with\nten years of service), death or disability of a named executive officer, the vesting of unvested RSUs is\naccelerated to the date of such event. Further, unvested RSUs will vest if, within one year after a change in\ncontrol, the named executive officer is involuntarily terminated. Upon any other termination, the named\nexecutive officer forfeits his unvested RSUs, unless the Compensation Committee takes specific action to vest\nsome or all of the unvested stock. Accordingly, the table below reflects the accelerated vesting of this stock\nupon retirement, death, or disability of the named executive officer or a change in control.\n51\nEquity Incentives — Performance Share Units. Unvested PSUs vest upon the named executive officer’s\ndeath or disability. Upon a change in control, unvested PSUs vest if the change in control occurs after\nnine months have elapsed in the performance period, otherwise the unvested PSUs are terminated. Further,\nunvested PSUs vest pro rata based on the period of employment during the performance period upon the\nretirement of a named executive officer after age 65 or after age 62 with ten years of service. Upon any other\ntermination, the executive forfeits his unvested PSUs, unless the Compensation Committee takes specific action\nto vest some or all of the unvested PSUs. Accordingly, the table below reflects the accelerated vesting of the\nPSUs upon the named executive officer’s retirement (if he or she has met the qualifying criteria), upon death or\ndisability, or upon a change in control in compliance with the rules set forth above. An executive forfeits all\nundistributed PSUs upon the termination of the executive’s employment for all other reasons.\nNon-Equity Incentives — CIP. Upon a change in control, the CIP benefit will be accelerated and\npayable on a pro-rata basis based on the target level benefit. For purposes of the disclosure in the table below,\nSEC regulations require that such change in control be assumed to occur on the last day of the Company’s most\nrecently completed fiscal year, which coincides with the last day of the performance period under CIP for 2023.\nAs a result of such assumption, the table below reflects the acceleration of the full value of the target level\nbenefit. However, in the case of retirement, death, or disability, the CIP benefit will not be accelerated but will\nbe payable (in the case of retirement, on a pro-rata basis) based on the actual benefit level achieved. Therefore,\nthese amounts would not be increased or enhanced as a result of the executive’s departure. The amounts earned\nunder the CIP for 2023 are reported in the Summary Compensation Table.\nRetirement Arrangements — Makris, Jr. Plan , Brogdon Plan, Fehlman Plan, Makris III Plan, and Reddin\nPlan. Upon a change in control, the sole participant under each of the Makris, Jr. Plan, Brogdon Plan, Fehlman\nPlan, and Makris III Plan, Mr. Makris, Jr., Mr. Brogdon, Mr. Fehlman, and Mr. Makris III, respectively, will\nbecome fully vested in the benefits under such plans. Payment of the benefits would commence on the first day\nof the seventh calendar month following the executive’s termination of services to the Company. In the absence\nof a change in control, upon the death or disability of the participant or the executive’s retirement at or after age\n60 for Mr. Brogdon, Mr. Fehlman, and Mr. Makris III, and age 65 for Mr. Makris, Jr., each participant’s benefits\nunder the respective plans will become fully vested and will become payable commencing on the first day of the\nseventh month after such event. In the event of the termination of the participant’s employment under any other\nconditions prior to the executive’s attaining age 60 for Mr. Brogdon, Mr. Fehlman, and Mr. Makris III, and age\n65 for Mr. Makris, Jr., all benefits under the respective plans are forfeited. For purposes of the disclosure in the\ntable below, SEC regulations require that such change in control be assumed to occur on the last day of the most\nrecently completed fiscal year. As a result of such assumption, each participant would become fully vested in\nthe benefits under the executive’s plan. Because Mr. Reddin separated from service with the Company in\nJuly 2023 without meeting the qualifications necessary to receive a benefit, Mr. Reddin is no longer eligible to\nreceive any benefit under the Reddin Plan.\nMiscellaneous Benefits. Under the CIC Agreements, which are discussed above at “Compensation\nDiscussion and Analysis,” the Company is obligated to pay certain other benefits. This includes continuation of\nmedical, dental, life, and long-term disability insurance coverage for three years from the date of the change in\ncontrol and certain tax gross-up payments for Mr. Fehlman. The conditions to the Company’s obligations under\nthe CIC Agreements are discussed above. Except for the benefits payable under the CIC Agreements, the\nCompany has no obligation to continue any other perquisites after a named executive officer’s employment\nterminates.\n52\nIn addition, as described in the “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” section above, the Company has\npurchased bank owned life insurance that provides a defined, lump-sum death benefit for certain of the named\nexecutive officer’s designated beneficiary or estate.\nChange in\nControl With\nInvoluntary and Without\nNot for Cause Trigger Event\nExecutive Benefits and Payments upon Termination Retirement Termination Termination Death/Disability\nGeorge A.

These amounts are attributable to the vesting of unvested restricted stock\n(including, where appropriate, RSUs and PSUs) and stock options, as of December 31, 2023. In the case of\na change in control, these amounts also include the acceleration of the full value of the target level benefit\nunder the 2023 CIP award. In the case of retirement, RSUs and PSUs do not vest unless the named\nexecutive officer has attained either age 65 or age 62 with ten years of service. As of December 31, 2023,\nonly Messrs. Makris, Jr. and Massanelli had met the qualifying retirement criteria for RSU and PSU\nretirement vesting. In the case of disability, PSUs with a performance period ending on December 31, 2023\nare valued using the actual number of shares that vested, and PSUs with performance periods ending after\nDecember 31, 2023 are valued using the maximum number of shares which may vest. In the case of death,\nPSUs with a performance period ending on December 31, 2023 are valued using the actual number of\nshares that vested, and PSUs with performance periods ending after December 31, 2023 are valued using\nthe maximum number of shares which may vest. In the case of retirement, PSUs with a performance period\nending on December 31, 2023 are valued using the actual number of shares that vested, and PSUs with\nperformance periods ending after December 31, 2023 are valued using the maximum number of shares\nwhich may vest and prorating the value based on a retirement date of December 31, 2023.\n[c] Because Mr. Makris, Jr. has attained age 65, he becomes fully vested in the benefit under the Makris, Jr.\nPlan upon his retirement, death, disability, or a change in control. The monthly benefit would commence\non the seventh month after his termination of service. The information related to the Makris, Jr. Plan is also\ndisclosed in the Pension Benefits Table. The value disclosed is the present value of Mr. Makris, Jr.’s\nbenefit, fully vested as of December 31, 2023.\n[d] Had Messrs. Makris, Jr., Brogdon, Fehlman, Makris III, Massanelli, or Rawls died on December 31, 2023,\nthe death benefits payable under the bank owned life insurance to their designated beneficiaries or estates\nwould have been $2,547,000, $890,000, $1,650,000, $610,000, $660,000, and $533,000 respectively.\n[e] Under the Change in Control Agreements (“CIC”) between certain named executive officers and the\nCompany, upon the occurrence of a change in control and a qualifying termination, severance cash\npayments will consist of two times the sum of the following items: (1) the highest annual base salary for\nthe previous twelve months and (2) the greater of the projected target annual incentive to be paid under the\nCIP for the current year, or the average CIP bonus paid to the executive over the prior two years.\n[f] The named executive officer’s benefit under the Brogdon Plan, Fehlman Plan, or Makris III Plan (as\napplicable) does not vest until he attains age 60; however, he becomes fully vested upon his death,\ndisability, or a change in control. The monthly benefit would commence on the seventh month after his\ntermination of service. The information related to the Brogdon Plan, Fehlman Plan, and Makris III Plan is\nalso disclosed in the Pension Benefits Table. The value disclosed is the present value of his benefit, fully\nvested as of December 31, 2023.\n[g] The amounts related to Other Benefits and Tax Gross-Up for a change in control include the costs\nassociated with continued participation in the Company’s health and welfare benefit plans for a period of\n36 months under the applicable CIC Agreement. The amount related to the tax gross-up ($1,710,591) is a\nreimbursement for certain taxes that would be applicable to the payments and accelerated benefits\noccurring upon a change in control.\n[h] Upon a change in control, Mr. Fehlman would receive a monthly benefit of $1,224.92 for the next\n36 months for purposes of continued health and welfare benefits under the CIC.\n[i] Because Mr. Reddin separated from service with the Company in July 2023, the table only shows\nMr. Reddin’s payments in connection with involuntary not for cause termination. The amount shown\nreflects a $1,000,000 severance payment to Mr. Reddin.\n54\n2023 PAY RATIO DISCLOSURE\nAs required by Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information:\nFor fiscal 2023, our last completed fiscal year:\n• The median of the annual total compensation of all employees of our company (other than\nMr. Fehlman), was $65,149; and\n• The annual total compensation of Mr. Fehlman, our CEO, was $2,921,407.\nBased on this information, the ratio for 2023 of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the median\nof the annual total compensation of all employees is 45 to 1.\nWe completed the following steps to identify the median of the annual total compensation of all our\nemployees and to determine the annual total compensation of our median employee and CEO:\n• As of December 31, 2023, our employee population consisted of approximately 3,016 individuals,\nincluding full-time, part-time, temporary, and seasonal employees employed on that date.\n• To find the median of the annual total compensation of all our employees (other than our CEO), we\nused wages from our payroll records as reported to the Internal Revenue Service on Form W-2 for\nfiscal 2023. In making this determination, we annualized the compensation of full-time and part-time\npermanent employees who were employed on December 31, 2023, but did not work for us the entire\nyear. No full-time equivalent adjustments were made for part-time employees.\n• We identified our median employee using this compensation measure and methodology, which was\nconsistently applied to all our employees included in the calculation.\n• After identifying the median employee, we added together all of the elements of such employee’s\ncompensation for 2023 in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K,\nresulting in annual total compensation of $65,149.\nWith respect to the annual total compensation of our CEO, we used the amount reported in the “Total”\ncolumn for 2023 of our Summary Compensation Table.\nThis ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules based on our payroll\nrecords and the methodology described above. The SEC rules for identifying the median employee and\ncalculating the pay ratio based on that employee’s annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety\nof methodologies, to apply certain exclusions and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect\ntheir compensation practices. As such, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the\npay ratio reported above, as other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and\nmay utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios.\nPAY VERSUS PERFORMANCE DISCLOSURES\n3D\\\u00039HUVXV\u00033HUIRUPDQFH\u00037DEOH\nAs required by Section 953(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and\nItem 402(v) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the relationship between\nexecutive compensation actually paid and certain financial performance of the Company.

The Company maintains an equity\ncompensation program for its non-employee directors. In accordance with SEC regulations, outright grants of\nstock are valued in accordance with the terms of the plan and consistent with Topic 718, at the closing price of\nthe stock on the date of grant.\nAll non-employee directors receive an annual equity retainer (of approximately $60,000, for 2023) for\nservice on the Board, payable in restricted stock units that vest in four substantially equal installments. In order\nfor an installment to vest, the director must be serving on the Board at the scheduled time of vesting. The first\ninstallment vests as of the grant date, and the second, third, and fourth installments vest on July 3, 2023;\nOctober 2, 2023; and January 2, 2024, respectively. The RSUs were issued on May 3, 2023 (following the\ndirectors’ reelection to the Board) under the 2023 Plan and valued at the closing price of the Common Stock on\nthat date, $15.77. If a director joins the Board in between annual meetings of shareholders, the annual retainer is\nprorated and paid in cash.\nNon-employee directors also receive a cash retainer for their service on the Board and the board of\nSimmons Bank. For 2023, non-employee directors serving on committees also received an annual cash retainer\nfor service on the committee as set forth in the table below (unless the director elected to receive such retainers\nin RSUs). Committee chairs received an enhanced retainer due to their increased responsibilities. For any\ndirector appointed to the Board or to a committee during the year, the cash retainers are prorated based upon the\nremaining period of service.\nCommittee Member Retainer Chair Retainer\nAudit $15,000 $30,000\nCompensation $10,000 $20,000\nExecutive $10,000 $30,000\nNominating & Corporate Governance $10,000 $20,000\nRisk $10,000 $35,000\n61\nThe Company maintains a voluntary deferred compensation plan in which non-employee directors may\ndefer receipt of any part or all of their respective directors’ fees, including retainer fees, meeting fees and\ncommittee fees. The director must elect to participate in the plan prior to the calendar year for which the\ndeferral will be applicable. Upon election, a director must elect the form of payment (lump sum or annual\ninstallments over two to five years) and the date of payment (attainment of a specified age or cessation of\nserving as a director of the Company). The sums deferred under the plan are credited to an account for the\ndirector along with earnings on the deferred sum at an interest rate equal to the yield on the ten-year\nU.S. Treasury bond, computed quarterly. The plan was frozen with respect to new deferrals for director fees, as\nwell as closed to new participants, in December 2022.

We believe\nthat our compensation policies and procedures are centered on pay-for-performance principles and are strongly\naligned with the long-term interests of our shareholders.\nAs required by SEC regulations, the Company is presenting the following proposal, which gives you as a\nshareholder the opportunity to approve or disapprove our pay program for named executive officers by voting\nfor or against the resolution set forth below (“say-on-pay” vote). While the vote on the resolution is advisory in\nnature and will not bind the Company to take any particular action, the Compensation Committee and the Board\nintend to carefully consider the shareholder vote resulting from the proposal in making future decisions\nregarding the Company’s compensation program. The Company anticipates that the next “say-on-pay” vote will\noccur at the 2025 annual shareholders’ meeting.\n“RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Company’s named executive officers, as disclosed in the\nProxy Statement pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis,\nthe compensation tables and narrative discussion, is hereby APPROVED.”\nTHE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT SHAREHOLDERS VOTE FOR\nPROPOSAL 3.\nAUDIT COMMITTEE\nDuring 2023, the Audit Committee was composed of Robert L.

The aggregate fees billed to the Company by FORVIS for\nsuch services in 2022 were $0.\nAll Other Fees\nThere were no fees billed to the Company by FORVIS during 2023 or 2022 for services other than those\nset forth above.\nShareholder ratification of the Audit Committee’s selection of FORVIS as our independent auditors for\nthe year ending December 31, 2024, is not required by the Company’s by-laws or otherwise. Nonetheless, the\nBoard has elected to submit the selection of FORVIS to our shareholders for ratification. If the selection of\nFORVIS as our independent auditors for the year ending December 31, 2024, is not ratified, the matter will be\nreferred to the Audit Committee for further review.\nRepresentatives of FORVIS are expected to be at the annual meeting, will have an opportunity to make a\nstatement if they desire, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.\nTHE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT SHAREHOLDERS VOTE FOR\nRATIFICATION OF THE SELECTION OF FORVIS AS THE COMPANY’S INDEPENDENT AUDITORS\nFOR 2024.\nPROPOSAL 5 — APPROVAL OF THE\nSIMMONS FIRST NATIONAL CORPORAT ION\nSECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED 2015 EMPLOYEE STOCK P URCHASE PLAN\nThe Company is asking shareholders to approve the Simmons First National Corporation Second\nAmended and Restated 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “Second A&R ESPP”), which amends and\nrestates the current plan to increase the number of offerings from 20 to 40, to increase the aggregate number of\nshares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Common Stock”) reserved for\nissuance from 500,000 shares to 800,000 shares, and to extend the term of the plan. The purpose of the proposed\namendments is to provide the Company with the ability to continue to make available a convenient method for\neligible employees of the Company and its subsidiaries to purchase shares of Common Stock at a favorable\nprice through payroll deductions and to ensure that the Company has a sufficient reserve of Common Stock\navailable under the plan to accommodate participation by eligible employees in plan offerings. The plan is\nintended to qualify as an “employee stock purchase plan” under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code (the\n“Code”).\nThe plan was originally adopted as the Simmons First National Corporation 2015 Employee Stock\nPurchase Plan (the “ESPP”), which was approved by shareholders with an effective date of June 1, 2015. The\nESPP was amended and restated as the Simmons First National Corporation First Amended and Restated 2015\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan (the “First A&R ESPP”) to increase the number of offerings from 10 to 20, to\nincrease the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance under the plan from 200,000\nshares (on a split-adjusted basis) to 500,000 shares, and to extend the term of the plan. The First A&R ESPP\nwas approved by shareholders with an effective date of April 17, 2019.\n65\nThe Second A&R ESPP was approved by the Board, subject to shareholder approval, on December 19,\n2023, based upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee (for purposes of this discussion, the\n“Committee”). Subject to approval by shareholders at the 2024 annual meeting, the Second A&R ESPP will\nbecome effective as of April 23, 2024. If the Second A&R ESPP is approved by shareholders, the Company\nintends to register the additional 300,000 shares available under the plan with the SEC pursuant to a registration\nstatement on Form S-8 shortly after the annual meeting.\nUnder the Second A&R ESPP, as under the prior versions of the plan, the Company will offer eligible\nemployees the opportunity to purchase shares of Common Stock under the plan (each such opportunity, an\n“Offering”). The Committee will determine the purchase price of the shares of Common Stock to be sold under\neach Offering (the “Purchase Price”) in accordance with the limitations set forth in the plan.\nThe opportunity to purchase shares of the Company’s Common Stock through the plan is intended to\nprovide an incentive to Company employees, who contribute and are expected to contribute materially to the\ncontinued success of the Company. The plan is a part of the Company’s competitive total compensation policy\nfor all employees. In addition, the Board believes the plan supports broad-based employee ownership in the\nCompany, and provides a convenient method for achieving such ownership that aligns the economic interests of\nthe employees with shareholders. In the Board’s opinion, employee participation in the plan has contributed to\nthe Company’s growth and success and is expected to continue to do so in the future. Thus, the Board considers\napproval of the Second A&R ESPP critical to the Company’s ability to continue to execute its strategic plans.\nThe significant terms of the Second A&R ESPP are described in this Proxy Statement. This description is\nonly a summary and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Second A&R ESPP, which is included in\nAppendix A to this Proxy Statement.\nSummary of Amendments\nThe Second A&R ESPP includes the following amendments to the First A&R ESPP, which have been\napproved by the Board subject to approval of the shareholders at the 2024 annual meeting:\n• Increases the number of Offerings under the plan from 20 to 40;\n• Increases the number of shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance under the plan from 500,000\nshares to 800,000 shares; and\n• Extends the plan’s term for conducting Offerings by ten years from the current expiration date of\nMarch 15, 2025 to March 15, 2035.\nKey Data\nAs of March 4, 2024, 125,396,745 shares of Common Stock were outstanding and the closing market\nprice per share of the Company’s Common Stock as reported on the Nasdaq stock market was $18.78. The\n500,000 shares currently reserved for issuance under the First A&R ESPP represent 0.40% of the outstanding\nshares on that date. If the Second A&R ESPP with the additional 300,000 shares had been in effect as of\nMarch 4, 2024, the aggregate 800,000 shares reserved for issuance under the plan would have represented\n0.64% of the outstanding shares on that date.\nIn determining the number of additional shares of Common Stock to request under the Second A&R\nESPP, the Board evaluated a number of factors, including the size of the Company’s employee population, the\nCompany’s recent share usage under the First A&R ESPP and the anticipated share usage under the Second\nA&R ESPP. The current offering period under the First A&R ESPP began on January 2, 2024; on that date,\nthere were 94,897 shares of Common Stock available for issuance under the plan. If the Second A&R ESPP is\nnot approved, the Company estimates that it would not have sufficient shares remaining under the First A&R\nESPP to continue offering opportunities to purchase shares under the plan following the current offering period,\nassuming the Company continues to conduct Offerings and grant options consistent with employees’ historical\nusage and the Company’s expected practices, and noting that future circumstances may require the Company to\nmake changes to its expected practices. In light of the factors described above, and the fact that the Board views\nthe ability to\n66\ncontinue to offer an employee stock purchase plan as critical to the Company’s ability to continue to attract and\nretain employees in the competitive labor markets in which the Company operates, the Board has determined\nthat the size of the requested share reserve under the Second A&R ESPP is reasonable and appropriate at this\ntime.\nSummary of the Plan\nAdministration. The S econd A&R ESPP will be administered by the Committee, which is composed\nentirely of independent non-employee directors who are not eligible to participate in the plan. The Committee\nhas the authority, subject to the terms of the Second A&R ESPP, to (i) determine the employees who are eligible\nto participate, (ii) determine the Purchase Price for each Offering, consistent with the provisions of the plan,\n(iii) establish applicable terms and limitations applicable to each Offering, consistent with the provisions of the\nplan, (iv) adopt, alter, and repeal administrative rules and procedures governing the plan, (v) interpret the terms\nand provisions of the plan, and (vi) otherwise supervise the administration of the plan. All determinations by the\nCommittee pursuant to the provisions of the Second A&R ESPP shall be made in its discretion and shall be\nconclusive.\nShares Subject to the Plan. Sub j e ct to adjustment as described in the plan, the aggregate number of\nshares reserved for issuance under the Second A&R ESPP is 800,000 shares, which is an increase of 300,000\nshares over the number of shares reserved for issuance under the First A&R ESPP. The proposed 800,000 share\nlimit under the Second A&R ESPP includes the shares that have been issued under the plan since inception\nthrough March 4, 2024. Shares to be delivered under the Second A&R ESPP may be issued directly by the\nCompany or obtained through purchases on the open market or otherwise.\nIn the event of any change in the Common Stock through a recapitalization, merger, consolidation, stock\ndividend or split, combination of shares or otherwise, the Committee may make such equitable adjustments to\nthe plan and to any then-current Offering as it deems necessary and appropriate. These adjustments may include\nchanging the number of shares of Common Stock reserved under the plan and changing the Purchase Price for\nthe then-current Offering.\nEligibility. Prio r to each Offering under the Second A&R ESPP, the Committee will specify the\neligibility criteria to participate in the Offering. Generally, all employees of the Company and its subsidiaries\nwill be eligible, provided that the following employees may be excluded from participation in an Offering:\n(i) employees who have been employed less than 2 years, (ii) employees whose customary employment is\n20 hours or less per week, (iii) employees whose customary employment is 5 months or less in any calendar\nyear, and (iv) certain highly compensated employees. No employee will be eligible to participate in the Second\nA&R ESPP if the employee owns (or would own after participating in an Offering) more than five percent (5%)\nof the shares of the Company. As of March 4, 2024, approximately 3,015 employees of the Company would be\neligible to participate in the Second A&R ESPP.\nOfferings. The S econd A&R ESPP provides for purchase of the Common Stock by eligible employees\nthrough a maximum of 40 Offerings, which is an increase of 20 Offerings over the number permitted under the\nFirst A&R ESPP. Each of the Offerings will be open for a 12 month period (the “Offering Period”). The\nCompany may make more than one Offering during any calendar year.\nPurchase of Shares. An e l igible employee may participate in an Offering by authorizing at any time\nprior to the first day of the Offering Period a payroll deduction in a dollar amount not exceeding any limitation\nset forth for the Offering by the Committee or, in the event the employee is participating in more than one\nOffering during any calendar year, a cumulative sum of $25,000 per calendar year, provided that the maximum\nnumber of shares of Common Stock that may be acquired by any employee in any calendar year under the\nSecond A&R ESPP is limited to that number of shares of Common Stock (rounded down to a whole number of\nshares) equal to $25,000 divided by the fair market value of the Common Stock determined on the first day of\nthe Offering Period of the first Offering for each calendar year in which the employee participates (“Share\nLimitation”). At the beginning of each Offering Period, a participating employee is granted an option to\npurchase such shares of Common Stock.\n67\nEach participating employee may at any time during an Offering Period increase, decrease or suspend his\nor her payroll deductions, or may withdraw from participation in the Offering. Under current rules established\nby the Committee, payroll deductions may not be changed more than once in each Offering Period and\nwithdrawal requests (effective on the last day of the Offering Period) must be received on or before the last day\nof such Offering Period.\nAt the end of each Offering Period, the balance of each participating employee’s aggregated payroll\ndeduction account will be applied toward the purchase of the largest number of whole shares of Common Stock\npossible, subject to application of the Share Limitation. Any remaining funds will be refunded to the\nparticipating employee. Common Stock purchased under the plan will be delivered to each participating\nemployee’s account at the securities brokerage firm designated by the Company to maintain employee stock\naccounts.\nPurchase Price. The C ommittee will determine the Purchase Price of the shares of Common Stock to\nbe sold under each Offering. The Purchase Price will not be less than the lesser of (i) 85% of the fair market\nvalue of the Common Stock at the time the option is granted at the beginning of the Offering Period, or (ii) 85%\nof the fair market value of the Common Stock at the time such option is exercised at the end of the Offering\nPeriod. In general, the “fair market value” of a share of Common Stock on a given date is defined as the last\nreported sale price of a share of Common Stock on the previous trading day, or if no sale took place, the last\nreported sale price of a share of Common Stock on the most recent day on which a sale took place, as recorded\non the Nasdaq stock market.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee is authorized to use different Purchase Price formulas for\nseparate Offerings, so long as each price formula complies with the parameters set forth above.\nShare Proration. If th e number of shares of Common Stock that participating employees become\nentitled to purchase is greater than the number of shares of Common Stock available, the Committee will\nallocate the available shares fairly and equitably among such participating employees.\nTransferability. A p a r ticipating employee may not transfer his or her options or other rights under the\nSecond A&R ESPP other than upon death. During his or her lifetime, a participating employee’s options and\nother rights under the Second A&R ESPP are exercisable only by the employee or by the employee’s guardian\nor legal representative, if applicable.\nTermination of Employment. In th e event of a participating employee’s retirement, death, disability or\nother termination of employment, his or her participation in any offering under the Second A&R ESPP will\ncease, no further amounts will be deducted pursuant to the plan, and the balance in the employee’s payroll\ndeduction account will be paid to the employee, or, in the event of the employee’s death, to his or her designated\nbeneficiary or, if none, to his or her estate.\nAmendment or Termination of the Plan. The B oard may amend or terminate the Second A&R ESPP\nat any time. However, any amendment approved by the Board would also require approval by the Company’s\nshareholders if the amendment would materially: (i) increase the benefits accruing to participants under the\nplan, (ii) modify the requirements as to eligibility for participation in the plan, (iii) increase the number of\nshares of Common Stock that may be issued under the plan, (iv) increase the cost of the plan to the Company or\n(v) alter the allocation of plan benefits among participating employees.\nDuration. Unl e s s terminated sooner by the Board as described above, no offering under the Second\nA&R ESPP will be commenced after March 15, 2035, provided that the plan will terminate earlier in the event\nall of the Common Stock reserved for issuance under the plan has been purchased.\nFederal Income Tax Consequences\nThe discussion below is a brief summary of the United States federal income tax consequences to\nparticipating employees and to the Company, based on current statutes, regulations and interpretations as\ncurrently in effect. This summary does not address foreign, state or local income tax consequences or gift,\nestate, employment or other non-income tax consequences. Participating employees should consult with their\nown tax advisors with respect to the tax consequences of participating in the Second A&R ESPP.\n68\nAmounts withheld from a participating employee’s compensation through payroll deductions under the\nSecond A&R ESPP will constitute ordinary income for federal income tax purposes in the year in which such\namounts would otherwise have been paid to the employee. Such amounts will be subject to normal employment\nand income tax withholdings. However, a participating employee will generally not recognize any income for\nfederal income tax purposes either on the grant of an option or upon the issuance of any shares of Common\nStock under the Second A&R ESPP.\nUnder Section 423 of the Code, the federal income tax consequences incurred upon disposition of shares\nof Common Stock acquired under the plan depend upon how long a participating employee holds the shares. If\nthe employee disposes of shares acquired under the Second A&R ESPP (other than a transfer by reason of\ndeath) less than one year after the exercise date at the end of the Offering Period or less than two years after the\ngrant date at the beginning of the Offering Period (a “disqualifying disposition”), an amount equal to the excess\nof the fair market value for each share over the Purchase Price will be treated as ordinary income for federal\nincome tax purposes in the taxable year in which the disposition takes place. The amount of such ordinary\nincome will be added to the participant’s basis in the shares, and any additional gain or resulting loss recognized\nupon such disposition of a share after such basis adjustment will constitute a capital gain or loss. If the\ndisposition occurs more than one year after the exercise date, the capital gain or loss will be a long-term capital\ngain or loss; if the disposition occurs one year or less after the exercise date, the capital gain or loss will be a\nshort-term capital gain or loss.\nIf a participating employee disposes of any shares acquired under the Second A&R ESPP after the one-\nyear and two-year holding periods described above (a “qualifying disposition”), the employee will recognize\nordinary income equal to the lesser of (a) the amount, if any, by which the fair market value of the shares at the\ngrant date exceeds the Purchase Price (but no less than zero), or (b) the amount, if any, by which the fair market\nvalue of the shares at the time of disposition (generally the sale price) exceeds the Purchase Price. The amount\nof any such ordinary income will be added to the participant’s basis in the shares, and any additional gain or\nresulting loss recognized on the disposition of the shares after such basis adjustment will constitute a long-term\ncapital gain or loss. If the sale price is less than the Purchase Price, the participating employee will not\nrecognize ordinary income, but will recognize a long-term capital loss equal to the difference between the sale\nprice and the Purchase Price.\nIf a participating employee dies while owning shares purchased under the Second A&R ESPP, then the\nemployee’s final income tax return must include ordinary income equal to the lesser of (a) the amount, if any, by\nwhich the fair market value of the shares at the grant date exceeds the Purchase Price (but no less than zero), or\n(b) the amount, if any, by which the fair market value of the shares at the time of death exceeds the Purchase\nPrice. When the shares are sold, the amount of any such ordinary income will be added to the participant’s basis\nin the shares, and any additional gain or resulting loss recognized on the disposition of the shares after such\nbasis adjustment will be treated as a capital gain or loss.\nThe Company generally may not take an income tax deduction with respect to the grant of any option, the\nissuance of any shares of Common Stock under the Second A&R ESPP or the disposition of any shares\nacquired under the Second A&R ESPP in a qualifying disposition. However, if an employee disposes of shares\npurchased under the Second A&R ESPP in a disqualifying disposition, the Company may take an income tax\ndeduction in the year of the disposition in an amount equal to the amount constituting ordinary income to the\nemployee.\nHistorical Plan Benefits\nThe following table indicates the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock purchased under the plan\nsince inception through December 31, 2023 by (i) each of the Company’s current named executive officers, (ii)\nall current executive officers as a group, and (iii) all employees who are not current executive officers as a\ngroup. No shares of Common Stock have been purchased under the plan by any individual director or director\nnominee who is not an employee or by the current non-employee directors as a group (with the exception of\nMarty Casteel, who purchased 654 shares during the time he was employed by the Company). Other than as\nreported for Mr. Makris, Jr. and Mr. Makris III in the following table, no shares of Common Stock have been\npurchased under the plan by an associate of any current executive officer, current director, or current director\nnominee. No person has received 5% or more of the total shares of Common Stock purchased under the plan\nsince its inception.\n69\nAggregate Purchases from Plan Inception through December 31, 2023\nAggregate Number\nName and Position of Purchased Shares\nNamed Executive Officers\nRobert A.

In addition, participation levels depend on each eligible\nemployee’s election to participate and level of contributions, and the per-share Purchase Price depends on the\nfuture value of the Company’s Common Stock. No options or other rights have been granted with respect to the\nadditional 300,000 shares under the Second A&R ESPP for which shareholder approval is being sought. As a\nresult, the Company cannot determine the benefits or amounts that will be received by any eligible employee or\ngroups of eligible employees if the Second A&R ESPP is approved by shareholders. Therefore, any benefits or\namounts that will be received by any participant or groups of participants if the Second A&R ESPP is approved\nare not currently determinable.\n70\nEQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN INFORMATION\nThe following table sets forth information as of December 31, 2023 with respect to compensation plans\nunder which equity securities of the Company are authorized for issuance.

In the event that the Company did not hold an annual meeting of the shareholders in the prior year\nor if the first anniversary of the prior year’s annual meeting of the shareholders is more than 30 days before or\nafter the date of the current year’s annual meeting of the shareholders, the shareholder’s notice is timely only if\nit is delivered to the Company’s Corporate Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company no later\nthan the 10th day after the Company publicly announces the date of the current year’s annual meeting of the\nshareholders or the 90th day before the date of the current year’s annual meeting of the shareholders, whichever\nis later.

Makris III, Secretary\nPine Bluff, Arkansas\nMarch 20, 2024\n74\nAppendix A\nSIMMONS FIRST NATIONAL CORPORATION\nSECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED\n2015 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN\nThe Simmons First National Corporation 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan was adopted by the Board\nof Directors (“Board”) of Simmons First National Corporation (“Company”) on December 15, 2014, with an\neffective date of June 1, 2015. The First Amended and Restated 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan was\nadopted by the Board of Directors of the Company on December 13, 2018 and approved by the shareholders of\nthe Company on April 17, 2019. This Second Amended and Restated 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\n(“Plan”) was adopted by the Board on December 19, 2023. The Plan will become effective upon approval by\nthe Company’s shareholders.\n1. 3XU S R VH\u0003RI\u00033ODQ\u0011 The p urpose of the Plan is to provide eligible employees of the Company and its\nsubsidiaries, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, a convenient opportunity to purchase shares of common\nstock of the Company through annual offerings financed by payroll deductions. As used in this Plan,\n“subsidiary” means a corporation or other form of business association of which shares (or other ownership\ninterests) having 50% or more of the voting power are, or in the future become, owned or controlled, directly or\nindirectly, by the Company.\n2. 4XD O L ILFDWLRQ\u0011 The P lan is not qualified under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986\n(“Code”) and is not subject to any provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974\n(“ERISA”). It is the Company’s intention for the Plan to qualify as an “employee stock purchase plan” under\nSection 423 of the Code, and the provisions of the Plan shall be construed so as to extend and limit participation\nin a manner consistent with the requirements of that Section of the Code.\n3. $GP L QLVWUDWLRQ\u0011 The P lan is administered by the Compensation Committee, which consists of at\nleast two or more members of the Board, none of whom are eligible to participate in the Plan and all of whom\nare “non-employee directors,” as such term is defined in Rule 16b-3(b)(3) of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“1934 Act”). The Compensation\nCommittee shall prescribe rules and regulations for the administration of the Plan and interpret its provisions.\nThe Compensation Committee may correct any defect, reconcile any inconsistency or resolve any ambiguity in\nthe Plan. The actions and determinations of the Compensation Committee on matters relating to the Plan are\nconclusive. The Compensation Committee and its members may be addressed in care of the Company at its\nprincipal office. The members of the Compensation Committee do not serve for fixed periods but may be\nappointed or removed at any time by the Board.\n4. 6WRF N \u00035HVHUYDWLRQ\u0011 An a g gregate of 800,000 shares of Class A, $0.01 par value, common stock of\nthe Company (“SFNC Stock”) is available for purchase under the Plan. Shares of SFNC Stock which are to be\ndelivered under the Plan may be obtained by the Company by authorized purchases on the open market or from\nprivate sources, or by issuing authorized but unissued shares of SFNC Stock. In the event of any change in the\nSFNC Stock through recapitalization, merger, consolidation, stock dividend or split, combination or exchanges\nof shares or otherwise, the Compensation Committee may make such equitable adjustments in the Plan and the\nthen outstanding offering as it deems necessary and appropriate including, but not limited to, changing the\nnumber of shares of SFNC Stock reserved under the Plan and the price of the current offering. If the number of\nshares of SFNC Stock that participating employees become entitled to purchase is greater than the number of\nshares of SFNC Stock available, the available shares shall be allocated by theCompensation Committee among\nsuch participating employees in such manner as it deems fair and equitable. No fractional shares of SFNC Stock\nshall be issued or sold under the Plan.\n5. (OLJ L E LOLW\\\u0003WR\u00033DUWLFLSDWH\u0011 All e m ployees of the Company and such of its subsidiaries as shall be\ndesignated by the Compensation Committee will be eligible to participate in the Plan. Each offering may\nexclude from participation in the offering (i) employees who have been employed less than 2 years, (ii)\nemployees whose customary employment is 20 hours or less per week, (iii) employees whose customary\nemployment is for not more than 5 months in any calendar year, and (iv) highly compensated employees (within\nthe meaning of section 414(q) of the Internal Revenue Code. No employee shall be eligible to participate in the\nPlan if, immediately after an option is granted under the Plan, the employee owns more than five percent (5%)\nof the total combined voting power or value of all classes of shares of the Company or of any parent or\nsubsidiary of the Company.\nA-1\n6. 6)1 & \u00036WRFN\u00032IIHULQJV\u0011 The C ompany may make up to forty (40) offerings of twelve (12) months’\nduration each to eligible employees to purchase SFNC Stock under the Plan. An eligible employee as defined in\nthe Offering may participate in such Offering by authorizing at any time prior to the first day of such Offering a\npayroll deduction for such purpose in a dollar amount, not exceeding any limitation set forth in the Offering, or\nin the event the participant is participating in more than one Offering during any calendar year a cumulative\nsum of $25,000 per calendar year, provided that the maximum number of shares of SFNC Stock that may be\nacquired by any participant in any calendar year under the plan is limited to the Share Limitation for such year,\nas defined in Section 8 below. The Compensation Committee may at any time suspend an Offering if required\nby law or if determined by the Compensation Committee to be in the best interests of the Company.\n7. 3DU W L F LSDQW\u0003$FFRXQWV\u0011 (a) T h e Company will maintain or cause to be maintained separate payroll\ndeduction accounts for all participating employees for each Offering. All funds received or held by the\nCompany or its subsidiaries under the Plan may be, but need not be, segregated from other corporate funds.\nPayroll deduction accounts will not be credited with interest. Any balance remaining in any employee’s payroll\ndeduction account at the end of an Offering period will be refunded to the employee.\n(b) Eac h participating employee will receive a statement of his or her payroll deduction account and the\nnumber of shares of SFNC Stock purchased therewith following the end of each Offering period.\n(c) Sub j e ct to rules, procedures and forms adopted by the Compensation Committee, a participating\nemployee may at any time during the offering period increase, decrease or suspend his or her payroll deduction,\nor may withdraw from participation in an offering. Under the initial rules established by the Compensation\nCommittee, payroll deductions may not be altered more than once in each Offering period and withdrawal\nrequests (effective on the last day of the offering) may be received on or before the last day of such offering. In\nthe event of a participating employee’s retirement, death, disability or termination of employment, his or her\nparticipation in any offering under the Plan shall cease, no further amounts shall be deducted pursuant to the\nPlan, and the balance in the employee’s account shall be paid to the employee, or, in the event of the employee’s\ndeath, to the employee’s beneficiary designated on a form approved by the Compensation Committee (or, if the\nemployee has not designated a beneficiary, to his or her estate).\n8. 2SW L R Q\u0003*UDQW\u0011 Each employee participating in any offering under the Plan will be granted an\noption, upon the effective date of such offering, for as many full shares of SFNC Stock as the amount of his or\nher payroll deduction account at the end of any offering period can purchase but not in excess of the share\nlimitation, as defined below. No employee may be granted an option under the Plan which permits his or her\nrights to purchase SFNC Stock under the Plan, and any other stock purchase plan of the Company or a parent or\nsubsidiary of the Company qualified under Section 423 of the Code, to exceed the number of shares of SFNC\nStock (rounded down to a whole number of shares) equal to $25,000 divided by the Fair Market Value of SFNC\nStock determined at the time of the option under the first Offering for each calendar year in which the employee\nparticipates (“Share Limitation”).\nAs of the last day of the Offering period, the payroll deduction account of each participating employee\nshall be totaled. If such account contains sufficient funds to purchase one or more full shares of SFNC Stock as\nof that date, the employee shall be deemed to have exercised an option to purchase the largest number of full\nshares of SFNC Stock (not exceeding the Share Limitation) at the purchase price. Such employee’s account will\nbe charged for the amount of the purchase and the stock will be delivered in accordance with Section 13. Any\nremaining funds in the employee’s account will be refunded to the employee.\n9. 3XU F K DVH\u00033ULFH\u0011\u0003 The \u0003C\u0003\u0003ompensation Committee shall determine the purchase price of the shares of\nSFNC Stock which are to be sold under each offering, which price shall not be less than the lesser of (i) an\namount equal to 85 percent of the Fair Market Value of the SFNC Stock at the time such option is granted, or\n(ii) an amount equal to 85 percent of the Fair Market Value of the SFNC Stock at the time such option is\nexercised. “Fair Market Value” of a share of SFNC Stock on a given date is defined as the closing price of a\nshare on the previous trading day (or, if none, on the most recent date on which there was one or more trades\nexecuted), as reported by the NASDAQ Global Select Market, or other similar service selected by the\nCompensation Committee. However, if the SFNC Stock is listed on a national securities exchange, “Fair\nMarket Value” is defined as the last reported sale price of a share on the previous trading day, or if no sale took\nplace, the last reported sale price of a share of stock on the most recent day on which a sale of a share of stock\ntook place as recorded on such exchange. If the SFNC Stock is neither listed on such date on a national\nsecurities exchange nor traded in the over-the-counter\nA-2\nmarket, “Fair Market Value” is defined as the fair market value of a share on such date as determined in good\nfaith by the Compensation Committee. Nothing herein shall restrict the authority of the Compensation\nCommittee to utilize different purchase price formula for separate Offerings, so long as such price formulas\ncomply with the parameters set forth in this Section.\n10. 1RQ \u0010 $ VVLJQDELOLW\\\u0003RI\u00032SWLRQ\u0011 No o p tion, right or benefit under the Plan may be transferred by a\nparticipating employee other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and all options, rights and\nbenefits under the Plan may be exercised during the participating employee’s lifetime only by such employee or\nthe employee’s guardian or legal representative. There are no restrictions imposed under the Plan upon the\nresale of shares of SFNC Stock issued under the Plan, however the timing of any resale could affect the income\ntax treatment of such sale.\n11. 7HUP \u000f \u00037HUPLQDWLRQ\u0003DQG\u0003$PHQGPHQWV\u0011\u0003 No \u0003o\u0003\u0003ffering under this plan shall be commenced after\nMarch 15, 2035, provided that the plan shall terminate earlier in the event all of the stock allocated to the plan\nhas been purchased. The Board may terminate the Plan at any time, or make such amendment of the Plan as it\nmay deem advisable, but no amendment may be made without the approval of the Company’s shareholders if it\nwould materially: (i) increase the benefits accruing to participants under the Plan; (ii) modify the requirements\nas to eligibility for participation in the Plan; (iii) increase the number of shares which may be issued under the\nPlan, (iv) increase the cost of the Plan to the Company; or (v) alter the allocation of Plan benefits among\nparticipating employees.\n12. 6HF X U LWLHV\u0003/DZ\u0003&RPSOLDQFH\u0011\u0003 Cert\u0003a\u0003\u0003in officers of the Company are subject to restrictions under\nSection 16(b) of the 1934 Act. With respect to such officers, transactions under the Plan are intended to comply\nwith all applicable conditions of Rule 16b-3 or its successors under the 1934 Act. To the extent any provision of\nthe Plan or action by the Compensation Committee fails to so comply, it shall be deemed null and void if\npermitted by law and deemed advisable by the Compensation Committee.\n13.

It is a great honor to have achieved such a milestone through some\nremarkably difficult periods. One of those difficult periods included 2023 – with rising inflation, increased\ninterest rates, bank failures and liquidity crunched by numerous factors, the banking industry was met\nwith challenges we have not seen in many years. I am proud that Simmons weathered the storm very well\nby sticking to our conservative management style and sound principles of banking. In times like these,\nfocusing on the future, and not focusing on short-term success, has proven over and over to be the recipe\nfor sustainability.\nAs we look to 2024 it appears that monetary policy has provided for some tempering of inflationary pressure\nwhile not creating an unemployment crisis – or a “soft landing” for the U.S. economy. We are hopeful that\ntrue economic factors will dictate growth, and government stimulants, which were necessary but overdone\nduring Covid, will not be the primary factor in that growth. Regardless, your bank will prepare to continue\nour legacy of providing capital to our customers for their worthwhile needs and serving our communities\nwhich have supported us throughout our history.\nWe want to acknowledge our directors who will retire at our shareholder meeting. Dean Bass, Jay\nBurchfield and Scott McGeorge have been outstanding contributors to Simmons Bank’s success. Their\nleadership throughout their tenures is greatly appreciated. They will be missed and we wish them the\nvery best.\nWe appreciate the support of our shareholders and encourage each one to examine the products and\nservices Simmons has to offer, including our digital capabilities. As we continue to build loyalty throughout\nour markets, the attribute most coveted is the combination of customer and shareholder.\nSincerely,\nGeorge A. Makris, Jr.\nExecutive Chairman\nSimmons First National Corporation\n4 | Letter to Shareholders\nLETTER FROM THE CEO\nAs Simmons Bank celebrated its 120th anniversary in 2023, we were once again reminded that during turbulent\nand challenging times, the customers and communities we serve look to their bank as a source of strength and\nstability. The foundation upon which our company was built centered on maintaining strong capital and liquidity\npositions while also exercising strict credit discipline. Adhering to these principles continues to be a mainstay of\nour company and a centerpiece of our ongoing strategy.\nAs shown later in this report, all of our regulatory capital ratios continued to significantly exceed “well-capitalized”\nguidelines. Liquidity took centerstage this year, with particular attention placed on uninsured deposits. To combat\nthe anxiety that ensued throughout the banking industry, we proactively worked closely with our customers to\nplace them in programs that helped address any perceived concerns. In total, approximately 79 percent of our\ndeposits at the end of the year were FDIC insured or subject to collateral agreements, well above the industry\naverage. We also maintain access to additional liquidity sources as part of our overall liquidity management\nstrategy, which in total represent more than two times the amount of uninsured, uncollateralized deposits as of\nthe year end.\nMaintaining strong capital and liquidity positions also afforded us the opportunity to extend credit (new loan\noriginations or funding commitments) totaling more than $10.4 billion during the year. At the same time, loan\ngrowth did not come at the expense of maintaining prudent underwriting standards as evidenced by the 12 basis\npoints of net charge-offs recorded during the year.\nWe believe adhering to these principles, rather than seeking opportunities that provide instant gratification while\nalso potentially adding undue risk, ultimately drive the creation of long-term shareholder value. They also are\nthe pillars that have allowed us to pay cash dividends to our shareholders almost since our founding in 1903. In\nJanuary 2024, our Board of Directors announced a 5 percent increase in the quarterly cash dividend, marking the\n115th consecutive year that Simmons has paid a cash dividend. According to recent research by Dividend Power,\nthere are only 25 U.S. publicly traded companies that have paid dividends for 100+ consecutive years – placing\nSimmons amongst an exclusive group of companies that include Coca-Cola, Exon Mobil, General Mills, IBM,\nProctor & Gamble and Union Pacific.\nThis past year also brought success with our Better Bank Initiative that concentrated\non people, processes and systems. As part of this initiative, we initially identified\npotential annual cost savings of $15 million. In the end, we surpassed our\nexpectations by achieving $18 million in annual costs savings. More importantly,\nwe believe this initiative provided increased capacity for future growth and will\nalso allow us to better serve our customers.\nFinally, I remain proud of our company’s resiliency and the work of our more than\n3,000 associates, collectively and individually. Meeting challenges head on\nand ensuring that we are doing the things we need to do, and should\nbe doing, to help our customers and communities achieve their\nfinancial goals is embedded in our DNA. Moreover, it provides a\nstrong foundation for our future growth and success.\nRespectfully,\nBob Fehlman\nChief Executive Officer\nSimmons First National Corporation\nBETTER BANK INITIATIVE\nQ&A with Jena Compton\nWhen Chief People Officer Jena Compton joined Simmons in 2015, the bank’s robust mergers and acquisitions\n(M&A) activity was delivering rapid growth – and cultural challenges. Eight years and multiple culture awards\nlater, Jena reflects on lessons learned, victories won and what’s next.\nQ: Since your arrival eight years ago, associate feedback has been key to developing and improving the\nSimmons Bank culture. How have you utilized employee feedback to ensure\nSimmons Bank is a best place to work?\nWe’ve gone through Quality Improvement Program input and Engagement\nSurveys to ask ourselves how we make Simmons an even better place to\nwork. Associates’ feedback helped our HR team get very creative in finding\nways to turn input into action. Payroll improvements coming in 2024 are an\nexample, as are enhanced bereavement leave and jeans Fridays. We also just\nannounced four additional weeks of paid parental leave and have several\nother exciting updates in the pipeline.\nQ: High Performance Culture is a newer initiative that encourages associates to find their “why.” What\nbenefits are we seeing since it launched?\nA lot of companies talk about being high performing, but our High Performance Culture Initiative\neffectively turned an aspirational emphasis at Simmons into part of our day-to-day language and activity.\nCulturally, High Performance has always been part of who we are, but it’s come alive since launching the\nHigh Performance Culture Initiative. Now we have tools to interview for High Performance, measure it\nand use it as a filter for our experiences and results. There’s a level of clarity and a toolbox to make sure\nwe’re living our culture.\nQ: How do you evaluate HR initiatives to ensure they’re strategic?\nThe HR role is to support the business and its success. That means the first responsibility we have is\nto fully understand the business strategy and how we enable it. We must look at Simmons’ strategy\nto understand the \"people\" components, from talent to process needs. From there we build an HR\nstrategy that supports the business strategy.\nWe’re constantly building tools, resources and programs to support associate experience. Sometimes\nthe support HR provides is helping Simmons \"run a better shop\" through efficient processes. When we\nstreamline tasks for associates, that’s also part of improving their experience.\nQ: Our 2023 strategy was Better Bank Initiative. What resonates with you about this focus and how does\nit impact HR?\nBetter Bank Initiative is focused on people, processes and systems – all of which result in a better\nassociate experience. When your aim is helping people enjoy and succeed at their work, you can’t have\nthat conversation without touching on areas covered by Simmons’ Better Bank Initiative, from honing\nprocesses and tools to providing associates with higher-performing peers. I say all the time that you\ncan’t talk about the people enough. People make everything happen at this bank, and that holds true\nfor bringing strategy to life.\n6 | Better Bank Initiative\nQ&A with Sharmane Andrews\nAs chief compliance officer, Sharmane manages the bank's risk related to fair and responsible banking and\nmanaging compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\nQ:\nYour team is instrumental in Simmons Bank achieving its CRA goals. How did your team find success\nin 2023?\nSimmons’ CRA unit sought to strengthen relationships internally with our\nbusiness lines and lenders and externally with nonprofit organizations.\nStaying connected with nonprofits within our communities allows us to\ndevelopment performance context aligning our lending, giving and services\noffered with community needs.\nQ:\nHow did our associates’ participation in service opportunities impact our\n2023 CRA goals?\nSimmons' associates engaged in a variety of services from helping\ncommunities build more sustainable food systems through charitable events,\nto partnering with national nonprofits dedicated to creating positive change in the lives of young people\nand adults.\nIn keeping with our 2023 CRA goal of building a network of community partners and promoting\nfinancial wellness, associates shared their expertise, which helped our communities foster a strong\nfinancial foundation, build savings and reach their financial goals. We partnered with organizations\nacross the footprint to provide personal finance classes, homebuyer workshops and mentored small\nbusiness owners (i.e., financing, human resources, business planning).\nQ:\nCommunity affairs officers across the footprint hosted several workshops to empower our customers\nand communities with financial education. As you look back on 2023, what are you most proud of?\nOur team really exceeded expectations in 2023. Their hard work will equip communities with the\nknowledge and resources needed to empower better financial solutions. I am most proud of the\noverall outreach within our Texas markets to various nonprofits. This team completed more than 665\ncommunity activities from financial literacy to serving on boards or being community advocates.\nHouston – Eddie Lasker, Karla Hollins and Graylin Beals established a partnership with Texas Southern\nUniversity, a Historically Black College and University (HBCU). They successfully delivered their first\nof many credit management workshops and are aiming to create valuable working experiences for\nstudents.\nSherman – In a remarkable show of unity and community spirit, the Sherman market joined forces\nto host a financial literacy workshop for Sherman Independent School District. This collaborative\neffort highlights the power of teamwork and the shared commitment to empowering the youth with\nessential financial knowledge.\nQ:\nWhat impact did your team have on emerging markets and how did this tie into our Better Bank\nInitiative?\nOur Simmons’ CRA team worked collectively with our real estate group securing cornerstone branches\nwithin our community, such as our new St. Louis Kingshighway branch – located in a banking desert\nand replacing a check cashing facility. Additionally, we opened two new branches in South Dallas within\nthe Red Bird community where many individuals are underbanked.\n7\nBETTER BANK INITIATIVE\nQ&A with Brad Yaney\nThis year, Executive Vice President Brad Yaney oversaw the execution of Simmons’ Credit Optimization\nInitiative – a sweeping effort that delivered new efficiencies for Simmons Bank.\nQ:\nHow long did the Credit Optimization Initiative run?\nIt began in October 2021 with an assessment of our commercial credit approval process and Credit Policy –\nbasically everything from the front-end of a commercial loan leading up to approval.\nWe then transitioned the assessment to the post-approval aspect, including loan\noperations and our attorney prepared loan closing process.\nWhile this specific initiative ended in July, keep in mind that optimizing our credit\nprocess is a continuing focus. For example, we’re actively working to revamp\nour loan covenant process, reviewing opportunities to shorten credit packages\nand partnering with our IT provider on LoanVantage enhancements. There’s\nalso significant work taking place to energize efforts around a Business Banking\nplatform, which will bring automation and efficiency to the large volume of small-\ndollar commercial loans that we originate and service. Small business loans are core to our customer base, and\nwe need a balanced \"low touch\" yet risk-based tool to help us achieve scalable growth in this area.\nQ:\nWhat’s the connection between Simmons’ Better Bank Initiative and what we accomplished through\nthe Credit Optimization project?\nBuilding a Better Bank is all about supporting our people through improved processes and systems. That’s\nexactly what Credit Optimization focused on: making our processes and systems efficient, scalable and\neffective so our people can be successful.\nCollaboration across business units was critical to the success of Credit Optimization and it will continue as\na key focus via the Better Bank Initiative. For example, our Real Estate Valuation team worked closely with\nAccounting and Finance to establish processes for the capture and recognition of fees. Our Lending Operations\nAnalysis group also helped the Credit Analysis team build out Service Level Agreement (SLA) tracking tools to\nensure delivery times were met. Those are just a couple of examples for how aligning teams and creating a\ncollaborative atmosphere helped us complete our goals. Finally, much like the SLA tracking, we’ve equipped\nour business units with new tools to help them be successful. It will be exciting to see more tools delivered over\nthe coming months and years. IT is partnering with business units to help deliver items like our Enterprise Data\nWarehouse, customer profitability and the Small Business Loan Center. That’s a great example of a \"support\nfunction\" assisting in revenue enablement!\nQ:\nWhat are your key takeaways from this initiative?\nSo many areas were touched through this project that I’d hesitate to say which was the biggest. Appraisals,\nCredit Analysis, Credit Policy, Systems, Loan Operations and Attorney Prepared Closings are just a few! Each of\nthese areas implemented enhancements to improve the entire loan process. All actions and accomplishments\nwere driven by the desire to make our bank better.\nAssociates who took part in this initiative should take pride that our leadership discussed this work publicly in\nearnings calls and investor meetings. Investors and analysts had interest in this initiative, wanting to understand\nprocesses that were changing, new efficiencies we were creating and how those efforts drove value in our\norganization.\nLast, Credit Optimization wasn’t about cost-cutting, but we did recognize saving opportunities through the\nproject. For example, we achieved more than $180,000 in annual savings through changing a vendor that\nprovided commercial real estate data.\n8 | Better Bank Initiative\nQ&A with Elizabeth Machen\nIn her role as chief marketing officer, Elizabeth Machen oversees marketing strategy and implementation for\nthe bank.\nQ:\nIn 2023 we focused on building a better bank. How would you summarize Marketing’s overall strategy\nand its tie into this initiative?\nAs a part of the 2023 Better Bank Initiative and its emphasis on people, processes\nand systems, Marketing focused on delivering our best to Simmons Bank customers.\nLeveraging more than 70,000 customer comments that we receive annually, the\nMarketing Brand Insights team visited four markets for intensive discussions on\ncustomer experience. We focused on identifying service gaps that can be improved\nand promoting successful tactics that can be replicated. The year ended with a 12\npercent increase in overall bank Net Promoter Score over the previous year.\nQ:\nThe bank’s footprint has grown significantly in the last several years. How\ndo you ensure consistent brand messaging across the six states?\nThe creative team has established a clear brand identity and closely collaborates with regional and product\nmarketing managers to maintain that identity across all channels and geographies. To ensure a uniform voice\nacross our many product campaigns and regional marketing efforts, we consistently monitor brand touchpoints\nand perform channel reviews. We also use our internal e-store, The Vault, to deliver uniform collateral throughout\nour footprint.\nQ:\nWhat are some highlights from your group this year? What impact did these have on the bank?\nThis year was focused on deposit-gathering and Marketing supported many initiatives that aided in new\ndeposits to the bank. During America Saves Week, Marketing executed a multi-channel campaign to drive\nsavings education and account growth. The campaign resulted in a successful year-over-year increase in\nconsumer deposit product originations and total deposit balance of new consumer deposit accounts.\nMarketing also supported the Digital Banking team as they expanded Simmons’ ability to grow deposits through\ndigital account openings. Digital Certificates of Deposit (CD) origination launched in March 2023, along with a\ndigital marketing campaign that promotes Simmons’ Coin Checking and Savings products. These campaigns\ndrove more than 4,280 new accounts from digital origination.\nQ:\nIn September of 2023 we announced the Simmons Bank Championship, a new PGA TOUR Champions\ntournament. How do you evaluate sponsorship opportunities to ensure they’re strategic and align\nwith the bank’s initiatives?\nThe Simmons Bank Championship offers an opportunity to bring a one-of-a-kind event to our corporate home.\nThe sponsorship positions Simmons Bank for mass consumer branding in a growing market, while providing\nsignificant business development opportunities under the Simmons Bank name.\nWith all brand partnerships, we evaluate asset provision by considering benefits to the community, as well\nas the business opportunities a sponsorship presents to the bank. We focus on aligning with like-minded\nbrands and organizations, securing banking relationships with partners, evaluating the potential for a long-\nterm partnership and promoting visibility for our brand. Our objective is always to ensure that a partnership is\nmutually beneficial, and that the partner and the bank are both invested.\n9\nBETTER BANK INITIATIVE\nQ&A with Tina Groves\nIn her role as chief risk officer, Tina Groves looks beneath the surface to identify risks and opportunities.\nQ:\nFrom Financial Crimes to Compliance and Regulatory areas, your team covers multiple facets of risk.\nHow do they fit together?\nThe common thread is Risk Management. We’re focused on operational,\ncompliance and enterprise level risk. The components of operational risk are\nFinancial Crimes, Model Risk Management, Organizational Risk Management\nand Third-Party Risk Management. Then you have our Compliance and\nRegulatory areas, with Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) tying everything\ntogether.\nERM connects all the dots as it looks at risk across the enterprise and\naggregates it. Individual risks don’t always seem like a big deal when they’re isolated, but when you\naggregate them, you find enterprise-wide issues. That insight helps us channel resources to prevent\nproblems.\nQ:\nHow do you summarize Risk's overall 2023 strategy to align with our Better Bank initiative?\nIt’s a pretty easy answer! We’re upgrading tools and technology. We’re also looking at associate education\nand the transfer of tools, training and responsibilities into the field.\nQ:\nWhat are some wins from your group this year and what impact did they have on the bank?\nOne win involves check fraud, an old-school fraud tactic that’s made a comeback the last few years.\nThrough our vendor relationships, our team searched the dark web to find stolen checks for sale. The\nface value of customer checks we recovered in 2023 is $1.9 million, but account balances that were at\nrisk totaled $76 million. Fraud prevention isn’t exactly a \"savings\" to the bank, but with a single vendor\nwe offset a huge risk.\nAnother significant contribution made by the Fraud Group included an aggressive effort to “chase the\nmoney” seeking recoveries from external financial institutions resulting in the recovery of $2.1 million.\nQ:\nWhat future initiatives are you focused on?\nWe’ll implement a new global risk compliance solution in early 2024. We’re also working on different\nautomations to help our Fraud and Third-Party Risk Management teams.\nNext, we have been shadowing various groups to identify new efficiencies that we can build in for our\npartners. For example, when we find counterfeit or stolen checks, our Fraud team goes in and restricts\nitems for those accounts to protect customers. The downside is that Simmons has to look at every item\nfor affected accounts, so our team has a lot of work when items are restricted. Thanks to the shadowing\nprocess, we’ve built in an automated escalation procedures that help Simmons resolve restrictions in a\nmore timely manner, relieving pressure for several teams.\n10 | Better Bank Initiative\nQ&A with Ann Madea\nAs an IT leader with global, regional and community banking experience, Chief Information Officer Ann\nMadea is fueled by driving growth. Her IT strategy has set Simmons on a path of transformation.\nQ:\nWhat are IT’s biggest wins from 2023 and how did they help the bank?\nWe made some major changes in 2023. This includes a new IT Service Management System,\nimplementing a new Workforce Strategy to source and upskill great talent, as well as continuing our\ntech modernization program like our branch network upgrades.\nWe also focused on budget and saved significantly on contract negotiations.\nThis contributed to the $15 million savings goal Simmons announced with\nour Build a Better Bank Initiative this year.\nWe continue to prioritize data-driven initiatives that can have a measurable\nimpact on customer experience as well as identifying those AI use cases\nthat will deliver business innovation, productivity and boost profitability.\nData is an asset and leveraging it helps us grow revenue, identify opportunities, generate operational\nefficiencies and mitigate risk – it’s one of the biggest areas where we can make a difference at Simmons\nBank.\nWe’re also partnering with the business units on numerous key initiatives such as the Business Lending\nCenter and customer profitability, as well as many other initiatives in support of Simmons’ growth. We\nwill continue to deliver business outcomes through digital capabilities, products and services.\nQ:\nWhat future IT initiatives are you focused on?\nWe’re focused on many initiatives, including APIs that would enable streamlined integration and the\nability to bring in Fintechs – when beneficial. There will be significant progress in the data and analytics\nspace. We will continue to look at emerging technologies such as AI, blockchain and microservices to\nunderstand where they fit and how they could benefit the bank while minimizing operational risk.\nWe will continue to align our IT strategy with our business partners\nand deliver those outcomes that generate revenue and maximize\nefficiencies. From the start I’ve had a solid team who understands\nthat we’re here to enable the business – that’s our number one goal.\n– Ann Madea,\nChief Information Officer\n11\nBETTER BANK INITIATIVE\nQ&A with Jimmy Crocker\nAs head of Wealth Management, Jimmy Crocker oversees more than 104 trust associates serving Simmons’\nentire six-state footprint with nearly $6.0 billion in assets under management and custody.1\nQ:\nIn 2022 your team celebrated a century of serving our clients. How did you carry that momentum into\nthis year?\nAs Simmons Bank has changed over the years, so has Wealth Management. For years, individuals\nand corporations perceived that banks could not manage money very well.\nThat has all changed. Private Wealth is a boutique investment group within\nthe bank that has trust powers. Our Simmons Private Wealth Core Equity\nStrategy performed very well in 2023. The management of trust assets is a\nsmall portion of the accounts we manage. We continue to grow our assets\nunder management for individuals, corporations and foundations. Standing\non the shoulders of those who came before us, the Wealth group continues\nto not only grow assets, revenue and net income, but build deep and lasting\nrelationships with our clients.\nQ:\nOur 2023 strategy was themed around “Building a Better Bank.” What resonates with you about\nBetter Bank Initiative and how does it impact Wealth?\nOur Better Bank Initiative is not just a slogan but a mindset. Wealth is always looking for ways to\nimprove the client experience from the advice and services we provide, to the decisions we make in\nthe process of managing client investments and the changes we have made, and continue to make, to\ncreate additional efficiencies and scalability.\nQ:\nWhat is the key differentiator for our Private Wealth group and how do we leverage it?\nIt’s truly our people. We have a group of talented professionals within the Private and Institutional\nWealth group. Not only are our associates experts in their chosen fields, but they approach every\nclient encounter with a servant’s heart. Our private wealth advisors have experience in trust and estate\nadministration as well as financial planning.

Our group is not only active in our clients’ futures but in our communities as\nwell. They have taken an active role in giving back to the communities they serve, taking an active role\nin building long-term community relationships.\nHighlights\nProducts and services offered by Simmons Bank Private and Institutional Wealth include investment management, trust and estate\nplanning, financial planning, business succession planning, employee benefits, 401K plan consulting, institutional investment\nmanagement, corporate trust services, and farm and land management.\nTotal assets under management or administration for Private and Institutional Wealth as of December 31, 2023, were $6.0 billion.\n104 private strategists, portfolio managers and institutional wealth associates are dedicated to serving our Private and Institutional\nWealth clients across our six-state footprint.\n1 Royalty Trust division was sold on December 30, 2022.\n12 | Better Bank Initiative\nQ&A with Cole Plafcan\nTwo years into his role, Senior Vice President and Agriculture Lending Director Cole Plafcan has built on\nSimmons’ agricultural legacy and developed a loyal customer base.\nQ:\nWhat are we doing well when it comes to Ag lending, and how do you want us to grow?\nAg lending is all about relationships. Building a strong, loyal customer base is key to our success. We will\ngrow one relationship at a time – ensuring we are our customers’ trusted partner – which will deepen\nour relationships over time.\nQ:\nAs a top-25 farm lender in the U.S., Simmons has a storied history of\nsupporting farmers in the communities we call home. How do you believe\nyour department carried on this legacy in 2023?\nAs the bank has grown, we remain committed to our customers, especially\nour agricultural communities. This customer-loyalty mindset is apparent\nfrom the top-down. Our department has key support and backing by our top\nexecutives, which our customers can feel. It differentiates us among other\nbanks our size.\nQ:\nHow did the Better Bank Initiative tie into your strategy for 2023?\nWith last year’s acquisition of Spirit of Texas, we expanded into a market that was primed with\nopportunity. Our team has done an outstanding job of establishing our agricultural lending presence\nin south Texas. Our team in Corpus Christi, specifically, has built strong customer and community\nrelationships that will help us grow into 2024 and beyond.\nQ:\nWhat unique challenges did your team face this year? How did you overcome those to become a\nstrong revenue producer?\nThis year marked a unique time in terms of prolonged high inflation and high interest rates. Like other\nareas in the bank, our borrowers faced these rising interest rates, which impacted their margins. Because\nof our strong client relationships, our team was able to successfully manage customer expectations as\nwell as bank profitability to attract, retain and expand our customer base.\nHighlights\nRanked #24 among the Top 100 Farm Lenders by American Bankers Association\n9 percent increase in agricultural portfolio from 2022\n13\nCOMMUNITY\nSimmons Bank Championship to debut on\nPGA TOUR Champions in 2024\nThe Simmons Bank Championship, a new PGA TOUR Champions tournament, will debut in Little Rock,\nArkansas on October 21-27, 2024.

Loyal. Adventurous. Humorous. Driven. Simple words chosen to describe a lifetime of a man\nwho was loved deeply and whose presence will be immensely missed.\nBill Cope, who served as Simmons Bank’s chief pilot since 2019, was involved in a tragic plane crash at the\nBill and Hillary Clinton National Airport in Little Rock, Arkansas on January 21, 2024. Bill was a veteran and\ncommitted family man, whose dedicated work ethic and personal warmth impacted all who met him. We’re\ndeeply saddened by this great loss to our team, and our hearts go out to Bill’s wife, children, extended\nfamily and friends.\nBill was blessed with a passion for flying which started at age 16 when he took his first solo flight. He joined\nthe Navy at the age of 18 and his intense love of aviation increased while working on the flight deck of the\nU.S. Ranger. Leaving the military, he entered the aviation program at Henderson State University where he\nmet his wife of 34 years, Tina. Bill’s first aviation job, flying for the Arkansas Forestry Service, relocated him\nand Tina to the Conway area. Together, they built Favoring Tailwinds, a company specializing in corporate\naviation.\nBill used his skills, talents, and wisdom to invest in young pilots who had chosen aviation as their profession.\nThe Cope family has established The Bill Cope Aviation Scholarship Fund so that Bill’s legacy of investing in\nyoung aviators may continue for many years to come.\n50 | Remembering Bill Cope\nSHAREHOLDER INFORMATION\nCorporate Headquarters Corporate Office\n501 Main Street 601 E. 3rd Street\nPine Bluff, AR 71601 Little Rock, AR 72201\n870.541.1000 866.246.2400\nInvestor Relations Online\nInvestors Relations is part of Simmons’ homepage at www.simmonsbank.com.
