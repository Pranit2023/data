(Nasdaq: PCSA) (Processa or the Company), a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on developing the next generation of chemotherapeutic drugs with improved efficacy and safety, provides updates on its product pipeline, upcoming milestones and business activities, and reports financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\n“We continued to make progress with our programs as we further demonstrate the potential benefits of our oncology therapeutics,” said George Ng, Chief Executive Officer of Processa Pharmaceuticals. “Our NGC-Cap Phase 2 clinical trial in metastatic breast cancer is underway with the first patient dosed. As this is an open-label trial, we anticipate sharing initial data in the second half of 2025. Additionally, we reported positive findings from preclinical studies that support NGC-Iri’s potential for improved efficacy and a superior side effect profile compared with the commonly used FDA-approved chemotherapy drugs irinotecan and Onivyde®. We are pleased with our progress and remain committed to improving the lives of people with cancer.”\n\n**Key Program Updates** Processa is focused on developing next-generation chemotherapies (NGC) by improving widely used U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs to extend cancer patients’ survival and/or improve their quality of life. This is achieved by altering how drugs are metabolized and/or distributed in the body, including how they reach cancer cells. In addition, Processa utilizes its Regulatory Science Approach, including the principles associated with FDA’s Project Optimus Oncology initiative, in the development of its NGC drug products to achieve a more favorable benefit-risk profile.\n\n  * _PCS6422: Next-Generation Capecitabine (NGC-Cap)_\n    * NGC-Cap is a combination of PCS6422 and capecitabine, which is the oral prodrug of the cancer drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). PCS6422 alters the metabolism of 5-FU, resulting in more 5-FU distributed to cancer cells.\n    * Earlier this month, the first patient was dosed in a Phase 2 clinical trial ([NCT06568692](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06568692?cond=Breast%20Cancer&term=processa&aggFilters=status:not%20rec&rank=1)) evaluating NGC-Cap for the treatment of advanced or metastatic breast cancer. The Phase 2 study is a global, multicenter, open-label, adaptive-design trial comparing two different doses of NGC-Cap to FDA-approved monotherapy capecitabine in approximately 60 to 90 patients. The trial is designed to evaluate the safety-efficacy profile of NGC-Cap versus monotherapy capecitabine, to determine the potential optimal dosage regimens of NGC-Cap as required by the FDA Project Optimus Initiative and to evaluate the possibility of personalizing NGC-Cap therapy. The Company expects to announce interim data from this trial in the second half of 2025. \n  * _PCS3117: Next-Generation Gemcitabine (NGC-Gem)_\n    * NGC-Gem is an oral analog of gemcitabine (Gemzar®) that is converted to its active metabolite by a different enzyme system, with potential for a positive response in gemcitabine patients including those inherently resistant to or who acquire resistance to gemcitabine.\n    * Processa is evaluating the potential of NGC-Gem in patients with pancreatic and other cancers, as well as ways to identify patients who are more likely to respond to NGC-Gem than gemcitabine alone. The Company is requesting a meeting with the FDA to discuss potential trial designs, including implementation of the Project Optimus initiative. \n  * _PCS11T: Next-Generation Irinotecan (NGC-Iri)_\n    * NGC-Iri is an analog of SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan, that is expected to have an improved safety-efficacy profile in every type of cancer where irinotecan is currently used.\n    * As announced in August, two studies in a human melanoma xenograft mouse model measured SN-38 in tumors, plasma and other tissues following administration of NGC-Iri, irinotecan and Onivyde®, the liposomal formulation of irinotecan. One study compared NGC-Iri with irinotecan, and the other compared irinotecan with Onivyde _®_. The results found that mice administered NGC-Iri had greater accumulation of SN-38 in the tumor compared with other tissues and that less SN-38 accumulated in non-cancer tissues, which could lead to improved efficacy with a more favorable adverse event profile compared with irinotecan and Onivyde _®_.\n    * The Company is currently evaluating the manufacturing process and potential sites for NGC-Iri. In addition, Processa is defining the potential paths to approval, which includes defining the target patient population and the type of cancer, and expects to conduct IND-enabling toxicology studies in 2025.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter Financial Results**\n\nResearch and development expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $2.3 million, compared with $1.2 million for the third quarter of 2023. General and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $1.1 million, compared with $1.0 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nThe net loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $3.4 million, or $1.03 per share, compared with the net loss for the third quarter of 2023 of $2.1 million, or $1.54 per share. All per-share figures reflect a 1-for-20 reverse stock split that was effective as of January 22, 2024.\n\nCash and cash equivalents were $2.9 million as of September 30, 2024.\n\n**About Processa Pharmaceuticals, Inc.**\n\nProcessa is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on developing the Next Generation Chemotherapy (NGC) drugs with improved safety and efficacy. Processa’s NGC drugs are modifications of existing FDA-approved oncology therapies resulting in an alteration of the metabolism and/or distribution of these drugs while maintaining the existing mechanisms of killing the cancer cells. By combining its novel oncology pipeline with proven cancer-killing active molecules and its Regulatory Science Approach, Processa’s strategy is to develop more effective therapy options with improved tolerability for cancer patients through an efficient regulatory path.\n\nFor more information, visit our website at [www.processapharma.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=yx2-LL3EfHWeqRYG6pIrxn-azX_JeL6rjqfF2HE2OrdWWPzouDsWIXs1YSrP-7p-wxLGnBNzUQAks2Iio0D6-pG1XFi58LOjMx9g3hia5SM=).\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis release contains forward-looking statements.

(Nasdaq: PCSA)** (Processa or the Company), a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on developing the next generation of chemotherapeutic drugs with improved efficacy and safety, today announced that the first patient has been dosed in a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating NGC-Cap for the treatment of advanced or metastatic breast cancer.\n\n“Dosing the first patient in this Phase 2 trial is a significant step in the development of NGC-Cap as a more effective and better tolerated treatment than widely used capecitabine and 5-FU,” stated David Young, PharmD, Ph.D., President of Research and Development at Processa. “We expect this Phase 2 trial to build upon NGC-Cap’s positive Phase 1b findings and we look forward to announcing the results from our interim analysis of this Phase 2 trial in mid-2025.”\n\nThe Phase 2 trial ([NCT06568692](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=iaxDgqPkaFeOrWviggssxRgaLv0Vqz2bj34YP19wsIkLhUz5op7nbqeGJ6KLQZuAVr4TA0XBTdIh3jPTRdfX4Pg9ocFI2eEVWuAbl2WJYFwZYrJDHRyYBqaeusQIt2OtirpI3rlT6VZlGaGqSgMuUF4mZulOjR8IqDja1q8Hxi7_2MWVYOINbnvVMMQDLM3oHaRXauYF0naYSfKqFbpBfQ==)) is a global multicenter, open-label, adaptive designed safety-efficacy trial comparing two different doses of NGC-Cap to FDA-approved monotherapy capecitabine in approximately 60 to 90 patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer. The trial is designed to evaluate the safety-efficacy profile of NGC-Cap versus monotherapy capecitabine, to determine the potential optimal dosage regimens of NGC-Cap as required by the FDA Project Optimus Initiative and to evaluate the possibility of personalizing NGC-Cap therapy.\n\nTo date, three clinical trial sites, including some with multiple clinical locations, have received institutional review board approval to participate in this study and are recruiting patients. Processa plans to activate approximately 30 sites worldwide.\n\nBreast cancer is the second most common cancer and a leading cause of cancer-related death. More than 2 million cases of breast cancer were diagnosed in 2022 with more than 665,000 deaths globally. The five-year survival rate for those diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer is approximately 30%.\n\n**About Capecitabine Administered with PCS6422 (NGC-Cap)**\n\nNGC-Cap combines the administration of PCS6422, the Company’s irreversible dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) enzyme inhibitor, with low doses of capecitabine. Capecitabine is the oral prodrug of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and along with 5-FU is among the most widely used chemotherapy drugs, particularly for the treatment of solid tumors. When metabolized (after oral ingestion) it becomes 5-FU in the body, which, in turn, metabolizes to molecules called anabolites that actively kill duplicating cells, such as cancer cells, and to molecules called catabolites that only cause side effects. The presence of the DPD enzyme plays an integral role in the undesirable conversion of 5-FU to catabolites causing side effects while simultaneously decreasing tumor exposure to 5-FU and its cancer-killing anabolites.\n\n**About Processa Pharmaceuticals, Inc.**\n\nProcessa is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on developing the Next Generation Chemotherapy (NGC) drugs with improved safety and efficacy. Processa’s NGC drugs are modifications of existing FDA-approved oncology therapies resulting in an alteration of the metabolism and/or distribution of these drugs while maintaining the existing mechanisms of killing the cancer cells.

(Nasdaq: PCSA) (Processa or the Company), a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on developing the next generation of chemotherapeutic drugs with improved efficacy and safety, provides updates on its product pipeline, upcoming milestones and business activities, and reports financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\n“We continued to make progress with our programs as we further demonstrate the potential benefits of our oncology therapeutics,” said George Ng, Chief Executive Officer of Processa Pharmaceuticals. “Our NGC-Cap Phase 2 clinical trial in metastatic breast cancer is underway with the first patient dosed. As this is an open-label trial, we anticipate sharing initial data in the second half of 2025. Additionally, we reported positive findings from preclinical studies that support NGC-Iri’s potential for improved efficacy and a superior side effect profile compared with the commonly used FDA-approved chemotherapy drugs irinotecan and Onivyde®. We are pleased with our progress and remain committed to improving the lives of people with cancer.”\n\n**Key Program Updates** Processa is focused on developing next-generation chemotherapies (NGC) by improving widely used U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs to extend cancer patients’ survival and/or improve their quality of life. This is achieved by altering how drugs are metabolized and/or distributed in the body, including how they reach cancer cells. In addition, Processa utilizes its Regulatory Science Approach, including the principles associated with FDA’s Project Optimus Oncology initiative, in the development of its NGC drug products to achieve a more favorable benefit-risk profile.\n\n  * _PCS6422: Next-Generation Capecitabine (NGC-Cap)_\n    * NGC-Cap is a combination of PCS6422 and capecitabine, which is the oral prodrug of the cancer drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). PCS6422 alters the metabolism of 5-FU, resulting in more 5-FU distributed to cancer cells.\n    * Earlier this month, the first patient was dosed in a Phase 2 clinical trial ([NCT06568692](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06568692?cond=Breast%20Cancer&term=processa&aggFilters=status:not%20rec&rank=1)) evaluating NGC-Cap for the treatment of advanced or metastatic breast cancer. The Phase 2 study is a global, multicenter, open-label, adaptive-design trial comparing two different doses of NGC-Cap to FDA-approved monotherapy capecitabine in approximately 60 to 90 patients. The trial is designed to evaluate the safety-efficacy profile of NGC-Cap versus monotherapy capecitabine, to determine the potential optimal dosage regimens of NGC-Cap as required by the FDA Project Optimus Initiative and to evaluate the possibility of personalizing NGC-Cap therapy. The Company expects to announce interim data from this trial in the second half of 2025. \n  * _PCS3117: Next-Generation Gemcitabine (NGC-Gem)_\n    * NGC-Gem is an oral analog of gemcitabine (Gemzar®) that is converted to its active metabolite by a different enzyme system, with potential for a positive response in gemcitabine patients including those inherently resistant to or who acquire resistance to gemcitabine.\n    * Processa is evaluating the potential of NGC-Gem in patients with pancreatic and other cancers, as well as ways to identify patients who are more likely to respond to NGC-Gem than gemcitabine alone. The Company is requesting a meeting with the FDA to discuss potential trial designs, including implementation of the Project Optimus initiative. \n  * _PCS11T: Next-Generation Irinotecan (NGC-Iri)_\n    * NGC-Iri is an analog of SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan, that is expected to have an improved safety-efficacy profile in every type of cancer where irinotecan is currently used.\n    * As announced in August, two studies in a human melanoma xenograft mouse model measured SN-38 in tumors, plasma and other tissues following administration of NGC-Iri, irinotecan and Onivyde®, the liposomal formulation of irinotecan. One study compared NGC-Iri with irinotecan, and the other compared irinotecan with Onivyde _®_. The results found that mice administered NGC-Iri had greater accumulation of SN-38 in the tumor compared with other tissues and that less SN-38 accumulated in non-cancer tissues, which could lead to improved efficacy with a more favorable adverse event profile compared with irinotecan and Onivyde _®_.\n    * The Company is currently evaluating the manufacturing process and potential sites for NGC-Iri. In addition, Processa is defining the potential paths to approval, which includes defining the target patient population and the type of cancer, and expects to conduct IND-enabling toxicology studies in 2025.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter Financial Results**\n\nResearch and development expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $2.3 million, compared with $1.2 million for the third quarter of 2023. General and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $1.1 million, compared with $1.0 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nThe net loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $3.4 million, or $1.03 per share, compared with the net loss for the third quarter of 2023 of $2.1 million, or $1.54 per share. All per-share figures reflect a 1-for-20 reverse stock split that was effective as of January 22, 2024.\n\nCash and cash equivalents were $2.9 million as of September 30, 2024.\n\n**About Processa Pharmaceuticals, Inc.**\n\nProcessa is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on developing the Next Generation Chemotherapy (NGC) drugs with improved safety and efficacy. Processa’s NGC drugs are modifications of existing FDA-approved oncology therapies resulting in an alteration of the metabolism and/or distribution of these drugs while maintaining the existing mechanisms of killing the cancer cells. By combining its novel oncology pipeline with proven cancer-killing active molecules and its Regulatory Science Approach, Processa’s strategy is to develop more effective therapy options with improved tolerability for cancer patients through an efficient regulatory path.\n\nFor more information, visit our website at [www.processapharma.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=yx2-LL3EfHWeqRYG6pIrxn-azX_JeL6rjqfF2HE2OrdWWPzouDsWIXs1YSrP-7p-wxLGnBNzUQAks2Iio0D6-pG1XFi58LOjMx9g3hia5SM=).\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis release contains forward-looking statements.

Young and Bigora have refined their Regulatory Science approach over the last 30+ years\n• The approach includes trying to understand what evidence FDA requires as well as the FDA\nevaluation process when evaluating benefit vs risk of a drug for approval\n• Using the Processa Regulatory Science approach increases the likelihood of approval by aligning\nourselves more closely to the FDA thought process\n• For example, one major objective of Processa’s Regulatory Science approach has been to\ndetermine the optimal dosage regimen of the drug\n⁃ The Regulatory Science approach for oncology drugs, therefore, follows the principles of FDA’s\nOncology Project Optimus Initiative and Optimal Dosage Regimen Draft Guidance\n4\nLarge Market Opportunity in Oncology\nCancer is the Second Leading

Approach to Next-Generation Chemotherapy\nExcellent Risk-Reward: Improving drugs that we know already work\n• Industry’s Approach:\n⁃ Search for novel or different ways to treat cancer - exciting, novel technology (gets headlines)\n⁃ High failure rate in clinic and market (often patients fail to complete treatment regimen due to side effects)\n• Our NGC Approach:\n⁃ Target heavily used current drugs where benefit is often limited due to toxicity (e.g., capecitabine, gemcitabine, irinotecan)\n⁃ Improve how the body metabolizes these drugs to their active cancer-killing metabolites and how these active metabolites\ndistribute to the cancer\n• Reduce toxicity while keeping the cancer-killing mechanism of action\n• NGC compounds will potentially improve efficacy and toxicity by altering distribution and/or metabolism of known\ncancer killing molecules\n⁃ Goal to demonstrate improvement over standard of care\n⁃ Regulatory Science development process aligns with FDA’s Oncology Project Optimus initiative to determine and justify the\nselection of the ODR1\n• Improved treatment would expand market to additional patient populations\n⁃ Fewer patients require dose modification, including dose reduction or discontinuation\n⁃ Expanded use in elderly and pediatric patients\n1 https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/oncology-center-excellence/project-optimus 7\nPipeline\nNext-Generation

Anticancer Drug with Significant Side Effects\n• Capecitabine\n⁃ Oral prodrug of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)\n⁃ Capecitabine and 5-FU are among the most widely\nused cancer chemotherapy agents\n• Breast, Gastric and Colorectal\n• Low treatment response with high side-effect profile\n⁃ Therapeutic dose determined by side effects from\ncatabolites (non-cancer killing molecules) and\nanabolites (cancer killing molecules)\n⁃ Approximately 35% - 70% of patients have dose-\nlimiting side effects from catabolites requiring a\nchange in therapy\n• Only 20%-40% of patients respond to Capecitabine\n• Medicare doses (2021): ~9,200,000\nSource: Xeloda product label and Talbot Br J Cancer 86, 1367, 2002. 9\nNGC-Cap: How We Improve Capecitabine Therapy\nIncreased cancer-killing anabolites in tumor;

non-existent\n• Exposure profile of the cancer cells to cancer-killing anabolites is GREATER than existing FDA-approved\nCap even though the amount of Cap administered is 10% of FDA-approved Cap\n• Therapeutic dose to be determined solely by exposure profile of anabolites\n10\nNGC-Cap: Study Design\nDetermining the NGC-Cap dosage regimens with a safety profile better than capecitabine monotherapy\n• Patients with advanced, progressive GI cancer even after multiple types of treatment including\n5-FU or capecitabine (n=18)\n• NGC-Cap is the combination of a single dose of PCS6422 administered 12-24 hours prior to\nreceiving 7 days of capecitabine followed by 7 capecitabine-free days\n• Doses of capecitabine in NGC-Cap ranged from 75mg QD to 225mg BID, versus the 1,600 -\n2,500mg BID for FDA-approved capecitabine\n• Primary objective to determine the Recommended Dose Range for Phase 2, including the\nMaximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)\n11\nNGC-Cap: Study Results To Date\nBetter Tolerated than Capecitabine with Preliminary Positive Efficacy\n• 5-10x greater exposure to its 5-FU cancer treatment metabolite than capecitabine\n⁃ Better tolerated than capecitabine even with greater exposure\n⁃ One patient with mild case of hand-foot-syndrome: 6% versus expected ~50% based upon published\ndata\n• Although patients had advanced, progressive cancer entering the study, some patients\nresponded to NGC-Cap\n⁃ Positive preliminary efficacy in patients’ refractory to other cancer treatments, including 5-FU or\ncapecitabine\n⁃ Partial response or stable disease

Warning\n• Irinotecan is widely used in lung, pancreatic,\novarian, cervical & other solid tumor cancers\n• Approximately 15-35% of patients respond to\nIrinotecan across the solid tumor cancers\n• The major drawback of Irinotecan and its active\nmetabolite SN-38 is the side-effect profile which\nincludes a black box warning for diarrhea and\nmyelosuppression\n• SN-38 from NGC-Iri preferentially accumulates in the\nmembrane of tumor cells and the tumor core more\nthan normal cells compared with Irinotecan and\nOnivyde®\n⁃ Potentially increasing the cancer-killing effect\n⁃ Decreasing the Black Box warning side effects\nassociated with Irinotecan\n• Medicare doses (2021): ~1,800,000\nSource: Irinotecan productlabel. 18\nNGC-Iri: Higher Amounts & Lower Required Dose\nTumor-Bearing Mice

Comparing NGC-Iri to Irinotecan and Onivyde\n• Accumulation of SN-38 in the tumor compared with other tissues, such as muscle, was greater after NGC-Iri\nadministration than after irinotecan or Onivyde® administration, as demonstrated by the tumor-to-muscle\nratio of approximately 200 for NGC-Iri and less than 15 for irinotecan and Onivyde® ;\n• More SN-38 accumulated in the tumor after NGC-Iri administration than after irinotecan or Onivyde®\nadministration, as demonstrated by the tumor-to-plasma ratio being approximately 10 for NGC-Iri and less\nthan 7 for irinotecan and Onivyde® ; and\n• Less SN-38 accumulated in non-cancer tissues, such as muscle, after NGC-Iri administration than after\nirinotecan or Onivyde® administration, as demonstrated by the muscle-to-plasma ration being less than\n0.10 for NGC-Iri and greater than 0.4 for irinotecan and Onivyde® , supporting the potential for a better\nNGC-Iri safety profile.\n• Despite the Black Box warning for severe side effects, in 2021 Medicare reported a total of more than 1.8M\ndoses of irinotecan and Onivyde® .\n21\nEfficacy\n• Active molecule SN-38 is same active molecule in Irinotecan\n• Distributes SN-38 differently, entering the cell membrane of cancer cells preferentially over normal cells,\nimproving cancer-killing effect\nSide Effects\ne\nl\ni\nf\no • Given the specificity of NGC-Iri for cancer cells over normal cells, animal data suggests fewer side\nr effects; likely that patients will have less diarrhea and less myelosuppression (a Black Box warning for\nP\nIrinotecan)\nt\nc\nIntellectual
