(NASDAQ: PHIO), a clinical stage biotechnology company exploring new pathways towards a cancer-free future, today announced it has completed the enrollment of its second patient cohort in its PH-762 Phase 1b dose-escalating clinical trial, and added a sixth clinical site in San Diego, CA. \n\nPhio recently presented new data from the ongoing clinical trial showing that, of the two patients who have completed treatment in the second dose cohort, one patient with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma achieved a complete response (100% tumor clearance) while a second patient with squamous cell carcinoma achieved a partial response (90% tumor clearance).\n\nThe new clinical trial site, Paradigm Clinical Research Centers in San Diego, CA joins five other sites across the country: \n\n  * Banner MD Anderson Cancer Center in Gilbert, Arizona\n  * The George Washington University-Medical Faculty Associates in Washington, D.C.\n  * The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC)-Department of Dermatology, Pittsburgh, PA\n  * Integrity Research Clinical Associates in Delray Beach, Florida \n  * Centricity Research in Dublin, Ohio \n\n\n\n“We are pleased with enrollment completion of the second dose cohort and the encouraging patient outcomes in the first two patients in this cohort,” said Robert Bitterman, CEO of Phio Pharmaceuticals. \n\nPhio develops therapeutics that use its proprietary INTASYL® siRNA gene silencing technology designed to make immune cells more effective in killing cancer cells. PH-762 is an INTASYL compound that silences PD-1, a protein that inhibits T cells’ ability to kill cancer cells. The Phase 1b trial is a dose escalation study for our lead product candidate, PH-762, in adult patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, or Merkel cell carcinoma. The study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of neoadjuvant use of intratumorally injected PH-762, assess the tumor response, and determine the dose or dose range for continued study of PH-762 in patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, or Merkel cell carcinoma.\n\nMore information about this clinical trial is available at clinicaltrials.gov (identifier: [NCT06014086](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/2EW1DHR7aW)).\n\n**About Phio Pharmaceuticals Corp.**\n\nPhio Pharmaceuticals Corp.

The net proceeds to the Company were approximately $2.6 million, after deducting placement agent fees and offering expenses.\n\n**Research and Development Expenses**\n\nResearch and development expenses were $0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with $1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 64%. The decrease was primarily driven by non-recurring clinal program direct start-up costs in the 3rd Quarter 2023 and reductions in research compensation attributable to reductions in headcount of participants during the 3rd Quarter 2024. \n\n**General and Administrative Expenses**\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $0.95 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with $0.97 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 2%. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in salary-related expenses compared to the prior year period.\n\n**Net Loss**\n\nNet loss was $1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with $2.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

(NASDAQ: PHIO) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company creating new pathways towards a cancer-free future by using its INTASYL® siRNA gene silencing technology designed to make the body’s immune cells more effective in killing cancer cells. Phio announced today that it is presenting clinical data from its on-going Phase 1b clinical trial at the 39th Annual Meeting of the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC), which will be held in Houston, TX from November 8-10, 2024.\n\nPhio’s presentation will highlight the clinical results from enrolled patients in Cohorts 1 and 2 in the Phase 1b dose escalation clinical trial. This clinical trial is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of intratumoral injection of PH-762 in patients with cutaneous squamous carcinoma, Merkel cell carcinoma and melanoma. \n\n**Clinical Results To Date**\n\nIntratumoral (IT) injection of PH-762 has been well tolerated in all patients enrolled in the trial to date. There were no related adverse events, no serious adverse events, and no dose limiting toxicities or dose adjustments. Five (5) patients with cutaneous carcinomas have enrolled in Cohorts 1 and 2. Each enrolled patient received four (4) IT doses of PH-762. The patients were diagnosed with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (4 patients) and metastatic melanoma (1 patient). \n\nAt Day 36 (tumor excision), while each patient in the first cohort had stable disease, the following results were described for two patients enrolled in the second cohort:\n\n  * Complete response (100% tumor clearance) reported for 1 patient with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma; and\n  * Partial response (90% tumor clearance) reported for 1 patient with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.\n\n\n\nThe Phase 1b trial is on-going. Anticipated completion of the enrollment phase of this trial is Q3 2025.\n\n“We are encouraged by the documented clinical and histopathological results observed to date,” said Mary Spellman MD, Phio’s acting Chief Medical Officer. “Corresponding safety and tolerability data supports continued assessment of intratumoral PH-762 in patients with cutaneous carcinomas.”\n\n**Presentation Details are as follows:**\n\n**Title:** | INTASYL PH-762: PD-1 Directed Intratumoral Immunotherapy for Cutaneous Carcinoma  \n---|---  \n**Abstract Number:** | 696  \n**Presenting Author:** | Mary Spellman, M.D.  \n**Date:** | Saturday November 9, 2024  \n**Location:** | Exhibit Halls A and B, George R.
