Brown Convention Center in Houston, Texas. \n\nAbCellera’s presentation, which is available for viewing [here](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fabcellera.com%2Fpost%2Fsitc2024%2F&esheet=54148421&newsitemid=20241107880960&lan=en-US&anchor=here&index=2&md5=1c2c032984d64ef68ebedd70c319d8a0), describes: \n\n**Strategies to address key challenges in TCE development:**\n\n  * CD3-binding antibodies to widen the therapeutic window by generating TCEs with potent tumor-cell killing and optimal cytokine release \n  * Molecules to enhance efficacy for solid tumor indications by increasing T-cell activation and proliferation through costimulation of CD28 and 4-1BB \n\n\n\n**Application of the platform to two of AbCellera’s TCE programs:**\n\n  * Preclinical characterization of TCEs against solid tumor targets B7-H4 and PSMA show tumor-cell killing and cytokine release profiles that are differentiated from clinical benchmarks \n\n\n\n**About AbCellera’s T-Cell Engager Platform**\n\nCD3 T-cell engagers have the potential to be a cornerstone of cancer treatment. They guide the immune system to find and eliminate cancer cells by binding tumor targets and the CD3 protein on cancer-killing T cells at the same time. However, the development of T-cell engagers has been limited due to challenges with efficacy and safety. To address these challenges, AbCellera developed a T-cell engager platform that includes novel CD3-binding antibodies to expand the therapeutic window for this modality, costimulatory building blocks to enhance efficacy for difficult-to-treat cancers, and discovery capabilities to broaden the range of T-cell engagers to complex tumor targets. AbCellera is leveraging its platform to unlock the full potential of this modality and bring potential new cancer medicines to patients. \n\n**About AbCellera Biologics Inc.**\n\n[AbCellera](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abcellera.com&esheet=54148421&newsitemid=20241107880960&lan=en-US&anchor=AbCellera&index=3&md5=943d712564358cc5bef7bd1a5f8b928b) (Nasdaq: ABCL) discovers and develops antibody medicines for indications across therapeutic areas including cancer, metabolic and endocrine conditions, and autoimmune disorders.

AbCellera’s engine integrates technology, data science, infrastructure, and interdisciplinary teams to solve the most challenging antibody discovery problems. AbCellera is focused on advancing an internal pipeline of first-in-class and best-in-class programs and collaborating on innovative drug development programs with partners. For more information, please visit [www.abcellera.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fabcellera.com%2F&esheet=54145712&newsitemid=20241104711335&lan=en-US&anchor=www.abcellera.com&index=4&md5=290d3f35c350b4aec6390abe5abd44d1). \n\n**Definition of Key Business Metrics**\n\nWe regularly review the following key business metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections, and make strategic decisions. We believe that the following metrics are important to understand our current business. These metrics may change or may be substituted for additional or different metrics as our business develops. Information on changes is set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. \n\n**_Partner-initiated program starts with downstreams_ ** represent the number of unique partner-initiated programs where we stand to participate financially in downstream success for which we have commenced the discovery effort. The discovery effort commences on the later of (i) the day on which we receive sufficient reagents to start discovery of antibodies against a target and (ii) the day on which the kick-off meeting for the program is held. We view this metric as an indication of the selection and initiation of projects by our partners and the resulting potential for near-term payments. Cumulatively, partner-initiated program starts with downstream participation indicate our total opportunities to earn downstream revenue from milestone fees and royalties (or royalty equivalents) in the mid- to long-term. \n\n**_Molecules in the clinic_ ** represent the count of unique molecules for which an Investigational New Drug, or IND, New Animal Drug, or equivalent under other regulatory regimes, application has reached “open” status or has otherwise been approved based on an antibody that was discovered either by us or by a partner using licensed AbCellera technology. Where the date of such application approval is not known to us, the date of the first public announcement of a clinical trial will be used for the purpose of this metric. We view this metric as an indication of our near- and mid-term potential revenue from milestone fees and potential royalty payments in the long term. \n\n**AbCellera Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements, including statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
