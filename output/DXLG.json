Here, we call it The DXL Factor.\n\nIt’s the belief that a great wardrobe isn’t a privilege but a Big + Tall man’s right. It’s the freedom to choose from the largest assortment of the best brands and the most exclusive styles, and it’s the way we enable the Big + Tall guy to wear what he wants.\n\n#### FIT\n\nWorking with Big + Tall guys for decades has taught us that we can’t just make clothes bigger, we have to make them differently. Our team has worked for decades to develop specific patterns, taking into consideration fit, comfort, movement and durability for sizes 1XL to 8XL and waists ranging from 38” to 70” to ensure a perfect fit.\n\n#### QUALITY\n\nOur clothes are not just built bigger, but built better with comfort + durability Big and Tall men can trust. Guests can breathe easier in stretch fabrics, hidden comfort features, reinforced seams, performance technology + so many more extras built in that he’ll appreciate.\n\n#### ASSORTMENT OF BRANDS\n\nWith a broad, highly-curated, head-to-toe selection of over 5,000 styles, 100 brands across all price points, and exclusive offerings not available anywhere else, our guest has the largest selection of Big + Tall styles.\n\nWe truly want big and tall men to look and feel their best for every occasion. From exclusive brands and styles, the latest designers, like vineyard vines, Polo Ralph Lauren, Nautica, Reebok, Levi’s and many more, to everyday essentials and private labels like Harbor Bay, Synrgy, Oak Hill and True Nation that are not found anywhere else.\n\n#### STYLE\n\nOur wide selection allows our guests to show up in style every day…not just on the big days or special occasions. Big + Tall men can easily shop from classic styles to day-to-day essentials and fashionable on-trend looks from their favorite brands, all in one place.\n\n#### EXPERIENCE\n\nDXL associates are trained and certified Fit and Style Experts who welcome our guests, helping, guiding and establishing meaningful relationships with each customer, through respect, value and trust no matter how guests choose to shop – at DXL.COM, on our App or in-store.\n\n## OUR MISSION\n\nWe exist to provide the Big + Tall man the freedom to choose his own style.\n\n## OUR VISION\n\nWe relentlessly strive to serve the fit and style needs of the Big + Tall man so he can wear what he wants.\n\n## GIVING BACK: CARE + COMPASSION IN THE DXL COMMUNITY\n\nOur partnership with St. Jude Hospital is one our associates take to heart. During our 16+ years, we’ve raised over $16 million by participating in Thanks and Giving Campaign, The St. Jude Walk/Run to End Childhood Cancer, Round Up the Change and more. These efforts have allowed us to fund initiatives like the Light Microscopy Center. Our associates are also passionate about supporting our local communities like: Big Brothers Big Sisters – Clothing Drive; The Canton Food Pantry – Food Drive; St. Jude Spring Prom – Donate A Dress; Quincy Family Resource Center – Toy Drive and the DXL Volunteer Service Program – 1 Day Per year volunteering at a 501 (c)(3).\n\nc\n"
