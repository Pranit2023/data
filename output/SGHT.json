(Nasdaq: SGHT) (\"Sight Sciences\" or the \"Company\"), an eyecare technology company focused on developing and commercializing innovative, interventional technologies that elevate the standard of care, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and updated its adjusted operating expenses guidance for full year 2024.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial and Business Highlights**\n\n  * Generated total revenue of $20.2 million, an increase of 1% compared to the same period in the prior year.\n  * Generated positive cash flow of $0.4 million, a substantial improvement compared to $10.0 million cash used in the third quarter of 2023, reflecting continued operational discipline and significant working capital improvements. Cash used in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $19.6 million compared to $40.5 million in the same period in the prior year.\n  * Five Medicare Administrative Contractors (“MACs”), each individually published final local coverage determinations and related final local coverage articles (collectively, the “Final LCDs”) regarding Micro-Invasive Glaucoma Surgery (“MIGS”). The Final LCDs confirm Medicare coverage for phacoemulsification / intraocular lens placement procedures (each, a “cataract surgery”) performed with a single MIGS procedure, including both canaloplasty and goniotomy procedures. Accordingly, Medicare coverage for canaloplasty and goniotomy procedures will continue in the states administered by these MACs. The anticipated effective date of the Final LCDs is November 17, 2024.\n\n\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n\"In the third quarter, our Surgical Glaucoma revenue improved slightly but our recovery did not meet our growth expectations, while our Dry Eye revenue outperformed our expectations ahead of our price increase, which was a testament to the importance of TearCare in the treatment paradigm for dry eye patients,” said Paul Badawi, co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of Sight Sciences. “The LCDs that will be effective later this month will provide clarity with continued Medicare coverage for cataract surgery procedures performed with a single MIGS procedure and restrictions on multiple MIGS procedures performed in a single surgery. Surgical glaucoma reimbursement coverage clarity coupled with the continued optimization of our commercial organization and strategy position us for stronger performance and predictability. With our procedurally comprehensive OMNI technology, and an increasing interventional surgeon mindset, we remain confident in the growth trajectory for OMNI in both combination cataract and standalone use cases in 2025 and beyond.”\n\n“We also remain focused on establishing equitable market access for TearCare and are working towards positive coverage policies and payment schedules in 2025,” Paul Badawi continued. “We believe these developments help lay the foundation to establish Sight Sciences as a leading interventional eye care company and position us for growth in 2025 and beyond.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results** Revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was $20.2 million, an increase of 1% compared to the same period in the prior year. Surgical Glaucoma revenue was $18.6 million, an increase of 1% compared to the same period in the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by higher account utilization, which increased by 3% versus the same period in the prior year. Dry Eye revenue was $1.5 million, a decrease of 4% from the same period in the prior year, but ahead of expectations for segment revenue during the period. The expected decline was primarily due to fewer new accounts and related SmartHub® sales, which was a result of the Company’s focus on achieving market access for TearCare procedures.\n\nGross profit for the third quarter of 2024 was $16.9 million compared to $17.3 million in the same period in the prior year. Gross margin for the third quarter of 2024 was 84%, compared to 87% in the same period in the prior year, as expected due to higher overhead costs per unit in the current period as a result of lower production volumes in both segments. Surgical Glaucoma gross margin in the third quarter of 2024 declined to 87%, compared to 89% in the same period in the prior year. Dry Eye gross margin in the third quarter of 2024 declined to 48%, from 57% in the same period in the prior year.\n\nTotal operating expenses were $28.1 million in the third quarter of 2024, representing an 8% decrease compared to $30.7 million in the same period in the prior year, which reflects improved operating expense leverage compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to lower legal expenses in the comparative periods. Research and development expenses were $4.7 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $4.2 million in the same period in the prior year, representing a 12% increase. Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $23.4 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $26.5 million in the same period in the prior year, representing a 12% decrease. Adjusted operating expenses1,2 were $23.8 million in the third quarter of 2024, down from $26.8 million in the same period in the prior year, representing an 11% decrease.\n\nNet loss was $11.1 million ($0.22 per share) in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $13.0 million ($0.27 per share) in the same period in the prior year.\n\nCash and cash equivalents totaled $118.6 million and total long-term debt was $35.0 million (before debt discount and amortized debt issuance costs) as of September 30, 2024, compared to $118.2 million and $35.0 million, respectively, as of June 30, 2024. Cash generated in the third quarter of 2024 totaled $0.4 million, compared to $10.0 million of cash used in the same period in the prior year, reflecting continued operational discipline and a substantial improvement in working capital.\n\n**2024 Financial Guidance** Sight Sciences maintains its revenue guidance expectations for full year 2024 of approximately $81.0 million to $83.0 million.\n\nThe Company continues to expect double-digit Surgical Glaucoma revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year as it regains commercial momentum and expands utilization and its customer base. However, the Company also acknowledges headwinds to growth in the total number of MIGS devices used in MIGS procedures due to the Final LCDs’ limitations on multiple MIGS used in a single surgery effective mid-quarter, and the slower than expected recovery in Surgical Glaucoma utilization and active accounts experienced in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nThe Company expects Dry Eye revenue for the fourth quarter 2024 to be less than $0.5 million. Dry Eye revenue is still expected to decrease following the implementation of an increase in dry eye pricing effective October 1, 2024, which is expected to have a significant negative impact on cash-pay procedure volumes in the fourth quarter of 2024, before the Company expects a return to growth in 2025 with market access wins.\n\nThe Company revises its guidance expectations for adjusted operating expenses1,3 for full year 2024 to approximately $104.0 million to $106.0 million from $107.0 million to $109.0 million previously reported, representing a decrease of approximately 4% to 6% compared to 2023.\n\nThe Company's full year 2024 financial guidance is forward-looking in nature, reflecting management’s expectations as of November 7, 2024, and is subject to significant risks and uncertainties that limit its ability to accurately forecast results. This outlook assumes no meaningful changes to the Company's business prospects or risks and uncertainties identified by management that could impact future results, which include, but are not limited to: changes to coverage decisions or reimbursement rates for our products, pricing pressure or loss of market share resulting from the evolving competitive landscape; and disruptions to or increased costs associated with our supply chain, including as a result of having a limited number of suppliers. \n\n1 “Adjusted operating expenses” is a financial measure not prepared in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP,” and such measure, a “non-GAAP financial measure”), and is calculated as operating expenses less stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, and restructuring costs. Please see the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below for additional information.2 A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures has been provided in the table titled \"Non-GAAP to GAAP Reconciliation\" attached to this press release.3 Consistent with Securities and Exchange Commission regulations, the Company has not provided a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in reliance on the “unreasonable efforts” exception set forth in the applicable regulations, because there is substantial uncertainty associated with predicting any future adjustments that may be made to the Company’s GAAP financial measures in calculating the non-GAAP financial measures.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nCertain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted operating expenses, are presented in this press release to provide information that may assist investors in understanding the Company's financial and operating results. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures are important performance indicators because they exclude items that are unrelated to, and may not be indicative of, the Company's core financial and operating results. These non-GAAP financial measures, as calculated, may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies and may not be appropriate measures for comparing the performance of other companies relative to the Company. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to represent, and should not be considered to be more meaningful measures than, or alternatives to, measures of operating performance as determined in accordance with GAAP. To the extent the Company utilizes such non-GAAP financial measures in the future, it expects to calculate them using a consistent method from period to period.\n\n**Conference Call** Sight Sciences' management team will host a conference call today, November 7, 2024, beginning at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time / 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time.
