Core FFO increased primarily due to a settlement received at one of our properties related to deferred maintenance.\n\nNet income available to common stockholders and Non-controlling OP Unitholders for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $8.5 million, or $0.20 per share, compared to net loss attributable to common stockholders and Non-controlling OP Unitholders for the three months ended June 30, 2024 of $1.6 million, or $0.04 per share. In the Summary Information table above, we provide a reconciliation of Core FFO to net income (loss) (which we believe is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Core FFO) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, a computation of basic and diluted Core FFO per weighted average share of common stock and Non-controlling OP Unit, and basic and diluted net income (loss) per weighted average share of common stock and Non-controlling OP Unit.\n\n**Subsequent to the end of the quarter:**\n\n  * **Collected 100% of October cash rents:** Collected 100% of cash rents due in October;\n\n  * **Issued common stock under ATM Program:** Issued 182,368 shares for net proceeds of $2.9 million;\n\n  * **Issued Series F Preferred Stock:** Issued 4,000 shares for net proceeds of $0.1 million;\n\n  * **Issued new debt:** Borrowed $15.2 million in fixed rate mortgage debt at an interest rate of 5.60% and a maturity date of August 31, 2029;\n\n  * **Repaid debt:** Repaid $14.8 million in fixed rate mortgage debt at an interest rate of 4.04%; and\n\n  * **Declared distributions:** Declared monthly cash distributions for October, November, and December2024, totaling $0.30 per share on our common stock and Non-controlling OP Units, $0.414063 per share on our Series E Preferred Stock, $0.375 per share on our Series F Preferred Stock, $0.375 per share on our Series G Preferred Stock, and $0.2625 per share on our senior common stock.\n\n\n\n\n**Comments from Gladstone Commercial's President, Buzz Cooper:** \"Our financial results reflect consistent performance and stabilized revenues from our tremendous same store property occupancy, rent collection and growth, accretive real estate investments made during 2023 and 2024, and our ability to renew tenants, as well as our deleveraging and capital recycling programs. We have continued our capital recycling program, whereby we have sold non-core assets and used the proceeds to de-lever our portfolio, as well as acquire properties in our target growth markets. We have successfully exited six non-core assets thus far in 2024, and we have additional non-core assets we anticipate selling over the next one to two years that we believe will result in capital gains. We will continue to opportunistically sell non-core assets and redeploy the proceeds into stronger target growth markets with a focus on industrial investment opportunities. While we expect to face challenges due to the lingering effects of the pandemic, significant inflation with a corresponding increase in interest rates, and the geo-political and economic issues arising from international wars, we feel strongly about the depth of our tenant credit underwriting. We have collected 100% of the first three quarters' cash rents and 100% of October cash rents. We anticipate our tenants will successfully navigate the current economic climate and will be able to continue operating successfully when economic normalcy returns fully. Despite economic uncertainty, so far during 2024, we renewed or newly leased 2,626,199 square feet of properties with ten tenants. We are actively marketing our remaining vacant space and currently anticipate positive outcomes. We expect to continue to have access to the debt and equity markets, as necessary, for added liquidity. We believe our same store rents, which have increased by 2% annually in recent years, should continue to rise as we grow, and we will continue to primarily focus on investing in our target markets, with an emphasis on industrial properties and actively managing our portfolio.\"\n\n**Conference Call:** Gladstone Commercial will hold a conference call on Tuesday, November 5, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss its earnings results.

FFO, as defined by NAREIT, is net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property and impairment losses on property, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO does not represent cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of its performance or to cash flow from operations as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions. The Company believes that FFO per share provides investors with an additional context for evaluating its financial performance and as a supplemental measure to compare it to other REITs; however, comparisons of its FFO to the FFO of other REITs may not necessarily be meaningful due to potential differences in the application of the NAREIT definition used by such other REITs.\n\n**Core FFO:** Core FFO is FFO adjusted for certain items that are not indicative of the results provided by the Company's operating portfolio and affect the comparability of the Company's period-over-period performance. These items include the adjustment for acquisition related expenses, gains or losses from early extinguishment of debt and any other non-recurring expense adjustments. Although the Company's calculation of Core FFO differs from NAREIT's definition of FFO and may not be comparable to that of other REITs, the Company believes it is a meaningful supplemental measure of its operating performance. Accordingly, Core FFO should be considered a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance.\n\nThe Company's presentation of FFO, as defined by NAREIT, or presentation of Core FFO, does not represent cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of its performance or to cash flow from operations as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions.\n\n_The statements in this press release regarding the forecasted stability of Gladstone Commercial's income, its ability, plans or prospects to re-lease its unoccupied properties, and grow its portfolio are \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking statements inherently involve certain risks and uncertainties, although they are based on Gladstone Commercial's current plans that are believed to be reasonable as of the date of this press release. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, Gladstone Commercial's ability to raise additional capital; availability and terms of capital and financing, both to fund its operations and to refinance its indebtedness as it matures; downturns in the current economic environment; the performance of its tenants; the impact of competition on its efforts to renew existing leases or re-lease space; and significant changes in interest rates.Additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated or implied by its forward-looking statements are disclosed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" of its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on February 21, 2024, and other reports filed with the SEC.Gladstone Commercial cautions readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made.Gladstone Commercial undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law._\n\n**CONTACT:**\n\nGladstone Commercial Corporation(703) 287-5893\n\n**SOURCE:** Gladstone Commercial Corporation\n\nView the original [press release](https://www.accesswire.com/938721/gladstone-commercial-corporation-reports-results-for-the-third-quarter-ended-september-30-2024) on accesswire.com \n\nReleased November 4, 2024\n\n  * location_on 1521 Westbranch Drive, Suite 100 | McLean, VA 22102\n  * call[(703) 287-5893](tel:7032875893)\n  * emailcommercial@gladstonecompanies.com\n\n\n\n  * [Email Alerts](/investors/news-events/email-alerts)\n  * [Contacts](/investors/company-information/contacts)\n  * [RSS News Feed](https://www.gladstonecommercial.com/investors/news-events/press-releases/rss)\n\n\n"

Core FFO increased primarily due to a settlement received at one of our properties related to deferred maintenance.\n\nNet income available to common stockholders and Non-controlling OP Unitholders for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $8.5 million, or $0.20 per share, compared to net loss attributable to common stockholders and Non-controlling OP Unitholders for the three months ended June 30, 2024 of $1.6 million, or $0.04 per share. In the Summary Information table above, we provide a reconciliation of Core FFO to net income (loss) (which we believe is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Core FFO) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, a computation of basic and diluted Core FFO per weighted average share of common stock and Non-controlling OP Unit, and basic and diluted net income (loss) per weighted average share of common stock and Non-controlling OP Unit.\n\n**Subsequent to the end of the quarter:**\n\n  * **Collected 100% of October cash rents:** Collected 100% of cash rents due in October;\n\n  * **Issued common stock under ATM Program:** Issued 182,368 shares for net proceeds of $2.9 million;\n\n  * **Issued Series F Preferred Stock:** Issued 4,000 shares for net proceeds of $0.1 million;\n\n  * **Issued new debt:** Borrowed $15.2 million in fixed rate mortgage debt at an interest rate of 5.60% and a maturity date of August 31, 2029;\n\n  * **Repaid debt:** Repaid $14.8 million in fixed rate mortgage debt at an interest rate of 4.04%; and\n\n  * **Declared distributions:** Declared monthly cash distributions for October, November, and December2024, totaling $0.30 per share on our common stock and Non-controlling OP Units, $0.414063 per share on our Series E Preferred Stock, $0.375 per share on our Series F Preferred Stock, $0.375 per share on our Series G Preferred Stock, and $0.2625 per share on our senior common stock.\n\n\n\n\n**Comments from Gladstone Commercial's President, Buzz Cooper:** \"Our financial results reflect consistent performance and stabilized revenues from our tremendous same store property occupancy, rent collection and growth, accretive real estate investments made during 2023 and 2024, and our ability to renew tenants, as well as our deleveraging and capital recycling programs. We have continued our capital recycling program, whereby we have sold non-core assets and used the proceeds to de-lever our portfolio, as well as acquire properties in our target growth markets. We have successfully exited six non-core assets thus far in 2024, and we have additional non-core assets we anticipate selling over the next one to two years that we believe will result in capital gains. We will continue to opportunistically sell non-core assets and redeploy the proceeds into stronger target growth markets with a focus on industrial investment opportunities. While we expect to face challenges due to the lingering effects of the pandemic, significant inflation with a corresponding increase in interest rates, and the geo-political and economic issues arising from international wars, we feel strongly about the depth of our tenant credit underwriting. We have collected 100% of the first three quarters' cash rents and 100% of October cash rents. We anticipate our tenants will successfully navigate the current economic climate and will be able to continue operating successfully when economic normalcy returns fully. Despite economic uncertainty, so far during 2024, we renewed or newly leased 2,626,199 square feet of properties with ten tenants. We are actively marketing our remaining vacant space and currently anticipate positive outcomes. We expect to continue to have access to the debt and equity markets, as necessary, for added liquidity. We believe our same store rents, which have increased by 2% annually in recent years, should continue to rise as we grow, and we will continue to primarily focus on investing in our target markets, with an emphasis on industrial properties and actively managing our portfolio.\"\n\n**Conference Call:** Gladstone Commercial will hold a conference call on Tuesday, November 5, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss its earnings results.
