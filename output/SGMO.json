Therapeutics Announces U.S. FDA Clearance of IND Application for ST-503 for the Treatment of Idiopathic Small Fiber Neuropathy, a Type of Chronic Neuropathic Pain\n\nNovember 19, 2024 at 4:15 PM EST\n\n[PDF Version](/node/18996/pdf)\n\n_Sangamo plans to_ _initiate enrollment of patients in the_ _Phase 1/2 study for ST-503 in mid-2025_\n\nRICHMOND, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 19, 2024-- Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: SGMO), a genomic medicine company, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has cleared the investigational new drug (IND) application for its ST-503 program, an investigational epigenetic regulator for the treatment of intractable pain due to idiopathic small fiber neuropathy (iSFN), a type of chronic neuropathic pain. \n\nNeuropathic pain can be caused by a broad array of pathologies impacting the central or peripheral nervous systems, such as surgical trauma, spinal cord injury, nerve compression, neurological and infectious diseases, or metabolic and hereditary syndromes. ST-503 is not intended for sporadic or acute pain, but for chronic, intractable pain that completely dominates and often destroys the lives of patients over many years. The Phase 1/2 study will assess the safety and efficacy of ST-503 in addressing iSFN, a peripheral neuropathy that results in highly debilitating symptoms of burning, prickling, stabbing or “lightning-like” pain. iSFN has an estimated prevalence of at least 43,000 patients in the U.S., and more broadly, peripheral neuropathies are estimated to affect nearly 40 million Americans. Antidepressants, anticonvulsants, opioids and topical therapies are potential treatment options, although no long-lasting or curative therapies are currently available for iSFN patients, leading to a high unmet medical need for this patient population. \n\n“The FDA’s clearance of the IND application to evaluate ST-503 in idiopathic small fiber neuropathy represents an important milestone for Sangamo on our journey to becoming a neurology genomic medicine company,” said Nathalie Dubois-Stringfellow, Ph.D, Chief Development Officer at Sangamo. “We strongly believe in the power of our zinc finger technology to address neurological conditions and are excited about our plans to advance this program into the clinic next year, to bring hope to patients suffering from debilitating, intractable pain, for which there are insufficient current treatment options.” \n\nA significant body of evidence implicates sodium channels in mediating the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain. ST-503 uses an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector carrying an engineered zinc finger repressor (ZFR) to specifically target the human gene, _SCN9A_ , that encodes the Nav1.7 sodium channel and is critical for pain signaling. Developing small molecules that specifically target Nav1.7 is challenging due to the high structural similarities between different sodium channels, making it difficult to achieve selectivity and avoid off-target effects. By directly targeting the _SCN9A_ gene, ST-503 was shown to selectively reduce the expression of Nav1.7 sodium channels in sensory neurons in animal models and significantly reduce pain hypersensitivity, following a single intrathecal administration of ST-503. Sangamo’s preclinical research has shown ST-503 to be well tolerated in nonhuman primates, with substantial Nav1.7 reduction observed with no off-target effects, demonstrating the promise of ST-503 as a potential therapy for chronic neuropathic pain, regardless of cause. \n\nSangamo is preparing for the Phase 1/2 clinical study to assess the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of a one-time dose of ST-503, administered intrathecally to patients with intractable pain due to iSFN, and plans to initiate patient enrollment in mid-2025. \n\nSangamo believes that if this study is successful, the development of ST-503 could be broadened to patient populations suffering from other types of chronic neuropathic pain. \n\n**About Sangamo Therapeutics**\n\nSangamo Therapeutics is a genomic medicine company dedicated to translating ground-breaking science into medicines that transform the lives of patients and families afflicted with serious neurological diseases who do not have adequate or any treatment options. Sangamo believes that its zinc finger epigenetic regulators are ideally suited to potentially address devastating neurological disorders and that its capsid discovery platform can expand delivery beyond currently available intrathecal delivery capsids, including the central nervous system.

sales._\n\n_Submitted investigational new drug (IND) application to FDA for ST-503 for the treatment of intractable pain due to idiopathic small fiber neuropathy (iSFN), a type of chronic neuropathic pain._\n\nRICHMOND, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 12, 2024-- Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: SGMO), a genomic medicine company, today reported business highlights and third quarter 2024 financial results. \n\n“This is a pivotal time for Sangamo as we build upon our recent strong momentum with news of a clear regulatory pathway to Accelerated Approval in the U.S. for ST-920 in Fabry disease, accelerating time to potential approval by approximately three years,” said Sandy Macrae, Chief Executive Officer of Sangamo Therapeutics. “Alongside Pfizer’s Hemophilia A program activities, and against a backdrop of our recent epigenetic regulation and capsid license agreement with Genentech, these developments create a strong foundation for our core neurology pipeline, which continues to advance. We were thrilled to submit our first neurology IND application this quarter for ST-503 for the treatment of intractable pain due to idiopathic small fiber neuropathy and expect to be in the clinic in mid-2025. We are proud of our scientific and strategic execution so far this year and are continuing to work diligently to secure additional funding to further advance our wholly owned neurology programs, capsid delivery technology and next-generation genome engineering capabilities.” \n\n**Recent Business Highlights**\n\n**_Corporate Updates_**\n\n  * Announced in August a global epigenetic regulation and capsid delivery license agreement with Genentech to develop novel genomic medicines for neurodegenerative diseases. \n  * Received $50.0 million from Genentech in upfront license fees and milestone payments. \n  * Eligible to earn up to $1.9 billion from Genentech in additional development and commercial milestones spread across multiple potential products under the agreement and tiered royalties on net sales of such products, subject to certain specified reductions. \n\n\n\n**_Clinical Programs_**\n\n_Fabry Disease_\n\n  * Announced in October the outcome of a successful interaction with the FDA, providing a clear regulatory pathway to Accelerated Approval for isaralgagene civaparvovec, or ST-920, an investigational gene therapy for the treatment of Fabry disease. \n  * The FDA has agreed in a Type B interaction that data from the ongoing Phase 1/2 STAAR study can serve as the primary basis for approval under the Accelerated Approval Program, using estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) slope as an intermediate clinical endpoint. \n  * Sangamo engaged with the FDA on alternative pathways to potential approval following analysis of clinical data from the Phase 1/2 STAAR study showing encouraging safety and efficacy data, including promising preliminary evidence of improved kidney function. In the 18 male and female patients treated with isaralgagene civaparvovec with more than one year of follow-up data, a statistically significant positive mean annualized eGFR slope was observed. \n  * Based on these latest data, the FDA agreed that eGFR slope at 52 weeks can serve as an intermediate clinical endpoint to support a potential Accelerated Approval. The FDA also advised that eGFR slope at 104 weeks may be assessed to verify clinical benefit. \n  * The complete dataset to support an Accelerated Approval pathway will be available in the first half of 2025. This approach unlocks a potential Biologics License Application (BLA) submission in the second half of 2025, three years ahead of previous estimates, and avoids the requirement for an additional, costly registrational study to establish clinical efficacy. \n  * Dosing was completed in the Phase 1/2 STAAR study in April 2024, with a total of 33 patients dosed. The longest treated patient recently achieved four years of follow-up. \n  * The 18th and final patient who started the study on Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT), was successfully withdrawn from ERT in September 2024, and all 18 patients remain off ERT as of today. \n  * Sangamo has begun to execute BLA readiness activities for isaralgagene civaparvovec, while continuing to advance ongoing business development discussions with potential collaboration partners. \n\n\n\n_Hemophilia A_\n\n  * Pfizer will be presenting detailed data from the Phase 3 AFFINE trial of giroctocogene fitelparvovec, an investigational gene therapy that Sangamo has co-developed with and licensed to Pfizer for the treatment of adults with moderately severe to severe hemophilia A, in an oral presentation at the 66th ASH Annual Meeting and Exposition on December 9, 2024. \n  * The ASH abstract confirmed that the AFFINE trial met its primary endpoint of non-inferiority and superiority, with a statistically significant decrease in total annualized bleeding rate (ABR) from Week 12 through at least 15 months of follow up post-infusion compared with routine Factor VIII (FVIII) replacement prophylaxis treatment (mean total ABR estimates, 1.24 vs 4.73). \n  * Key secondary endpoints as defined by the trial protocol – the percentage of participants with FVIII activity >5% (chromogenic assay) at 15 months and ABR for treated bleeds – were met, and also demonstrated superiority compared to prophylaxis. At Month 15, 84% of participants had FVIII activity >5%, with 82.8% of participants continuing to maintain FVIII activity >5% at 2-years post-infusion. \n  * Treated ABR during Week 12 through ≥15 months post-infusion was significantly reduced compared to prophylaxis (mean treated ABR estimates, 0.07 vs. 4.08), demonstrating superiority. \n  * In the AFFINE trial, giroctocogene fitelparvovec was generally well tolerated with no study discontinuations. \n  * Pfizer is discussing these data with regulatory authorities. \n  * Sangamo is eligible to earn from Pfizer up to $220.0 million in milestone payments upon the achievement of certain regulatory and commercial milestones for giroctocogene fitelparvovec and product sales royalties of 14% - 20% if giroctocogene fitelparvovec is approved and commercialized, subject to certain reductions. \n\n\n\n**_Neurology Pipeline_**\n\n_Chronic Neuropathic Pain_\n\n  * Submitted IND application to the FDA for ST-503, an investigational epigenetic regulator for the treatment of intractable pain due to iSFN, a type of chronic neuropathic pain. \n  * Assuming clearance of this IND by the FDA, we expect to start the Phase 1/2 study in the middle of 2025. \n  * Published a manuscript in _bioRxiv_ titled, “Potent and selective repression of SCN9A by engineered zinc finger repressors (ZFRs) for the treatment of neuropathic pain” demonstrating that ZFRs can selectively and potently reduce the expression of Nav1.7 sodium channels in sensory neurons in animal models, following a single intrathecal administration of ST-503. \n\n\n\n_Prion Disease_\n\n  * Clinical trial authorization (CTA) enabling activities continue to advance for Sangamo’s program to treat prion disease, leveraging our novel neurotropic AAV capsid known as STAC-BBB, that has demonstrated industry-leading blood brain barrier penetration in nonhuman primates (NHPs) following intravenous administration. \n  * Presented updated data at Prion 2024 Conference in October 2024, showing the potency of Sangamo’s ZFR in a disease mouse model at multiple dose levels. The ZFR significantly reduced expression of prion mRNA and protein in the brain, extended mouse survival and limited the formation of toxic prion aggregates. \n  * Additionally, we presented NHP data at the Prion 2024 Conference, showing that a single intravenous administration of the prion ZFR, delivered via STAC-BBB, resulted in potent and widespread repression of the prion gene in transduced neurons. \n  * A CTA submission is expected in the fourth quarter of 2025. \n\n\n\n_Novel Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) Capsid Delivery Technology_\n\n  * We continue to engage in business development discussions with new potential collaborators for STAC-BBB for use in delivering intravenously administered genomic medicines for certain specified neurological diseases. \n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nConsolidated net income available for common stockholders for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 was $10.7 million, or $0.04 per share on a fully diluted basis, compared to a net loss of $104.2 million, or $0.59 per share, for the same period in 2023. \n\n_Revenues_\n\nRevenues for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 were $49.4 million, compared to $9.4 million for the same period in 2023. \n\nThe increase of $40.0 million in revenues was primarily attributed to $49.2 million in revenue relating to our collaboration agreement with Genentech, Inc. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of $5.5 million in revenue relating to our collaboration agreement with Kite Pharma, Inc. which expired pursuant to its terms in April 2024, and a decrease of $3.7 million in revenue relating to our other license agreements. \n\n_GAAP and Non-GAAP Operating Expenses_\n\n**Three Months Ended** | **Nine Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n**September 30 ,** | **September 30 ,**  \n**(In millions)** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nResearch and development |  $  |  27.7  |  $  |  57.1  |  $  |  87.8  |  $  |  183.4   \nGeneral and administrative |  11.1  |  13.9  |  34.9  |  48.1   \nImpairment of long-lived assets |  -  |  44.8  |  5.5  |  65.2   \nImpairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets |  -  |  -  |  -  |  89.5   \nTotal operating expenses |  38.8  |  115.8  |  128.2  |  386.2   \nImpairment of long-lived assets |  -  |  (44.8  |  )  |  (5.5  |  )  |  (65.2  |  )   \nImpairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets |  -  |  -  |  -  |  (89.5  |  )   \nDepreciation and amortization |  (1.3  |  )  |  (5.5  |  )  |  (3.9  |  )  |  (13.2  |  )   \nStock-based compensation expense |  (3.3  |  )  |  (6.2  |  )  |  (9.1  |  )  |  (21.3  |  )   \nNon-GAAP operating expenses |  $  |  34.2  |  $  |  59.3  |  $  |  109.7  |  $  |  197.0   \n  \nTotal operating expenses on a GAAP basis for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 were $38.8 million compared to $115.8 million for the same period in 2023. Non-GAAP operating expenses, which exclude impairment charges, depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation expense as shown in the reconciliation table above, for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 were $34.2 million, compared to $59.3 million for the same period in 2023. \n\nThe decrease in total operating expenses on a non-GAAP basis was primarily attributable to a decrease in preclinical and clinical expenses due to deferral and reprioritization of certain research and development programs, lower compensation and other personnel costs mainly due to lower headcount as a result of restructuring of operations and a corresponding reductions in workforce announced during 2023, a decrease in external professional services costs, and a decrease in facilities and infrastructure related expenses. \n\n_Cash and Cash Equivalents_\n\nCash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 were $39.2 million, compared to cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $81.0 million as of December 31, 2023. We believe that our available cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024, together with the $10.0 million milestone payment we received from Genentech, will be sufficient to fund our planned operations into the first quarter of 2025. \n\n_Financial Guidance for 2024_\n\n  * On a GAAP basis, we expect total operating expenses in the range of approximately $150 million to $170 million in 2024, which includes non-cash stock-based compensation expense, impairment expense, and depreciation and amortization. \n  * We expect non-GAAP total operating expenses, excluding estimated non-cash stock-based compensation expense of approximately $13 million, impairment expense of approximately $6 million, and depreciation and amortization of approximately $6 million, in the range of approximately $125 million to $145 million in 2024. \n\n\n\n**Upcoming Events**\n\nSangamo plans to participate in the following event: \n\n  * Jefferies London Healthcare Conference, November 19-21, 2024\n\n\n\nAccess links for available webcasts for investor conferences will be available on the Sangamo website in the Investors and Media section under [Events](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.sangamo.com%2Fevents-and-presentations&esheet=54150891&newsitemid=20241112955936&lan=en-US&anchor=Events&index=1&md5=1d88f6702d0a80b720e55046dc11bce5).

These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Factors that could cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties related to Sangamo’s lack of capital resources and need for substantial additional funding to execute its operating plan and to continue to operate as a going concern, including the risk that Sangamo will be unable to obtain funding or partnerships or additional collaboration partners necessary to advance its preclinical and clinical programs and to otherwise operate as a going concern, in which case Sangamo may be required to cease operations entirely, liquidate all or a portion of its assets and/or seek protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the potential for Genentech to breach or terminate its agreement with Sangamo; and the potential for Sangamo to fail to realize its expected benefits from the Genentech agreement, including but not limited to further validating the importance of the zinc finger platform to support the development of therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases; Sangamo’s ability to execute its restructurings as currently contemplated; the uncertain and costly research and development process, including the risk that preclinical results may not be indicative of results in any future clinical trials; the effects of macroeconomic factors or financial challenges, including as a result of the ongoing overseas conflicts, current or potential future bank failures, inflation and high interest rates, on the global business environment, healthcare systems and business and operations of Sangamo and its collaborators, including the initiation and operation of clinical trials; the impacts of clinical trial delays, pauses and holds on clinical trial timelines and commercialization of product candidates; the uncertain timing and unpredictable nature of clinical trial results, including the risk that therapeutic effects in the Phase 3 AFFINE trial will not be durable in patients as well as the risk that the therapeutic effects observed in the latest preliminary clinical data from the Phase 1/2 STAAR study will not be durable in patients and that final clinical trial data from the study will not validate the safety and efficacy of isaralgagene civaparvovec, including that the 52-week data from the Phase 1/2 STAAR study will not support a BLA submission and/or that the 104-week data from such study will not verify the clinical benefit of isaralgagene civaparvovec or support FDA approval, and that the patients withdrawn from ERT will remain off ERT; the unpredictable regulatory approval process for product candidates across multiple regulatory authorities; reliance on results of early clinical trials, which results are not necessarily predictive of future clinical trial results, including the results of any registrational trial of Sangamo’s product candidates; the potential for technological developments that obviate technologies used by Sangamo; Sangamo’s reliance on collaborators and its potential inability to secure additional collaborations, and Sangamo’s ability to achieve expected future operating results._\n\n_All forward-looking statements about our future plans and expectations, including our financial guidance, are subject to our ability to secure adequate additional funding. There can be no assurance that Sangamo and its collaborators will be able to develop commercially viable products or that Sangamo will earn any milestone or royalty payments under its collaboration agreements. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements due to the risks and uncertainties described above and other risks and uncertainties that exist in the operations and business environments of Sangamo and its collaborators. These risks and uncertainties are described more fully in Sangamo’s Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, filings and reports, including in Sangamo’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as supplemented by Sangamo’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, and subsequent filings and reports that Sangamo makes from time to time with the SEC. Forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are made as of this date, and Sangamo undertakes no duty to update such information except as required under applicable law._\n\n_Non-GAAP Financial Measures_\n\n_To supplement our financial results and guidance presented in accordance with GAAP, we present non-GAAP operating expenses, which excludes depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense and impairment of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets from GAAP operating expenses. We believe that this non-GAAP financial measure, when considered together with our financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, can enhance investors’ and analysts’ ability to meaningfully compare our results from period to period and to our forward-looking guidance, and to identify operating trends in our business. We have excluded depreciation and amortization, and stock-based compensation expense because they are non-cash expenses that may vary significantly from period to period as a result of changes not directly or immediately related to the operational performance for the periods presented, and we have excluded impairment of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our operating performance in other periods. This non-GAAP financial measure is in addition to, not a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. We encourage investors to carefully consider our results under GAAP, as well as our supplemental non-GAAP financial information, to more fully understand our business._\n\n**SELECTED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL DATA**  \n---  \n(Unaudited; in thousands, except per share amounts)  \n**Statement of Operations Data:**  \n**Three months ended** | **Nine months ended**  \n**September 30 ,** | **September 30 ,**  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nRevenues |  $  |  49,412  |  $  |  9,398  |  $  |  50,249  |  $  |  174,190   \nOperating expenses:  \nResearch and development |  27,732  |  57,089  |  87,846  |  183,351   \nGeneral and administrative |  11,049  |  13,918  |  34,861  |  48,068   \nImpairment of long-lived assets |  -  |  44,799  |  5,521  |  65,232   \nImpairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets |  -  |  -  |  -  |  89,485   \nTotal operating expenses |  38,781  |  115,806  |  128,228  |  386,136   \nIncome (loss) from operations |  10,631  |  (106,408  |  )  |  (77,979  |  )  |  (211,946  |  )   \nInterest and other income, net |  129  |  3,515  |  3,694  |  9,610   \nIncome (loss) before income taxes |  10,760  |  (102,893  |  )  |  (74,285  |  )  |  (202,336  |  )   \nIncome tax expense (benefit) |  88  |  1,270  |  260  |  (4,800  |  )   \nNet income (loss) |  10,672  |  (104,163  |  )  |  (74,545  |  )  |  (197,536  |  )   \nNet income allocated to participating securities |  1,287  |  -  |  -  |  -   \nNet income (loss) available to common stockholders |  $  |  9,385  |  $  |  (104,163  |  )  |  $  |  (74,545  |  )  |  $  |  (197,536  |  )   \nNet income (loss) per share  \nBasic |  $  |  0.05  |  $  |  (0.59  |  )  |  $  |  (0.37  |  )  |  $  |  (1.14  |  )   \nDiluted |  $  |  0.04  |  $  |  (0.59  |  )  |  $  |  (0.37  |  )  |  $  |  (1.14  |  )   \nShares used in computing net income (loss) per share  \nBasic |  208,345  |  177,171  |  198,849  |  173,375   \nDiluted |  214,325  |  177,171  |  198,849  |  173,375   \n**Selected Balance Sheet Data:**  \n**September 30, 2024** | **December 31, 2023**  \nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities |  $  |  39,201  |  $  |  81,002   \nTotal assets |  $  |  111,263  |  $  |  165,320   \nTotal stockholders' equity |  $  |  39,134  |  $  |  82,887   \n  \n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20241112955936r1&sid=acqr8&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\nView source version on [businesswire.com](http://businesswire.com): <https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241112955936/en/>\n\nInvestor Relations & Media Inquiries Louise Wilkie ir@sangamo.com media@sangamo.com\n\nSource: Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc.\n"

Therapeutics Announces Alignment With FDA on Accelerated Approval Pathway for ST-920 in Fabry Disease With BLA Submission Expected in 2025\n\nOctober 22, 2024 at 8:05 AM EDT\n\n[PDF Version](/node/18936/pdf)\n\n- _U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) provides a clear regulatory pathway to Accelerated Approval for isaralgagene civaparvovec using data from ongoing Phase 1/2 STAAR study, avoiding requirement for additional registrational study and accelerating estimated time to potential approval by approximately three years._\n\n- _FDA confirms that estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) slope data at one year across all Phase 1/2 patients can serve as primary basis for approval under Accelerated Approval pathway._\n\n- _Data to support Accelerated Approval pathway available in first half of 2025, with a potential Biologics License Application (BLA) submission expected in the second half of 2025._\n\nRICHMOND, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 22, 2024-- Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: SGMO), a genomic medicine company, today announced the outcome of a recent successful interaction with the U.S. FDA, providing a clear regulatory pathway to Accelerated Approval for isaralgagene civaparvovec, or ST-920, its wholly owned gene therapy product candidate for the treatment of Fabry disease. \n\nThe FDA has agreed in a Type B interaction that data from the ongoing Phase 1/2 STAAR study can serve as the primary basis for approval under the Accelerated Approval Program, using eGFR slope at 52 weeks across all patients as an intermediate clinical endpoint. The complete dataset to support an Accelerated Approval pathway will be available in the first half of 2025. This approach unlocks a potential BLA submission in the second half of 2025, three years ahead of previous estimates, and avoids the requirement for an additional registrational study to establish clinical efficacy. \n\nSangamo engaged with the FDA on alternative pathways to potential approval following analysis of clinical data from the Phase 1/2 STAAR study showing encouraging safety and efficacy data, including promising preliminary evidence of improved kidney function. Renal manifestations, such as proteinuria or a decreased glomerular filtration rate, occur early in life in almost all male, and in many female, patients with Fabry disease, and can lead to end-stage renal disease and early death. In the 18 male and female patients treated with isaralgagene civaparvovec with more than one year of follow-up data, statistically significant improvements were observed in both mean and median eGFR levels, resulting in a positive annualized eGFR slope. Based on these latest data, the FDA agreed that eGFR slope at 52 weeks can serve as an intermediate clinical endpoint to support a potential Accelerated Approval. The FDA also advised that eGFR slope at 104 weeks may be assessed to verify clinical benefit. \n\n“Fabry is a debilitating disease, for which there is a serious unmet medical need,” said Sandy Macrae, Chief Executive Officer of Sangamo. “I strongly believe in the potential for ST-920 to alleviate many manifestations of Fabry disease and am delighted to have a clear regulatory pathway that could bring this treatment to patients significantly sooner than originally anticipated”. \n\nDosing was completed in the Phase 1/2 STAAR study in April 2024, with a total of 33 patients dosed. The longest treated patient recently achieved four years of follow-up. The 18th and final patient who started the study on Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT) was successfully withdrawn from ERT in September 2024, and all 18 patients remain off ERT as of today. The 52-week eGFR slope data from all enrolled patients in the Phase 1/2 STAAR study will be available in the first half of 2025. A potential BLA submission is anticipated in the second half of 2025. \n\nSangamo has begun to execute BLA readiness activities for isaralgagene civaparvovec, while continuing to advance ongoing business development discussions with potential collaboration partners. \n\n**About the STAAR Study**\n\nThe Phase 1/2 STAAR study is a global open-label, single-dose, dose-ranging, multicenter clinical study designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of isaralgagene civaparvovec, or ST-920, a gene therapy product candidate in patients with Fabry disease. Isaralgagene civaparvovec requires a one-time infusion without preconditioning. The STAAR study enrolled male and female patients who are on ERT, are ERT pseudo-naïve (defined as having been off ERT for six or more months), or who are ERT-naïve. The FDA has granted Orphan Drug, Fast Track and RMAT designations to isaralgagene civaparvovec, which has also received Orphan Medicinal Product designation and PRIME eligibility from the EMA and Innovative Licensing and Access Pathway from U.K. Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. \n\n**About Fabry Disease**\n\nFabry disease is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the galactosidase alpha gene (GLA), which leads to deficient alpha-galactosidase A (α-Gal A) enzyme activity, which is necessary for metabolizing globotriaosylceramide (Gb3). The buildup of Gb3 in the cells can cause serious damage to vital organs, including the kidney, heart, nerves, eyes, gut and skin. Symptoms of Fabry disease can include decreased or absent sweat production, heat intolerance, angiokeratoma (skin blemishes), vision problems, kidney disease, heart failure, gastrointestinal disturbance, mood disorders, neuropathic pain and tingling in the extremities. \n\n**About Sangamo Therapeutics**\n\nSangamo Therapeutics is a genomic medicine company dedicated to translating ground-breaking science into medicines that transform the lives of patients and families afflicted with serious neurological diseases who do not have adequate or any treatment options. Sangamo believes that its zinc finger epigenetic regulators are ideally suited to potentially address devastating neurological disorders and that its capsid discovery platform can expand delivery beyond currently available intrathecal delivery capsids, including in the central nervous system. Sangamo’s pipeline also includes multiple partnered programs and programs with opportunities for partnership and investment.
