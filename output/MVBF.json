Announces Third Quarter 2024 Results\n\nOctober 30, 2024\n\nFAIRMONT, W.Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--  MVB Financial Corp. (NASDAQ: MVBF) (“MVB Financial,” “MVB” or the “Company”), the holding company for MVB Bank, Inc. (“MVB Bank”), today announced financial results for the third quarter of 2024, with reported net income of $2.1 million, or $0.16 basic and diluted earnings per share. \n\n** Third Quarter 2024 Highlights **\n\n**_Previously disclosed digital asset program exit reduced EPS by $0.29 in third quarter and $0.37 year-to-date._ **\n\n**_Noninterest bearing deposits represent 33.0% of total deposits._ **\n\n**_On balance sheet payments-related deposits increased by 60.8% due to growth in existing relationships._ **\n\n**_Tangible book value per share of $23.20, up 2.2% from the prior quarter._ **\n\n**_Capital strength further enhanced._ **\n\n**From Larry F. Mazza, Chief Executive Officer, MVB Financial:**\n\n“MVB continues to be proactive, and we have adapted our growth strategy related to changing market conditions. To this end, we have simplified our number of strategic initiatives to five as we move into fourth quarter. This laser focus by Team MVB will enhance our ability to effectively execute on our revised strategy. \n\n“One example of this laser focus is our payments strategy. Growth in existing account relationships, along with new leadership and initiatives, drove a 60.8% quarter over quarter increase in payments-related deposit balances. Excluding the impact of the digital asset program wind-down and termination costs related to the decision to call two brokered certificates of deposit, net interest income and net interest margin are approaching a positive inflection point. Finally, while loan balances declined partly due to elevated payoff activity, our loan pipeline has improved from earlier this year. \n\n“As previously disclosed, we began winding down MVB’s digital asset program account relationships during the second quarter due to changing market conditions and profitability challenges. While this process is now mostly complete, our third-quarter results reflected both the full quarter impact of this decision and lingering costs associated with the wind-down, without any associated revenue benefit. Alongside a higher cost base, these factors negatively affected earnings in the third quarter, overshadowing some of the positive trends we’ve seen. \n\n“Through it all, MVB’s foundational strength remains intact, evidenced by stable asset quality, an enhanced capital base and growth in tangible book value per share. While our strategic shift has weighed on earnings in the short-term, we are increasingly well-positioned for future growth and improved profitability.” \n\n**THIRD QUARTER 2024 HIGHLIGHTS**\n\n  * **Growth in payments and gaming deposits drive increased total deposits.**\n    * Total deposits increased 4.1%, or $118.8 million, to $3.00 billion compared to the prior quarter-end. Deposit growth was led by payments-related deposits, which increased by 60.8%, primarily due to the expansion of existing relationships. Deposit growth also reflected increased gaming deposits, partially offset by the movement of $70.2 million of banking-as-a-service deposits off balance sheet. \n    * Noninterest bearing (“NIB”) deposits increased 0.5%, or $5.3 million, to $989.1 million. NIB deposits represent 33.0% of total deposits as of September 30, 2024. \n    * The loan-to-deposit ratio was 72.3% as of September 30, 2024, compared to 76.5% as of June 30, 2024, and 74.7% as of September 30, 2023. \n  * **Net interest income and net interest margin lower on digital asset program wind-down and certificate of deposit termination costs.**\n    * Net interest income on a fully tax-equivalent basis, a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, declined 3.4%, or $0.9 million, to $26.8 million relative to the prior quarter, reflecting net interest margin contraction and lower earning assets balances. \n    * Net interest margin on a fully tax-equivalent basis, a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, was 3.61%, down 14 basis points from the prior quarter. Approximately 11 basis points of the decline in net interest margin is attributable to the wind down of the digital asset program. Also, approximately five basis points of net interest margin compression reflected termination costs of $0.3 million related to the Company’s decision to call two brokered certificates of deposit (“CDs”) with a value of $49.5 million during the third quarter. Total cost of funds was 2.77%, up 23 basis points compared to the prior quarter, primarily reflecting the full quarter impact of the shift in deposit mix from the wind-down of the digital asset program and the brokered CD termination costs. \n    * Average earning assets balance declined 0.9%, or $26.1 million, from the prior quarter to $2.95 billion, reflecting lower average loan balances, partially offset by higher interest-bearing balances with banks. Average total loan balances declined 2.4%, or $53.3 million, from the prior quarter to $2.18 billion, reflecting elevated loan payoff activity and muted market demand. \n  * **Noninterest income lower on digital asset program exit, masking progress on Fintech fee income and continued mortgage rebound.**\n    * Total noninterest income declined 6.8%, or $0.5 million, relative to the prior quarter, to $6.7 million. The decline is attributable to lower other operating income, primarily a $0.8 million decrease in wire transfer fees reflecting the full quarter impact of the digital asset program wind-down. Excluding other operating income, noninterest income increased 12.8%, reflecting a continued rebound in equity method investment income from our mortgage segment, as well as higher payment card and service charge income, consulting and compliance income and holding gains on equity securities. \n    * Relative to the prior year period, total noninterest income increased by 15.0%, or $0.9 million, inclusive of the impact of the digital asset program wind-down, to $6.7 million, primarily reflecting higher payment card and service income, which increased by 35.1% year-over-year. \n  * **Foundational strength intact, led by enhanced capital position, growth in tangible book value per share and stable asset quality.**\n    * The Community Bank Leverage Ratio, Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio and MVB Bank’s Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio were 10.9%, 14.9% and 15.7%, respectively, compared to 10.7%, 14.6% and 15.4%, respectively, at the prior quarter end. \n    * The tangible common equity ratio, a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, was 8.8% as of September 30, 2024, down from 8.9% as of June 30, 2024 and up from 7.8% as of September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, accumulated other comprehensive loss declined $5.9 million, or 20.9%, and $17.8 million, or 44.2%, to $22.5 million as compared to $28.4 million at June 30, 2024 and $40.3 million at September 30, 2023, respectively. Adjusted for accumulated other comprehensive loss, the tangible common equity ratio was 9.4% as of September 30, 2024. \n    * Book value per share and tangible book value per share, a non-U.S. GAAP measure, were $23.44 and $23.20, respectively, which represent increases of 2.2% and 2.2% relative to the prior quarter-end and 9.9% and 10.1% from the year-ago period. \n    * Nonperforming loans increased $5.5 million, or 23.6%, to $28.6 million, or 1.3% of total loans, from $23.1 million, or 1.0% of total loans, at the prior quarter end. Approximately 47.2% of the balance of nonperforming loans is a single commercial multifamily loan, which had a balance of $13.5 million as of September 30, 2024, down $1.1 million from the prior quarter. The loan is current as of September 30, 2024 and the Company believes the loan is properly collateralized with a loan to value of less than 70%. Criticized loans as a percentage of total loans were 5.7%, consistent with the prior quarter end. \n    * Net charge-offs were $0.7 million, or 0.1% of loans, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $0.9 million, or 0.2% of loans, for the prior quarter. \n    * Provision for credit losses totaled $1.0 million, compared to $0.3 million for the prior quarter and included a credit impairment of an available-for-sale debt security of $0.5 million during the third quarter. \n    * Allowance for credit losses was 0.99% of total loans, as compared to 1.00% at the prior quarter end. \n\n\n\n**INCOME STATEMENT**\n\nNet interest income on a tax-equivalent basis totaled $26.8 million for the third quarter of 2024, a decline of $0.9 million, or 3.4%, from the second quarter of 2024 and $3.3 million, or 11.0%, from the third quarter of 2023. The decline from both prior periods reflects net interest margin contraction and lower average earning asset balances. \n\nInterest income increased $0.5 million, or 1.1%, from the second quarter of 2024 and declined $1.7 million, or 3.5%, from the third quarter of 2023. The increase in interest income relative to the prior quarter reflects an increase in cash balances due to growth of payment deposits and seasonal considerations. The decline in interest income relative to the year-ago period reflects a decline in cash balances, driven by the exit of digital asset program accounts, and a decline in loan balances, partially offset by a higher tax-equivalent yield on loans and cash balances. \n\nInterest expense increased $1.5 million, or 8.0%, from the second quarter of 2024 and $1.6 million, or 8.6%, from the third quarter of 2024. The cost of funds increased to 2.77% for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to 2.54% for the second quarter of 2024 and 2.43% for the third quarter of 2023. The higher cost of funds compared to the prior quarter was primarily attributable to the full quarter impact of the exit of the digital asset program account relationships and $0.3 million of termination costs related to the Company’s decision to call two brokered CDs during the third quarter. The process of winding down the digital asset program account relationships was initiated during the second quarter of 2024, and the deposits were replaced with higher cost funding throughout the third quarter of 2024. Relative to the year-ago period, the increase reflects the impact of higher interest rates on our deposits, a shift in the mix of average deposits, the exit of the digital asset program account relationships and the termination costs associated with the two brokered CDs that were called. \n\nOn a tax-equivalent basis, net interest margin for the third quarter of 2024 was 3.61%, a decline of 14 basis points versus the second quarter of 2024 and 29 basis points versus the third quarter of 2023. See the table below for a reconciliation between net interest margin and net interest margin on a fully tax-equivalent basis, a non-U.S. GAAP measure. \n\nNoninterest income totaled $6.7 million for the third quarter of 2024, a decline of $0.5 million from the second quarter of 2024 and an increase of $0.9 million from the third quarter of 2023. The decline compared to the prior quarter is primarily driven by a decline of $1.2 million in other operating income, partially offset by increases of $0.5 million in holding gains on equity securities and $0.3 million in equity method investments income from our mortgage segment. The $0.9 million increase in noninterest income from the third quarter of 2023 was primarily driven by increases of $1.5 million in equity method investments income from our mortgage segment and $1.0 million in payment card and service charge income, partially offset by a decline of $1.6 million in other operating income. \n\nNoninterest expense totaled $29.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $0.6 million from the second quarter of 2024 and a decline of $1.2 million from the third quarter of 2023. The increase from the second quarter of 2024 primarily reflects increases of $0.8 million in salaries and employee benefits and $0.3 million in travel, entertainment, dues and subscriptions, partially offset by a $0.5 million decline in professional fees. The decline from the third quarter of 2023 primarily reflects declines of $1.0 million in professional fees and $0.9 million in other operating expense, partially offset by an increase of $0.7 million in salaries and employee benefit expense. \n\n**BALANCE SHEET**\n\nLoans totaled $2.17 billion as of September 30, 2024, a decline of $35.5 million, or 1.6%, from June 30, 2024, and $99.2 million, or 4.4%, from September 30, 2023. The decline in loan balances relative to the prior quarters primarily reflects slower loan growth based on overall market conditions and the impact of loan amortization and payoffs. \n\nDeposits totaled $3.00 billion as of September 30, 2024, an increase of $118.8 million, or 4.1%, from June 30, 2024, and a decline of $37.2 million, or 1.2%, from September 30, 2023. The increase in deposits relative to the prior quarter reflects an increase in payment deposits of $190.9 million and higher CD balances. The increase in CD balances of $77.0 million, or 10.0%, to $846.8 million was primarily driven by a $25.1 million, or 5.0%, increase in brokered CDs and a $52.2 million, or 19.9%, increase in core CDs. Relative to the year-ago period, the decline in total deposits reflects a decline in NIB deposits and increased utilization of off-balance sheet deposit networks to generate fee income, enhance capital efficiency and manage liquidity and concentration risk. \n\nNIB deposits totaled $989.1 million as of September 30, 2024, an increase of $5.3 million, or 0.5%, from June 30, 2024 and a decline of $104.8 million, or 9.6%, from September 30, 2023. Relative to the prior year period, the decline in NIB deposits reflected the exit of digital asset program accounts. Digital asset program account balances declined $6.7 million and $180.1 million to $21.4 million as compared to June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. NIB deposits represented 33.0% of total deposits as of September 30, 2024, compared to 34.1% of total deposits at the prior quarter-end and 36.0% for the year-ago period. \n\nOff-balance sheet deposits totaled $1.44 billion as of September 30, 2024, an increase of $85.2 million, or 6.3%, compared to $1.36 billion at June 30, 2024, and $329.0 million, or 30%, from $1.11 billion at September 30, 2023. Management proactively moved $70.2 million of banking-as-a-service deposits off balance sheet due to uncertainty of the existing regulatory framework for brokered deposits and potential reclassification of certain banking-as-a-service deposits as brokered deposits. Off-balance sheet deposit networks are utilized to generate fee income, enhance capital efficiency and manage liquidity and concentration risk. \n\n**CAPITAL**\n\nThe Community Bank Leverage Ratio was 10.9% as of September 30, 2024, compared to 10.7% as of June 30, 2024, and 10.4% as of September 30, 2023. MVB’s Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio was 14.9% as of September 30, 2024, compared to 14.6% as of June 30, 2024 and 14.0% as of September 30, 2023. The Bank’s Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio was 15.7% as of September 30, 2024, compared to 15.4% as of June 30, 2024 and 14.8% as of September 30, 2023. \n\nThe tangible common equity ratio, a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, was 8.8% as of September 30, 2024, consistent with June 30, 2024, and up from 7.8% as of September 30, 2023. See the reconciliation of the tangible common equity ratio to its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure later in this release. \n\nThe Company issued a quarterly cash dividend of $0.17 per share for the third quarter of 2024, consistent with the second quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023. \n\n**ASSET QUALITY**\n\nNonperforming loans totaled $28.6 million, or 1.3% of total loans, as of September 30, 2024, as compared to $23.1 million, or 1.0% of total loans, as of June 30, 2024, and $10.6 million, or 0.5% of total loans, as of September 30, 2023. Criticized loans as a percentage of total loans were 5.7% as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, compared to 6.1% as of September 30, 2023. \n\nNet charge-offs were $0.7 million, or 0.1% of average total loans, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $0.9 million, or 0.2% of average total loans, for the second quarter of 2024 and $5.9 million, or 1.0% of average total loans, for the third quarter of 2023. \n\nThe provision for credit losses totaled $1.0 million, compared to $0.3 million for the prior quarter ended June 30, 2024, and a release of allowance of $0.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The allowance for credit losses for loans was 0.99% of total loans at September 30, 2024, compared to 1.00% at June 30, 2024, and 1.1% at September 30, 2023. \n\n**About MVB Financial Corp.**\n\nMVB Financial, the holding company of MVB Bank, is publicly traded on The Nasdaq Capital Market® (“Nasdaq”) under the ticker “MVBF.” \n\nMVB Financial is a financial holding company headquartered in Fairmont, West Virginia.

These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations about the future and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, information concerning possible or assumed future results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as “may,” “could,” “should,” “would,” “will,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “continues” or the negative of those terms or similar expressions.

Accordingly, the consolidated financial information in this announcement is subject to change. \n\nQuestions or comments concerning this earnings release should be directed to: \n\n**Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThis document contains supplemental financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). Management uses these non-U.S. GAAP measures in its analysis of the Company’s performance. These measures should not be considered a substitute for U.S. GAAP basis measures nor should they be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Management believes the presentation of non-U.S. GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of specified items provide useful supplemental information that is essential to a proper understanding of the Company’s financial condition and results. Non-U.S. GAAP measures are not formally defined under U.S. GAAP, and other entities may use calculation methods that differ from those used by us. As a complement to U.S. GAAP financial measures, our management believes these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures assist investors in comparing the financial condition and results of operations of financial institutions due to the industry prevalence of such non-U.S. GAAP measures. See the tables below for a reconciliation of these non-U.S. GAAP measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. \n\n**MVB Financial Corp.** ** Financial Highlights **

Rodriguez has a strong reputation in the financial services risk management industry as a leader who operates at the intersection of innovation and prudent risk management. \n\n“We are pleased to welcome Joe Rodriguez to the MVB family as a trusted partner on the financial frontier, committed to the success of our Team, clients, communities and shareholders,” said Larry F. Mazza, CEO, MVB Financial and MVB Bank. \n\n“Known for his deep-seated expertise in banking and financial services regulatory frameworks, Joe has built a reputation for building risk management teams that are not just safeguards, but drivers of business value and sustainable transformation.” \n\nAt MVB, Rodriguez leads the Office of Risk Management, including the risk, compliance and legal functions of MVB Bank. Working directly with the MVB Board of Directors Risk and Compliance Committee, he will continue to build MVB’s risk management capabilities. \n\nRodriguez comes to MVB from Capital One where he most recently served as the Executive Risk Officer for Financial Services, reporting to the Financial Services Business Chief Risk Officer. He managed a team of risk professionals who are responsible for enterprise risk and change management activities, including leading the regulatory change governance process for new/revised laws and regulations; conducting ongoing risk assessments, including RCSA; overseeing development and maintenance of compliance controls; leading regulator exam and internal audit engagements; managing risk and compliance reporting; and overseeing remediation of exam, audit and risk assessment findings. He also served as the Lead Compliance Officer for Financial Services, and Acting Head of Enterprise Privacy Compliance at Capital One. \n\nPrior to his current role at Capital One, Rodriguez served as Lead Counsel – Financial Services Regulatory, AML and Sanctions at Walmart. There, he led enhancements to the company’s AML Compliance Program, advised on regulatory matters involving partner financial institutions and advised on agreements to expand Walmart’s money transmission and payments partnerships. Prior to his in-house experience, he served as outside counsel to leading banks and fintech companies and was a partner at the law firm Davis Wright Tremaine LLP, a firm known for its deep financial services practice. \n\nMuch of Rodriguez’s early career was spent in government service, where he was an early employee at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). He served as Regional Counsel for the Bureau’s Southeast Region, advising on examination reports, MRAs and MOUs and evaluating institutional compliance. He was also a Trial Attorney at the U.S. Department of Justice, representing the United States in federal district court and bankruptcy court regarding complex tax and financial fraud matters.

Operations and Basis of Presentation\nBusiness and Organization\nMVB Financial Corp. is a financial holding company organized in 2003 as a West Virginia corporation that operates principally through its wholly-owned\nsubsidiary, MVB Bank, Inc. (the “Bank”). The Bank’s consolidated subsidiaries include MVB Edge Ventures, Inc. (“Edge Ventures”), Paladin Fraud, LLC\n(“Paladin Fraud”) and MVB Insurance, LLC (“MVB Insurance”). The Bank owns a controlling interest in Trabian Technology, Inc. (“Trabian”). Edge Ventures\nwholly-owns Victor Technologies, Inc. (“Victor”) and MVB Technology, LLC (\"MVB Technology\"). The Bank also owns an equity method investment in\nIntercoastal Mortgage Company, LLC (“ICM”) and MVB Financial Corp. owns equity method investments in Warp Speed Holdings, LLC (“Warp Speed”) and\nAyers Socure II, LLC (“Ayers Socure II”). MVB Financial Corp.'s consolidated subsidiaries also includes SPE PR, LLC.\nThrough our professional services entities, which include Paladin Fraud and Trabian, we provide consulting solutions to assist clients in building digital\nproducts and meeting their fraud defense needs.\nIn February 2023, we completed the sale of the Bank’s wholly-owned subsidiary, ProCo Global, Inc. (“Chartwell,” which does business under the registered\ntrade name Chartwell Compliance). In May 2023, we entered into an agreement with Flexia Payments, LLC (\"Flexia\"), to facilitate the divestiture of our\ninterests in the ongoing business of Flexia. Refer to Note 15 – Acquisition & Divestiture Activity.\nWe conduct a wide range of business activities through the Bank, primarily commercial and retail (“CoRe”) banking services, as well as Fintech banking.\nCoRe Banking\nWe offer our customers a full range of products and services including:\nl Various demand deposit accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts and certificates of deposit;\nl Commercial, consumer and real estate mortgage loans and lines of credit;\nl Debit cards;\nl Cashier’s checks; and\nl Safe deposit rental facilities.\nFintech Banking\nWe provide innovative strategies to independent banking and corporate clients throughout the United States. Our dedicated Fintech team specializes in\nproviding banking services to corporate Fintech clients, primarily focusing on operational risk management and compliance. Managing banking relationships\nwith clients in the gaming, payments and banking-as-a-service industries is complex, from an operational and regulatory perspective. Due to this complexity, a\nlimited number of banking institutions serve these industries, which can result in a lack of quality focus on these entities, providing us with an expanded pool\nof potential customers. When serviced safely and efficiently, we believe these industries provide a source of stable, lower-cost deposits and noninterest, fee-\nbased income. We thoroughly analyze each industry in which our customers operate, as well as any new products or services provided, from an operational and\nregulatory perspective.\nPrinciples of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation\nThe financial statements are consolidated to include the accounts of MVB and its subsidiaries, including the Bank and the Bank’s subsidiaries. In our opinion,\nthe accompanying consolidated financial statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of our financial statements for\ninterim periods in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and with instructions for Form 10-\nQ and Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the SEC. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidated financial\nstatements. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have\nbeen omitted. The consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 has been derived from audited financial statements included in our 2023 Form 10-K.\nThe information presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in\n13\nconjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the 2023 Form 10-K. Operating results for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024.\nWholly-owned investments or investments in which we have a controlling financial interest, whether majority owned or in certain circumstances a minority\ninterest, are required to be consolidated into our financial statements. We evaluate investments in entities on an ongoing basis to determine the need to\nconsolidate.\nThe Bank owns an 80.8% interest in Trabian, which ownership interest represents a controlling interest. Accordingly, we are required to consolidate 100% of\nTrabian within our consolidated financial statements. The remaining interests in Trabian are accounted for separately as noncontrolling interests within our\nconsolidated financial statements. Noncontrolling interest represents the portion of ownership and profit or loss that is attributable to the minority owners of\nthis entity.\nUnconsolidated investments where we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the respective investee are\naccounted for using the equity method of accounting. Those investments that are not consolidated or accounted for using the equity method of accounting are\naccounted for under cost or fair value accounting. For investments accounted for under the equity method, we record our investment in non-consolidated\naffiliates and the portion of income or loss in equity in earnings of non-consolidated affiliates. We periodically evaluate these investments for impairment. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, we held three equity method investments. See Note 5 – Equity Method Investments for further information.\nPreparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts\nreported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates are based upon the best available information and actual results\ncould differ from those estimates. An estimate that is particularly significant to the consolidated financial statements relates to the determination of the\nallowance for credit losses (“ACL”).\nIn certain instances, amounts reported in prior period consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes may be reclassified to conform to the current\npresentation. Specifically, in Note 3 – Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses, certain amounts within the table presenting the amortized cost of loans\nsummarized by vintage year as of December 31, 2023 were reclassified. At September 30, 2024, we elected to disaggregate the revolving loans amortized costs\nbasis balances and present the balances by year of origination, rather than disclosing in a single column as they were presented as of December 31, 2023. The\nimpact of this reclassification was only to Note 3 – Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses and did not affect the financial statements. In addition, within the\nconsolidated statement of cash flows, certain amounts were reclassified from operating activities to investing activities related to our equity method\ninvestments for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nWe have evaluated subsequent events for potential recognition and/or disclosure through the date these consolidated financial statements were issued.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic\n848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. The amendments provide optional expedients and exceptions for certain\ncontracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of rate reform. In\nDecember 2022, the FASB issued ASC 2022-06, Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848, which extends the sunset date of Topic 848 from December 31,\n2022, to December 31, 2024. The guidance permits entities to not apply modification accounting or remeasure lease payments in lease contracts if the changes\nto the contract are related to the discontinuation of the reference rate. If certain criteria are met, the amendments also allow exceptions to the de-designation\ncriteria of the hedging relationship and the assessment of hedge effectiveness during the transition period. In January 2021, ASU 2021-01 was issued by the\nFASB and clarified that certain exceptions in reference rate reform apply to derivatives that are affected by the discounting transition. As of September 30,\n2024, all loans and other relevant financial instruments that referenced LIBOR have been transitioned to the secured overnight financing rate (\"SOFR\").\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segments Disclosures. The amendments are\nintended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. In addition, the\namendments clarify circumstances in which an entity can disclose multiple segment measures of profit or loss and provide new segment disclosure\nrequirements for entities with a single reportable segment. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim\nperiods within fiscal years\n14\nbeginning after December 15, 2024. We are currently evaluating the impact these changes may have on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The amendments require\ndisaggregated information about a reporting entity's effect tax rate reconciliation, as well as information on income taxes paid. Public business entities will be\nrequired to disclose additional information in specified categories with respect to the reconciliation of the effective tax rate to the statutory rate for federal, state\nand foreign income taxes. The amendments also require greater detail about individual reconciling items in the rate reconciliation to the extent that the impact\nof those items exceeds a specified threshold. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. We are currently evaluating the\nimpact these changes may have on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-01, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope Application of Profits Interest and Similar Awards.\nThe amendments clarify how an entity determines whether a profits interest or similar award is (i) within the scope of Compensation - Stock Compensation\n(Topic 718) or (ii) not a share-based payment arrangements and therefore within the scope of other guidance. The amendments are effective for fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2024. We do not currently expect these amendments to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued 2024-03, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40).\nThe amendments improve the disclosures about a public business entity’s expenses and address requests from investors for more detailed information about the\ntypes of expenses (including purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, amortization, and depletion) in commonly presented expense\ncaptions (such as cost of sales and research and development). The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026,\nand interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. We are currently evaluating the impact these changes may have on our consolidated financial\nstatements.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn January 2023, we adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, and\nsubsequent amendments to the initial guidance, which collectively comprise Accounting Standards Codification Topic 326 Financial Instruments - Credit\nLosses (\"ASC 326\"). ASC 326 replaced the incurred loss impairment methodology in current U.S. GAAP with an expected credit loss methodology and\nrequired consideration of a broader range of information to determine credit loss estimates. Financial assets measured at amortized cost are presented at the net\namount expected to be collected by using an ACL. Purchased credit deteriorated (“PCD”) loans received an allowance account at the acquisition date that\nrepresents a component of the purchase price allocation. Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities are recorded through an ACL, with such\nallowance limited to the amount by which fair value is below amortized cost. We adopted ASC 326 using the modified retrospective method for loans, leases\nand off-balance sheet credit exposures. Adoption of this guidance resulted in a $10.0 million increase in the ACL, comprised of increases in the ACL for loans\nof $8.9 million and the ACL for unfunded commitments of $1.1 million, with $1.2 million of the increase reclassified from the amortized cost basis of PCD\nfinancial assets. This increase was offset by $2.1 million related to tax effect, resulting in a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings of $6.6 million.

We evaluate available-for-sale debt securities to\ndetermine whether the unrealized loss is due to credit-related factors or non-credit-related factors. When determining the ACL on securities, we consider such\nfactors as adverse conditions specifically related to a certain security or to specific conditions in an industry or geographic area, our ability to hold the security\nfor a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery in value, whether or not the security has been downgraded by a rating agency and whether or\nnot the financial condition of the security issuer has severely deteriorated.\n16\nThe following table summarizes the activity in the ACL related to available-for-sale debt securities during the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2024.

Our loan\nportfolio segmentation is based primarily on call report codes, which are levels at which we develop and document our systematic methodology to determine\nthe ACL attributable to each respective portfolio segment. The ACL portfolio segments are aggregated into broader segments in order to present informative yet\nconcise disclosures within this document, as follows:\nCommercial business loans – Commercial business loans are made to provide funds for equipment and general corporate needs, as well as to finance owner-\noccupied real estate, and to finance future cash flows of Federal government lease contracts. Repayment of these loans primarily uses the funds obtained from\nthe operation of the borrower’s business. Commercial business loans also include lines of credit that are utilized to finance a borrower’s short-term credit needs\nand/or to finance a percentage of eligible receivables and inventory. This segment includes both internally originated and purchased participation loans. Credit\nrisk arises from the successful operation of the business, which may be affected by competition, rising interest rates, regulatory changes and adverse conditions\nin the local and regional economy. Commercial business loans include the following ACL segments: commercial and industrial (including both healthcare and\nSBA subsegments), commercial real estate owner-occupied (including both healthcare and SBA subsegments), government leases, and other loans.\nCommercial real estate loans – Commercial real estate loans consist of non-owner occupied properties, such as investment properties for retail, office and\nmultifamily with a history of occupancy and cash flow. This segment includes both internally originated and purchased participation loans. These loans carry\nthe risk of adverse changes in the local economy and a tenant’s deteriorating credit strength, lease expirations in soft markets and sustained vacancies, which\ncan adversely impact cash flow. Commercial real estate loans include the following ACL segments: commercial real estate non-owner occupied (including both\nhealthcare and SBA subsegments).\nCommercial acquisition, development and construction loans – Commercial acquisition, development and construction loans are intended to finance the\nconstruction of commercial and residential properties, and also includes loans for the acquisition and development of land. Construction loans represent a\nhigher degree of risk than permanent real estate loans and may be affected by a variety of factors such as the borrower’s ability to control costs and adhere to\ntime schedules and the risk that the market may not absorb constructed units within the anticipated time frame or at the anticipated price. The loan commitment\non these loans often includes an interest reserve that allows the lender to periodically advance loan funds to pay interest charges on the outstanding balance of\nthe loan. Commercial acquisition, development and construction loans include the following ACL segments: other construction (including an SBA\nsubsegment).\nResidential real estate – This residential real estate segment contains permanent and construction mortgage loans principally to consumers, but also includes\nloans to residential real estate developers, secured by residential real estate, which we previously presented under commercial acquisitions, development and\nconstruction loans under the incurred loss model. Residential real estate loans to consumers are evaluated for the adequacy of repayment sources at the time of\napproval, based upon measures including credit scores, debt-to-income ratios and collateral values. Credit risk arises from the continuing financial stability of\nthe borrower and, where applicable, the builder, which can be adversely impacted by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy, among other factors.\nResidential real estate secured loans to developers represent a higher degree of risk than permanent real estate loans and may be affected by a variety of factors\nsuch as the borrower’s ability to control costs and adhere to time schedules and the risk that the market may not absorb constructed units within the anticipated\ntime frame or at the anticipated price. Also\n18\nimpacting credit risk would be a shortfall in the value of the residential real estate in relation to the outstanding loan balance in the event of a default or\nsubsequent liquidation of the real estate collateral. Residential real estate loans include the following ACL segments: residential and residential construction\n(including SBA subsegment).\nHome equity lines of credit – This segment includes subsegments for senior lien and subordinate lien lines of credit. Credit risk is similar to residential real\nestate loans described above as it is subject to the borrower’s continuing financial stability and the value of the collateral securing the loan.\nConsumer loans – This segment of loans includes primarily installment loans and personal lines of credit. Consumer loans include installment loans used by\nclients to purchase automobiles, boats and recreational vehicles. Credit risk is similar to residential real estate loans described above as it is subject to the\nborrower’s continuing financial stability and the value of the collateral securing the loan. This segment primarily includes loans purchased from a third-party\noriginator that originates loans in order to finance the purchase of personal automotive vehicles. Credit risk is unique as this segment includes only those loans\nprovided to consumers who cannot typically obtain financing through traditional lenders. As such, these loans are subject to a higher risk of default than the\ntypical consumer loan. Consumer loans include the following ACL segments: subprime consumer automotive and consumer.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Bank’s other real estate owned balance totaled $0.8 million, all of which was related to a 2020 acquisition of another bank. The\nother real estate owned balance consisted of two unrelated commercial properties. As of September 30, 2024, there were eight residential mortgages in the\nprocess of foreclosure with a loan balance totaling $3.4 million.\nBank management uses a nine-point internal risk rating system to monitor the credit quality of the overall loan portfolio. The first five categories are considered\nnot criticized and are aggregated as “Pass” rated. The criticized rating categories utilized by management generally follow bank regulatory definitions.\nLoans categorized as “Pass” rated have adequate sources of repayment, with little identifiable risk of collection and general conformity to the Bank's policy\nrequirements, product guidelines and underwriting standards. Any exceptions that are identified during the underwriting and approval process have been\nadequately mitigated by other factors.\nLoans categorized as “Special Mention” rated have potential weaknesses that deserve management’s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential\nweaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the institution’s credit position at some future date. Special mention assets\nare not adversely classified and do not expose the institution to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification.\nLoans categorized as “Substandard” rated are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral\npledged, if any. Loans so classified must have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt and are characterized by the\ndistinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.\nLoans categorized as “Doubtful” rated have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as Substandard with the added characteristic that the weakness\nmakes collections or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently known facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable. However, these loans\nare not yet rated as loss because certain events may occur which would salvage the debt.\nAny portion of a loan that has been or is expected to be charged off is placed in the “Loss” category.\nTo help ensure that risk ratings are accurate and reflect the present and future capacity of borrowers to repay a loan as agreed, the Bank has a structured loan\nrating process with several layers of internal and external oversight. Generally, consumer and residential mortgage loans are included in the Pass categories,\nunless a specific action, such as past due status, bankruptcy, repossession or death, occurs to raise awareness of a possible credit event. The Bank’s Chief Credit\nOfficer is responsible for the timely and accurate risk rating of the loans in the portfolio at origination and on an ongoing basis. The Bank's Credit Department\nensures that a review of all commercial relationships of $1.0 million or more is performed annually.\nReview of the appropriate risk grade is included in both the internal and external loan review process and on an ongoing basis. The Bank has an experienced\ncredit department that continually reviews and assesses loans within the portfolio. The Bank engages an external consultant to conduct independent loan\nreviews on at least an annual basis. Generally, the external consultant reviews commercial relationships with the intent of reviewing 35% to 40% of the Bank's\ncommercial outstanding loan balances on an annual basis. The Bank's credit department compiles detailed reviews, including plans for resolution, on loans\nclassified as Substandard on a quarterly basis.\n19\nThe following table presents the amortized cost

$ 2,579 $ —\nThe increase in acquisition, development and construction loans in non-accrual status from December 31, 2023 was primarily the result of the addition of a\nsingle commercial multifamily loan that was put into non-accrual status during the three months ended June 30, 2024. The loan had a balance of $13.5 million\nas of September 30, 2024.\nThe ACL is a valuation account that is deducted from the loans' amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loans. Loans are\ncharged off against the ACL when management believes the loan balance is uncollectible. Accrued interest receivable is excluded from the estimate of credit\nlosses. Management determines the ACL balance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current\nconditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit behaviors along with model judgments provide the basis for the estimation of expected\ncredit losses. Adjustments to modeled loss estimates may be made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in\nunderwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency level or term, as well as for changes in environmental conditions, such as changes in economic conditions,\nproperty values or other relevant factors.\nThe Bank’s methodology for determining the ACL is based on the requirements of ASC 326. The ACL is calculated on a collective basis when similar risk\ncharacteristics exist. The ACL for the majority of loans and leases was calculated using a discounted cash flow methodology applied at a loan level with a one-\nyear reasonable and supportable forecast period and a one-year straight-line reversion period with loss rates, prepayment assumptions and curtailment\nassumptions driven by each loan’s collateral type. Expected credit loss rates were estimated using a regression model based on historical data from peer banks\nwhich incorporates a third-party vendor’s economic forecast to predict the change in credit losses. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank\n24\nexpects the markets in which it operates will experience economic improvements over the next one to two years. The ACL for only one portfolio segment\nconsisting entirely of automotive loans to consumers was calculated under the remaining life methodology using straight-line amortization over the remaining\nlife of the portfolio.\nLoans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. Loans evaluated individually are not also included in the collective evaluation.\nWhen Bank management determines that foreclosure is probable or when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty at the reporting date and repayment\nis expected to be substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral, expected credit losses are based on the fair value of the collateral at the reporting\ndate, adjusted for selling costs as appropriate.\nThe following table presents the amortized cost basis of collateral-dependent loans by class of loans as of the periods shown:\nVehicles and Assignment of Accounts Allowance for\n(Dollars in thousands) Real Estate Equipment Cash Flow Receivable Other Totals Credit Losses\nSeptember 30, 2024\nCommercial\nBusiness $ 3,508 $ 2,016 $ — $ 213 $ 1,524 $ 7,261 $ 3,382\nReal estate — — — — — — —\nAcquisition, development and\nconstruction 15,635 — — — — 15,635 —\nTotal commercial $ 19,143 $ 2,016 $ — $ 213 $ 1,524 $ 22,896 $ 3,382\nResidential 1,889 — — — — 1,889 5\nHome equity lines of credit — — — — — — —\nConsumer — 187 — — — 187 47\nTotal $ 21,032 $ 2,203 $ — $ 213 $ 1,524 $ 24,972 $ 3,434\nCollateral value $ 39,883 $ 2,994 $ — $ 84 $ — $ 42,961\nDecember 31, 2023\nCommercial\nBusiness $ 424 $ 2,277 $ — $ 452 $ 1,037 $ 4,190 $ 1,583\nReal estate — — — — — — —\nAcquisition, development and\nconstruction — — — — — — —\nTotal commercial $ 424 $ 2,277 $ — $ 452 $ 1,037 $ 4,190 $ 1,583\nResidential — — — — — — —\nHome equity lines of credit — — — — — — —\nConsumer — 344 — — — 344 60\nTotal $ 424 $ 2,621 $ — $ 452 $ 1,037 $ 4,534 $ 1,643\nCollateral value $ 301 $ 2,040 $ — $ 906 $ 320 $ 3,567\nThe Bank evaluates certain loans in homogeneous pools, rather than on an individual basis, when those loans are below specific thresholds based on\noutstanding principal balance. More specifically, residential mortgage loans, home equity lines of credit and consumer loans are evaluated collectively for\nexpected credit losses by applying allocation rates derived from the Bank’s historical losses specific to these loans. The reserve was immaterial at September\n30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nManagement has identified a number of additional qualitative factors that it uses to supplement the estimated losses derived from the loss rate methodologies\nemployed within the Current Expected Credit Losses model because these factors are likely to cause estimated credit losses associated with the existing loan\npools to differ from the loss rate methodologies. The additional factors that are evaluated quarterly and updated using information obtained from internal,\nregulatory and governmental sources are: lending policies and procedures, nature and volume of the portfolio, experience and ability of lending management\nand staff, volume and severity of problem credits, quality of the loan review system, changes in the value of underlying collateral, effect of concentrations of\ncredit from a loan type, industry and/or geographic standpoint, changes in economic and business conditions, consumer sentiment and other external factors.\n25\nTo estimate the liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures, Bank management analyzed the portfolios of unfunded commitments based on the same\nsegmentation used for the ACL calculation. The estimated funding rate for each segment was derived from a funding rate study created by a third-party vendor\nwhich analyzed funding of various loan types over time to develop industry benchmarks at the call report code level. Once the estimated future advances were\ncalculated, the allocation rate applicable to that portfolio segment was applied in the same manner as those used for the ACL calculation. The resulting\nestimated loss allocations were totaled to determine the liability for unfunded commitments related to these loans, which management considers necessary to\nanticipate potential losses on those commitments that have a reasonable probability of funding. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the liability\nfor unfunded commitments related to loans held-for-investment was $1.4 million and $1.0 million, respectively.\nBank management reviews the loan portfolio on a quarterly basis using a defined, consistently-applied process in order to make appropriate and timely\nadjustments to the ACL. When information confirms that all or part of specific loans are uncollectible, these amounts are promptly charged off against the\nACL.\nThe following table presents the balance and activity for the primary segments of the ACL as of the periods shown:\nCommercial\nAcquisition,\ndevelopment and Total\n(Dollars in thousands) Business Real Estate construction Commercial Residential Home Equity Consumer Total\nACL at June 30, 2024 $ 9,573 $ 2,472 $ 1,437 $ 13,482 $ 6,248 $ 85 $ 2,269 $ 22,084\nProvision (release of allowance) for\ncredit losses1 (743) 308 228 (207) 839 5 (511) 126\nCharge-offs (415) — — (415) — — (977) (1,392)\nRecoveries — 3 — 3 — 1 677 681\nACL at September 30, 2024 $ 8,415 $ 2,783 $ 1,665 $ 12,863 $ 7,087 $ 91 $ 1,458 $ 21,499\n(Dollars in thousands)\nALL at December 31, 2023 $ 7,931 $ 2,931 $ 1,674 $ 12,536 $ 6,412 $ 97 $ 3,079 $ 22,124\nProvision (release of allowance) for\ncredit losses1 2,734 (166) (9) 2,559 640 (9) (939) 2,251\nCharge-offs (2,292) — — (2,292) — — (2,788) (5,080)\nRecoveries 42 18 — 60 35 3 2,106 2,204\nACL at September 30, 2024 $ 8,415 $ 2,783 $ 1,665 $ 12,863 $ 7,087 $ 91 $ 1,458 $ 21,499\n1 Excludes the provision for unfunded commitments and the provision for credit losses related to available-for-sale debt securities.\n26\nCommercial\nAcquisition,\ndevelopment and Total\n(Dollars in thousands) Business Real Estate construction Commercial Residential Home Equity Consumer Total\nACL balance at June 30, 2023 $ 11,308 $ 3,051 $ 1,707 $ 16,066 $ 7,168 $ 114 $ 6,946 $ 30,294\nProvision (release of allowance) for\ncredit losses1 1,584 183 343 2,110 (242) (15) (2,012) (159)\nCharge-offs (4,028) — — (4,028) (359) — (3,677) (8,064)\nRecoveries 4 7 — 11 — 1 2,193 2,205\nALL balance at September 30, 2023 $ 8,868 $ 3,241 $ 2,050 $ 14,159 $ 6,567 $ 100 $ 3,450 $ 24,276\n(Dollars in thousands)\nALL, prior to adoption of ASC 326, at\nDecember 31, 2022 $ 8,771 $ 5,704 $ 1,064 $ 15,539 $ 2,880 $ 131 $ 5,287 $ 23,837\nImpact of adopting ASC 326 (126) (2,846) 288 (2,684) 3,889 (5) 6,482 7,682\nInitial allowance on loans purchased\nwith credit deterioration 710 — — 710 507 — — 1,217\nProvision (release of allowance) for\ncredit losses1 3,770 363 698 4,831 (328) (29) (4,165) 309\nCharge-offs (4,297) — — (4,297) (381) — (11,933) (16,611)\nRecoveries 40 20 — 60 — 3 7,779 7,842\nACL balance at September 30, 2023 $ 8,868 $ 3,241 $ 2,050 $ 14,159 $ 6,567 $ 100 $ 3,450 $ 24,276\n1 Excludes the provision for unfunded commitments and the provision for credit losses related to available-for-sale debt securities.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were charge offs totaling $1.4 million and $5.1 million, respectively.

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the provision related to unfunded\ncommitments was $0.3 million and $0.5 million, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, there was an inconsequential and a\n$0.1 million release of allowance related to unfunded commitments, respectively.\nThe ACL is based on estimates and actual losses will vary from current estimates. Management believes that the granularity of the portfolio segments, the\nrelated loss estimation methodologies and other qualitative factors, as well as the consistency in the application of assumptions, result in an ACL that is\nrepresentative of the risk found in the components of the portfolio at any given date.\nLoan Modifications for Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty\nOccasionally, the Bank modifies loans to borrowers in financial distress by providing concessions that allow for the borrower to lower their payment\nobligations for a defined period, these may include, but are not limited to: principal forgiveness, payment delays, term extensions, interest rate reductions and\nany combinations of the preceding.\nThe following table summarize the amortized cost basis of loans that were modified as of the period shown:\n27\nInterest Rate Total Class of\n(Dollars in thousands) Principal Forgiveness Payment Delay Term Extension Reduction Total Financing Receivable\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024\nCommercial\nBusiness $ — $ — $ 475 $ — $ 475 — %\nReal estate — — — — — — %\nAcquisition, development and construction — — — — — — %\nTotal commercial — — 475 — 475 — %\nResidential — — — — — — %\nHome equity lines of credit — — — — — — %\nConsumer — — — — — — %\nTotal $ — $ — $ 475 $ — $ 475 — %\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2023\nCommercial\nBusiness $ — $ 3,122 $ — $ — $ 3,122 — %\nReal estate — — — — — — %\nAcquisition, development and construction — — — — — — %\nTotal commercial — 3,122 — — 3,122 — %\nResidential — — — — — — %\nHome equity lines of credit — — — — — — %\nConsumer — — — — — — %\nTotal $ — $ 3,122 $ — $ — $ 3,122 — %\n28\nInterest Rate Total Class of\n(Dollars in thousands) Principal Forgiveness Payment Delay Term Extension Reduction Total Financing Receivable\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nCommercial\nBusiness $ — $ 5,333 $ 475 $ — $ 5,808 1 %\nReal estate — — — — — — %\nAcquisition, development and construction — — — — — — %\nTotal commercial — 5,333 475 — 5,808 — %\nResidential — — — — — %\nHome equity lines of credit — — — — — %\nConsumer — — — — — %\nTotal $ — $ 5,333 $ 475 $ — $ 5,808 — %\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nCommercial\nBusiness $ — $ 7,681 $ — $ — $ 7,681 1 %\nReal estate — 11,321 — — 11,321 2 %\nAcquisition, development and construction — — — — — — %\nTotal commercial — 19,002 — — 19,002 1 %\nResidential — — — — — — %\nHome equity lines of credit — — — — — — %\nConsumer — — — — — — %\nTotal $ — $ 19,002 $ — $ — $ 19,002 1 %\nThe above table presents the amortized cost basis of loans at September 30, 2024 that were experiencing financial difficulty and modified during the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2024, by class and by type of modification.

There were no\nequity method investments which met any of the applicable thresholds for reporting separate financial statements in accordance with Rule 3-09.\nOur equity method investments are initially recorded at cost, including transaction costs to obtain the equity method investment, and are subsequently adjusted\nfor changes due to our share of the entities' earnings.\nICM\nThe following table presents summarized income statement information for ICM for the periods shown:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nTotal revenues $ 11,530 $ 9,943 $ 34,251 $ 31,588\nNet income (loss) 724 (1,520) 1,419 (5,691)\nGain on loans sold $ 6,961 $ 5,880 $ 20,532 $ 18,568\nGain (loss) on loans held-for-sale 665 (745) 1,060 (165)\nVolume of loans sold 356,537 359,791 1,016,775 1,071,795\nOur ownership percentage of 40% of ICM allows us to have significant influence over the operations and decision making at ICM. Accordingly, the\ninvestment, which had a carrying value of $23.8 million at September 30, 2024, is accounted for as an equity method investment. Our share of ICM's net\nincome totaled $0.2 million and $0.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, while our share of ICM's net loss totaled\n$0.6 million and $2.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the\nmortgage pipeline was $518.1 million and $439.0 million, respectively.\n33\nWarp Speed\nThe following table presents summarized income statement information for our equity method investment in Warp Speed for the periods shown:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nTotal revenues $ 42,542 $ 28,672 $ 110,695 $ 104,005\nNet income (loss) 1,339 (218) $ (3,012) 8,707\nGain on loans sold $ 13,770 $ 3,985 $ 35,309 $ 11,915\nGain (loss) on loans held-for-sale 1,797 (4,735) 1,879 12,480\nVolume of loans sold 463,811 381,486 1,082,435 979,692\nOur ownership percentage of 37.5% of Warp Speed allows us to have significant influence over its operations and decision making. Accordingly, the\ninvestment, which had a carrying value of $51.9 million at September 30, 2024, is accounted for as an equity method investment. At the time of acquisition, we\nmade a policy election to record our proportionate share of net income of the investee on a three month lag. Our share of Warp Speed's net income and loss\ntotaled $0.5 million and $0.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, while our share of net loss and income totaled $0.1\nmillion and $3.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the\nmortgage pipeline was $530.8 million and $267.8 million, respectively.\nAyers Socure II\nOur ownership percentage of Ayers Socure II is 10% and it was determined that we have significant influence over the company. Accordingly, the investment is\naccounted for as an equity method investment. Our share of net income from Ayers Socure II for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was not\nsignificant. The equity method investment in Ayers Socure II is not considered a significant investment based on the criteria of Rules 3-09 and 4-08(g) of\nRegulation S-X.\nAyers Socure II's sole business is ownership of equity securities in Socure Inc. (“Socure”). In addition to our equity method investment in Ayers Socure II, we\nalso have a direct equity security ownership interest in Socure. With the combination of our investments in both Ayers Socure II and Socure directly, we own\nless than 1% of Socure in the aggregate.\nNote 6 – Deposits\nThe following table presents the components of deposits as of the periods shown:\n(Dollars in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nDemand deposits of individuals, partnerships and corporations\nNoninterest-bearing demand $ 989,144 $ 1,197,272\nNOW 615,236 538,444\nSavings and money markets 542,227 571,299\nTime deposits, including CDs and IRAs 855,041 594,461\nTotal deposits $ 3,001,648 $ 2,901,476\nTime deposits that meet or exceed the FDIC insurance limit $ 2,703 $ 3,150\n34\nThe following table presents the maturities of time deposits for the twelve month periods ended September 30:\n(Dollars in thousands)\n2025 $ 467,748\n2026 116,782\n2027 185,596\n2028 54,534\n2029 30,362\nThereafter 19\nTotal $ 855,041\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, overdrawn deposit accounts totaling $2.2 million and $3.8 million were reclassified as loan balances.\nNote 7 – Borrowed Funds\nThe Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank's maximum borrowing\ncapacity with the FHLB was $689.0 million and the remaining borrowing capacity was $675.9 million, with the difference being deposit letters of credit of\n$11.9 million and credit enhancement recourse obligations related to the master commitments through the FHLB's Mortgage Partnership Finance program of\n$1.2 million.\nShort-term borrowings\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank had no short-term borrowings with the FHLB or Federal Reserve Bank and no federal funds\npurchased outstanding.\nThe following table presents information related to short-term borrowings as of and for the periods indicated:\n(Dollars in thousands) Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Year Ended December 31, 2023\nBalance at end of period $ — $ —\nAverage balance during the period 29 17,542\nMaximum month-end balance — —\nWeighted-average rate during the period 5.99 % 5.07 %\nWeighted-average rate at end of period — % — %\nLong-term borrowings\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank had no long-term borrowings with the FHLB or the Federal Reserve Bank.\nRepurchase agreements\nAlong with traditional deposits, the Bank has access to securities sold under agreements to repurchase (“repurchase agreements”) with clients representing\nfunds deposited by clients, on an overnight basis, that are collateralized by investment securities owned by us. All repurchase agreements are subject to terms\nand conditions of repurchase/security agreements between us and the client and are accounted for as secured borrowings. Our repurchase agreements reflected\nin liabilities consist of client accounts and securities which are pledged on an individual security basis.\nWe monitor the fair value of the underlying securities on a monthly basis. Repurchase agreements are reflected in the amount of cash received in connection\nwith the transaction. The primary risk with our repurchase agreements is the market risk associated with the investments securing the transactions, as we may\nbe required to provide additional collateral based on fair value changes of the underlying investments. Securities pledged as collateral under repurchase\nagreements are maintained with our safekeeping agents.\n35\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, all of our repurchase agreements were overnight agreements. These borrowings were collateralized with\ninvestment securities with a carrying value of $4.9 million at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and were comprised of United States\ngovernment agency securities and United States sponsored mortgage-backed securities. Declines in the value of the collateral would require us to increase the\namounts of securities pledged.\nThe following table presents information related to repurchase agreements as of and for the periods shown:\n(Dollars in thousands) Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Year Ended December 31, 2023\nBalance at end of period $ 4,755 $ 4,821\nAverage balance during the period 3,334 5,662\nMaximum month-end balance 4,755 10,041\nWeighted-average rate during the period 0.92 % 0.02 %\nWeighted-average rate at end of period 2.37 % 0.01 %\nSubordinated debt\nThe following table presents information related to subordinated debt as of and for the periods shown:\n(Dollars in thousands) Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Year Ended December 31, 2023\nBalance at end of period $ 73,725 $ 73,540\nAverage balance during the period 73,634 73,415\nMaximum month-end balance 73,725 73,540\nWeighted-average rate during the period 4.05 % 4.38 %\nWeighted-average rate at end of period 4.01 % 4.02 %\nIn September 2021, we completed the private placement of $30.0 million fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes to certain qualified institutional investors.\nThese notes are unsecured and have a 10-year term, maturing October 1, 2031, and will bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.25%, payable semi-annually in arrears,\nfor the first five years of the term. Thereafter, the interest rate will reset quarterly to an interest rate per annum equal to a benchmark rate, which is Three-\nMonth Term SOFR, plus 254 basis points, payable quarterly in arrears. These notes have been structured to qualify as Tier 2 capital for regulatory capital\npurposes.\nIn November 2020, we completed the private placement of $40.0 million fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes to certain qualified institutional investors.\nThese notes are unsecured and have a ten-year term, maturing December 1, 2030, and will bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.25%, payable semi-annually in\narrears, for the first five years of the term. Thereafter, the interest rate will reset quarterly to an interest rate per annum equal to a benchmark rate, which is\nThree-Month Term SOFR, plus 401 basis points, payable quarterly in arrears. These notes have been structured to qualify as Tier 2 capital for regulatory capital\npurposes.\nIn March 2007, we completed the private placement of $4.0 million Floating Rate, Trust Preferred Securities through our MVB Financial Statutory Trust I\nsubsidiary (the “Trust”). We established the Trust for the sole purpose of issuing the Trust Preferred Securities pursuant to an Amended and Restated\nDeclaration of Trust. The Trust Preferred Securities and the Debentures mature in 2037 and have been redeemable by us since 2012. Interest payments are due\nin March, June, September and December and are adjusted at the interest due dates at a rate of 0.26% plus Three-Month Term SOFR. The obligations we\nprovide with respect to the issuance of the trust preferred securities constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by us of the Trust’s obligations with respect to\nthe trust preferred securities to the extent set forth in the related guarantees. The securities issued by the Trust are includable for regulatory purposes as a\ncomponent of our Tier 1 capital.\nSenior term loan\nThe following table presents information related to senior term loan as of and for the periods shown:\n(Dollars in thousands) Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Year Ended December 31, 2023\nBalance at end of period $ — $ 6,786\nAverage balance during the period 3,146 9,007\nMaximum month-end balance 6,794 9,768\nWeighted-average rate during the period 11.21 % 8.50 %\nWeighted-average rate at end of period — % 8.76 %\n36\nIn October 2022, we entered into a credit agreement with Raymond James Bank (“Raymond James”). Pursuant to the credit agreement, Raymond James has\nextended to us a senior term loan in the aggregate principal amount of up to $10.0 million. In connection with the closing of the Warp Speed transaction, we\nborrowed $10.0 million and paid Raymond James an upfront fee of 1% of the loan amount. The loan bore interest per annum at a rate equal to 2.75%, plus term\nSOFR, which reset monthly. Accrued interest was payable on the last business day of each month, beginning with October 31, 2022, with the then outstanding\nprincipal balance of the loan payable on the last business day of each quarter in the amount of $125,000 during the first year and $250,000 thereafter. In May\n2024, the senior term loan was repaid.\nNote 8 – Pension and Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans\nWe participate in a trusteed pension plan known as the Allegheny Group Retirement Plan. Benefits are based on years of service and the employee’s\ncompensation. Accruals under the plan were frozen as of May 31, 2014. Freezing the plan resulted in a remeasurement of the pension obligations and plan\nassets as of the freeze date. The pension obligation was remeasured using the discount rate based on the Citigroup Above Median Pension Discount Curve in\neffect on May 31, 2014 of 4.5%.\nThe following table presents information pertaining to the activity in our defined benefit pension plan, using the latest available actuarial valuations with a\nmeasurement date of September 30, 2024 and 2023 for the periods shown:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nInterest cost $ 113 $ 113 339 339\nExpected return on plan assets (157) (164) (471) (492)\nAmortization of net actuarial loss 43 29 129 87\nNet periodic benefit income $ (1) $ (22) $ (3) $ (66)\nContributions paid $ — $ — $ — $ —\nThere was no service cost or amortization of prior service cost for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nIn June 2017, we approved a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the “SERP”), pursuant to which the Chief Executive Officer of Potomac Mortgage\nGroup (“PMG”) is entitled to receive certain supplemental nonqualified retirement benefits. The SERP took effect on December 31, 2017. As the executive\ncompleted three years of continuous employment with PMG prior to retirement date (which shall be no earlier than the date he attains age 55) he will, upon\nretirement, be entitled to receive $1.8 million payable in 180 equal consecutive monthly installments. The liability is calculated by discounting the anticipated\nfuture cash flows at 4.0%. The liability accrued for this obligation was $1.6 million as of September 30, 2024 and $1.4 million December 31, 2023,\nrespectively. In February 2024, the SERP was terminated. Within the agreement, there is a one year provision for payment delay. As such, the $1.8 million\nobligation is scheduled to be paid in February 2025.\n37\nNote 9 – Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe following table presents the carrying values and estimated fair values of our financial instruments as of the periods shown:\nQuoted Prices in\nActive Markets for Significant Other Significant\nIdentical Assets (Level Observable Inputs Unobservable Inputs\n(Dollars in thousands) Carrying Value Estimated Fair Value I) (Level II) (Level III)\nSeptember 30, 2024\nFinancial Assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 610,911 $ 610,911 $ 610,911 $ — $ —\nSecurities available-for-sale 374,828 374,828 — 348,456 26,372\nEquity securities 41,760 41,760 4,273 — 37,486\nLoans receivable, net 2,149,773 2,313,371 — — 2,313,371\nServicing rights 1,510 1,510 — — 1,510\nInterest rate swaps 3,891 3,891 — 3,891 —\nAccrued interest receivable 15,325 15,325 — 3,033 12,292\nFHLB stock 2,031 2,031 — 2,031 —\nEmbedded derivative 648 648 — — 648\nFinancial Liabilities:\nDeposits $ 3,001,648 $ 3,006,451 $ — $ 3,006,451 $ —\nRepurchase agreements 4,755 4,755 — 4,755 —\nInterest rate swaps 3,891 3,891 — 3,891 —\nFair value hedge 6,617 6,617 — 6,617 —\nAccrued interest payable 3,388 3,388 — 3,388 —\nSubordinated debt 73,725 65,793 — 65,793 —\nDecember 31, 2023\nFinancial assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 398,229 $ 398,229 $ 398,229 $ — $ —\nSecurities available-for-sale 345,275 345,275 — 319,530 25,745\nEquity securities 41,086 41,086 3,590 — 37,496\nLoans held-for-sale 629 629 — 629 —\nLoans receivable, net 2,295,470 2,230,279 — — 2,230,279\nServicing rights 1,768 1,799 — — 1,799\nInterest rate swaps 6,249 6,249 — 6,249 —\nAccrued interest receivable 15,267 15,267 — 2,836 12,431\nFHLB stock 2,094 2,094 — 2,094 —\nEmbedded derivative 648 648 — — 648\nFinancial liabilities:\nDeposits $ 2,901,476 $ 2,587,246 $ — $ 2,587,246 $ —\nRepurchase agreements 4,821 4,821 — 4,821 —\nInterest rate swaps 6,249 6,249 — 6,249 —\nFair value hedge 6,111 6,111 — 6,111 —\nAccrued interest payable 2,385 2,385 — 2,385 —\nSenior term loan 6,786 6,786 — 6,786 —\nSubordinated debt 73,540 57,234 — 57,234 —\n38\nNote 10 – Fair Value Measurements\nFair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information about the financial instrument. These estimates do not reflect\nany premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time of our entire holdings of a particular financial instrument. Because no market exists\nfor a significant portion of our financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic\nconditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters\nof significant judgment, and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. Fair value\nestimates are based on existing on-and-off balance sheet financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business and the\nvalue of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments.\nThe methods of determining the fair value of assets and liabilities presented in this footnote are consistent with our methodologies disclosed in Note 1 -\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of the\n2023 Form 10-K. Valuation techniques for the assets and liabilities described below are consistent with techniques used in prior periods.\nAssets Measured on a Recurring Basis\nAs required by accounting standards, financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair\nvalue measurement. The following measurements are made on a recurring basis.\nAvailable-for-sale investment securities – Available-for-sale investment securities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value measurement is\nbased upon quoted prices, if available. If quoted prices are not available, fair values are measured using independent pricing models or other model-based\nvaluation techniques such as the present value of future cash flows, adjusted for the security’s credit rating, prepayment assumptions and other factors such as\ncredit loss assumptions. Level I securities include those traded on an active exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange and money market funds. Level II\nsecurities include mortgage-backed securities issued by government sponsored entities and private label entities, municipal bonds, United States Treasury\nsecurities that are traded by dealers or brokers in inactive over-the-counter markets and corporate debt securities. Certain local municipal securities related to\ntax increment financing (“TIF”) are independently valued and classified as Level III instruments.\nEquity securities – Certain equity securities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value measurement is based upon quoted prices, if available. If\nquoted prices are not available, fair values are measured using independent pricing models or other model-based valuation techniques such as the present value\nof future cash flows, adjusted for the security's credit rating, prepayment assumptions and other factors such as credit loss assumptions. The valuation\nmethodologies utilized may include significant unobservable inputs.\nLoans held-for-sale – The fair value of loans held-for-sale is determined, when possible, using quoted secondary market prices or investor commitments. If no\nsuch quoted price exists, the fair value of a loan is determined using quoted prices for a similar asset or assets, adjusted for the specific attributes of that loan,\nwhich would be used by other market participants. If the fair value at the reporting date exceeds the amortized cost of a loan, the loan is reported at amortized\ncost.\nInterest rate swaps – Interest rate swaps are recorded at fair value based on third-party vendors who compile prices from various sources and may determine\nthe fair value of identical or similar instruments by using pricing models that consider observable market data.\nFair value hedges – Treated like an interest rate swap, fair value hedges are recorded at fair value based on third-party vendors who compile prices from\nvarious sources and may determine fair value of identical or similar instruments by using pricing models that consider observable market data.\nEmbedded derivatives – Accounted for and recorded separately from the underlying contract as a derivative at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair values are\ndetermined using the Monte Carlo model valuation technique. The valuation methodology utilized includes significant unobservable inputs.\n39\nThe following tables present assets and liabilities reported on the consolidated statements of financial condition at their fair value on a recurring basis as of the\nperiods shown by level within the fair value hierarchy:\nSeptember 30, 2024\n(Dollars in thousands) Level I Level II Level III Total\nAssets:\nUnited States government agency securities $ — $ 41,637 $ — $ 41,637\nUnited States sponsored mortgage-backed securities — 107,278 — 107,278\nUnited States treasury securities — 103,241 — 103,241\nMunicipal securities — 87,100 18,872 105,972\nCorporate debt securities — 8,451 — 8,451\nOther securities — 749 — 749\nEquity securities 4,273 — — 4,273\nInterest rate swaps — 3,891 — 3,891\nEmbedded derivative — — 648 648\nLiabilities:\nInterest rate swaps — 3,891 — 3,891\nFair value hedge — 6,617 — 6,617\nDecember 31, 2023\n(Dollars in thousands) Level I Level II Level III Total\nAssets:\nUnited States government agency securities $ — $ 38,408 $ — $ 38,408\nUnited States sponsored mortgage-backed securities — 82,382 — 82,382\nUnited States treasury securities — 100,356 — 100,356\nMunicipal securities — 88,662 18,245 106,907\nCorporate debt securities — 8,942 — 8,942\nOther securities — 780 — 780\nEquity securities 3,590 — — 3,590\nLoans held-for-sale — 629 — 629\nInterest rate swaps — 6,249 — 6,249\nEmbedded derivative — — 648 648\nLiabilities:\nInterest rate swaps — 6,249 — 6,249\nFair value hedge — 6,111 — 6,111\n40\nThe following table represents recurring Level III assets as of the periods shown:\n(Dollars in thousands) Municipal Securities Embedded Derivatives Total\nBalance at June 30, 2024 $ 17,929 $ 648 $ 18,577\nMaturities/calls (72) — (72)\nUnrealized gain included in other comprehensive income (loss) 1,015 — 1,015\nBalance at September 30, 2024 $ 18,872 $ 648 $ 19,520\nBalance at December 31, 2023 $ 18,245 $ 648 $ 18,893\nRealized and unrealized income included in earnings 5 — 5\nMaturities/calls (297) — (297)\nUnrealized gain included in other comprehensive income (loss) 919 — 919\nBalance at September 30, 2024 $ 18,872 $ 648 $ 19,520\nBalance at Balance at June 30, 2023 $ 34,418 $ 648 $ 35,066\nRealized and unrealized gains included in earnings 45 — 45\nPurchase of securities 250 — 250\nMaturities/calls (17,389) — (17,389)\nUnrealized loss included in other comprehensive income (loss) (184) — (184)\nBalance at September 30, 2023 $ 17,140 $ 648 $ 17,788\nBalance at December 31, 2022 $ 35,343 $ 787 $ 36,130\nRealized loss included in earnings 46 (139) (93)\nPurchase of securities 250 — 250\nMaturities/calls (18,156) — (18,156)\nUnrealized loss included in other comprehensive income (loss) (343) — (343)\nBalance at September 30, 2023 $ 17,140 $ 648 $ 17,788\nAssets Measured on a Nonrecurring Basis\nFrom time to time, we may be required to measure certain financial assets, financial liabilities, non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities at fair value on\na nonrecurring basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These include assets that are measured at the lower of cost or market value that were recognized at fair\nvalue below cost at the end of the period. Certain non-financial assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis include foreclosed assets (upon initial\nrecognition or subsequent impairment), non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities measured at fair value in the second step of a goodwill impairment test\nand intangible assets and other non-financial long-lived assets measured at fair value for impairment assessment. Non-financial assets measured at fair value on\na nonrecurring basis during 2024 and 2023 include certain acquired foreclosed assets which, upon acquisition, were measured at fair market value. Subsequent\nto their initial recognition, the foreclosed assets were remeasured at fair value through a write-down included in other noninterest expense.\nCollateral-dependent loans – Certain loans receivable are evaluated individually for credit loss when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and\nrepayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of collateral. Estimated credit losses are based on the fair value of the\ncollateral, adjusted for costs to sell. Collateral values are estimated using Level II inputs based on observable market data or Level III inputs based on\ncustomized discounting criteria. For a majority of collateral-dependent real estate related loans, we obtain an external appraisal. Other valuation techniques are\nused as well, including internal valuations, comparable property analysis and contractual sales information.\nLoans held-for-sale – The fair value of loans held-for-sale is determined, when possible, using quoted secondary-market prices or investor commitments. If no\nsuch quoted price exists, the fair value of a loan is determined using quoted prices for a similar asset or assets, adjusted for the specific attributes of that loan,\nwhich would be used by other market participants. If the fair value at the reporting date exceeds the amortized cost of a loan, the loan is reported at amortized\ncost.\n41\nOther real estate owned – Other real estate owned, which is obtained through the Bank’s foreclosure process, is valued utilizing the appraised collateral value.\nCollateral values are estimated using Level II inputs based on observable market data or Level III inputs based on customized discounting criteria. At the time\nthe foreclosure is completed, we obtain an external appraisal.\nThe following table presents the fair value of these assets as of the periods shown:\nSeptember 30, 2024\n(Dollars in thousands) Level I Level II Level III Total\nCollateral-dependent loans $ — $ — $ 21,537 $ 21,537\nOther real estate owned — — 825 825\nDecember 31, 2023\n(Dollars in thousands) Level I Level II Level III Total\nCollateral-dependent loans $ — $ — $ 2,891 $ 2,891\nOther real estate owned — — 825 825\nThe following tables present quantitative information about the Level III significant unobservable inputs for assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of\nthe periods shown:\nQuantitative Information about Level III Fair Value Measurements\n(Dollars in thousands) Fair Value Valuation Technique Unobservable Input Range\nSeptember 30, 2024\nNonrecurring measurements:\nCollateral-dependent loans $ 21,537 Appraisal of collateral 1 Appraisal adjustments 2 0% - 20%\nLiquidation expense 2 6%\nOther real estate owned $ 825 Appraisal of collateral 1 Appraisal adjustments 2 0% - 20%\nLiquidation expense 2 6%\nRecurring measurements:\nMunicipal securities 3 $ 18,872 Appraisal of bond 4 Bond appraisal adjustment 5 5% - 15%\nEmbedded derivatives $ 648 Monte Carlo pricing model Deferred payment $0 - $49.1 million\nVolatility 59%\nTerm 4.75 years\nRisk free rate 3.59%\nDecember 31, 2023\nNonrecurring measurements:\nCollateral-dependent loans $ 2,891 Appraisal of collateral 1 Appraisal adjustments 2 0% - 20%\nLiquidation expense 2 6%\nOther real estate owned $ 825 Appraisal of collateral 1 Appraisal adjustments 2 0% - 20%\nLiquidation expense 2 6%\nRecurring measurements:\nMunicipal securities 3 $ 18,245 Appraisal of bond 4 Bond appraisal adjustment 5 5% - 15%\nEmbedded derivatives $ 648 Monte Carlo pricing model Deferred payment $0 - $49.1 million\nVolatility 59%\nTerm 4.75 years\nRisk free rate 3.59%\n1 Fair value is generally determined through independent appraisals of the underlying collateral, which generally include various Level III inputs that are not\nidentifiable.\n2 Appraisals may be adjusted by management for qualitative factors such as economic conditions and estimated liquidation expenses. The range and weighted-\naverage of liquidation expenses and other appraisal adjustments are presented as a percent of the appraisal.\n42\n3 Municipal securities classified as Level III instruments are comprised of TIF bonds related to certain local municipal securities.\n4 Fair value is determined through independent analysis of liquidity, rating, yield and duration.\n5 Appraisals may be adjusted for qualitative factors, such as local economic conditions, liquidity, marketability and legal structure.\nNote 11 – Derivatives\nWe use certain derivative instruments to meet the needs of customers, as well as to manage the interest rate risk associated with certain transactions. All\nderivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value.\nFair Value Hedges of Interest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to changes in the fair value of fixed rate mortgages included in a closed portfolio due to changes in benchmark interest rates.\nIn 2023, we entered into five fixed portfolio layer method fair value swaps, designated as hedging instruments, to manage exposure to changes in fair value on\nfixed rate mortgages and certain fixed rate available for sale securities attributable to the designated interest rate. Four of the interest rate swaps are designated\nto hedge a closed portfolio of fixed rate mortgages and one of the interest rate swaps is designated to hedge a closed portfolio of fixed rate municipal bonds.\nThe interest rate swaps involve the payment of fixed-rate amounts to a counterparty in exchange for us receiving variable-rate payments over the life of the\nagreements, without the exchange of the underlying notional amount.\nWe designated the fair value swaps under the portfolio layer method. The total notional amount of the five swaps was $429.3 million as of September 30, 2024,\none of which is amortizing and included a $20.7 million amortization adjustment to the notional amount at September 30, 2024. Under this method, the hedged\nitems are designated as a hedged layer of closed portfolios of financial loans and municipal bonds that are anticipated to remain outstanding for the designated\nhedged periods. Adjustments are made to record the swaps at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in interest income. The carrying values of the fair\nvalue swaps are also adjusted through interest income, based on changes in fair value attributable to changes in the hedged risk.\nThe following table represents the carrying value of the portfolio layer method hedged assets and the cumulative fair value hedging adjustments included in the\ncarrying value of the hedged assets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nAmortized Cost Basis Amortized Cost Basis\n(Dollars in thousands) Balance Sheet Location\nBasis Hedged Asset Adjustment Basis Hedged Asset Adjustment\nFixed rate mortgages Loans receivable $ 469,103 $ 379,315 $ 4,422 $ 491,018 $ 390,297 $ 4,055\nFixed rate bonds Investment securities available-for-sale $ 59,436 $ 50,000 $ 1,736 $ 59,270 $ 50,000 $ 1,570\nTotal hedged assets $ 528,539 $ 429,315 $ 6,158 $ 550,288 $ 440,297 $ 5,625\nIn October 2024, we discontinued a portfolio layer method fair value swap designated as a hedging instrument to hedge a closed portfolio of fixed rate\nmortgages. The hedge had a notional amount of $250.0 million and was in a liability position with a fair value of $2.8 million as of September 30, 2024. As\npart of the discontinuance, we incurred a $1.7 million fee that will be amortized over the life of the related loans.\nDerivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments\nMatched Interest Rate Swaps. We enter into interest rate swap contracts to help commercial loan borrowers manage their interest rate risk. The interest rate\nswap contracts with commercial loan borrowers allow them to convert floating-rate loan payments to fixed rate loan payments. When we enter into an interest\nrate swap contract with a commercial loan borrower, we simultaneously enter into a \"mirror\" swap contract with a third-party. The third-party exchanges the\nborrower's fixed-rate loan payments for floating-rate loan payments. These derivatives are not designated as hedges and changes in fair value are recognized in\nearnings. Because these derivatives have mirror-image contractual terms, the changes in fair value substantially offset each other through earnings. Fees earned\nin connection with the execution of derivatives related to this program are recognized in earnings through loan-related derivative income.\n43\nThe following tables summarize outstanding financial derivative instruments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nSeptember 30, 2024\nFair Value of Asset\n(Dollars in thousands) Balance Sheet Location Notional Amount (Liability) Gain (Loss)\nFair value hedge of interest rate risk:\nPay fixed rate swaps with counterparty Accrued interest receivable and other assets $ 429,315 $ (6,617)$ (506)\nNot designated hedges of interest rate risk:\nMatched interest rate swaps with borrowers Accrued interest receivable and other assets 138,442 3,891 3,891\nMatched interest rate swaps with counterparty Accrued interest payable and other liabilities 138,442 (3,891) (3,891)\nTotal derivatives $ 706,199 $ (6,617)$ (506)\nDecember 31, 2023\nFair Value of Asset\n(Dollars in thousands) Balance Sheet Location Notional Amount (Liability) Gain (Loss)\nFair value hedge of interest rate risk:\nPay fixed rate swaps with counterparty Accrued interest receivable and other assets $ 440,297 $ (6,111)$ (6,111)\nNot designated hedges of interest rate risk:\nMatched interest rate swaps with borrowers Accrued interest receivable and other assets 126,494 6,249 6,249\nMatched interest rate swaps with counterparty Accrued interest payable and other liabilities 126,494 (6,249) (6,249)\nTotal derivatives $ 693,285 $ (6,111)$ (6,111)\nEmbedded Derivative\nIn December 2022, we entered into an agreement to sell a portion of our shares of Interchecks Technologies, Inc., a former equity method investment that was\nsubsequently reclassified to equity securities due to the decrease in the remaining ownership percentage. Based on the terms of the sale, we recognized the cash\nreceived at closing, as well as a receivable for the remaining installment payment, which is based on a future economic event and is accounted for and\nseparately recorded as a derivative. The derivative instrument is included in accrued interest receivable and other assets on the consolidated balance sheet,\nwhile the gains and losses are included in noninterest income on the consolidated statement of income. The fair value of the embedded derivative was\n$0.6 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, with no gain or loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and a loss of $0.1 million for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n44\nNote 12 – Earnings per Share\nWe determine basic earnings per share (“EPS”) by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares\noutstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is determined by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares\noutstanding, increased by both the number of shares that would be issued assuming the exercise of instruments under our incentive stock plan.\nThe following table presents our calculation of EPS for the periods shown:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(Dollars in thousands except shares and per share data) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNumerator for earnings per share:\nNet income from continuing operations $ 2,156 $ 3,872 $ 10,807 $ 14,308\nNet (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interest (76) (5) (156) 231\nNet income available to common shareholders from continuing operations 2,080 3,867 10,651 14,539\nNet income from discontinued operations available to common shareholders — — — 8,782\nNet income available to common shareholders $ 2,080 $ 3,867 $ 10,651 $ 23,321\nDenominator:\nWeighted-average shares outstanding - basic 12,927,962 12,722,010 12,874,311 12,678,708\nEffect of dilutive instruments 241,049 394,619 246,934 334,126\nWeighted-average shares outstanding - diluted 13,169,011 13,116,629 13,121,245 13,012,834\nEarnings per share from continuing operations - basic $ 0.16 $ 0.30 $ 0.83 $ 1.15\nEarnings per share from discontinued operations - basic $ — $ — $ — $ 0.69\nEarnings per common share - basic $ 0.16 $ 0.30 $ 0.83 $ 1.84\nEarnings per share from continuing operations - diluted $ 0.16 $ 0.29 $ 0.81 $ 1.12\nEarnings per share from discontinued operations - diluted $ — $ — $ — $ 0.67\nEarnings per share common share - diluted $ 0.16 $ 0.29 $ 0.81 $ 1.79\nInstruments not included in the computation of diluted EPS because the effect would\nbe antidilutive 125,826 228,243 136,838 250,893\n45\nNote 13 – Comprehensive Income\nThe following tables present the reclassified components of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) as of and for the periods shown:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nAmount Amount Amount Amount\nreclassified reclassified reclassified reclassified Affected income statement\nDetails about AOCI components from AOCI from AOCI from AOCI from AOCI line item\nAvailable-for-sale securities\nGain (loss) on sale of\nRealized gain (loss) recognized in income $ — $ — $ 658 $ (1,536) available-for-sale\nsecurities\nIncome tax effect — — (158) 369 Income taxes\nRealized gain (loss) recognized in income, net of tax — — 500 (1,167)\nDefined benefit pension plan items\nSalaries and employee\nAmortization of net actuarial loss (43) $ (29) $ (129) $ (87)\nbenefits\nIncome tax effect 10 7 30 21 Income taxes\nDefined benefit pension plan items, net of tax (33) (22) (99) (66)\nInvestment hedge\nInterest on investment\nCarrying value adjustment — — — 289\nsecurities\nIncome tax effect — — — (69) Income taxes\nInvestment hedge, net of tax — — — 220\nTotal reclassifications $ (33) $ (22) $ 401 $ (1,013)\n46\nUnrealized gains\n(losses) on available Defined benefit pension\n(Dollars in thousands) for-sale securities plan items Investment hedge Total\nBalance at June 30, 2024 $ (26,176) $ (2,244) $ 34 $ (28,386)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclassification 6,271 (377) — 5,894\nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) — 33 — 33\nNet current period other comprehensive income (loss) 6,271 (344) — 5,927\nBalance at September 30, 2024 $ (19,905) $ (2,588) $ 34 $ (22,459)\nBalance at December 31, 2023 $ (25,871) $ (2,994) $ 34 $ (28,831)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclassification 6,466 307 — 6,773\nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (500) 99 — (401)\nNet current period other comprehensive income (loss) 5,966 406 — 6,372\nBalance at September 30, 2024 $ (19,905) $ (2,588) $ 34 $ (22,459)\nBalance at June 30, 2023 $ (31,674) $ (2,824) $ 34 $ (34,464)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclassification (5,885) 76 — (5,809)\nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) — 22 — 22\nNet current period other comprehensive income (loss) (5,885) 98 — (5,787)\nBalance at September 30, 2023 $ (37,559) $ (2,726) $ 34 $ (40,251)\nBalance at December 31, 2022 $ (34,829) $ (3,129) $ 254 $ (37,704)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclassification (3,897) 337 — (3,560)\nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) 1,167 66 (220) 1,013\nNet current period other comprehensive income (loss) (2,730) 403 (220) (2,547)\nBalance at September 30, 2023 $ (37,559) $ (2,726) $ 34 $ (40,251)\n47\nNote 14 – Segment Reporting\nWe have identified three reportable segments: CoRe Banking; Mortgage Banking; and Financial Holding Company. All other operating segments are\nsummarized in an Other category.\nOur CoRe Banking segment, which includes our Fintech division, represents banking products and services offered to customers by the Bank, primarily loans\nand deposits accounts. Revenue from banking activities consists primarily of interest earned on loans and investment securities and service charges on deposit\naccounts.\nRevenue from our Mortgage Banking segment is primarily comprised of our share of net income or loss from mortgage banking activities of our equity method\ninvestments in ICM and Warp Speed.\nRevenue from Financial Holding Company activities is mainly comprised of intercompany service income and dividends.\nThe following tables present information about the reportable segments and reconciliation to the consolidated financial statements for

$14.4 million in the form of a note issued\nto the buyer, resulting in a gain on sale of $11.8 million. The note matures in June 2027 and bears interest at a fixed rate of 7%, payable in four equal annual\ninstallments, which commenced June 20, 2024. To facilitate a transition of the Chartwell services and support the onboarding and conversion of systems, we\nentered into a 60 day Employee Lease and Service Agreement, whereby we provided the purchaser with finance and accounting, human capital, information\ntechnology, marketing and record/data retention services. In addition, we entered into a contract with the purchaser to continue to provide services and support\nfrom Chartwell for three years following the sale. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we have paid $1.0 million and $3.3 million in\nfees related to this contract, respectively.\nChartwell's net income is presented in income from discontinued operations for all periods shown.

In consideration for the assignment, Flexia granted a license to MVB Technology for the Flexia software. Additionally, through\na Mutual Release Agreement between Edge Ventures and Flexia, Edge Ventures transferred its 800 Class A Common Units and 1,500 Preferred Units of Flexia\nback to Flexia for cancellation. As a result of the transactions, we incurred a loss of $1.1 million and no longer consolidate Flexia in our financial statements.\n52\nItem 2 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial\nstatements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with the consolidated financial statements and\naccompanying notes and other detailed information appearing in the 2023 Form 10-K.

In addition to historical information, this discussion\ncontains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause results to differ materially from management’s\nexpectations. See the “Forward-Looking Statements” section of this report for further information on forward-looking statements.\nExecutive Summary\nWe continue to adapt our business model due to challenging market conditions, primarily due to the current high interest rate environment, a slowing economy\nand multiple high-profile bank failures that occurred during the first half of 2023. Interest rates have remained at an elevated level through September 30, 2024,\nalthough the Federal Reserve did reduce its key interest rate to a range of 4.75% to 5.00% in September 2024. Lower loan balances are the result of slower\nmarket demand, the impact of loan amortization and payoffs and slower loan growth based on overall market conditions and portfolio management. We\ninitiated the process of winding down our digital asset program account relationships, while maintaining operating accounts, during the second quarter of 2024.\nThis decision was prompted by changing market conditions and profitability challenges that contributed to an unfavorable risk/reward dynamic. We remain\ncommitted to the gaming, payments and banking-as-a-service industries. We continue to expand the Bank's treasury services function to support the banking\nneeds of financial and emerging technology companies, which we believe will further enhance core deposits, notably through the expansion of deposit\nacquisition and fee income strategies through the Fintech division. Additionally, we have expanded our compliance and risk management team to support the\ngrowth in these lines of business.\nCurrent Market Conditions\nThere continues to be a focus on liquidity after the bank failures that occurred during the first half of 2023, when certain specialized banking institutions with\nelevated concentrations of uninsured deposits experienced large deposit outflows, resulting in the institutions being placed into FDIC receiverships. In the\naftermath, there has been substantial market disruption and indications that deposit concerns could spread within the banking industry, leading to deposit\noutflows and other destabilizing results. These market events could have a material adverse effect on our business. A deterioration in economic conditions or\nthe loss of confidence in financial institutions may result in deposit base outflows and limit our access to some of our customary sources of liquidity, including,\nbut not limited to, inter-bank borrowings and borrowings from the Federal Reserve and FHLB. In addition, account and deposit balances may decrease when\nclients perceive alternative investments, such as the stock market or real estate, as providing a better risk/return trade-off. Furthermore, the portion of our\ndeposit portfolio that is comprised of large uninsured deposits may be more likely to be withdrawn rapidly under adverse economic conditions. If our clients\nmove money out of bank deposits into investments or to other financial institutions, we could lose a relatively low-cost source of funds. As of September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023, our liquid assets totaled $645.0 million and $504.3 million, respectively, which we believe would enable us to meet our cash\nobligations as they come due.\nFinancial Results\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. Three Months Ended September 30, 2023\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income decreased $3.3 million, noninterest income increased $0.9 million and noninterest\nexpenses decreased by $1.2 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our tax-equivalent yield on earning assets in the three months\nended September 30, 2024 was 6.32% compared to 6.29% in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Loans receivable decreased by $35.5 million to\n$2.17 billion during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Our overall cost of interest-bearing liabilities was 4.04% in the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 compared to 3.58% in the three months ended September 30, 2023. This cost of interest-bearing liabilities, combined with the earning\nasset yield, resulted in a tax-equivalent net interest margin of 3.61% in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.90% in the three months\nended September 30, 2023.\nOur net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $2.1 million compared to $3.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nEarnings for the three months ended September 30, 2024 equated to a return on average assets of 0.3% and a return on average equity of 2.8%, compared to the\nthree months ended September 30, 2023 results of 0.5% and 5.8%, respectively. Basic and diluted earnings per share were $0.16 for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, compared to $0.30\n53\nand $0.29, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income decreased $7.9 million, noninterest income increased $6.4 million and noninterest\nexpenses decreased by $0.7 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our yield on tax-equivalent earning assets in the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 was 6.31% compared to 6.10% in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Loans receivable decreased by $146.3 million to\n$2.17 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our overall cost of interest-bearing liabilities was 4.14% in the nine months ended September\n30, 2024 compared to 3.30% in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This cost of interest-bearing liabilities, combined with the earning asset yield,\nresulted in a tax-equivalent net interest margin of 3.73% in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.03% in the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023.\nOur net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $10.7 million compared to $23.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023,\nlargely the result of an $11.8 million pre-tax gain related to the sale of the Bank’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Chartwell. Earnings for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 equated to a return on average assets of 0.4% and a return on average equity of 4.9%, compared to the nine months ended September 30,\n2023 results of 0.9% and 11.4%, respectively. Basic and diluted earnings per share were $0.83 and $0.81, respectively, for the nine months ended September\n30, 2024, compared to $1.84 and $1.79, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin (Average Balance Schedules)\nThe following tables present information regarding (i) average balances, the total dollar amount of interest income from interest earning assets and the resultant\naverage yields; (ii) average balances, the total dollar amount of interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities and the resultant average rates; (iii) the interest\nrate spread; (iv) net interest income and margin; and (v) net interest income and margin (on a tax-equivalent basis) as of and for the periods shown.

Interest-earning\nassets include loans, investment securities and certificates of deposit in banks. Interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing deposits and borrowed funds\nsuch as sweep accounts, repurchase agreements, subordinated debt and the senior term loan. Net interest income, which is the primary source of revenue for the\nBank, is also impacted by changes in market interest rates and the mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.\nNet interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets and measures the net revenue stream generated by the\nBank’s balance sheet. Net interest spread is calculated by taking the difference between interest earned on earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing\nliabilities in an effort to maximize net interest income, while maintaining an appropriate level of interest rate risk.\nIn September 2024, the Federal Reserve lowered its key interest rate from a range of 5.25% to 5.5% as of December 31, 2023 to a range of 4.75% to 5.00% as\nof September 30, 2024. We continually analyze methods to deploy assets into an earning asset mix to generate a stronger net interest margin.\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. Three Months Ended September 30, 2023\nNet interest margin on a tax-equivalent basis was 3.61% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.90% for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The decrease in net interest margin on a tax-equivalent basis primarily reflects higher funding costs and a shift in the mix of earnings\nassets, partially offset by investment yields. Tax-equivalent net interest spread was 2.28% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.71%\nfor the three months ended September 30, 2023. The difference between the tax-equivalent net interest margin and tax-equivalent net interest spread was 133\nbasis points in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 119 basis points in the three months ended September 30, 2023 driven by the increase\nin interest expense and the decline in average assets.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income decreased by $3.3 million, or 11.0%, to $26.6 million from $29.9 million during the\nthree months ended September 30, 2023. Average total earning assets were $2.95 billion in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $3.06\nbillion in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Total interest income decreased by $1.7 million, or 3.5%, to $46.6 million in the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 from $48.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 driven by a decrease in total earning assets, including interest bearing\ndeposits with other banks. Average total loans decreased to $2.18 billion in the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $2.27 billion in the three months\nended September 30, 2023, primarily as the result of a $40.2 million decrease in average commercial loans and an $26.7 million decrease in average consumer\nloans. The yield on total loans increased six basis points.\n58\nAverage investment securities increased $49.1 million as the result of a $51.8 million increase in taxable investments, partially offset by a $2.7 million decrease\nin tax-exempt investments during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The yield on tax-\nexempt securities decreased 46 basis points, and the taxable securities yield increased 81 basis points.\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities decreased by $71.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from the three months ended September 30,\n2023. The decrease was primarily the result of average balance decreases of $140.3 million in NOW accounts and $103.4 million in money market checking\ndeposits, partially offset by an increase of $136.7 million in certificates of deposit.\nAverage interest-bearing deposits were $1.89 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and $1.96 billion for the three months ended September\n30, 2023.Total interest expense increased by $1.6 million, primarily driven by increases in interest rates. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased to\n4.04% in the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.58% in the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nNet interest margin on a tax-equivalent basis was 3.73% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 4.03% for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The decrease in net interest margin on a tax-equivalent basis primarily reflects higher funding costs and a shift in the mix of earnings\nassets, partially offset by loan yields. Tax-equivalent net interest spread was 2.17% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.80% for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023. The difference between the tax-equivalent net interest margin and tax-equivalent net interest spread was 156 basis\npoints in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 123 basis points in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This difference was driven by\nthe increase in interest expense and the decline in average assets.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income decreased by $7.9 million, or 8.6%, to $84.3 million from $92.2 million during the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. This decrease is largely due to an increase in cost of funds, partially offset by higher yields on earning assets. Average total\nearning assets were $3.04 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $3.09 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Total\ninterest income increased by $2.7 million, or 1.9%, to $142.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from $140.1 million in the nine months\nended September 30, 2023 driven by higher yields from new loan production at favorable interest rates. Average total loans decreased to $2.23 billion in the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 from $2.34 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as the result of a $47.0 million decrease in\naverage consumer loans, a $30.1 million decrease in average real estate loans and a $24.2 million decrease in average commercial loans. The yield on total\nloans increased 28 basis points.\nAverage investment securities increased $13.1 million as the result of a $31.3 million increase in taxable investments, partially offset by an $18.2 million\ndecrease in tax-exempt investments during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The yield on\ntax-exempt securities decreased 67 basis points, and the taxable securities yield increased 41 basis points.\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities decreased by $54.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe decrease was primarily the result of average balance decreases of $198.9 million in negotiable order of withdrawal accounts, $41.0 million in money\nmarket checking accounts and $23.4 million in FHLB and other borrowings, partially offset by $163.8 million in certificates of deposit and $51.7 million in\nsaving accounts.\nAverage interest-bearing deposits were $1.81 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and $1.83 billion for the nine months ended September 30,\n2023. Total interest expense increased by $10.5 million, primarily driven by increases in interest rates. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased to\n4.14% in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.30% in the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nFurther discussion on borrowings is included in Note 7 – Borrowed Funds accompanying the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this\nreport.\n59\nProvision for Credit Losses\nThe provision for credit losses, which is a product of management’s analysis, is recorded in response to inherent losses in the loan portfolio. Credit loss\nprovisions were $1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, while there was a release of allowance for credit losses of $0.2 million for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase in credit loss provisions is the result of an increase in the required reserve calculated by the\npooled loan analysis, which was partially offset by lower calculated reserves of the individually analyzed loans.\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. Three Months Ended September 30, 2023\nTotal loans decreased $35.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a decrease of $42.0 million in the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The decline in loan balances compared to the prior quarters primarily reflects the amortization of the loan portfolio and the Bank’s\npurposeful effort to improve the overall strength of the loan portfolio through selective originations. The commercial loan portfolio decreased by $34.0 million\nduring the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to an increase of $5.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023, while the\nresidential mortgage loan portfolio increased by $0.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a $23.8 million decrease\nduring the three months ended September 30, 2023. Additionally, our consumer loan portfolio decreased by $2.3 million during the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, while it decreased by $21.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net charge-offs totaled $0.7 million and $5.9 million\nduring the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nTotal loans decreased $146.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus a decrease of $102.2 million in the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The commercial loan portfolio decreased by $121.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a decrease\nof $37.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, while the residential mortgage loan portfolio decreased by $15.9 million during the nine months\nended September 30, 2024, while increasing by $40.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Additionally, our consumer loan portfolio\ndecreased by $7.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, while it decreased by $101.2 million in the nine months ended September 30,\n2023. In addition, net charge-offs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled $2.9 million compared to net charge-offs of $8.8 million in the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023.\nNoninterest Income\nPayment card and service charge income, consulting compliance income, equity method investment income or loss and gains on sale of loans generally account\nfor the majority of our noninterest income. From time to time, we also recognize gains or losses on acquisition and divestiture activity, sales of assets or our\ninvestment portfolio.\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. Three Months Ended September 30, 2023\nNoninterest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 totaled $6.7 million and $5.8 million, respectively. The increase in noninterest\nincome for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily the result of equity method\ninvestment income from our mortgage segment of $0.7 million, as compared to a loss of $0.8 million in the prior year period, and an increase of $1.0 million in\npayment card and service charge income. These increases were partially offset by a decline in other operating income of $1.6 million.\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nNoninterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 totaled $21.6 million and $15.3 million, respectively. The increase in noninterest\nincome for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily the result of a $2.5 million\nincrease in payment card and service charge income and a $0.7 million gain on sale of available-for-sale securities, compared to a $1.5 million loss during the\nprior year period. There were also losses of $1.0 million on divestiture activity and $1.0 million on the sale of loans for the nine months ended September 30,\n2023, without corresponding losses in the current period. These increases were partially offset by a decline in other operating income of $1.5 million.\n60\nNoninterest Expense\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. Three Months Ended September 30, 2023\nNoninterest expense was $29.5 million and $30.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decline from the prior\nperiod primarily reflects declines of $1.0 million in professional fees and $0.9 million in other operating expenses, partially offset by an increase in salaries and\nemployee benefits of $0.7 million. Approximately 56.7% and 52.1% of noninterest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively, was related to personnel costs. Personnel costs are a significant part of our noninterest expense as such costs are critical to financial services\norganizations.\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nNoninterest expense was $88.6 million and $89.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decline from the prior year\nperiod primarily reflects declines of $3.2 million in other operating expenses, $0.8 million in equipment depreciation and maintenance and $0.7 million in\ntravel, entertainment, dues and subscriptions. These declines were partially offset by an increase in professional fees of $3.0 million, incurred to enhance our\nrisk management and compliance-related infrastructure, and an increase in salaries and employee benefits of $0.7 million. Approximately 55.5% and 54.3% of\nnoninterest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, was related to personnel costs. Personnel costs are a significant part\nof our noninterest expense, as such costs are critical to financial services organizations.\nReturn on Assets and Equity\nAssets\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. Three Months Ended September 30, 2023\nOur return on average assets was 0.3% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.5% for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The\ndecreased return in the three months ended September 30, 2024 is the result of a $1.8 million decrease in earnings, while average total assets decreased by\n$107.3 million, mainly as the result of a $82.8 million decrease in average interest-bearing balances with banks, a $40.2 million decrease in average\ncommercial loans and a $26.7 million decrease in average consumer loans.\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nOur return on average assets was 0.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The\ndecreased return for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is the result of a $12.7 million decrease in earnings, while average total assets decreased by\n$35.3 million, mainly the result of a $47.0 million decrease in average consumer loans, a $30.1 million decrease in average real estate loans and a $24.2 million\ndecrease in average commercial loans, offset by a $38.5 million increase in average interest-bearing deposits with banks.\nEquity\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. Three Months Ended September 30, 2023\nOur return on average stockholders’ equity was 2.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 5.8% for the three months ended September\n30, 2023. The decreased return in the three months ended September 30, 2024 is a result of a $1.8 million decrease in earnings, while average equity increased\nby $28.4 million.\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nOur return on average stockholders’ equity was 4.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 11.4% for the nine months ended September\n30, 2023. The decreased return for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is a result of a $12.7 million decrease in earnings, while average equity\nincreased by $17.7 million.\n61\nStatement of Financial Condition\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents totaled $610.9 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $398.2 million at December 31, 2023. We believe the current balance of\ncash and cash equivalents adequately serves our liquidity and performance needs. Total cash and cash equivalents fluctuate daily due to transactions in process\nand other liquidity demands.\nInvestment Securities\nInvestment securities, including equity securities, totaled $416.6 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $386.4 million at December 31, 2023. The\nfollowing table presents a summary of the investment securities portfolio as of the periods shown. The available-for-sale securities are reported at estimated fair\nvalue.\n(Dollars in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nAvailable-for-sale securities:\nUnited States government agency securities $ 41,637 $ 38,408\nUnited States sponsored mortgage-backed securities 107,278 82,382\nUnited States treasury securities 103,241 100,356\nMunicipal securities 105,972 106,907\nCorporate debt securities 8,451 8,942\nOther debt securities 7,500 7,500\nOther securities 749 780\nInvestment securities available-for-sale $ 374,828 $ 345,275\nEquity securities $ 41,760 $ 41,086\nManagement monitors the earnings performance and liquidity of the investment portfolio on a regular basis through the Asset and Liability Committee\n(“ALCO”) meetings. The ALCO also monitors net interest income and assists in the management of interest rate risk. Through active balance sheet\nmanagement and analysis of the investment securities portfolio, sufficient liquidity is maintained to satisfy depositor requirements and the various credit needs\nof our customers. Management believes the risk characteristics inherent in the investment portfolio are acceptable based on these parameters.\nOur equity securities primarily consist of investments in private entities within the Fintech industry and these investments may not be as liquid as our\ninvestments in other types of securities.\nLoans\nOur loan portfolio totaled $2.17 billion as of September 30, 2024 and $2.32 billion as of December 31, 2023. The Bank’s lending is primarily focused in North\nCentral West Virginia, Northern Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina. The portfolio consists principally of commercial lending, retail lending, which\nincludes single-family residential mortgages, and consumer lending.\nFor more information regarding our loans, see Note 3 – Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses accompanying the consolidated financial statements included\nelsewhere in this report.\n62\nLoan Concentration\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, commercial and non-residential real estate loans comprised the largest component of the loan portfolio. A large\nportion of commercial loans are secured by real estate and are diverse in terms of geographical location and industry. Loans that are not secured by real estate\nare typically secured by accounts receivable, mortgages or equipment. While the loan concentration is in commercial loans, the commercial portfolio is\ncomprised of loans to many different borrowers in numerous different industries, generally located in our primary market areas. Additionally, within the\ncommercial portfolio, loans within the healthcare industry, which include loans to physicians, nursing homes and pharmacies, represent 22% of our total loan\nportfolio as of September 30, 2024.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe ACL was $21.5 million, or 0.99% of loans receivable, at September 30, 2024, compared to $22.1 million, or 0.95% of loans receivable, at December 31,\n2023. Over the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the ACL was impacted by an increase in provision needed for individually analyzed loans of $1.8\nmillion. Additionally, over the nine months ended September 30, 2024, changes to the loan portfolio balances, qualitative factor adjustments and expected loss\nforecasts within the expected credit loss calculation resulted in allowance decreases of $1.6 million to both the consumer segment, which includes the subprime\nautomotive portfolio, and the commercial and industrial segment. This decrease was offset by an increase of $0.7 million in allowance required by the\nresidential segment. The commercial real estate, commercial acquisition, development and construction and home equity line of credit segments required a total\nof $0.1 million of additional allowance over the same period. Bank management expects that the markets in which it lends will experience economic\nimprovements over the next one to two years, and most decreases in estimated loss rates have been further supported by decreases in loan balances in the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024. This results in marginally lower allocation rates against slightly lower loan balances, resulting in an overall lower\nallowance needed for the pooled loan portfolio. However, this has been partially offset by the increase in allowance needed by the individually analyzed loans\nand net-charge-offs. Net charge-offs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 included $0.4 million related to five U.S. Small Business Administration\nloans secured by business assets and $1.0 million related to the subprime consumer automotive segment.\nManagement continually monitors the risk in the loan portfolio by reviewing of the monthly delinquency reports and the Loan Review Committee. The Loan\nReview Committee is responsible for determining the adequacy of the ACL. This analysis involves the portfolio's experience to date and the makeup of the\noverall portfolio. Specific loss estimates are derived for individual loans based on specific criteria such as current delinquent status, related deposit account\nactivity, where applicable, and changes in the local and national economy. When appropriate, we also consider public knowledge and verifiable information\nfrom the local market to assess risks to specific loans and the loan portfolios as a whole.\nFunding Sources\nThe Bank considers a number of alternatives including, but not limited to, deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term borrowings, when evaluating funding\nsources. Deposits remain the most significant source of funds, totaling $3.00 billion, or 97.4% of funding sources at September 30, 2024. This same\ninformation at December 31, 2023 reflected $2.90 billion in deposits representing 97.1% of funding sources. Borrowings, consisting of subordinated debt,\nFHLB and other borrowings represented 2.4% of funding sources at September 30, 2024, versus 2.7% at December 31, 2023. Repurchase agreements, which\nare available to large corporate customers, represented 0.2% of funding sources at September 30, 2024 and 0.2% at December 31, 2023.\nAt September 30, 2024, noninterest-bearing balances totaled $989.1 million, compared to $1.20 billion at December 31, 2023, or 33.0% and 41.3%,\nrespectively, of total deposits. Interest-bearing deposits totaled $2.01 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to $1.70 billion at December 31, 2023.\n63\nThe following table presents the balance of each of the deposit categories as of the periods shown:\n(Dollars in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nDeposits:\nNoninterest-bearing demand $ 989,144 $ 1,197,272\nNOW 615,236 538,444\nSavings and money markets 542,227 571,299\nTime deposits, including CDs and IRAs 855,041 594,461\nTotal deposits $ 3,001,648 $ 2,901,476\nTime deposits that meet or exceed the FDIC insurance limit $ 2,703 $ 3,150\nAverage interest-bearing deposits were $1.89 billion during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $1.96 billion during the same time period\nin 2023 and average noninterest-bearing deposits were $910.79 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $975.2 million during\nthe same time period in 2023.\nAverage interest-bearing deposits were $1.81 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $1.83 billion during the same time period\nin 2023 and average noninterest-bearing deposits were $1.11 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $1.11 billion during the\nsame time period in 2023.\nThe decrease in noninterest bearing deposits is primarily related to our decision to exit the digital asset program. Digital asset program account balances\ndeclined $163.2 million as compared to December 31, 2023.\nWe utilize a custodial deposit transference structure for certain deposit programs whereby we, acting as custodian of account holder funds, place a portion of\nsuch account holder funds that are not needed to support near term settlement at one or more third-party banks insured by the FDIC (each, a program bank).\nAccounts opened at program banks are established in our name as custodian, for the benefit of our account holders. We remain the issuer of all accounts under\nthe applicable account holder agreements and have sole custodial control and transaction authority over the accounts opened at program banks. We maintain the\nrecords of each account holder's deposits maintained at program banks. Program banks undergo robust due diligence prior to becoming a program bank and are\nalso subject to continuous monitoring. These off-balance sheet deposits totaled $1.4 billion at September 30, 2024 and $1.1 billion at December 31, 2023 and\nrepresent the gaming and banking-as-a-service industries.\nAlong with traditional deposits, the Bank has access to both short-term borrowings from FHLB, Federal Reserve Bank and overnight repurchase agreements to\nfund its operations and investments. For details on our borrowings, refer to Note 7 – Borrowed Funds accompanying the consolidated financial statements\nincluded elsewhere in this report.\nDeposit Concentration\nThree of our primary deposit verticals are payments, gaming and banking-as-a-service, with such deposits totaling $504.9 million, $391.4 million and $219.1\nmillion as of September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to $449.8 million, $354.1 million and $251.6 million as of December 31, 2023, respectively. Of the\ngaming deposits, $370.1 million is with our three largest gaming clients at September 30, 2024.\nCapital Resources\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, stockholders’ equity increased $13.7 million to $303.2 million. This increase primarily consists of net\nincome of $10.7 million, other comprehensive income of $6.4 million, common stock options exercised of $1.2 million and stock based compensation of $2.5\nmillion, offset by cash dividends paid of $6.5 million.\nThe growth in assets of $104.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 outpaced the growth in stockholders' equity, and the equity to assets ratio\nincreased from 8.7% at December 31, 2023 to 8.9% at September 30, 2024. We paid dividends to common shareholders of $6.5 million and $6.5 million in the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, compared to earnings of $10.7 million and $23.3 million in the nine months ended September\n30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, resulting in the dividend payout ratio increasing to 61.7% in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 27.7% in the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023.\n64\nWe and the Bank are also subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital\nrequirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a material effect on our\nconsolidated financial statements. The Bank is required to comply with applicable capital adequacy standards established by the federal banking agencies. West\nVirginia state chartered banks, such as the Bank, are subject to similar capital requirements adopted by the West Virginia Division of Financial Institutions.\nBank regulators have established “risk-based” capital requirements designed to measure capital adequacy. Risk-based capital ratios reflect the relative risks of\nvarious assets companies hold in their portfolios. A weight category of 0% (lowest risk assets), 20%, 50%, 100% or 150% (highest risk assets) is assigned to\neach asset on the balance sheet. Detailed information concerning our risk-based capital ratios can be found in Supervision and Regulation in Item 1, Business\nand Note 16 – Regulatory Capital Requirements to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of\nthe 2023 Form 10-K.\nThe optional community bank leverage ratio (“CBLR”) framework, which is issued through interagency guidance, intends to provide a simple alternative\nmeasure of capital adequacy for electing qualifying depository institutions as directed under the EGRRCPA. Under the CBLR, if a qualifying depository\ninstitution elects to use such measure, such institutions will be considered well capitalized if its ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets (i.e.,\nleverage ratio) exceeds a 9% threshold, subject to a limited two quarter grace period, during which the leverage ratio cannot go 100 basis points below the then\napplicable threshold, and will not be required to calculate and report risk-based capital ratios.\nThe Bank elected to begin using the CBLR for the first quarter of 2021 and intends to utilize this measure for the foreseeable future. Eligibility criteria to\nutilize the CBLR include the following:\n● Total assets of less than $10 billion;\n● Total trading assets plus liabilities of 5% or less of consolidated assets;\n● Total off-balance sheet exposures of 25% or less of consolidated assets;\n● Cannot be an advanced approaches banking organization; and\n● Leverage ratio greater than 9%.\nThe Bank's CBLR at September 30, 2024 was 10.9%, which is above the minimum requirement of 9%. Management believes that capital continues to provide\na strong base for profitable growth.\nLiquidity\nMaintenance of a sufficient level of liquidity is a primary objective of the ALCO. Liquidity, as defined by the ALCO, is the ability to meet anticipated operating\ncash needs, loan demand and deposit withdrawals without incurring a sustained negative impact on net interest income. It is our policy to optimize the funding\nof the balance sheet, continually balancing the stability and cost factors of various funding sources. We believe liquidity needs are satisfied by the current\nbalance of cash and cash equivalents, readily available access to traditional and non-traditional funding sources and the portions of the investment and loan\nportfolios that mature within one year. Our liquid assets totaled $645.0 million as of September 30, 2024. These sources of funds should enable us to meet cash\nobligations as they come due.\nThe main source of liquidity for the Bank comes through deposit growth. Liquidity is also provided from cash generated from investment maturities, principal\npayments from loans and income from loans and investment securities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash from operating, investing and\nfinancing activities totaled $10.3 million, $114.9 million and $87.5 million, respectively. Significant changes in cash flows during the quarter included inflows\nfrom the net change in loans of $141.0 million, the net change in deposits of $100.2 million and sales of available-for-sale investment securities of $24.3\nmillion, partially offset by an outflow of $58.0 million to purchase available-for-sale investment securities.\nWhen appropriate, the Bank has the ability to take advantage of external sources of funds such as advances from the FHLB, national market certificate of\ndeposit issuance programs, the Federal Reserve discount window, brokered deposits and Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Services. These external\nsources often provide attractive interest rates and flexible maturity dates that enable the Bank to match funding with the contractual maturity dates of assets.\nSecurities in the investment portfolio are classified as available-for-sale and can be utilized as an additional source of liquidity.\nWe have an effective shelf registration covering $75 million of debt and equity securities, all of which is available, subject to authorization from the Board of\nDirectors and market conditions, to issue debt or equity securities at our discretion. While we seek to preserve flexibility with respect to cash requirements,\nthere can be no assurance that market conditions would permit us to sell securities on acceptable terms or at all.\n65\nCurrent Economic Conditions\nWe consider North Central West Virginia and Northern Virginia to be our primary market areas for CoRe banking services. We consider our Fintech banking\nmarket to be customers located throughout the entire United States.\nWe believe that the current economic climate in our primary market areas reflects economic climates that are consistent with the general national economic\nclimate. Unemployment in the United States was 3.9% for September 2024 and 3.8% for September 2023.\nSupervision and Regulation\nIn July 2024, the Board of Directors of the FDIC approved a notice of proposed rulemaking (the \"NPR\"), requesting public comment on proposed revisions to\nits regulations relating to brokered deposits. The proposed rules set forth in the NPR would, in part, revise the \"deposit broker\" definition and amend the\nanalysis of the \"primary purpose\" exception. The NPR also proposes to eliminate the \"exclusive deposit placement arrangement exception,\" as well as make\nchanges to the notice and application process for the primary purpose exception. The proposed rules would also clarify when an insured depository institution\ncan regain status as an \"agent institution\" under the limited exception for a capped amount of reciprocal deposits.\nElimination of the \"exclusive deposit placement arrangement exception\" as proposed in the NPR would require the Bank to reevaluate its current classification\nof certain BaaS deposit and could require the Bank to reclassify those as brokered deposits. We may also be required to reclassify certain BaaS deposits as\nbrokered deposits if the FDIC were to conclude under the existing framework that such deposits should be classified as brokered deposits. The Bank will\ncontinue to monitor regulatory guidance on the treatment of deposits in light of the proposed NPR and application of the existing brokered deposit framework\nby regulators.\nWe provide additional information on our Supervision and Regulation in our 2023 Form 10-K under “Part I, Item 1. Business—Supervision and Regulation.”\nCommitments and Contingent Liabilities\nIn the ordinary course of business, we offer financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk to meet our customers' financing needs. These financial\ninstruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest\nrate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the statements of financial condition.\nOur exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit and standby letters\nof credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. We use the same credit policies when making commitments and conditional obligations\nas we do for on-balance-sheet instruments.\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments\ngenerally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire\nwithout being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We evaluate each customer’s creditworthiness\non a case-by-case basis. The amount and type of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by us upon extension of credit, varies and is based on management’s\ncredit evaluation of the customer.\nStandby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee a customer's performance to a third-party. Standby letters of credit generally\nhave fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the\nsame as that involved in extending loans to customers. Our policy for obtaining collateral and the nature of such collateral is substantially the same as that\ninvolved in making commitments to extend credit.\n66\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nWe grant a majority of our commercial, financial, agricultural, real estate and installment loans to customers throughout the North Central West Virginia and\nNorthern Virginia markets. Collateral for loans is primarily residential and commercial real estate, personal property and business equipment. We evaluate the\ncreditworthiness of each of our customers on a case-by-case basis and the amount of collateral they obtain is based on management’s credit evaluation.\nContingent Liability\nThe Bank is involved in various legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management and counsel, the outcome of these\nmatters will not have a significant adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Commitments\nThe Bank has entered into certain agreements that represent off-balance sheet arrangements that could significantly impact the consolidated financial\nstatements and could have a significant impact in future periods. Specifically, the Bank has entered into agreements to extend credit or provide conditional\npayments pursuant to standby and commercial letters of credit. In addition, the Bank utilizes letters of credit issued by the FHLB to collateralize certain public\nfunds deposits.\nCommitments to extend credit, including loan commitments, standby letters of credit and commercial letters of credit do not necessarily represent future cash\nrequirements, as these commitments often expire without being drawn upon.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to use judgment in making\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of\nrevenue and expenses.\nThere have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates or in the underlying accounting assumptions and estimates used in\nthese critical accounting policies from those disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes contained in the 2023 Form 10-K.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements and Developments\nRecent accounting pronouncements and developments applicable us are described further in Note 1 – Nature of Operations and Basis of Presentation\naccompanying the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nItem 3 – Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur market risk is composed primarily of interest rate risk. The ALCO is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position and establishing policies\nto monitor and coordinate our sources, uses and pricing of funds.\nThe objective of the asset/liability management function is to structure the balance sheet in ways that maintain consistent growth in net interest income and\nminimize exposure to market risks within our policy guidelines. This objective is accomplished by managing balance sheet liquidity and interest rate risk\nexposure based on changes in economic conditions, interest rate levels and customer preferences. We manage balance sheet liquidity through the investment\nportfolio, sales of commercial and residential real estate loans and through the utilization of diversified funding sources, including retail deposits, a variety of\nwholesale funding sources and borrowings through the FHLB. Interest rate risk is managed through the use of interest rate caps, commercial loan swap\ntransactions, interest rate lock commitments on mortgage loans held-for-sale and the structuring of loan terms that provide cash flows to be consistently re-\ninvested along the rate cycle.\nWe believe that accepting some level of interest rate risk is necessary to achieve realistic profit goals. Management and our Board of Directors have chosen an\ninterest rate risk profile that is consistent with our strategic business plan. While management carefully monitors the exposure to changes in interest rates and\ntakes actions as warranted to decrease any adverse impact, there can be no assurance about the actual effect of interest rate changes on net interest income.\n67\nCredit Risk\nWe have counter-party risk which may arise from the possible inability of third-party investors to meet the terms of their forward sales contracts, including\nderivative contracts such as interest rate swaps and fair value hedges. We work with third-party investors that are generally well-capitalized, are investment\ngrade and exhibit strong financial performance to mitigate this risk. We monitor the financial condition of these third parties on an annual basis and we do not\ncurrently expect these third parties to fail to meet their obligations.\nItem 4 – Controls and Procedures\nAs of September 30, 2024, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer\nand Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)\nof the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"). Based on the results of this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and\n15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n68\nPART II – OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1 – Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time in the ordinary course of business, we and our subsidiaries may be subject to claims, asserted or unasserted, or named as a party to lawsuits\nor investigations. Litigation, in general, and intellectual property and securities litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive to normal business\noperations. Moreover, the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with any certainty, and in the case of more complex legal proceedings, the results can\nbe difficult to predict. We are not aware of any material pending legal proceedings to which we or any of our subsidiaries is a party or of which any of their\nproperty is the subject.\nItem 1A – Risk Factors\nOur operations are subject to many risks that could adversely affect our future financial condition and performance, including the risk factors that are described\nin the 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed.\nItem 2 – Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nNone.\nItem 3 – Defaults Upon Senior Securities\nNone.\nItem 4 – Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\nItem 5 – Other Information\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, none of our directors or officers adopted or terminated a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule\n10b5-1 trading arrangement, as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.\nItem 6 – Exhibits\nExhibit Number Description Exhibit Location\nCertificate of principal executive officer pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-\nExhibit 31.1 Filed herewith\nOxley Act of 2002\nCertificate of principal financial officer pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-\nExhibit 31.2 Filed herewith\nOxley Act of 2002\nCertificate of principal executive officer pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-\nExhibit 32.1 Filed herewith\nOxley Act of 2002\nCertificate of principal financial officer pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-\nExhibit 32.2 Filed herewith\nOxley Act of 2002\nExhibit 101.INS XBRL Instance Document Filed herewith\nExhibit 101.SCH XBRL Taxonomy Extension Schema Filed herewith\nExhibit 101.CAL XBRL Taxonomy Extension Calculation Linkbase Filed herewith\nExhibit 101.DEF XBRL Taxonomy Extension Definition Linkbase Filed herewith\nExhibit 101.LAB XBRL Taxonomy Extension Label Linkbase Filed herewith\nExhibit 101.PRE XBRL Taxonomy Extension Presentation Linkbase Filed herewith\nCover Page Interactive Data File (formatted as Inline XBRL and contained in\nExhibit 104 Filed herewith\nExhibit 101)\n69\nSIGNATURES\nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned,\nthereunto duly authorized.\nMVB Financial Corp.\nDate: November 5, 2024 By: /s/ Larry F.

          "content": "Forward-Looking Statements\nMVB Financial Corp. (“MVB” or the “Company”) has made forward-looking statements, within the meaning of Section 27A of the\nSecurities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, in this presentation that are\nintended to be covered by the protections provided under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking\nstatements are based on current expectations about the future and subject to risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements\ninclude, without limitation, information concerning possible or assumed future results of operations of the Company and its\nsubsidiaries. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as “may,” “could,” “should,”, “would,” “will,” “plans,”\n“believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “continues,” or the negative of those terms or similar expressions. Note that\nmany factors could affect the future financial results of the Company and its subsidiaries, both individually and collectively, and could\ncause those results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Those factors include but are not limited to:\nmarket, economic, operational, liquidity, credit, and interest rate risk; changes in interest rates; inability to successfully execute business\nplans, including strategies related to investments in financial technology companies; competition; length and severity of the COVID-19\npandemic and its impact on the Company’s business and financial condition; changes in economic, business and political conditions;\nchanges in demand for loan products and deposit flow; operational risks and risk management failures; and government regulation and\nsupervision. Further, we urge you to carefully review and consider the cautionary statements and disclosures, specifically those made in\nPart I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the “2023 Form 10-K”), filed\nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") on March 13, 2024, and from time to time, in our other filings with the SEC.\nReaders are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of the stated\nreport. Except to the extent required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements in order to reflect\nany event or circumstance occurring after the date of this report or currently unknown facts or conditions or the occurrence of\nunanticipated events. All forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.\nAccounting standards require the consideration of subsequent events occurring after the balance sheet date for matters that require\nadjustment to, or disclosure in, the consolidated financial statements. The review period for subsequent events extends up to and\nincluding the filing date of a public company’s financial statements when filed with the SEC. Accordingly, the consolidated financial\ninformation in this announcement is subject to change.\nThe Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as tangible book value per share and tangible common equity to tangible\nassets, to provide information useful to investors in understanding the Company’s operating performance and trends and to facilitate\ncomparisons with the performance of the Company’s peers. The non-GAAP financial measures used may differ from the non-GAAP\nfinancial measures other financial institutions use to measure their results of operations. Non-GAAP financial measures should be\nviewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company’s reported results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nReconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures are provided in the\nAppendix to this Presentation.\n2\nDriving on a Wet Track with the Caution Flag Out:\nAdapting to the Wet Track\n3\nMVB’s Strategy on a Page (SOAP)\nOur Why Purpose\nTo positively impact people’s financial Trusted partners on the financial\nlives, one life at a time frontier, committed to your success\nRespect, Love & Caring Trust Commitment Adaptive Teamwork\nBanking That’s Tech-Forward Banker of Choice to Fintechs Builder of Fintechs Backer of Fintechs\nCoRe Lending &\nVictor Banking as a Service Gaming Payments\nDeposits\nCompliance and Client and Partner Operational\nStrategic M&A Talent and Culture\nRisk Management Relationships Excellence\n4\n4\nKey Connection Points Across the MVB Strategy\nGrowth Vehicle(s) What is the Connection?
