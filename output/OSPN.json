(NASDAQ: OSPN) announced a new integration with [Ping Identity](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pingidentity.com%2Fen.html&esheet=54154644&newsitemid=20241119822839&lan=en-US&anchor=Ping+Identity&index=1&md5=d0f17c9c4df0769c05accb588fc8405c), a leader in securing digital identities for the world's largest enterprises, now listed on the Ping Identity Integration Directory. Through this strategic partnership, Ping Identity will now offer [OneSpan’s FIDO-enabled](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.onespan.com%2Fproducts%2Fdigipass-fx-authenticators&esheet=54154644&newsitemid=20241119822839&lan=en-US&anchor=OneSpan%26%238217%3Bs+FIDO-enabled&index=2&md5=6086e697d571836a4eeb2c973880f392) solutions to eliminate passwords and benefit from stronger authentication. \n\nOneSpan joins a growing list of technology partners developing integrations through the Ping Identity [Global Technology Partner Program](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pingidentity.com%2Fen%2Fcompany%2Fpartners.html&esheet=54154644&newsitemid=20241119822839&lan=en-US&anchor=Global+Technology+Partner+Program&index=3&md5=a0a23235d4a4aaaa8471c3b4e9ccc3b0). Partner solutions built on the Ping Identity Platform are helping organizations compete in a new digital era where user experience is increasingly important, and security cannot be sacrificed. \n\n“OneSpan is excited to join forces with Ping Identity to enhance the security landscape by delivering the most secure and user-friendly authentication solutions that protect our customers against today’s evolving cyber threats,” said Giovanni Verhaeghe, Senior Vice President of Corporate and Business Development at OneSpan. “By partnering with Ping Identity, we’re making it easier for organizations to leverage high assurance hardware-based authentication with Ping Identity’s market-leading identity management solutions.” \n\nAccording to Gartner1, “IAM leaders should migrate to passwordless methods wherever they can, and as soon as they can, to enhance security and optimize UX.” In response to this recommendation, our joint partnership enables customers to leverage the combined strengths of OneSpan’s DIGIPASS authentication solutions and Ping Identity’s IAM solutions. OneSpan’s [DIGIPASS FX](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.onespan.com%2Fproducts%2Fdigipass-fx-authenticators&esheet=54154644&newsitemid=20241119822839&lan=en-US&anchor=DIGIPASS+FX&index=4&md5=b7cebbb268da9e92afef1a0a8db15816) solutions are FIDO2-certified, phishing-resistant passkeys that enable passwordless authentication, significantly reducing human error risk. Designed with user privacy in mind, the FIDO protocol uses a private and public key pair system. This prevents private keys and biometric data from leaving the device. It eliminates the vulnerabilities associated with human error, such as phishing and password reuse, and provides superior protection compared to code-based verifications like SMS and one-time passwords. \n\n“Ping Identity is committed to expanding our technology partner ecosystem to enhance digital customer experiences across the entire user journey,” said Loren Russon, the SVP of product management at Ping Identity. \"Our collaboration with OneSpan makes integration seamless for customers to quickly benefit from the robust PingOne Cloud Platform.” \n\nFor more information on OneSpan’s work with Ping Identity visit [here](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.pingidentity.com%2Fs%2Fdirectory-profile%2Fa7hUJ000000SSNxYAO%2Fonespan&esheet=54154644&newsitemid=20241119822839&lan=en-US&anchor=here&index=5&md5=4ee8eafae8deafcff599ad2b82cfa481). \n\n**About OneSpan**\n\nOneSpan provides security, identity, electronic signature, and digital workflow solutions that protect and facilitate digital transactions and agreements.

(NASDAQ: OSPN) today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\n“We reported another strong quarter of subscription growth, profitability and cash generation driven by our team’s hard work and operational focus,” stated OneSpan CEO, Victor Limongelli. “The OneSpan team has done a tremendous job in delivering value to our customers while increasing our profitability. We are now much better positioned to drive efficient revenue growth over the long-term.” \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * **Total revenue** was $56.2 million, a decrease of 4% compared to $58.8 million for the same quarter of 2023. Digital Agreements revenue was $15.4 million, an increase of 18% year-over-year. Security Solutions revenue was $40.8 million, a decrease of 11% year-over-year. \n  * **ARR** increased 9% year-over-year to $163.9 million. \n  * **Gross profit** was $41.5 million, or 74% gross margin, compared to $40.7 million, or 69% in the same period last year. \n  * **Operating income** was $11.3 million, compared to operating loss of $4.8 million in the same period last year. \n  * **Net income** was $8.3 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $4.1 million, or $(0.10) per diluted share, in the same period last year.

The Company is affirming its ARR guidance and is increasing its Adjusted EBITDA guidance to reflect stronger than originally anticipated operating leverage driven by improved execution of its cost savings initiatives. \n\nMore specifically, for the Full Year 2024, OneSpan expects: \n\n  * Revenue to be in the range of $238 million to $242 million, as compared to its previous guidance range of $238 million to $246 million. \n  * ARR to finish the year in the range of $166 million to $170 million. \n  * Adjusted EBITDAto be in the range of $65 million to $67 million, as compared to its previous guidance range of $55 million to $59 million. \n\n\n\n**Conference Call Details**\n\nIn conjunction with this announcement, OneSpan Inc. will host a conference call today, October 30, 2024, at 4:30 p.m. ET.

Shortly after the conclusion of the call, a replay of the webcast will be available on the same website for approximately one year. \n\n____________________________________________ \n\n  1. ARR is calculated as the approximate annualized value of our customer recurring contracts as of the measurement date. These include subscription, term-based license, and maintenance and support contracts and exclude one-time fees. To the extent that we are negotiating a renewal with a customer within 90 days after the expiration of a recurring contract, we continue to include that revenue in ARR if we are actively in discussion with the customer for a new recurring contract or renewal and the customer has not notified us of an intention to not renew. See our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 for additional information describing how we define ARR, including how ARR differs from GAAP revenue. \n  2. NRR is defined as the approximate year-over-year growth in ARR from the same set of customers at the end of the prior year period. \n  3. An explanation of the use of Non-GAAP financial measures is included below under the heading “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” A reconciliation of each Non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure has also been provided in the tables below. We are not providing a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA guidance to GAAP net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, because we are unable to predict certain items included in GAAP net income without unreasonable efforts. \n\n\n\n**About OneSpan**\n\nOneSpan provides security, identity, electronic signature (“e-signature”) and digital workflow solutions that protect and facilitate digital transactions and agreements.

These solutions, which are largely cloud-based, include OneSpan Sign e-signature, OneSpan Notary, and Identity Verification. This segment also includes costs attributable to our transaction cloud platform. \n  * **Security Solutions**. Security Solutions consists of our broad portfolio of software products, software development kits (SDKs) and Digipass authenticator devices that are used to build applications designed to defend against attacks on digital transactions across online environments, devices, and applications. The software products and SDKs included in the Security Solutions segment are largely on-premises software products and include multi-factor authentication and transaction signing solutions, such as mobile application security and mobile software tokens. \n\n\n\nSegment operating income consists of the revenues generated by a segment, less the direct costs of revenue, sales and marketing, research and development expenses, amortization expense, and restructuring and other related charges that are incurred directly by a segment. Unallocated corporate costs include costs related to administrative functions that are performed in a centralized manner that are not attributable to a particular segment. \n\n**_Segment and consolidated operating results (unaudited):_**\n\n**Three Months Ended****September 30 ,** |  **Nine Months Ended****September 30 ,**  \n---|---  \n_(In thousands, except percentages)_ |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \n**Digital Agreements**  \nRevenue  |  $  |  15,405  |  $  |  13,012  |  $  |  45,280  |  $  |  36,426   \nGross profit (1)  |  $  |  11,031  |  $  |  9,808  |  $  |  30,664  |  $  |  26,839   \nGross margin  |  72  |  %  |  75  |  %  |  68  |  %  |  74  |  %   \nOperating income (loss) (2)  |  $  |  3,419  |  $  |  (4,666  |  )  |  $  |  3,000  |  $  |  (17,820  |  )   \n**Security Solutions**  \nRevenue  |  $  |  40,837  |  $  |  45,826  |  $  |  136,728  |  $  |  135,752   \nGross profit (3)  |  $  |  30,517  |  $  |  30,861  |  $  |  98,620  |  $  |  87,410   \nGross margin  |  75  |  %  |  67  |  %  |  72  |  %  |  64  |  %   \nOperating income (4)  |  $  |  20,200  |  $  |  15,673  |  $  |  66,770  |  $  |  39,827   \n**Total Company :**  \nRevenue  |  $  |  56,242  |  $  |  58,838  |  $  |  182,008  |  $  |  172,178   \nGross profit  |  $  |  41,548  |  $  |  40,669  |  $  |  129,284  |  $  |  114,249   \nGross margin  |  74  |  %  |  69  |  %  |  71  |  %  |  66  |  %   \n**Statements of Operations reconciliation:**  \nSegment operating income  |  $  |  23,619  |  $  |  11,007  |  $  |  69,770  |  $  |  22,007   \nCorporate operating expenses not allocated at the segment level  |  12,367  |  15,801  |  36,771  |  52,695   \nOperating income (loss)  |  $  |  11,252  |  $  |  (4,794  |  )  |  $  |  32,999  |  $  |  (30,688  |  )   \nInterest income, net  |  624  |  587  |  1,246  |  1,675   \nOther income (expense), net  |  (1,915  |  )  |  353  |  (1,293  |  )  |  342   \nIncome (loss) before income taxes  |  $  |  9,961  |  $  |  (3,854  |  )  |  $  |  32,952  |  $  |  (28,671  |  )   \n  \n(1)  |  Digital Agreements gross profit includes intangible asset write-off of $0.8 million and internal capitalized software write-off of $0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.   \n---|---  \n(2)  |  Digital Agreements operating income (loss) includes $0.6 million and $1.9 million of amortization of intangible assets expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and $0.6 million and $1.7 million of amortization of intangible assets expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.   \n(3)  |  Security Solutions gross profit includes $1.6 million of inventory impairments related to discontinuation of investments in our Digipass CX product for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.   \n(4)  |  Security Solutions operating income includes $1.6 million of inventory impairments and $1.4 million of capitalized software write-offs related to discontinuation of investments in our Digipass CX product for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 _._  \n  \n**_Revenue by major products and services (unaudited):_**\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n---  \n**2024** |  **2023**  \n_(In thousands)_ |  **Digital** **Agreements** |  **Security** **Solutions** |  **Digital** **Agreements** |  **Security** **Solutions**  \nSubscription  |  $  |  15,045  |  $  |  18,603  |  $  |  11,807  |  $  |  14,378   \nMaintenance and support  |  327  |  9,317  |  995  |  11,276   \nProfessional services and other (1)  |  33  |  820  |  210  |  1,333   \nHardware products  |  —  |  12,097  |  —  |  18,839   \nTotal Revenue  |  $  |  15,405  |  $  |  40,837  |  $  |  13,012  |  $  |  45,826   \n**Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n**2024** |  **2023**  \n_(In thousands)_ |  **Digital** **Agreements** |  **Security** **Solutions** |  **Digital** **Agreements** |  **Security** **Solutions**  \nSubscription  |  $  |  43,641  |  $  |  59,642  |  $  |  32,641  |  $  |  46,485   \nMaintenance and support  |  1,321  |  29,125  |  3,121  |  31,914   \nProfessional services and other (1)  |  318  |  3,548  |  664  |  4,002   \nHardware products  |  —  |  44,413  |  —  |  53,351   \nTotal Revenue  |  $  |  45,280  |  $  |  136,728  |  $  |  36,426  |  $  |  135,752   \n  \n(1) |  Professional services and other includes perpetual software licenses revenue, which was less than 1% of total revenue for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and approximately 1% of total revenue for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.   \n---|---  \n  \n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nWe report financial results in accordance with GAAP. We also evaluate our performance using certain Non-GAAP financial metrics, namely Adjusted EBITDA, Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) and Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) Per Diluted Share. Our management believes that these measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial metrics, provide useful supplemental information regarding the performance of our business, as further discussed in the descriptions of each of these Non-GAAP metrics below. \n\nThese Non-GAAP financial measures are not measures of performance under GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives or substitutes for the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. While we believe that these Non-GAAP financial measures are useful for the purposes described below, they have limitations associated with their use, since they exclude items that may have a material impact on our reported results and may be different from similar measures used by other companies. Additional information about the Non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures appear below. \n\n**Adjusted EBITDA**\n\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, long-term incentive compensation, restructuring and other related charges, and certain non-recurring items, including acquisition related costs, rebranding costs, and non-routine shareholder matters. We use Adjusted EBITDA as a simplified measure of performance for use in communicating our performance to investors and analysts and for comparisons to other companies within our industry. As a performance measure, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA presents a view of our operating results that is most closely related to serving our customers. By excluding interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, long-term incentive compensation, restructuring costs, and certain other non-recurring items, we are able to evaluate performance without considering decisions that, in most cases, are not directly related to meeting our customers’ requirements and were either made in prior periods (e.g., depreciation, amortization, long-term incentive compensation, non-routine shareholder matters), deal with the structure or financing of the business (e.g., interest, one-time strategic action costs, restructuring costs, impairment charges) or reflect the application of regulations that are outside of the control of our management team (e.g., taxes). In addition, removing the impact of these items helps us compare our core business performance with that of our competitors. \n\n**Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA**  \n---  \n**(in thousands, unaudited)**  \n**Three Months Ended** **September 30 ,** |  **Nine Months Ended** **September 30 ,**  \n_(In thousands)_ |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nNet income (loss)  |  $  |  8,273  |  $  |  (4,133  |  )  |  $  |  28,294  |  $  |  (30,240  |  )   \nInterest income, net  |  (624  |  )  |  (587  |  )  |  (1,246  |  )  |  (1,675  |  )   \nProvision for income taxes  |  1,688  |  279  |  4,658  |  1,569   \nDepreciation and amortization of intangible assets (1)  |  1,941  |  1,689  |  6,086  |  4,524   \nLong-term incentive compensation (2)  |  2,744  |  1,933  |  6,358  |  10,426   \nRestructuring and other related charges (3)  |  720  |  6,524  |  5,454  |  13,076   \nOther non-recurring items (4)  |  1,983  |  599  |  3,060  |  3,160   \nAdjusted EBITDA  |  $  |  16,725  |  $  |  6,304  |  $  |  52,664  |  $  |  840   \n  \n_(1)_ |  _Includes cost of sales depreciation and amortization expense directly related to delivering cloud subscription revenue of $0.7 million and $2.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and $0.4 million and $0.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, other non-recurring items consist of $1.6 million of inventory impairment charges and $1.6 million of fees related to non-recurring projects and our acquisition of ProvenDB._  \n  \n**Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) and Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) Per Diluted Share**\n\nWe define Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) and Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) Per Diluted Share as net income (loss) or net income (loss) per diluted share, as applicable, before the consideration of long-term incentive compensation expenses, the amortization of intangible assets, restructuring costs, and certain other non-recurring items. We use these measures to assess the impact of our performance excluding items that can significantly impact the comparison of our results between periods and the comparison to competitor results. \n\nWe exclude long-term incentive compensation expense because our long-term incentives generally reflect the use of restricted stock unit grants or cash incentive grants, including incentives directly tied to the performance of the business, while other companies may use different forms of incentives that have different cost impacts, which makes comparison difficult. We exclude amortization of intangible assets as we believe the amount of such expense in any given period may not be correlated directly to the performance of the business operations and that such expenses can vary significantly between periods as a result of new acquisitions, the full amortization of previously acquired intangible assets, or the write down of such assets due to an impairment event. However, intangible assets contribute to current and future revenue, and related amortization expense will recur in future periods until expired or written down. \n\nWe also exclude certain non-recurring items including one-time strategic action costs and non-recurring shareholder matters, as these items are unrelated to the operations of our core business. By excluding these items, we are better able to compare the operating results of our underlying core business from one reporting period to the next. \n\nWe make a tax adjustment based on the above adjustments resulting in an effective tax rate on a Non-GAAP basis, which may differ from the GAAP tax rate. We believe the effective tax rates we use in the adjustment are reasonable estimates of the overall tax rates for the Company under its global operating structure. \n\n**Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss)**  \n---  \n**(in thousands, except per share data)**  \n**(unaudited)**  \n**Three Months Ended September 30,** |  **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nNet income (loss)  |  $  |  8,273  |  $  |  (4,133  |  )  |  $  |  28,294  |  $  |  (30,240  |  )   \nAmortization of intangible assets (1)  |  585  |  583  |  1,967  |  1,749   \nLong-term incentive compensation (2)  |  2,744  |  1,933  |  6,358  |  10,426   \nRestructuring and other related charges (3)  |  720  |  6,524  |  5,454  |  13,076   \nOther non-recurring items (4)  |  1,983  |  599  |  3,060  |  3,160   \nTax impact of adjustments (5)  |  (1,206  |  )  |  (1,928  |  )  |  (3,368  |  )  |  (5,682  |  )   \nNon-GAAP net income (loss)  |  $  |  13,099  |  $  |  3,578  |  $  |  41,765  |  $  |  (7,511  |  )   \nNon-GAAP net income (loss) per share  |  $  |  0.33  |  $  |  0.09  |  $  |  1.07  |  $  |  (0.19  |  )   \nShares  |  39,458  |  40,999  |  38,864  |  40,529   \n  \n_(1)_ |  _Includes cost of sales amortization expense directly related to delivering cloud subscription revenue of $0 and $0.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and $0.1 million and $0.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.
