(Nasdaq: DTIL), a clinical stage gene editing company utilizing its novel proprietary ARCUS® platform to develop _in vivo_ gene editing therapies for sophisticated gene edits, today will present preclinical data supporting the advancement of PBGENE-HBV into clinical development. The Company will also outline the design of its first-in-human study, ELIMINATE-B, in patients with chronic hepatitis B. Company management will present these updates and host panel discussions on the unmet need in chronic hepatitis B and the approach to treatment with PBGENE-HBV during a virtual event being held today, November 15, 10:00 a.m. EST / 7:00 a.m. PST before commencement of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) Meeting. \n\n“We are excited to share the preclinical data supporting PBGENE-HBV alongside the design of our Phase 1 trial, ELIMINATE-B, which will be the first clinical study of an _in vivo_ gene editing program in chronic hepatitis B,” said Michael Amoroso, Chief Executive Officer, Precision BioSciences. “Chronic hepatitis B affects approximately 300 million people globally and represents a multi-billion-dollar market with chronic treatments currently serving more than 5 million patients worldwide. However, most available treatments for chronic hepatitis B target downstream aspects of the viral lifecycle, leaving the root of disease intact. Consequently, less than 3% of patients treated with existing approved treatments achieve a functional cure. This is unacceptable considering that up to 40% of patients with chronic hepatitis B will progress to develop life-threatening liver disease or liver cancer. PBGENE-HBV is uniquely designed to address this unmet need at the source of viral replication.” \n\n“Our preclinical results reflect the robust data package submitted to regulators in support of our global Phase 1 trial and underscore our conviction in PBGENE-HBV, which has so far demonstrated compelling safety and selectivity, highly efficient editing, and confirmation of its mechanism to eliminate cccDNA and viral DNA integrated into hepatocytes,” said Murray Abramson, M.D., M.P.H., Head of Clinical Development, Precision BioSciences. “Importantly, the ELIMINATE-B study will evaluate patients who are controlled but not cured by nucleoside analogues. We believe ELIMINATE-B will highlight the differentiated mechanism of PBGENE-HBV. By simultaneously targeting the two distinct drivers of disease – cccDNA and viral DNA integrated into hepatocytes – PBGENE-HBV has the potential to deliver a much-needed functional cure for people living with chronic hepatitis B.” \n\nMr. Amoroso added, “With regulatory authorization in place and global sites coming online, we are excited to begin dosing patients with PBGENE-HBV and look forward to sharing clinical data as it matures in 2025.” \n\n**PBGENE-HBV Preclinical Data Highlights:**\n\nToday, Precision will present preclinical data generated to date, which support the progression of PBGENE-HBV into a first-in-human clinical trial. The Company will share robust safety, tolerability, and efficacy signals observed through an array of preclinical models. Key highlights are as follows: \n\nSafety and Tolerability:\n\n  * Comprehensive off-target analysis demonstrated a high degree of specificity for PBGENE-HBV, with no increased risks of translocations or integrations in HBV-infected human liver cells; \n  * PBGENE-HBV was well tolerated over multiple administrations in mice and non-human primates (NHPs), with rapid clearance after each dose administration, transient transaminase elevations which resolved rapidly, and non-adverse changes in blood parameters; \n  * PBGENE-HBV does not distribute to germ cells, as evidenced by NHP studies; and \n  * PBGENE-HBV’s high-quality mRNA and optimized LNP formulation contributed to a compelling safety profile. \n\n\n\nEfficacy:\n\n  * PBGENE-HBV effectively distributed to all hepatocytes in the liver; \n  * PBGENE-HBV demonstrated 99% viral DNA editing in NHPs; \n  * Confirmed PBGENE-HBV’s dual mechanism with elimination of cccDNA observed in primary human hepatocyte, mouse, and NHP models and inactivation of integrated HBV DNA observed in transgenic mouse models and HBV cell lines; and \n  * Observed sustained declines in key viral biomarkers, HBV DNA and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), indicative of a functional cure in transgenic mouse models following administration of PBGENE-HBV and nucleoside analogue withdrawal. \n\n\n\nBased on these data, Precision has submitted clinical trial applications to authorities in multiple geographies and has so far received clearance to initiate its Phase 1 study in Moldova. Additional regulatory applications are under review or planned for other jurisdictions, including a U.S. IND. \n\n**ELIMINATE-B Phase 1 Trial Design and Overview:**\n\nELIMINATE-B is a global, multi-site, Phase 1 clinical trial, which will evaluate up to 45 HBV patients that are hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-negative and virologically suppressed on nucleos(t)ide analogues (NUCs). Since greater than 80% of patients with chronic hepatitis B are HbeAg-negative, this represents the majority of patients with hepatitis B. The ELIMINATE-B trial is targeted for enrollment of 45 patients in up to five countries and will progress in two stages: (1) a staggered, multiple ascending dose cohort, deploying a standard 3+3 design with each patient receiving up to 3 dose administrations; and (2) a dose expansion cohort once the appropriate dose and schedule has been determined.The key safety endpoint of the trial will be frequency and severity of dose-limiting toxicities. Efficacy will be determined by antiviral activity throughout finite duration PBGENE-HBV treatment and follow-up, including reduction in HBsAg, sustained HBV DNA negativity, and discontinuation of standard-of-care nucleos(t)ide analogues. \n\nELIMINATE-B is open and currently screening and accruing patients, and Precision expects to report data from the study as it matures throughout 2025. \n\nFurther details on the trial can be found in the event slides posted on Precision’s website in the Investors section under Events & Presentations at [investor.precisionbiosciences.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.precisionbiosciences.com%2F&esheet=54153481&newsitemid=20241115506955&lan=en-US&anchor=investor.precisionbiosciences.com&index=1&md5=0dc9c8c0308494cdb4515fe6dd70857e) and on [clinicaltrials.gov](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov&esheet=54153481&newsitemid=20241115506955&lan=en-US&anchor=clinicaltrials.gov&index=2&md5=8869be05de07fed50200bd639de3ea9b) identifier NCT06680232. \n\n**Investor Event Webcast Information:**\n\nPrecision’s investor event will include presentations by management on the preclinical data for PBGENE-HBV and the design of ELIMINATE-B. Panel discussions will feature leading hepatitis experts and Precision Scientific Advisory Board members on the market opportunity in HBV, and investigators on their clinical experience treating HBV and the potential for PBGENE-HBV to address this unmet need. \n\nThe event will be webcast live on Friday, November 15, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. EST / 7:00 a.m. PST.

(Nasdaq: DTIL), a clinical stage gene editing company utilizing its novel proprietary ARCUS® platform to develop _in vivo_ gene editing therapies for sophisticated gene edits, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and provided a business update. \n\n“With the clearance of our first clinical trial application (CTA) for our lead program, PBGENE-HBV, we have arrived at the next phase of Precision’s journey as a single platform, clinical stage _in vivo_ gene editing company. Our team is moving quickly to dose patients and in parallel is leveraging our robust regulatory package to seek additional regulatory application approvals globally with the aim of rapidly accelerating enrollment in the PBGENE-HBV phase 1 trial,” said Michael Amoroso, Chief Executive Officer at Precision BioSciences. “PBGENE-HBV represents the very first clinical stage gene editing program for chronic hepatitis B utilizing a differentiated dual modality targeting the elimination of cccDNA and inactivation of integrated HBV genomes - the root cause of viral persistence in chronic hepatitis B. We look forward to sharing detail on our clinical plans for PBGENE-HBV on November 15 prior to AASLD.” \n\n“Looking ahead, we expect to report phase 1 PBGENE-HBV data throughout 2025 while continuing to work in parallel to submit an investigational new drug (IND) and/or CTA for our second wholly owned _in vivo_ gene editing program, PBGENE-3243 for the potential treatment of m.3243-associated mitochondrial disease,” added Mr. Amoroso. \n\n**Wholly Owned Portfolio**\n\n**PBGENE-HBV (Viral Elimination Program):** PBGENE-HBV is Precision’s wholly owned _in vivo_ gene editing program under investigation in a global first-in-human clinical trial, which is designed to potentially cure chronic hepatitis B. Currently, it is estimated that approximately 300 million people worldwide are afflicted with chronic hepatitis B. PBGENE-HBV is the first and only potentially curative gene editing program to enter clinic that is specifically designed to eliminate cccDNA and inactivate integrated HBV DNA. \n\nIn October 2024, Precision received CTA approval for PBGENE-HBV in Moldova and is working towards dosing patients. Investigators and clinical sites in Moldova, the first country to approve a CTA for PBGENE-HBV, have extensive experience executing and enrolling patients in early- and mid-stage hepatitis B clinical trials. Precision has submitted additional regulatory applications globally which are pending approval. The Company’s robust preclinical safety package supports the ability of PBGENE-HBV to specifically target and eliminate hepatitis B cccDNA and inactivate integrated HBV DNA without impacting any genes in the human genome, including no editing-associated translocations in HBV-infected primary human hepatocytes. In addition, non-human primate data showed that PBGENE-HBV was well-tolerated across multiple dose administrations. \n\n**PBGENE-3243 (Mutant Mitochondrial DNA Elimination Program previously known as PBGENE-PMM):** PBGENE-3243 is a first-of-its-kind potential treatment for m.3243-associated mitochondrial diseases that is designed to target mutant mitochondrial DNA. Mitochondrial diseases are the most common hereditary metabolic disorder in the world. Precision has updated the program’s nomenclature to more accurately describe its intended target patient population – those who have m.3243 mutation and muscle-related symptoms. In particular, the m.3243-associated mitochondrial disease that PBGENE-3243 intends to address, affects approximately 20,000 people in the US alone. The high specificity of ARCUS nucleases enables editing and elimination of mutant mitochondrial DNA while allowing wild-type (normal) mitochondrial DNA to repopulate in the mitochondria, thus improving cellular function. Unlike CRISPR/Cas, base editors, and prime editors that require a guide RNA, ARCUS single-component nucleases do not require a nucleic acid for targeting and are able to penetrate the mitochondrial membranes. \n\nEarlier this year, Precision presented additional data from the PBGENE-3243 program at the UMDF Conference. The presentation highlighted the ability of PBGENE-3243 to localize exclusively to mitochondria, avoiding any detectable off-target editing in the nuclear genome, while generating substantial shifts in heteroplasmy and improvements in mitochondrial function. The Company expects to submit an IND and/or CTA for this program in 2025. \n\n**Wholly Owned Portfolio – Under Assessment**\n\nIn April 2024, Precision exercised its option to regain rights for the three programs developed under its collaboration with Prevail Therapeutics Inc. The Company is finalizing its portfolio assessment for these returned programs for internal development and/or development through new partners and expects to provide an update as decisions are final. These programs include: \n\n  * **PBGENE-DMD** – novel gene excision approach for treatment of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy utilizing a pair of ARCUS nucleases, delivered by a single adeno-associated virus (AAV), that are designed to _excise_ an approximately 500,000 base pair mutation “hot spot” region from the dystrophin gene to generate a functionally competent variant of the dystrophin protein. \n  * **PBGENE-LIVER** – liver target for _gene insertion_ with data demonstrating that ARCUS is capable of 40% to 45% high efficiency _gene insertion_ at 1- and 3-months in nondividing cells, the most challenging context for _gene insertion_ , in adult nonhuman primates. \n  * **PBGENE-CNS** – gene editing program targeting neurons to address a disease of the central nervous system. \n\n\n\n**Partnered Programs**\n\n**iECURE-OTC (Gene Insertion Program):** Led by iECURE, ECUR-506 is an ARCUS-mediated _in vivo_ gene editing program currently in a first-in-human phase 1/2 trial (OTC-HOPE) evaluating ECUR-506 as a potential treatment for neonatal onset ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency. iECURE expects initial data from this trial to be available in 2025. \n\n**PBGENE-NVS (Gene Insertion Program):** Precision continues to advance its gene editing program with Novartis to develop a custom ARCUS nuclease for patients with hemoglobinopathies, such as sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. The collaborative intent is to _insert, in vivo_ , a therapeutic transgene as a potential one-time transformative treatment administered directly to the patient to overcome disparities in patient access to treatment with other therapeutic technologies, including those that are targeting an _ex vivo_ gene editing approach. \n\n**Corporate Updates & Upcoming Events**\n\n**PBGENE-HBV Investor Event:** Precision will host a virtual investor event on November 15, 2024, at 7:00am PST (10:00am EST) in San Diego highlighting the complete preclinical safety data and additional details regarding the phase 1 trial for PBGENE-HBV. The live webcast of the event will be available on the Events & Presentations section of the Precision BioSciences [investor website](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.precisionbiosciences.com%2F&esheet=54146368&newsitemid=20241104349480&lan=en-US&anchor=investor+website&index=1&md5=592da85fffd936d572cc6a2e357b0b28). \n\n**ESGCT presentation:** The company presented a poster at the European Society of Gene & Cell Therapy (ESGCT) 31st Annual Congress held on October 24, 2024, in Rome, Italy. The poster highlighted preclinical data demonstrating the ability of ARCUS to achieve high-efficiency _gene insertion, gene replacement_ , and _base correction_ via _homology-directed repair (HDR)._ In the preclinical work presented, the company showed that targeted _gene insertion_ can be achieved using ARCUS in greater than 85% of T cells and 39% of non-dividing primary human hepatocytes. These high rates of _gene insertion_ were accomplished primarily through HDR which the research demonstrated was dependent on homology arms in the repair template and on the unique characteristic ARCUS 3’ overhang cut in the direction of DNA replication. \n\n**Strengthened Senior Leadership Team:** In September 2024, Precision announced the appointment of Dr. Murray Abramson, MD, MPH as Senior Vice President, Head of Clinical Development, and John Fry as Strategic Clinical Advisor, Hepatitis, significantly strengthening the Company’s infectious disease and hepatitis capabilities to support its transition into the clinic and execute its Phase 1 PBGENE-HBV trial. Precision also announced the retirement of Alan List, MD who has assumed a role on Precision’s Scientific Advisory Board as a Clinical Consultant. \n\n**Amended Banc of California Loan and Security Agreement:** On July 31, 2024, the Company entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement (the 2024 Loan and Security Agreement) with Banc of California (formerly known as Pacific Western Bank) pursuant to which Banc of California provided the Company with a term loan with a principal amount of $22.5 million secured by restricted cash. The maturity date under the 2024 Loan and Security Agreement is June 30, 2027. \n\n**Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 Financial Results:**\n\n**Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash:** As of September 30, 2024, Precision had approximately $121.3 million in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. The Company expects that existing cash and cash equivalents, upfront and potential near-term cash from CAR T transactions, along with expected operational receipts, continued fiscal and operating discipline, and availability of Precision’s at-the-market (ATM) facility are expected to extend Precision’s cash runway into the second half of 2026. Based on its expected cash runway, Precision believes it is sufficiently capitalized to propel two wholly owned programs through Phase 1 data readouts in 2025 and 2026. \n\n**Revenues:** Total revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, were $0.6 million, as compared to $13.1 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease of $12.5 million in revenue during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, was primarily the result of a $7.0 million decrease in revenue recognized under the Novartis Agreement as Precision nears completion of its pre-clinical workplan compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. In addition, there was a $5.5 million decrease in revenue recognized under the Prevail Agreement during the three months ended September 30, 2024, following conclusion of the collaboration in April 2024. \n\n**Research and Development Expenses:** Research and development expenses were $13.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $15.9 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease of $2.8 million was primarily due to a $2.7 million decrease in PBGENE-HBV external development costs primarily from nonclinical studies and a $2.0 million decrease in outsourced R&D costs, lab supplies and services, and share based compensation, offset by a $2.4 million increase in PBGENE-3243 program external development costs as the program continues to advance toward an IND and/or CTA in 2025. \n\n**General and Administrative Expenses:** General and administrative expenses were $8.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $9.6 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease of $0.8 million was primarily due to a decrease in consulting fees in addition to decreases in tax and insurance expenses. \n\n**Net Loss from Continuing Operations:** Net loss from continuing operations was $16.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $12.1 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in net loss was primarily related to decreases in revenue under the Novartis and Prevail Agreements. \n\n**Net Loss:** Net loss was $16.4 million, or $(2.25) per share (basic and diluted), for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a net loss of $8.1 million, or $(2.10) per share (basic and diluted), for the same period in 2023. \n\n**Shares:** Basic and diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding for the third quarter of 2024 were 7,287,173 compared to 3,838,900 for the same period in 2023. Precision BioSciences had 7,480,521 shares outstanding as of September 30, 2024. \n\n**About Precision BioSciences, Inc.**\n\nPrecision BioSciences, Inc. is a clinical stage gene editing company dedicated to improving life (DTIL) with its novel and proprietary ARCUS® genome editing platform that differs from other technologies in the way it cuts, its smaller size, and its simpler structure.

(Nasdaq: DTIL), a clinical stage gene editing company utilizing its novel proprietary ARCUS® platform to develop in vivo gene editing therapies for sophisticated gene edits, today announced a poster presentation at the European Society of Gene & Cell Therapy (ESGCT) 31st Annual Congress being held October 22-25, 2024, in Rome, Italy. The poster highlighted preclinical data demonstrating the ability of ARCUS to achieve high-efficiency gene insertion, gene replacement and base correction via homology-directed repair (HDR). \n\n“Gene editing enzymes that support efficient HDR are relatively rare. However, we demonstrate here that ARCUS is capable of utilizing HDR with high efficiency to achieve a range of gene editing outcomes, including specific base changes, insertions, and the replacement of large segments of DNA within the genome,\" said Jeff Smith, PhD, Co-Founder and Chief Research Officer of Precision BioSciences. “These data continue to validate the ARCUS platform as an ideal modality for treating diseases that require gene insertion or repair to restore function whereas other gene editing modalities are largely focused on knocking-out function. In addition to the preclinical data presented today, we look forward to seeing supportive clinical validation of HDR-based ARCUS gene insertion through our partner iECURE, who is advancing their ECUR-506 clinical stage program utilizing an ARCUS nuclease for treating OTC deficiency,” added Jeff Smith. \n\n**Title:** High-efficiency homology-directed insertion into the genome using ARCUS nucleases **Poster Number:** #PO678 **Presenter:** Adam Mischler, PhD, Senior Scientist, Precision BioSciences Gene Discovery **Date and Time:** Thursday, October 24, 2024, 6:00-7:30pm CEST\n\nIn preclinical work presented today, we show that targeted gene insertion can be achieved using ARCUS in greater than 85% of T cells and 39% of non-dividing primary human hepatocytes. These high rates of gene insertion were accomplished primarily through HDR as evidenced by the dependency on homology arms in the repair template and on the unique ARCUS 3’ 4 base pair overhang cut that resembles a processed end for stimulating HDR. Using HDR, ARCUS successfully demonstrates the ability to support a wide range of DNA editing approaches using a template to define the specific edit. Unlike base editors’ limitation to two possible base changes, ARCUS was able to produce all twelve possible base changes, in addition to producing very specific base removal and insertions. Unlike prime editors, ARCUS was also able to generate whole gene insertions and even replace large segments within a gene to restore function. The characteristic enzymology of ARCUS nucleases drives high rates of HDR, which can potentially be leveraged to achieve a multitude of highly precise gene editing functions for therapeutic benefit. \n\n**About Precision BioSciences, Inc.**\n\nPrecision BioSciences, Inc. is an advanced gene editing company dedicated to improving life (DTIL) with its novel and proprietary ARCUS genome editing platform that differs from other technologies in the way it cuts, its smaller size, and its simpler structure. Key capabilities and differentiating characteristics may enable ARCUS nucleases to drive more intended, defined therapeutic outcomes. Using ARCUS, the Company’s pipeline is comprised of in vivo gene editing candidates designed to deliver lasting cures for the broadest range of genetic and infectious diseases where no adequate treatments exist.
