Such statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and are generally beyond the control of the Company. There can be no assurance that future developments affecting the Company will be the same as those anticipated by management. These statements are evidenced by terms such as \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"should,\" \"expect,\" \"believe,\" \"intend,\" and similar expressions. Although these statements reflect management's good faith beliefs and projections, they are not guarantees of future performance and they may not prove true. These projections involve risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those addressed in the forward-looking statements. While there is no assurance that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, below are certain factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained or implied in the forward-looking statements: the effect of acquisitions we have made or may make, including, without limitation, the failure to achieve the expected revenue growth and/or expense savings from such acquisitions, and/or the failure to effectively integrate an acquisition target into our operations; recent adverse developments in the banking industry highlighted by high-profile bank failures and the potential impact of such developments on customer confidence, liquidity, and regulatory responses to these developments; changes in general economic, political, or industry conditions; geopolitical concerns, including the ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East; uncertainty in U.S. fiscal and monetary policy, including the interest rate policies of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; inflation/deflation, interest rate, market, and monetary fluctuations; volatility and disruptions in global capital and credit markets; competitive pressures on product pricing and services; success, impact, and timing of our business strategies, including market acceptance of any new products or services; the impact of changes in financial services policies, laws, and regulations, including those concerning taxes, banking, securities, and insurance, and the application thereof by regulatory bodies; potential changes in federal policy and at regulatory agencies as a result of the upcoming 2024 presidential election; a deterioration of the credit rating for U.S. long-term sovereign debt, actions that the U.S. government may take to avoid exceeding the debt ceiling, and uncertainties surrounding debt ceiling and the federal budget; the impact of recent or future changes in FDIC insurance assessment rate or the rules and regulations related to the calculation of the FDIC insurance assessment amount, including any special assessments; cybersecurity threats and the cost of defending against them, including the costs of compliance with potential legislation to combat cybersecurity at a state, national, or global level; the Company's ability to remediate the existing material weaknesses identified in its internal control over financial reporting; the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures; climate change, including any enhanced regulatory, compliance, credit and reputational risks and costs; and other factors that may affect our future results. Additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements are discussed in the Company's 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") and available at the SEC's Internet site (<http://www.sec.gov>).\n\nThe Company specifically disclaims any obligation to update any factors or to publicly announce the result of revisions to any of the forward-looking statements included herein to reflect future events or developments.\n\n![Cision](https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=PH44846&sd=2024-10-30) View original content to download multimedia:<https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/shore-bancshares-inc-reports-quarterly-dividend-of-0-12-per-share-302292040.html>\n\nSOURCE Shore Bancshares, Inc.\n\n[ View all news ](/news-market-information/press-releases/)\n\nCopyright 2024, [© Powered By Q4 Inc.](http://q4inc.com/Powered-by-Q4/)\n\n  * [Home](https://www.shoreunitedbank.com/shore-bancshares--inc-)\n  * [Terms of Use](https://www.shoreunitedbank.com/terms-of-use)\n\n\n\nNOTICE: Shore Bancshares is not responsible for and has no control over the subject matter, content, information, or graphics of the web sites that have links here.

The third quarter efficiency ratio was affected by one-time data processing expense related to the fraud incident in the first quarter of 2024. The third quarter of 2024 non-GAAP efficiency ratio(1) was 62.10% when compared to 61.05% in the second quarter of 2024.\n  * **Strong Deposit Growth** - Total deposits increased to $5.23 billion at September 30, 2024 from $5.15 billion at June 30, 2024. Average noninterest bearing deposits increased to $1.58 billion for the third quarter of 2024 representing 30.55% of average funding, excluding subordinated debt, compared to 28.42% during the second quarter of 2024. The Bank's use of wholesale funding, which includes Federal Home Loan Bank (\"FHLB\") advances and brokered deposits, has been minimal in 2024. Wholesale funding increased from $44.5 million or 0.74% of assets at December 31, 2023 to $50.0 million or 0.84% of total assets at September 30, 2024. Sustained efforts to enhance the Bank's deposit franchise are expected to continue to attract additional deposits in future quarters.\n\n\n\n\"Increasing net interest income drove a healthy increase in net interest margin in the third quarter,\" stated James (\"Jimmy\") M. Burke, President and Chief Executive Officer of Shore Bancshares, Inc. \"Active management of our deposit relationships, combined with the recent reduction in rates by the Federal Reserve, have helped us stabilize our cost of funding even as assets yields continue to increase. Credit remains stable and economic activity in our markets remains strong. We continue to rapidly build capital and are optimistic that decreasing rates and clarity in November will result in loan growth.\"\n\n(1) | Reconciliations of the non–U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") measures are set forth at the end of this press release.  \n---|---  \n  \n**Balance Sheet Review**\n\nTotal assets were $5.9 billion at September 30, 2024, a decrease of $93.2 million or 1.6%, when compared to $6.0 billion at December 31, 2023. The aggregate decrease was primarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $188.8 million and investment securities held to maturity of $28.6 million partially offset by an increase in investment securities available for sale of $22.8 million and loans held for investment of $92.9 million. The ratio of the ACL to total loans remained flat at 1.24% at September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023.\n\nThe Company's tangible common equity ratio(1) at September 30, 2024 was 7.39% compared to 6.78% at December 31, 2023. The Company's Tier 1 and Total Risk-Based Capital Ratios at September 30, 2024 were 9.89% and 12.04%, respectively. The Bank's Tier 1 and Total Risk-Based Capital Ratios at September 30, 2024 were 10.60% and 11.84%, respectively. Non-owner occupied CRE loans as a percentage of the Bank's Tier 1 Capital + ACL at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were $2.1 billion or 364.0% and $2.0 billion or 382.6%, respectively. Construction loans as a percentage of the Bank's Tier 1 Capital + ACL at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were $337.1 million or 59.3% and $299.0 million or 56.7%, respectively.\n\nThe Bank's office CRE loan portfolio, which includes owner-occupied and non-owner occupied CRE loans, was $509.4 million or 10.8% of total loans of $4.7 billion at September 30, 2024. The Bank's office CRE loan portfolio included $140.9 million or 27.7% of the total with medical tenants and $71.8 million or 14.1% of the total with government or government contractor tenants. There were 503 loans in the office CRE portfolio with an average and median loan size of $1.0 million and $0.4 million, respectively. Loan to Value (\"LTV\") estimates for the office CRE portfolio are summarized below and LTV collateral values are based on the most recent appraisal, which may vary from the appraised value at loan origination.\n\n**LTV Range** | **Loan Count** | **Loan Balance** | **% of Total CRE**  \n---|---|---|---  \nLess than or equal to 50% | 258 | $ 177,771 | 35 %  \n50%-60% | 69 | 118,547 | 23 %  \n60%-70% | 80 | 111,951 | 22 %  \n70%-80% | 73 | 82,674 | 16 %  \nGreater than 80% | 23 | 18,433 | 4 %  \nGrand Total | 503 | $ 509,376 | 100 %  \n  \nThe Bank had 18 office CRE loans totaling $164.6 million with balances greater than $5.0 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 24 office CRE loans totaling $189.8 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease in this portfolio segment was the result of normal amortization and two large loan payoffs in the quarter. At September 30, 2024, the average loan debt-service coverage ratio was 2.5x and average LTV was 50.0%. Of the office CRE portfolio balance, 73% is secured by properties in rural or suburban areas with limited exposure to metropolitan cities and 97% is secured by properties with five stories or less. Of the office CRE loans, $2.0 million were classified as special mention or substandard at September 30, 2024.\n\nTotal deposits decreased $160.4 million, or 3.0% to $5.2 billion at September 30, 2024 when compared to December 31, 2023. The decrease in total deposits was primarily due to decreases in demand deposits of $414.0 million and money market and savings of $143.8 million, partially offset by increases in noninterest-bearing deposits of $313.4 million and time deposits of $84.0 million. The decrease in deposits is primarily attributable to seasonal municipal runoff and a decrease in interest rate-sensitive cannabis-related deposits. During the second quarter of 2024, the Company reclassified $399.4 million of demand deposits which carried an average rate of 4 bps to noninterest bearing deposits.\n\nTotal funding, which includes customer deposits, FHLB short and long-term advances, and brokered deposits was $5.28 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to $5.26 billion at June 30, 2024 and $5.43 billion at December 31, 2023. The Bank had $50.0 million in total FHLB advances at September 30, 2024 compared to aggregate advances of $81.0 million at June 30, 2024 and zero at December 31, 2023. The advance consisted of 18-month Bermuda Convertible of $50 million. The Bank had zero brokered deposits (excluding reciprocal deposits) at September 30, 2024 compared to $28.2 million at June 30, 2024 and $19.4 million at December 31, 2023. Total reciprocal deposits were $1.3 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to $1.2 billion at June 30, 2024 and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2023. \n\nThe Bank's uninsured deposits at September 30, 2024 were $895.9 million or 17.14% of total deposits. The Bank's uninsured deposits, excluding deposits secured with pledged collateral, at September 30, 2024 were $768.6 million or 14.71% of total deposits. At September 30, 2024, the Bank had approximately $1.1 billion of available liquidity including: $183.6 million in cash, $932.5 million in secured borrowing capacity at the FHLB and other correspondent banks, and $95.0 million in unsecured lines of credit.\n\nTotal stockholders' equity increased $22.1 million, or 4.3%, when compared to December 31, 2023, primarily due to current year earnings, offset by cash dividends paid. As of September 30, 2024, the ratio of total equity to total assets was 9.01% and the ratio of total tangible equity to total tangible assets(1) was 7.39% compared to 8.50% and 6.78% at December 31, 2023, respectively.\n\n**Review of Quarterly Financial Results**\n\nNet interest income was $43.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $42.1 million for the second quarter of 2024 and $45.6 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in net interest income when compared to the second quarter of 2024 was primarily due to the increase in interest and fees on loans of $1.9 million and interest and dividends on investment securities of $268 thousand, partially offset by an increase in interest expense of $460 thousand. The increase in interest expense in the third quarter of 2024 was the result of higher interest expense on deposits of $1.3 million, partially offset by lower interest expense from carrying lower short-term advances from the FHLB during the quarter to offset seasonal outflows from municipal customers of $1.1 million. The decrease in net interest income when compared to the third quarter of 2023 was primarily due the higher interest expense on deposits of $5.4 million and long-term borrowings of $618 thousand. These were partially offset by an increase in interest and fees on loans of $4.3 million. All of these items were significantly impacted by the merger in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nThe Company's net interest margin increased to 3.17% for the third quarter of 2024 from 3.11% for the second quarter of 2024 primarily due to loans repricing at a greater rate than deposits. The Company's cost of funds was positively impacted during the second quarter due to a shift from interest-bearing to noninterest-bearing deposits. Average interest-bearing deposits decreased $77.8 million, or 2.2% which resulted in $1.3 million less interest expense. These interest-bearing deposits were almost entirely replaced with an increase in the average balance on noninterest-bearing deposits of $99.1 million, or 6.7%. The Company's net interest margin decreased to 3.17% for the third quarter of 2024 from 3.35% for the third quarter of 2023. Comparing the third quarter of 2024 to the third quarter of 2023, the Company's interest-earning asset yields increased 23 bps to 5.47% from 5.24%, while the cost of funds repriced at a slower pace resulting in an increase of 43 bps to 2.38% from 1.95% for the same period.\n\nThe provision for credit losses was $1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The comparable amounts were $2.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, and $28.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the provision for credit losses for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024 was due to new loan growth, increases in specific reserves and charge-offs in the third quarter of 2024. Coverage ratios remained flat at 1.24% at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024. The decrease in the provision for credit losses when compared to the third quarter of 2023 was primarily due to an enhanced CECL model in the third quarter of 2023 due to the merger. Net charge-offs were $1.4 million for the third quarter of 2024 and third quarter of 2023, compared to $886 thousand for the second quarter of 2024.\n\nAt September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, nonperforming assets were $15.8 million, or 0.27% of total assets and $17.0 million, or 0.29% of total assets, respectively. The balance of nonperforming assets decreased primarily due to a decrease in repossessed properties of $1.3 million. When comparing September 30, 2024 to September 30, 2023, nonperforming assets increased $4.5 million, primarily due to increases in nonaccrual loans of $5.9 million, an increase in repossessed marine loans and assets held for sale of $306 thousand, partially offset by a decrease of $1.7 million in loans 90 days past due and still accruing almost entirely impacted by the merger in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nTotal noninterest income for the third quarter of 2024 was $7.3 million, a decrease of $1.2 million from $8.4 million for the second quarter of 2024 and a decrease $7.7 million from $15.0 million for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease from the second quarter of 2024 was lower revenues from mortgage banking and Mid-Maryland Title Company, Inc. (the \"title Company\"). The Bank's mortgage revenue declined $806 thousand due to lower interest rates which decreased the value of mortgage servicing rights $686 thousand and also drove higher prepayment rates. The title company revenues declined due to lower settlement activity than the prior quarter.\n\nTotal noninterest expense of $34.1 million for the third quarter of 2024 increased $615 thousand when compared to the second quarter of 2024 expense of $33.5 million and decreased $13.0 million when compared to the third quarter of 2023 expense of $47.2 million. The increase from the second quarter of 2024 was primarily due to one time data processing costs related to the fraud incident in the first quarter of 2024 and other fraud expenses. The decrease from the third quarter of 2023 was primarily due to one time merger related expenses that were incurred in 2023 partially offset by an increase in expenses due to the operation of a larger branch network and employee base due to the merger, which significantly impacted almost all expense line items. In addition, despite the increased size, the Company has prudently reduced its staff by approximately 72 FTE's since the consummation of the merger. The efficiency ratio for the third quarter of 2024 when compared to the second quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023 was 67.49%, 66.23% and 77.81%, respectively. Furthermore, non-GAAP efficiency ratios(1) for the same periods were 62.10%, 61.05% and 54.89%, respectively. The net operating expense ratio, which is non-interest expense less non-interest income divided by average assets, for the third quarter 2024 was 1.84%, compared to 1.73% and 2.21% for the second quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023, respectively. The non-GAAP net operating expense ratio(1), which excludes core deposit intangible amortization and non-recurring activity, for the third quarter 2024 was 1.65%, compared to 1.55% and 1.48% for the second quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023, respectively.\n\n**Review of Nine Month Financial Results**\n\nNet interest income for the first nine months of 2024 was $126.5 million, an increase of $32.8 million, or 34.9%, when compared to the first nine months of 2023. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to an increase in total interest income of $76.0 million, or 53.2%, which included an increase in interest and fees on loans of $73.8 million, or 57.4%. The increase of interest and fees on loans was primarily due to the increase in the average balance of loans of $1.4 billion, or 42.3%, and an increase in net accretion income of $5.5 million due to the merger. Increases to net interest income were partially offset by increased total interest expense of $43.2 million, or 87.9%, primarily due to increases in the cost of funds and in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits of $1.0 billion, or 38.1%. All of the increases in average balances were largely due to the merger.\n\nThe Company's net interest margin remained flat at 3.12% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Margins were flat as more rapid increases in rates on interest-bearing liabilities were offset by lower increases in interest-earning assets yields and larger balances in noninterest-bearing deposits. The increases in the average balance and rates paid on interest-bearing deposits of $1.0 billion and 104 bps, respectively, were partially offset by increases in the average balance and yields earned on average earning assets of $1.4 billion and 64 bps, respectively. Additionally, margins were positively impacted as average balances of noninterest-bearing deposits increased $424.9 million, or 43.2% from 25.9% of average funding for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 27.2% of average funding for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net accretion income impacted net interest margin by 29 bps and 21 bps for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nThe provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $4.0 million and $30.1 million, respectively. The decrease in the provision for credit losses was due to higher levels of reserves required by the Company's CECL model related to the merger in 2023. Net charge-offs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $3.0 million compared to net recoveries of $1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nTotal noninterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased $3.3 million or 13.0%, when compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower trust and investment fee income of $1.1 million and one-time third quarter 2023 bargain purchase income of $8.8 million offset by $2.2 million of losses on sale of investment securities, both a direct result of the merger with TCFC in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nTotal noninterest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased $14.6 million, or 16.3%, when compared to the same period in 2023. Almost all noninterest expense line items increased as a result of the credit card fraud losses and the expanded operations of the newly combined Company. There were no merger-related expenses and $4.7 million of credit card fraud losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $16.8 million expenses and no fraud losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The Company continues to focus on streamlining processes to unlock operational efficiencies and reduce overall noninterest expenses.\n\n**Shore Bancshares Information**\n\nShore Bancshares is a financial holding company headquartered in Easton, Maryland and is the parent company of Shore United Bank, N.A.

Such statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and are generally beyond the control of the Company. There can be no assurance that future developments affecting the Company will be the same as those anticipated by management. These statements are evidenced by terms such as \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"should,\" \"expect,\" \"believe,\" \"intend,\" and similar expressions. Although these statements reflect management's good faith beliefs and projections, they are not guarantees of future performance and they may not prove true. These projections involve risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those addressed in the forward-looking statements. While there is no assurance that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, below are certain factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained or implied in the forward-looking statements: the effect of acquisitions we have made or may make, including, without limitation, the failure to achieve the expected revenue growth and/or expense savings from such acquisitions, and/or the failure to effectively integrate an acquisition target into our operations; recent adverse developments in the banking industry highlighted by high-profile bank failures and the potential impact of such developments on customer confidence, liquidity, and regulatory responses to these developments; changes in general economic, political, or industry conditions; geopolitical concerns, including the ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East; uncertainty in U.S. fiscal and monetary policy, including the interest rate policies of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; inflation/deflation, interest rate, market, and monetary fluctuations; volatility and disruptions in global capital and credit markets; competitive pressures on product pricing and services; success, impact, and timing of our business strategies, including market acceptance of any new products or services; the impact of changes in financial services policies, laws, and regulations, including those concerning taxes, banking, securities, and insurance, and the application thereof by regulatory bodies; potential changes in federal policy and at regulatory agencies as a result of the upcoming 2024 presidential election; a deterioration of the credit rating for U.S. long-term sovereign debt, actions that the U.S. government may take to avoid exceeding the debt ceiling, and uncertainties surrounding debt ceiling and the federal budget; the impact of recent or future changes in FDIC insurance assessment rate or the rules and regulations related to the calculation of the FDIC insurance assessment amount, including any special assessments; cybersecurity threats and the cost of defending against them, including the costs of compliance with potential legislation to combat cybersecurity at a state, national, or global level; the Company's evaluation of the effect of the credit card fraud on the Company's internal controls over financial reporting and its ability to remediate the existing material weakness identified in its internal control over financial reporting; the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures; climate change, including any enhanced regulatory, compliance, credit and reputational risks and costs; and other factors that may affect our future results. Additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements are discussed in the Company's 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") and available at the SEC's Internet site ([http://www.sec.gov](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4224842-1&h=761152399&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sec.gov%2F&a=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sec.gov)).\n\nThe Company specifically disclaims any obligation to update any factors or to publicly announce the result of revisions to any of the forward-looking statements included herein to reflect future events or developments.\n\n![Cision](https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=PH75202&sd=2024-08-01) View original content to download multimedia:<https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/shore-bancshares-inc-reports-quarterly-dividend-of-0-12-per-share-302212867.html>\n\nSOURCE Shore Bancshares, Inc.\n\n[ View all news ](/news-market-information/press-releases/)\n\nCopyright 2024, [© Powered By Q4 Inc.](http://q4inc.com/Powered-by-Q4/)\n\n  * [Home](https://www.shoreunitedbank.com/shore-bancshares--inc-)\n  * [Terms of Use](https://www.shoreunitedbank.com/terms-of-use)\n\n\n\nNOTICE: Shore Bancshares is not responsible for and has no control over the subject matter, content, information, or graphics of the web sites that have links here.

Reports Second Quarter and First-Half Financial Results\n\nCompany Release -\n\n7/25/2024 6:30 AM ET\n\nDownload the PDF version PDF Format (opens in new window)\n\nEASTON, Md., July 25, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Shore Bancshares, Inc. (NASDAQ - SHBI) (the \"Company\" or \"Shore Bancshares\"), the holding company for Shore United Bank, N.A. (the \"Bank\" or \"SUB\") reported net income for the second quarter of 2024 of $11.2 million or $0.34 per diluted common share compared to net income of $8.2 million or $0.25 per diluted common share for the first quarter of 2024, and net income of $4.0 million or $0.20 per diluted common share for the second quarter of 2023. Net income for the first-half of 2024 was $19.4 million or $0.58 per diluted common share, compared to net income for the first-half of 2023 of $10.5 million or $0.53 per diluted common share. Unless the context clearly suggests otherwise, references to \"the merger\" refers to the merger of equals which took place on July 1, 2023 between the Company and The Community Financial Corporation (\"TCFC\").\n\n[ ![Shore Bancshares Logo \\(PRNewsfoto/Shore Bancshares, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/803952/Shore_Bancshares_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/803952/Shore_Bancshares_Logo.html)\n\n**Second****Quarter and First-Half of 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * **Return on Average Assets (\"ROAA\")** - The Company reported ROAA of 0.77% for the second quarter of 2024, compared to 0.57% for the first quarter of 2024 and 0.45% for the second quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP, ROAA([1]), which excludes fraud expense, core deposit intangible amortization, and merger-related expenses, was 0.91% for the second quarter of 2024, compared to 0.94% for the first quarter of 2024 and 0.59% for the second quarter of 2023.\n  * **Net Interest Margin** **Expansion** - Net interest margin (\"NIM\") increased to 3.11% for the second quarter of 2024 from 3.08% for the first quarter of 2024. Excluding net accretion interest income of $3.8 million and $3.6 million for the same time periods, NIM increased two basis points (\"bps\") to 2.83% for the second quarter of 2024 from 2.81% for the first quarter of 2024.\n  * **Continued Stable and Low Cost Funding** - Total deposits remained stable in the second quarter of 2024 with noninterest-bearing deposits increasing $386.6 million to 30.8% of total deposits. The increase in noninterest-bearing deposits was primarily due to the migration of low-cost demand deposits to noninterest-bearing deposits and successful initiatives designed to drive noninterest-bearing deposit growth. The total average cost of deposits for the second quarter of 2024 declined four bps to 2.19% when compared to the first quarter of 2024.\n  * **Improving Earnings Drive Capital Accretion -** Second quarter net interest income and noninterest income increased $1.0 million and $1.9 million, respectively, from the first quarter of 2024. Net interest income increased due to modest loan growth, slightly higher accelerated accretion income, and loan and securities repricing. Noninterest income increased primarily due to higher mortgage-banking revenue from increased volume and sales of residential mortgages. The improved earnings for the second quarter resulted in a 14 bps increase in the Company's Tier 1 Capital Ratio and a 14 bps increase in the Company's Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio, which were 9.67% and 11.82%, respectively, on June 30, 2024. The Company's leverage ratio and tangible common equity ratio(1) also increased to 8.07% and 7.23%, respectively, in the second quarter of 2024.\n  * **Reduced Commercial Real Estate (\"CRE\") Concentration -** The CRE Concentration Ratio, which is calculated as non-owner occupied CRE loans as a percentage of the Bank's Tier 1 Capital + Allowance for Credit Losses (\"ACL\"), decreased in the second quarter of 2024 to 368.7% from 370.0% in the first quarter of 2024 and 382.6% in the fourth quarter of 2023. Capital accretion has allowed the Bank to meet the needs of its customers and fund new CRE loans.\n  * **Improving Operating Leverage** - The second quarter efficiency ratio improved to 66.2% when compared to 76.9% in the first quarter 2024 and 77.8% in the second quarter 2023. The second quarter non-GAAP efficiency, which excludes core deposit intangible amortization and non-recurring activity, improved to 61.1% when compared to 62.4% in the first quarter 2024 and 71.8% in the second quarter 2023. Management anticipates ongoing expense management and technology investments will result in continued improvements in operating leverage over time.\n\n\n\n\"Throughout our first post-merger operating year, we have worked to strengthen our balance sheet and streamline our operations. Our second quarter financial results reflect our progress and momentum on both fronts.\" stated James (\"Jimmy\") M. Burke, President and Chief Executive Officer of Shore Bancshares, Inc. \"Stable deposit balances and increasing asset yields drove NIM expansion and improving financial results built capital and supported loan growth. We continue to closely manage expenses and make investments that will improve operating leverage over time. Credit remains broadly stable and economic activity in our markets remains strong. We appreciate the focus and commitment of all our associates who continue to deliver outstanding service to our clients and our communities.\"\n\n___________________________________  \n---  \n(1) Reconciliations of the non–U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") measures are set forth at the end of this press release.  \n  \n**Balance Sheet Review**\n\nTotal assets were $5.9 billion at June 30, 2024, a decrease of $145 million or 2.4%, when compared to $6.0 billion at December 31, 2023. The aggregate decrease was primarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $233.5 million and investment securities held to maturity of $13.8 million partially offset by an increase in investment securities available for sale of $21.1 million and loans held for investment of $64.7 million. The ratio of the ACL to total loans increased slightly from 1.23% at December 31, 2023 to 1.24% at June 30, 2024. \n\nThe Company's tangible common equity ratio(1) at June 30, 2024 was 7.23% compared to 7.11% at December 31, 2023. The Company's Tier 1 and Total Risk-Based Capital Ratios at June 30, 2024 were 9.67% and 11.82%, respectively. The Bank's Tier 1 and Total Risk-Based Capital Ratios at June 30, 2024 were 10.45% and 11.69%, respectively. Non-owner occupied CRE loans as a percentage of the Bank's Tier 1 Capital + ACL at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were $2.1 billion or 368.7% and $2.0 billion or 382.6%, respectively. Construction loans as a percentage of the Bank's Tier 1 Capital + ACL at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were $327.9 million or 58.6% and $299.0 million or 56.7%, respectively.\n\nThe Bank's office CRE loan portfolio, which includes owner-occupied and non-owner occupied CRE loans, was $504.9 million or 10.7% of total loans of $4.7 billion at June 30, 2024. The Bank's office CRE loan portfolio included $141.1 million or 28.0% of the total with medical tenants and $72.9 million or 14.4% of the total with government or government contractor tenants. There were 507 loans in the office CRE portfolio with an average and median loan size of $1.0 million and $0.4 million, respectively. Loan to Value (\"LTV\") estimates for the office CRE portfolio are summarized below and LTV collateral values are based on the most recent appraisal, which varies from the initial loan boarding to interim credit reviews:\n\n**LTV Range** | **Loan Count** | **Loan Balance** | **% of Total CRE**  \n---|---|---|---  \nLess than or equal to 50% | 257 | $ 169,209 | 34 %  \n50%-60% | 67 | 131,378 | 26 %  \n60%-70% | 84 | 99,728 | 20 %  \n70%-80% | 74 | 87,971 | 17 %  \nGreater than 80% | 25 | 16,583 | 3 %  \nGrand Total | 507 | $ 504,869 | 100 %  \n  \nThe Bank had 18 office CRE loans totaling $164.1 million that were greater than $5.0 million at June 30, 2024, compared to 24 office CRE loans totaling $189.8 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease in this portfolio segment was the result of normal amortization and two large loan payoffs in the quarter. For the office CRE portfolio, at June 30, 2024, the average loan debt-service coverage ratio was 2.5x and average LTV was 51.0%. Of the office CRE portfolio balance, 74% is secured by properties in rural or suburban areas with limited exposure to metropolitan cities and 87% is secured by properties with five stories or less. Of the office CRE loans, $5.9 million will mature and $4.1 million of the office CRE loans will reprice prior to December 31, 2024. Of the office CRE loans, $2.1 million were classified as special mention or substandard at June 30, 2024.\n\nTotal deposits decreased $237.2 million, or 4.4% to $5.1 billion at June 30, 2024 when compared to December 31, 2023. The decrease in total deposits was primarily due to decreases in demand deposits of $507.0 million and money market and savings of $88.6 million, partially offset by increases in noninterest-bearing deposits of $329.2 million and time deposits of $29.2 million. The decrease in deposits is primarily attributable to seasonal municipal runoff and a decrease in interest rate-sensitive cannabis-related deposits. The increase in noninterest bearing deposits was significantly impacted by a transfer of $399.4 million of demand deposits which carried an average rate of four bps during the second quarter of 2024.\n\nTotal funding, which includes customer deposits, Federal Home Loan Bank (\"FHLB\") short and long-term advances, and brokered deposits remained flat at $5.2 billion at June 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024. The Bank had $81 million in total FHLB advances at June 30, 2024 compared to zero at March 31, 2024. These advances consisted of short-term direct rate credits of $31 million and an 18-month Bermuda Convertible of $50 million. The Bank's uninsured deposits at June 30, 2024 were $948.9 million or 18.43% of total deposits. The Bank's uninsured deposits, excluding deposits secured with pledged collateral, at June 30, 2024 were $819.4 million or 15.91% of total deposits. At June 30, 2024, the Bank had approximately $1.0 billion of available liquidity including: $138.9 million in cash, $894.3 million in secured borrowing capacity at the FHLB and other correspondent banks, and $95.0 million in unsecured lines of credit. \n\nTotal stockholders' equity increased $11.6 million, or 2.3%, when compared to December 31, 2023, primarily due to current year earnings, offset by cash dividends paid. As of June 30, 2024, the ratio of total equity to total assets was 8.92% and the ratio of total tangible equity to total tangible assets(1) was 7.23% compared to 8.50% and 6.78% at December 31, 2023, respectively.\n\n**Review of Quarterly Financial Results**\n\nNet interest income was $42.1 million for the second quarter of 2024, compared to $41.1 million for the first quarter of 2024 and $22.5 million for the second quarter of 2023. The increase in net interest income when compared to the first quarter of 2024 was primarily due to the increase in interest and fees on loans of $1.5 million and interest and dividends on investment securities of $0.8 million, partially offset by an increase in interest expense of $1.0 million. The increase in interest expense in the second quarter of 2024 was the result of carrying short-term advances from FHLB during the quarter to offset seasonal outflows from municipal customers of $1.5 million, partially offset by lower interest expense on deposits of $0.9 million. The increase when compared to the second quarter of 2023 was primarily due to the increase in interest and fees on loans of $34.6 million, interest and dividends on investment securities of $1.5 million and interest on deposits from other banks of $0.4 million, coupled with a decrease in interest on short-term borrowings of $1.9 million. These increases were partially offset by the increase in interest on deposits of $17.7 million and interest on long-term borrowings of $1.0 million all significantly impacted by the merger in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nThe Company's net interest margin increased to 3.11% for the second quarter of 2024 from 3.08% for the first quarter of 2024 primarily due to loans and securities repricing at a greater rate than deposits. The Company's cost of funds was positively impacted during the second quarter due to a shift from interest-bearing to noninterest-bearing deposits. Average interest-bearing deposits decreased $395.0 million, or 9.9% which resulted in $0.9 million less interest expense. These interest-bearing deposits were almost entirely replaced with an increase in the average balance on noninterest-bearing deposits of $317.4 million, or 27.3%. The Company's net interest margin increased to 3.11% for the second quarter of 2024 from 2.68% for the second quarter of 2023. Comparing the second quarter of 2024 to the second quarter of 2023, the Company's interest-earning asset yields increased 102 bps to 5.39% from 4.37%, while the cost of funds repriced at a slower pace resulting in an increase of 60 bps to 2.36% from 1.76% for the same period.\n\nThe provision for credit losses was $2.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The comparable amounts were $0.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and $0.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The increase in the provision for credit losses for the second quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2024 was due to new loan growth, a small increase in the Bank's CECL model loss factors and increases in specific reserves and charge-offs in the second quarter of 2024. Coverage ratios were 1.24% and 1.23% at June 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively. The increase in the provision for credit losses when compared to the second quarter of 2023 was primarily due to an updated CECL model in the third quarter of 2023 due to the merger. Net charge-offs for the second quarter of 2024 were $0.9 million compared to net charge-offs of $0.6 million for the first quarter of 2024 and net charge offs of $50,000 for the second quarter of 2023.\n\nAt June 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, nonperforming assets were $18.4 million, or 0.31% of total assets and $16.4 million, or 0.28% of total assets, respectively. The balance of nonperforming assets increased primarily due to an increase in assets held for sale of $1.1 million and an increase of $1.1 million in loans 90 days past due and still accruing. When comparing June 30, 2024 to June 30, 2023, nonperforming assets increased $13.7 million, primarily due to increases in nonaccrual loans of $11.4 million, an increase in repossessed marine loans and assets held for sale of $2.9 million, and an increase of $0.7 million in loans 90 days past due and still accruing almost entirely impacted by the merger in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nTotal noninterest income for the second quarter of 2024 was $8.4 million, an increase of $1.9 million from $6.6 million for the first quarter of 2024 and an increase $3.1 million from $5.3 million for the second quarter of 2023. The increase from the first quarter of 2024 was primarily due to improved mortgage banking revenue. In addition, both Wye Financial Partners, the Bank's wealth management division, and the Mid-Maryland Title Company, Inc. (the \"title company\") have experienced improved revenue streams due to increased activity. The increase from the second quarter of 2023 was due to higher revenue among almost all revenue line items, a direct result of the merger in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nTotal noninterest expense of $33.5 million for the second quarter of 2024 decreased $3.2 million when compared to the first quarter of 2024 expense of $36.7 million and increased $11.9 million when compared to the second quarter of 2023 expense of $21.6 million. The decrease from the first quarter of 2024 was primarily due to a credit card fraud loss of $4.3 million in the first quarter of 2024, partially offset by an increase in salaries and wages of $1.5 million. The increase from the second quarter of 2023 was primarily due to the operation of a larger branch network and employee base due to the merger, which significantly impacted almost all expense line items. In addition, despite the increased size, the Company has prudently reduced its staff by approximately 72 FTE's since the consummation of the merger. The efficiency ratio for the second quarter of 2024 when compared to the first quarter of 2024 and the second quarter of 2023 was 66.23%, 76.93% and 77.76%, respectively. Furthermore, Non-GAAP efficiency ratios(1) for the same periods were 61.05%, 62.37% and 71.75%, respectively. The net operating expense ratio,which is non-interest expense less non-interest income divided by average assets, for the second quarter 2024 was 1.73%, compared to 2.10% and 1.82% for the first quarter of 2024 and the second quarter of 2023, respectively. The Non-GAAP net operating expense ratio, which excludes core deposit intangible amortization and non-recurring activity, for the second quarter 2024 was 1.55%, compared to 1.62% and 1.64% for the first quarter of 2024 and the second quarter of 2023, respectively.\n\n**Review of Six Month Financial Results**\n\nNet interest income for the first six months of 2024 was $83.3 million, an increase of $35.1 million, or 72.9%, when compared to the first six months of 2023. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to an increase in total interest income of $72.6 million, or 101.2%, which included an increase in interest and fees on loans of $69.5 million, or 109.3%. The increase of interest and fees on loans was primarily due to the increase in the average balance of loans of $2.0 billion, or 75.9%, and an increase in net accretion income of $6.7 million due to the merger. Increases to net interest income were partially offset by increased total interest expense of $37.4 million, or 159.0%, primarily due to increases in the cost of funds and in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits of $1.6 billion, or 76.8%. All of these increases were largely due to the merger.\n\nThe Company's net interest margin increased to 3.09% for 2024 from 2.93% for 2023, primarily due to recent loan growth and repricing of earning assets, higher net accretion due to the merger, a positive shift in lower cost deposits and an overall stabilized funding base. The increase in the average balance and yields earned on average earning assets of $2.1 billion and 100 bps, respectively, were partially offset by increases in the average balance and rates paid on interest-bearing deposits of $1.6 billion and 136 bps, respectively. The average balance on noninterest-bearing deposits increased $522.7 million, or 65.4%. Net accretion income impacted the increased net interest margin by 27 bps and five bps for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Until the balance sheet restructuring in the third quarter of 2024, the net interest margin experienced compression due to the Company's liability sensitive position, deposit rate pressures and significantly higher FHLB borrowing rates.\n\nThe provision for credit losses for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 was $2.5 million and $1.9 million, respectively. The increase in the provision for credit losses for 2024 was due to higher levels of reserves required by the Company's CECL model and higher net charge-offs. Net charge offs for the six months ended June 30, 2024 were $1.5 million compared to net recoveries of $70,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2023.\n\nTotal noninterest income for the six months ended June 30, 2024 increased $4.4 million or 41.2%, when compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in noninterest income was experienced among almost all revenue line items. These increases were attributable to the increased size and scale of the Company following the merger as well as strategic initiatives to improve business line operations and profitability.\n\nTotal noninterest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2024 increased $27.7 million, or 65.2%, when compared to the same period in 2023. Almost all noninterest expense line items increased as a result of the merger and the expanded operations of the newly combined Company. There were no merger-related expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $1.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The Company continues to focus on streamlining processes to unlock operational efficiencies and reduce overall noninterest expenses.\n\n**Shore Bancshares Information**\n\nShore Bancshares is a financial holding company headquartered in Easton, Maryland and is the parent company of Shore United Bank, N.A.

Reports 2024 First Quarter Financial Results\n\nCompany Release -\n\n5/2/2024 4:15 PM ET\n\nDownload the PDF version PDF Format (opens in new window)\n\nEASTON, Md., May 2, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Shore Bancshares, Inc. (NASDAQ - SHBI) (the \"Company\" or \"Shore Bancshares\"), the holding company for Shore United Bank, N.A. (the \"Bank\" or \"SUB\") reported net income for the first quarter of 2024 of $8.2 million or $0.25 per diluted common share compared to a net income of $10.5 million or $0.32 per diluted common share for the fourth quarter of 2023, and net income of $6.5 million or $0.32 per diluted common share for the first quarter of 2023.\n\n[ ![Shore Bancshares Logo \\(PRNewsfoto/Shore Bancshares, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/803952/Shore_Bancshares_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/803952/Shore_Bancshares_Logo.html)\n\n**First****Quarter 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * **Credit Card Fraud** - On April 2, 2024, the Bank detected that it had been subjected to fraudulent credit card account openings during the first quarter of 2024 and commenced an investigation. Bad actors used stolen personal information to open Bank-issued credit cards through the Bank's online credit card activation system. The personal information used had been stolen from individuals who are not customers of the Bank. No existing Bank customers were impacted by this fraudulent activity and the Bank's core processing system was not compromised. Upon detection, the Bank immediately closed all fraudulently-opened credit card accounts and suspended all credit card activations. The Bank will not open new credit card accounts until its investigation is complete. The Bank is implementing enhanced activity monitoring on all existing cards outstanding.As a result of the fraudulent activity, the Company recognized a $4.3 million fraud-related expense in the first quarter of 2024 and does not anticipate additional losses related to this event. The majority of the fraud loss, approximately $3.6 million, or 84%, occurred between March 25, 2024 and April 2, 2024. In coordination with the Bank's credit card processor, management is evaluating the root causes of the fraud event and the preventative and monitoring controls that would have mitigated the fraud loss. Management will also consider in this evaluation whether the credit card product can attain the size and scale needed in the near-term for the Bank to continue as an issuer. The Bank has notified and is actively working with law enforcement to recover a portion of the fraud losses by various means.The above information was reported on the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with SEC on April 30, 2024 describing the event. The impact of this event resulted in a $0.10 decrease to basic and diluted earnings per share.\n  * **Return on Average Assets (\"ROAA\")** - The Company reported ROAA of 0.57% for the first quarter of 2024, compared to 0.72% and 0.75% for the fourth and first quarters of 2023, respectively. Excluding the fraud expense, amortization from core deposit intangibles, and merger-related expenses the Company's Non-GAAP, ROAA was 0.94% for the first quarter of 2024, compared to 0.88% and 0.84% for the fourth and first quarters of 2023, respectively.\n  * **Stable Net****Interest Margin** - Net interest margin (\"NIM\") remained relatively stable at 3.08% for the first quarter of 2024 from 3.09% for the fourth quarter of 2023. Excluding net accretion interest income of $3.6 million and $3.0 million for the same time periods, NIM decreased six basis points to 2.81% for the first quarter of 2024 from 2.87% for the fourth quarter of 2023.\n  * **Active Management of Deposit Costs** - Decreases in rates on higher cost deposit relationships mitigated margin compression in the first quarter of 2024. For the month of March 2024, asset yields grew more quickly than funding costs which positively impacted the Company's net interest margin and may position the Bank to see positive margin movement during the second quarter of 2024. As a result of decreased rates paid on some deposits and expected seasonal cash outflows in the first quarter of 2024, deposits decreased $201.8 million, or 3.7% to $5.2 billion at March 31, 2024 when compared to December 31, 2023. Liquidity remained relatively stable with the loan to deposit ratio modestly increasing from 86.2% at December 31, 2023 to 89.7% at March 31, 2024. The Bank had no brokered deposits or advances at March 31, 2024.\n  * **Stable Credit Trends** - The Company's total nonperforming assets to total assets for the first quarter of 2024 was 0.28% compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 of 0.23%. The Company's credit quality metrics remain at historical lows with no signs of significant deterioration or systemic issues within its loan portfolios.\n  * **Branch Closings and Office Space Rationalization** - The Company expects to close two branches by the end of the third quarter and to consolidate two office buildings into a single space by the end of the third quarter.\n\n\n\n\"While the first quarter's credit card fraud was disappointing, I am pleased with the response of our team after the incident was identified to contain the problem, and that no customers were impacted,\" stated James (\"Jimmy\") M. Burke, President and Chief Executive Officer of Shore Bancshares, Inc. \"We are undertaking a comprehensive review of the incident to recover as much of the fraudulent charges as possible and are evaluating our options regarding the future of an in-house credit card program.\"\n\nBurke continued, \"Active balance sheet management in the first quarter resulted in stabilizing margins and net interest income while continued focus on reducing expenses is expected to enhance future operating leverage. Credit remains stable and we believe we are well positioned to deliver improving profitability in future quarters.\"\n\n**Balance Sheet Review**\n\nTotal assets were $5.8 billion at March 31, 2024, a decrease of $185 million or 3.1%, when compared to $6.0 billion at December 31, 2023. The aggregate decrease was primarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $257.9 million and investment securities held to maturity of $9.4 million partially offset by an increase in investment securities available for sale of $69.0 million and loans held for investment of $7.7 million. The ratio of the Allowance for Credit Losses (\"ACL\") to total loans decreased slightly from 1.24% at December 31, 2023, to 1.23% at March 31, 2024. \n\nThe Company's tangible common equity ratio at March 31, 2024 was 7.11% compared to 6.78% at December 31, 2023. The Company's Tier 1 and Total Risk-Based Capital Ratios at March 31, 2024 were 9.53% and 11.68%, respectively. The Bank's Tier 1 and Total Risk-Based Capital Ratios at March 31, 2024 were 10.32% and 11.56%, respectively. Non-owner occupied commercial real estate (\"CRE\") loans as a percentage of the Bank's Tier 1 Capital + ACL at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were $2.0 billion or 370.0% and $2.0 billion or 382.6%, respectively. Construction loans as a percentage of the Bank's Tier 1 Capital + ACL at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were $299.1 million or 54.9% and $299.0 million or 56.7%, respectively.\n\nThe Bank's office CRE loan portfolio, which includes owner-occupied and nonowner-occupied CRE loans, was $516.0 million or 11.1% of total loans of $4.6 billion at March 31, 2024. The Bank's office CRE loan portfolio included $137.7 million or 26.7% of the total with medical tenants and $73.3 million or 14.2% of the total with government or government contractor tenants. There were 513 loans in the office CRE portfolio with an average and median loan size of $1.0 million and $0.4 million, respectively. Loan to Value (\"LTV\") estimates are less than 70% for $395.8 million or 76.7% of the office CRE portfolio and less than 80% for $490.4 million or 95.0% of the office CRE portfolio.\n\nThe Bank had 19 office CRE loans totaling $172.0 million that were greater than $5.0 million at March 31, 2024, compared to 24 office CRE loans totaling $189.8 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease in this portfolio segment was the result of normal amortization and a two large loan payoffs in the quarter. For the office CRE portfolio, at March 31, 2024, the average loan debt-service coverage ratio was 1.7x and average LTV was 57.6%. Of the office CRE portfolio balance, 73% is secured by properties in rural or suburban areas with limited exposure to metropolitan cities and 92% are secured by properties with five stories or less. Of the office CRE loans, $5.8 million will mature and $5.1 million of the office CRE loans will reprice prior to December 31, 2024. Of the office CRE loans, $2.2 million are special mention or substandard.\n\nTotal deposits decreased $201.8 million, or 3.7% to $5.2 billion at March 31, 2024 when compared to December 31, 2023. The decrease in total deposits was primarily due to a decrease in time deposits of $15.3 million, demand deposits of $63.6 million, money market and savings of $65.6 million and noninterest-bearing deposits of $57.4 million. The decrease in deposits is primarily attributable to seasonal municipal runoff and disintermediation of interest-sensitive cannabis-related deposits.\n\nTotal funding, which includes customer deposits, Federal Home Loan Bank (\"FHLB\") advances, and brokered deposits decreased $246.3 million from $5.4 billion at December 31, 2023 to $5.2 billion at March 31, 2024. The Bank had no FHLB advances at March 31, 2024 or December 31, 2023 and reduced brokered deposits from $44.5 million at December 31, 2023 to zero at March 31, 2024. The Bank's uninsured deposits at March 31, 2024 were $981.3 million or 18.93% of total deposits. The Bank's uninsured deposits, excluding deposits secured with pledged collateral, at March 31, 2024 were $825.9 million or 15.93% of total deposits. At March 31, 2024, the Bank had approximately $1.2 billion of available liquidity including: $114.6 million in cash, $1.1 billion in secured borrowing capacity at the FHLB and other correspondent banks, and $45.0 million in unsecured lines of credit. \n\nTotal stockholders' equity increased $4.1 million, or 0.8%, when compared to December 31, 2023, primarily due to current year earnings, offset by the cash dividend paid. As of March 31, 2024, the ratio of total equity to total assets was 8.84% and the ratio of total tangible equity to total tangible assets was 7.11% compared to 8.50% and 6.78% at December 31, 2023, respectively.\n\nManagement continues to pursue opportunities to increase efficiencies and decrease expenses as a percentage of operating revenues. Following feasibility assessments, management decided to close two branches by the end of the third quarter, subject to regulatory approval. The Onley, VA branch should close on or about July 17, 2024 and the Westgate branch located in Annapolis, MD should close on or about September 30, 2024. Limited growth opportunities within the Eastern Shore of Virginia and a conscientious focus on profitability led to the decision to close the Onley branch. The Westgate branch has limited foot traffic and is located less than a mile from another SUB branch within the City of Annapolis. Customer disruption is expected to be limited. These closures are estimated to cost $0.2 million. The Company is expected to reduce four positions as part of these closings\n\nAdditionally, the Company plans to reduce professional office space located in Easton, MD. By the end of the third quarter, a newly renovated office building is expected to be put into service eliminating the need for two currently-occupied office buildings. In the second quarter, the Company expects to begin marketing for sale the two redundant office properties. Recent appraisals on these properties exceed the Bank's cost bases resulting in no impairment. At the present time the two properties remain in service, are not listed for immediate sale, and are classified as active assets on our balance sheet. Once these properties meet the accounting criteria they will be moved to held for sale.\n\n**Review of Quarterly Financial Results**\n\nNet interest income was $41.1 million for the first quarter of 2024, compared to $41.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 and $25.7 million for the first quarter of 2023. The decrease in net interest income when compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 was primarily due to the increase in interest expense of $0.4 million resulting from an increase in the average balance of interest bearing deposits of $70.9 million. The increase when compared to the first quarter of 2023 was primarily due to the increase in interest and fees on loans, interest on deposits from other banks, a decrease in interest on short-term borrowings partially offset by the increase in interest on deposits and interest on long-term borrowings all significantly impacted by the merger of equals with TCFC in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nThe Company's net interest margin decreased slightly to 3.08% for the first quarter of 2024 from 3.09% for the fourth quarter of 2023 primarily due to an increase in the overall mix of interest-bearing deposits compared to noninterest-bearing deposits. Average interest-bearing deposits increased $70.9 million which resulted in a two basis point rate increase. In addition to the change in deposit mix, rates on money market and time deposits also increased, which were partly offset by lower rates on demand deposits. The Company's net interest margin decreased to 3.08% for the first quarter of 2024 from 3.18% for the first quarter of 2023. Comparing the first quarter of 2024 to the first quarter of 2023, the Company's interest-earning asset yields increased 98 basis points to 5.32% from 4.34%, while the cost of funds repriced at a faster pace resulting in an increase of 109 basis points to 2.31% from 1.22% for the same period.\n\nThe provision for credit losses was $0.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The comparable amounts were $0.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, and $1.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease in the provision for credit losses for the first quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 was primarily related to more optimistic short-term forecasts for unemployment and Gross Domestic Product (\"GDP\"). Coverage ratios were 1.23% and 1.24% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The decrease in the provision for credit losses when compared to the first quarter of 2023 was primarily due to improved economic factors and forecasts. Net charge-offs for the first quarter of 2024 were $0.6 million compared to net charge-offs of $0.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 and net charge offs of $20,000 for the first quarter of 2023.\n\nAt March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, nonperforming assets were $16.4 million or 0.28% of total assets and $13.7 million, or 0.23% of total assets, respectively. The balance of nonperforming assets increased primarily due to an increase in repossessed marine loans of $1.8 million and an increase of $0.8 million in loans 90 days past due and still accruing. When comparing March 31, 2024 to March 31, 2023, nonperforming assets increased $13.7 million, primarily due to increases in nonaccrual loans of $10.9 million, an increase in repossessed marine loans of $1.8 million, and an increase of $0.9 million in loans 90 days past due and still accruing almost entirely impacted by the merger with TCFC in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nTotal noninterest income for the first quarter of 2024 was $6.6 million, a decrease of $1.0 million from $7.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 and an increase $1.2 million from $5.3 million for the first quarter of 2023. The decrease from the fourth quarter of 2023 was primarily due to other noninterest income which included decreases in other fees on bank services and other loan fee income, decreases in mortgage banking revenue and trust and investment fee income. The increase from the first quarter of 2023 was primarily due to other noninterest income which included increases in other loan fee income, gains on life insurance contracts, an increase in credit card income, increases in trust and investment fee income and interchange credits all a result of the merger in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nTotal noninterest expense of $36.7 million for the first quarter of 2024 increased $3.0 million when compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 expense of $33.7 million and increased $15.8 million when compared to the first quarter of 2023 expense of $20.9 million. The increase from the fourth quarter of 2023 was primarily due to credit card fraud expense of $4.3 million, and an increase in employee benefits of $0.7 million partially offset by decreases in salaries and wages expense of $1.0 million, merger related expenses of $0.6 million, and FDIC insurance premium expense of $0.6 million. The increase from the first quarter of 2023 was primarily due to the operation of a larger branch network due to the merger with TCFC which significantly impacted almost all expense line items. Unrelated to the merger were the fraud expenses in the first quarter of 2024 previously mentioned above.\n\n**Subsequent Event**\n\nOn May 1, 2024, the Company's board of directors declared a quarterly common stock dividend in the amount of $0.12 per share, payable May 31, 2024 to stockholders of record on May 16, 2024.\n\n**Shore Bancshares Information**\n\nShore Bancshares is a financial holding company headquartered in Easton, Maryland and is the parent company of Shore United Bank, N.A.
