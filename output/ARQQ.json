(Nasdaq: ARQQ, ARQQW) (“Arqit” or the “Company”), a global leader in quantum encryption technology, today announced that it has entered into a definitive securities purchase agreement with existing shareholders Heritage Assets SCSP, Notion Capital, Carlo Calabria, and Garth Ritchie (collectively, the “Purchasers”) for the sale and purchase of 5,440,000 of the Company’s ordinary shares, $0.000004 par value per share (the “Ordinary Shares”) at an offering price of $2.50 per Ordinary Share, in a registered direct offering (the “Offering”). Arqit director Manfredi Lefebvre d’Ovidio has shared investment and voting power over the shares held by Heritage Assets SCSP, existing Arqit shareholder Notion Capital is the beneficial owner of the Arqit shares held by Ropemaker Nominees Limited, and Carlo Calabria and Garth Ritchie are each directors of the Company.\n\nIn a concurrent private placement, Arqit will issue to the Purchasers unregistered warrants (the “Warrants”) to purchase up to 5,440,000 Ordinary Shares (the “Warrant Shares”), exercisable only upon the later of (i) one year from the issuance date of the Warrants, (ii) the date of the approval by the Company’s shareholders of an increase in authorized capital sufficient to permit the issuance of the Warrant Shares and (iii) the date that the closing trading price of the Ordinary Shares on the Nasdaq Capital Market has exceeded $5.00 for 60 consecutive trading days (such later date, the “Exercise Date”). The Warrants will be exercisable for a period of one year following the Exercise Date. The Warrants will terminate on the earlier of (x) 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the last day of the exercise period or (y) 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date falling five years after the date of issuance.\n\nThe gross proceeds of the Offering are expected to be approximately $13.6 million, before deducting Offering expenses. Arqit intends to use the net proceeds from this Offering for general corporate purposes. The Offering is expected to close on or about September 30, 2024, but in any case no later than October 9, 2024.\n\nA “shelf” registration statement on Form F-3, as amended (File Number 333-268786), relating to the offered Ordinary Shares was initially filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on 14 December 2022 and was declared effective on 30 December 2022. The Offering of Ordinary Shares is being made only by means of a prospectus, including a prospectus supplement, forming a part of an effective registration statement. A prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus relating to the Offering will be filed with the SEC. Electronic copies of the prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus may be obtained, when available, on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.\n\nThe unregistered Warrants and the Warrant Shares described above are being offered in a private placement under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and/or Regulation D promulgated thereunder. Accordingly, the Warrants and Warrant Shares may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an effective registration statement or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and such applicable state securities laws.\n\nThis press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any of these Company securities, nor shall there be any sale of these Company securities in any state or other jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or other jurisdiction.\n\n**Notes to Editors**\n\n**About Arqit**\n\nArqit Quantum Inc.

He has expertise in driving sustainable revenue growth and scaling businesses. He is an Operating Partner at Notion Capital, a leading European venture capital firm and early backer of Arqit. Mr. Leaver will act independently of Notion Capital in his role as CEO and at the direction of the Board of Directors. He has been advising Arqit on its go-to-market strategy as a consultant for the last six months so assumes his new role with understanding of the challenges and opportunities in front of the company.\n\nDavid Williams, Co-founder of Arqit commented: _“I take great pride in the on-going success of Arqit and see a bright future for the company. It has been a pleasure to get to know Andy over the last six months and he has already proven himself invaluable. I am confident he has the right mix of skills to lead Arqit through the next chapter of its journey.”_\n\nAndy Leaver, CEO added: _“The threat to existing encryption from quantum computers is well documented and Arqit is doing something genuinely transformational in its field. It has a wealth of opportunities ahead of it and I look forward to stewarding the company at this critical juncture. On behalf of myself and the Board of Directors, I would like to thank David for his leadership and drive which has built the foundation for Arqit’s success going forward.”_\n\n**Notes to Editors**\n\n**About Arqit**\n\nArqit Quantum Inc.

The new CUSIP for the ordinary shares will be G0567U 127.\n\nNo fractional ordinary shares will be issued as a result of the 25:1 Reverse Share Split. If a beneficial owner of ordinary shares would be entitled to receive a fractional share upon the implementation of the 25:1 Reverse Share Split, the Company will instead round up to the nearest whole number of ordinary shares.\n\nShareholders who hold ordinary shares in book entry form with the Company’s transfer agent, Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, do not need to take any action to receive their post-split ordinary shares. Shareholders who hold ordinary shares in “street name,” through a bank, broker or other nominee, will have their positions automatically adjusted to reflect the 25:1 Reverse Share Split, subject to such broker’s particular processes, and will not be required to take any action in connection with the 25:1 Reverse Share Split.\n\nAdditionally, as a result of the 25:1 Reverse Share Split, the number of ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of each outstanding warrant will automatically be decreased to reflect the effect of the 25:1 Reverse Share Split, and the exercise price of each such warrant will automatically be adjusted (to the nearest cent) by multiplying the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such reverse share split by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of ordinary shares purchasable upon the exercise of the warrants immediately prior to such reverse share split and the denominator of which is the number of ordinary shares purchasable immediately after the 25:1 Reverse Share Split, pursuant to the terms of such warrants.\n\nBy implementing the 25:1 Reverse Share Split, the Company expects to regain compliance with Nasdaq’s minimum $1.00 bid price per share requirement. The Company was first notified by Nasdaq of its failure to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive trading days under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) on October 19, 2023, and was given 180 calendar days, until April 16, 2024, to regain compliance. On April 18, 2024, the Company received an extension of another 180-calendar-day compliance period until October 14, 2024, to regain compliance.\n\n**About Arqit**\n\nArqit Quantum Inc.

(Nasdaq: ARQQ, ARQQW) (“Arqit”), a leader in quantum safe encryption, today announced its operational and financial results for the six months ended 31 March 2024.\n\n**Recent Operational Highlights**\n\n  * Arqit sells Symmetric Key Agreement (“SKA”) software enabling quantum safe encryption. The company has re-branded its flagship product from QuantumCloud™ to SKA Platform™ to more precisely reflect its offering which no longer contains any hardware or quantum effects – it is a pure software tech stack which runs in the cloud. \n  * During the first half of fiscal year 2024, nine existing customers renewed or increased commitments to buy Arqit software under existing contracts. All customer contracts maturing during the period were renewed or extended. \n  * Several transactions that were expected to bill in the period slipped into the second half of the fiscal year. Following the end of the first half of the fiscal year, Arqit entered into several new transactions and contract expansions that are expected to result in revenue recognised during the second half of the fiscal year. \n  * After the period end we were notified of the award, following a competition, of a seven figure multi-year contract with a government customer in the EMEA region, our first such contract. \n  * Three new major telcos operators agreed to or launched initial test installations and several others are in planning, suggesting market adoption is now accelerating. \n  * In April, Arqit announced that an integration of its software with Intel for out-of-the-box post-quantum cryptography solutions using Arqit’s SKA Platform™ running on Intel Xeon Scalable processors. Arqit believes it represents the world’s first quantum-safe, 1.89 Tb IPsec solution. The product is currently available for sale and joint commercial efforts are underway. Arqit views this as a very significant milestone and a key differentiator against competition. \n  * Arqit’s TradeSecure™ offering which provides a symmetric key agreement solution for digital assets, specifically trade finance documents, announced in April 2024 additional partners to bring Arqit TradeSecure™ to market: \n    * Lux Kapitalmarkt Management AG (LuxAG) has entered into a partnership with Arqit and TraxPay to invest in digital negotiable instruments. This partnership will help to facilitate liquidity in the supply chain finance market.\n    * Vayana TradeXchange’s marketplace for global trade finance will use Arqit TradeSecure™ technology to transform international supply chains. Vayana TradeXchange is part of Vayana Group, one of India’s largest regulated networks for domestic supply chain finance.\n  * Following the launch of our TradeSecure™ product with supply chain platforms and credit funds signing agreements to provide vendor financing, a number of transactions are currently under negotiation.\n  * Telecom Italia Sparkle announced the successful completion of a quantum-safe VPN test, preliminary to a large-scale commercial launch. TI Sparkle is one of the largest Tier 1 Internet providers in the world. It owns and manages a network of more than 600,000 km of fibre.\n\n\n  * Arqit announced one additional OEM relationship (Intel) bringing total OEM partners or relationships to three; and announced additional reseller relationships with Phalanx, Total Computers, LuxAG and Vayana TradeXchange bringing total reseller relationships to 12. Arqit also has four distributor relationships. \n  * During the period, Arqit made significant progress in generating positive evaluation of its technology by major government organisations which are influential in the development and adoption of technological standards, particularly for cyber security. Arqit expects to report more fully on this in future periods. \n  * During this period, Arqit announced that Arqit’s SKA Platform™ meets the National Security Agency (NSA) Commercial Solutions for Classified (CSfC) Symmetric Key Management Requirements Annex V2.0 and uses an NSA approved Key Generation Solution (KGS) to generate and manage pre-shared keys. The SKA Platform has been integrated into NIAP validated CSfC components which deliver a significant competitive advantage for national security systems. As such, there is a growing interest from OEM partners and telcos for incorporation into government contracts. Arqit is positively engaged with a number of national security and cyber agencies. \n  * Arqit won two Global Mobility awards at Mobile World Congress in February 2024. The company took home the top honour in the CTO Choice: Outstanding Mobile Technology Award category, which was voted on by CTO’s across the industry, including those from the world’s major mobile phone companies. The award was for a secure 5G solution that was developed in collaboration between Arqit, Hewlett Packard Aruba and Ampliphae. The collaboration also won the award for Best Mobile Security Solution. \n  * During the first half of fiscal 2024, after a comprehensive sale process failed to result in a transaction for its satellite division, Arqit discontinued its satellite construction program. All costs associated with the program have been eliminated, and assets and liabilities related to the program have been classified as discontinued operations. There is no longer any hardware element to Arqit’s activities – the company is solely focused on selling its SKA Software. \n  * In April, Arqit was informed by Nasdaq that it was eligible for an additional 180 day period in order to regain compliance with Nasdaq minimum bid price requirements. \n  * In May 2024, Arqit commenced a cost reduction initiative across all business functions which will include the elimination of significant headcount. These cost reduction actions have begun in accordance with local laws in each of the relevant jurisdictions. Pro forma for the cost reduction initiative, Arqit will have 81 employees as compared to 125 at the end of the reporting period. In addition, the company has undertaken actions to rationalize its office space to further reduce costs. These cost reduction initiatives are expected to result in a 40% decrease in monthly budgeted operating costs to approximately $1.8 million commencing July from previously budgeted monthly operating costs of approximately $3.0 million. As of 31 March 2024, Arqit had $21.3 million of cash and cash equivalents. \n  * In December 2022, Arqit established an at-the-market equity offering program (the “ATM Program”) pursuant to which it may issue and sell ordinary shares with an aggregate offering amount of up to $50.0 million. Effective 15 April 2024, Arqit amended its ATM Program reducing the aggregate offering amount to $29.0 million. As a result, the remaining balance available for issuance, net of amounts issued in previous periods, is $17.5 million. Arqit did not issue any shares under the ATM Program during the first half of fiscal year 2024. \n  * After the close of the fiscal period, $0.9 million in gross proceeds from an equity subscription from D2BW Limited, an entity controlled by Arqit’s founders, was received. \n\n\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\nThere is increasing market awareness of the need for Post Quantum Cryptography by cyber security technology vendors and customers. Arqit’s technology has been selected by several important OEM partners and customers and has been well received in on-going government evaluations. Important new industry voices are amplifying the suitability of Arqit’s Symmetric Key Agreement Platform:\n\n  * In May, Intel published a detailed white paper describing the technical merits of the integration of Arqit SKA technology with Intel processers to address the store now, decrypt later threat and launched commercial sale of the integration. \n  * In May, Industrial Data Corporation, in partnership with Arqit, independently reviewed and published a research note describing the positive merits of Arqit’s products. \n  * In February, the GSMA conference publisher released a paper describing the need for and suitability of Arqit’s products for the mobile phone industry. \n  * In May 2022, the NSA/NIAP mandated that all providers of VPNs working under NSA Commercial Solutions for Classified accreditation must incorporate an industry standard called RFC8784 which describes a method for injecting Symmetric Keys into VPNs. Arqit believes it has the only cloud software method capable of meeting this requirement with provable security and Zero Trust Network Architecture. \n\n\n\nIndependent market research suggests that around a third of respondents are actively implementing post-quantum cryptography or are planning to do so in the next twelve months. Although the pace of market adoption has lagged our expectations, the traction we are seeing in defence and telcos is supportive of this research.\n\nAs a result of growing market adoption and improving customer engagement, Arqit expects to begin generating more significant and consistent revenues by the end of the first half of the 2025 fiscal year.\n\nThe imperative for stronger encryption emanating from organizations such as The White House and NSA is resonating with the marketplace. The benefits of symmetric key agreement encryption versus alternative methods of enhanced encryption are being recognized as well. Increased market awareness and recognition of the efficacy of SKA are favourable to prospective demand for Arqit SKA Platform™.\n\nArqit’s collaboration with Intel and awarding of the CTO Choice: Outstanding Mobile Technology Award at the Mobile World Congress support our belief in the prospective demand for Arqit SKA Platform™. Initial discussion to public announcement of integration with Intel Xeon Scalable processors occurred in less than three months – which Arqit believes demonstrates belief and intent by a market leader in chip technology in the need for and the efficacy of Arqit SKA Platform™.\n\nAs previously announced, Arqit is focusing its resources on delivering its applications NetworkSecure™, TradeSecure™ and WalletSecure™. The end customers for these products are broadly governments, network operators (e.g. telcos) and financial institutions. Each end customer base is of scale and financial wherewithal. However, these organizations also are deliberate in matters of adopting new technology solutions. Our revenue generation for the first half of fiscal 2024 is not reflective of the depth and breadth of engagements which Arqit has with numerous potential end customers. Several expected upgrades to existing contracts and several expected new contracts, all meaningful to revenue growth, which were expected in the period slipped into the second half of the fiscal year. We take comfort from the renewal of all contracts that were due to expire during the period and increased commitments by several of our existing customers.\n\nArqit continues to focus on minimizing its cost structure as we work toward increased revenue generation. The additional cost reduction initiatives commenced in early May reflects management’s commitment to taking necessary measures to give Arqit the runway to succeed.\n\nCommenting, David Williams, Arqit Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer said: “While revenue generation lagged our expectations, Arqit has made significant progress in the period in making new installations with government, telcos and financial services customers. Conversion of these engagements to significant revenue is our relentless focus.\n\nWe see additional opportunities for end customers to consume our product through our collaboration with Intel. We are excited about this recent development which builds upon our other OEM integrations, distribution and reseller relationships.\n\nMy conviction in the prospects for Arqit remains high. The purchase of shares by D2BW Limited, an entity I own along with my co-founder, David Bestwick, in April reflects our conviction that Arqit’s SKA Platform™ is the solution for stronger, simpler encryption.”\n\n**First Half of Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\nThe following is a summary of Arqit’s operating results for the six month period ended 31 March 2024. Comparison is made, where applicable, to the comparable period ended 31 March 2023.\n\n  * Generated $119 thousand in Revenue for the first half of fiscal year 2024 as compared to $19 thousand for the comparable period in 2023.\n  * Arqit generated Revenue during the period from Arqit SKA (PaaS)™, Arqit NetworkSecureTM (firewall) and professional services. Nine customers during the period increased or renewed existing contracts. All contracts due to expire during the period were renewed. No contracts were terminated. Arqit executed on three contracts for Arqit SKA (PaaS)™, four contracts for Arqit NetworkSecureTM and four contracts for professional services.\n  * Arqit’s SKA Private Instance product involves the sale of an initial Integration License which allows customers to set up the platform. The full commercial use of that platform results in new revenues from the sale of end point license bundles which are then expected to become recurring after the initial Integration License period. Arqit sold two such licenses in the fiscal period ending 30 September 2023. Arqit expected to generate new Integration License sales in the period ending 31 March 2024 but these sales opportunities slipped into the second half of the fiscal year.\n  * For the comparable period in 2023, Arqit SKA Platform™ Revenue totalled $19 thousand from two contracts.\n  * Administrative Expenses1 for the period were $16.8 million versus $25.4 million for the comparable period in 2023. Lower employee costs resulting from headcount reduction and attrition were the primary drivers of lower Administrative Expenses. Arqit ended the period with headcount of 125 employees versus 170 at 31 March 2023. Pro forma for cost reduction activities initiated after the close of the financial period, Arqit’s pro forma headcount will be 81. Administrative expense for the period includes a $293 thousand non-cash credit for share based compensation versus a $8.3 million non-cash charge for the comparable period in 2023.\n  * Operating loss for the period was $16.6 million versus a loss of $25.4 million for the first half of fiscal year 2023. The variance in operating loss between periods primarily reflects lower Administrative Expenses resulting from cost actions.\n  * Loss before tax was $16.1 million. Adjusted loss before tax was $16.1 million2 which in management’s view reflects the underlying business performance once the non-cash change in warrant value is deducted from loss before tax. For the comparable period in fiscal year 2023, profit before tax was $12.6 million and adjusted loss before tax was $34.7m million. The variance between periods is primarily due to the change in fair value of warrants and cost actions.\n  * During the six months ended March 31, 2024, Arqit determined that its satellite assets were no longer considered as “held for sale”. As a result, the satellite assets have been fully impaired, and an impairment loss was recognized as part of “loss from discontinued operations, net of tax” for the six months ended March 31, 2024.\n  * Arqit ended the first half of fiscal 2024 with a cash and cash equivalents of $21.3 million versus a cash balance of $44.5 million as of Arqit’s 30 September 2023 fiscal year end.\n  * During the period 4,481,825 restricted share units were granted under Arqit’s equity incentive plan. A total of 10,280,849 restricted share units and 8,004,817 options, have been granted to employees, officers and directors under the plan to date.\n\n\n\n________________________1 Administrative expenses are equivalent to operating expenses.2 Adjusted loss before tax is a non-IFRS measure. For a discussion of this measure, how its calculated and a reconciliation to the most comparable measure calculated in accordance with IFRS, please see “Use of Non-IFRS Financial Measures” below.\n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nArqit will host a conference call at 11:00 a.m. ET / 8:00 a.m. PT on 20 May 2024 with the Company’s Founder, Chairman and CEO, David Williams, and CFO, Nick Pointon.

Although Arqit's management uses this measure as an aid in monitoring Arqit's on-going financial performance, investors should consider adjusted loss before tax in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial performance measures prepared in accordance with IFRS. Adjusted loss before tax is defined as loss before tax excluding change in fair value of warrants, which is non-cash. There are limitations associated with the use of non-IFRS financial measures, including that such measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies due to potential differences among calculation methodologies. There can be no assurance whether (i) items excluded from the non-IFRS financial measures will occur in the future, or (ii) there will be cash costs associated with items excluded from the non-IFRS financial measures. Arqit compensates for these limitations by using adjusted loss before tax as a supplement to IFRS loss before tax and by providing the reconciliation for adjusted loss before tax to IFRS loss before tax, as the most comparable IFRS financial measure.\n\n**IFRS and Non-IFRS loss before tax**\n\nArqit presents its consolidated statement of comprehensive income according to IFRS and in line with SEC guidance. Consequently, the changes in warrant values are included within that statement in arriving at loss before tax. The changes in warrant values are non-cash. After this adjustment is made to Arqit’s IFRS loss before tax of $16.1 million, Arqit’s non-IFRS adjusted loss before tax is $16.1 million, as shown in the reconciliation table below.\n\n**Six month periodended 31 March2024****$’000** |  **Six month periodended 31 March2023****$’000**  \n---|---  \nLoss before tax on an IFRS basis | $ | (16,105 | ) | $ | (21,836 | )  \nChange in fair value of warrants | $1 | $(12,910 | )  \n**Adjusted loss before tax** | **$** | **(16,104** | **)** | **$** | **(34,746** | **)**  \n  \nThe change in fair value of warrants arises as IFRS requires our outstanding warrants to be carried at fair value within liabilities with the change in value from one reporting date to the next being reflected against profit or loss in the period. It is non-cash and will cease when the warrants are exercised, are redeemed, or expire.\n\n**Other Accounting Information**\n\nAs of 31 March 2024, we had $26.5 million of total liabilities, $8 thousand of which related to our outstanding warrants, which are classified as liabilities rather than equity according to IFRS and SEC guidance. The warrant liability amount reflected in our consolidated statement of financial position is calculated as the fair value of the warrants as of 31 March 2024. Our liabilities other than warrant liabilities were $26.5 million, and we had total assets of $41.8 million including cash of $23.3 million.\n\n**Caution About Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis communication includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, may be forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on Arqit’s expectations and beliefs concerning future events and involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations. These factors are difficult to predict accurately and may be beyond Arqit’s control. Forward-looking statements in this communication or elsewhere speak only as of the date made. New uncertainties and risks arise from time to time, and it is impossible for Arqit to predict these events or how they may affect it. Except as required by law, Arqit does not have any duty to, and does not intend to, update or revise the forward-looking statements in this communication or elsewhere after the date this communication is issued. In light of these risks and uncertainties, investors should keep in mind that results, events or developments discussed in any forward-looking statement made in this communication may not occur. Uncertainties and risk factors that could affect Arqit’s future performance and cause results to differ from the forward-looking statements in this release include, but are not limited to: (i) the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against the Arqit, (ii) the ability to maintain the listing of Arqit’s securities on a national securities exchange, (iii) changes in the competitive and regulated industries in which Arqit operates, variations in operating performance across competitors and changes in laws and regulations affecting Arqit’s business, (iv) the ability to implement business plans, forecasts, and other expectations, and identify and realise additional opportunities, (v) the potential inability of Arqit to successfully deliver its operational technology, (vi) the risk of interruption or failure of Arqit’s information technology and communications system, (vii) the enforceability of Arqit’s intellectual property, and (viii) other risks and uncertainties set forth in the sections entitled “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in Arqit’s annual report on Form 20-F (the “Form 20-F”), filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on 21 November 2023 and in subsequent filings with the SEC. While the list of factors discussed above and in the Form 20-F and other SEC filings are considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realisation of forward-looking statements.\n\n![](https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=OTEyMDM2NCM2MjU5NzY3IzIyMzI2MDg=) ![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/NWM1YzI3ZmEtMWYxNS00ODkwLThjOWEtNGY0ZGI0OGJhZjFhLTEyNDQxNjE=/tiny/Arqit-Quantum-Inc-.png)\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/bbebcd14-5d5c-4e5c-afc9-29d15d9399ed/small/arqq-logo-png.png)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/bbebcd14-5d5c-4e5c-afc9-29d15d9399ed)\n\nSource: Arqit \n\nReleased May 20, 2024\n\n  * [Email Alerts](/news-events/email-alerts)\n  * [Company Profile](/company-information)\n  * [Contacts](/company-information/contacts)\n  * [RSS News Feed](https://ir.arqit.uk/news-events/press-releases/rss \"Opens in a new window\")\n\n\n\nThis website stores data such as cookies to enable essential site functionality, as well as marketing, personalization, and analytics.

30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 (our\n“audited consolidated financial statements”). The Company qualifies as a foreign private issuer as defined under Rule 405 under the Securities Act and\nprepares its financial statements denominated in U.S. dollars in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the International\nAccounting Standards Board (“IFRS”).\n4\nTable of Contents\nCAUTIONARY NOTE ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND\nRISK FACTOR SUMMARY\nThis Annual Report contains certain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the\nprovisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) and Section 21E of the Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). These\nforward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and include information about possible or assumed future results of the business, financial\ncondition, results of operations, liquidity, plans and objectives of the Company. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology\nsuch as “believe,” “may,” “estimate,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “should,” “plan,” “expect,” “predict,” “potential,” or the negative of these terms or\nother similar expressions. The statements regarding the following matters are forward-looking by their nature:\n● that there will be significant market opportunities for the Company’s products as a result of an expected transformation in the cyber encryption\nindustry over the next decade;\n● that consumers, businesses and governments across all geographies and industries will likely need to replace the existing cyber encryption\ntechnology used in almost all electronic interfaces in order to maintain cyber security;\n● that the global addressable market for information security services will be $289 billion by the end of 2027;\n● that new opportunities for growth in demand for the Company’s products are expected in government, defense, telecoms, financial services, Internet\nof Things and connected car markets;\n● that “public key infrastructure” will be vulnerable to quantum computer attack; and\n● that quantum computers of sufficient scale to break “public key infrastructure” may be available within a few years.\nThe preceding list is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all of forward-looking statements in this Annual Report. The forward-looking statements are\nbased on beliefs, assumptions and expectations of the Company of future performance, taking into account the information currently available. These\nstatements are only predictions based upon the current expectations and projections of the Company about future events.\nYou should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in the\nforward-looking statements are reasonable, they cannot guarantee that future results, levels of activity, performance and events and circumstances reflected\nin the forward-looking statements will be achieved or will occur. Except as required by law, the Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly any\nforward-looking statements for any reason after the date of this Annual Report, to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in expectations.\nImportant risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors that could cause our actual results or conditions to differ materially from our forward-looking\nstatements include, among others, the items in the following list, which also summarizes some of our most principal risks:\n● The Company is an early stage company with a history of losses and will be reliant upon a significant increase in sales and marketing activity in\norder to become profitable in the future.\n● The Company’s limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate its business and future prospects and increases the risk of your investment.\n● The market adoption of the Company’s product is not fully proven, is evolving and may develop more slowly than or differently from the\nCompany’s expectations. Its future success depends on the growth and expansion of these markets and its ability to adapt and respond effectively to\nevolving markets.\n● The Company’s primary distribution channel is through channel partnerships, and therefore the Company is dependent upon maintaining and\nincreasing the number of channel partnerships, and developing annual recurring revenues through those channel partnerships, in order to continue to\ndevelop its business.\n● If the Company fails to sell or otherwise monetize its satellite currently under construction, it may be required to recognize further impairment\nlosses, write off capitalized satellite costs or incur breakage fees under certain of its contracts related to satellite construction obligations.\n5\nTable of Contents\n● The Company will require additional capital to fund its operations, and if it is unable to obtain such capital, it will be unable to successfully continue\nto develop its business and commercialize its products.\n● The Company is reliant upon the lease of data center capacity and access to fiber optic infrastructure from third parties in order to commercialize its\nproduct.\n● The complexity of the Company’s products could result in unforeseen delays or expenses from undetected defects, errors or reliability issues in\nsoftware, which could reduce the market adoption of its new products, damage its reputation with current or prospective customers and expose it to\nproduct liability and other claims and adversely affect its operating costs.\n● The Company may not be able to adequately protect or enforce its intellectual property rights or prevent unauthorized parties from copying or\nreverse engineering its products or technology. Its efforts to protect and enforce its intellectual property rights and prevent third parties from\nviolating its rights may be costly.\n● Third-party claims that the Company is infringing intellectual property, whether successful or not, could subject it to costly and time-consuming\nlitigation or expensive licenses, and its business could be adversely affected.\n● Certain of the Company’s products contain third-party open source software components, and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying\nopen source software licenses could restrict its ability to sell its products or expose the Company to other risks.\n● The Company’s intellectual property applications, including patent applications, may not be approved or granted or may take longer than expected\nto be approved, which may have a material adverse effect on its ability to prevent others from commercially exploiting products similar to its.\n● In addition to patented technology, the Company relies on unpatented proprietary technology, trade secrets, designs, experiences, work flows, data,\nprocesses, software and know-how.\n● The markets in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological change, and competing product innovations could adversely\naffect market adoption of its products.\n● The Company’s business depends substantially on the efforts of its executive officers and highly skilled personnel. The Company needs to attract\nand retain a large number of skilled, specialized and dedicated employees in different jurisdictions in order to grow and manage its business, and if\nthe Company loses the services of existing key employees or fail to achieve its recruitment goals, its operations may be disrupted.\n● Failure to comply with governmental trade controls, including export and import control laws and regulations, sanctions, and related regimes could\nsubject the Company to liability or loss of contracting privileges, limit its ability to compete in certain markets or harm its reputation with the\ngovernments.\n● Failures, or perceived failures, to comply with privacy, data protection, and information security requirements in the jurisdictions in which the\nCompany operates may adversely impact its business, and such legal requirements are evolving and may require improvements in, or changes to,\nits policies and operations.\n● Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect the Company’s business and result of operations.\n● The Company’s Business Combination Warrants are accounted for as liabilities and the changes in value of the warrants could have a material effect\non its financial results.\n● Interruption or failure of the Company’s information technology and communications systems could impact its ability to effectively provide its\nproducts and services.\n● If any of the Company’s third parties’ systems, its customers’ cloud or on-premises environments, or its internal systems are breached or if\nunauthorized access to customer or third-party data is otherwise obtained, public perception of its business may be harmed, and the Company may\nlose business and incur losses or liabilities.\n6\nTable of Contents\n● If the Company’s network and products do not interoperate with its customers’ internal networks and infrastructure or with third-party products,\nwebsites, or services, its network may become less competitive and its results of operations may be harmed.\nSome of these factors are discussed in more detail in this Annual Report, including under “Item 3. Key Information—Risk Factors,” “Item 4. Information\non the Company” and “Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects.” Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should\nunderlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described in this Annual Report as anticipated, believed, estimated\nor expected.\n7\nTable of Contents\nPART I\nITEM 1.

RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report, in evaluating us and our\nshares. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks. The trading price and\nvalue of our ordinary shares could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. This Annual Report also contains\nforward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking\nstatements as a result of certain factors, including the risks faced by us described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nAdditional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.\nRisks Related to Arqit’s Business and Operations\nArqit is an early stage company with a history of losses and will be reliant upon a significant increase in sales and marketing activity in order to become\nprofitable in the future.\nArqit has only just started to generate material revenues through the commercialization of its products. For the years ended September 30, 2021, 2022 and\n2023, Arqit generated operating losses of $172.6 million, $63.8 million and $84.4 million, respectively. Arqit intends to continue to invest and to increase\ninvestments in sales, marketing and product development, and believes that it will continue to incur operating and net losses until at least the time it is able\nto fully commercialize its products, but which may occur later than expected or not at all. There can be no assurance that Arqit’s products or its sales\nstrategy will be commercially successful. Arqit’s potential profitability is dependent upon the successful development and commercial introduction and\nacceptance of its products, which may not occur. Because Arqit will incur the costs and expenses of commercializing its products before it receives any\nsignificant revenues with respect thereto, its losses in future periods may be significant. If Arqit is never able to achieve or sustain profitability, its results of\noperations could differ materially from its expectations and Arqit’s business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely\naffected.\nArqit’s limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate its business and future prospects and increases the risk of your investment.\nArqit began operations in 2017, has a limited operating history, and operates in the post-quantum cryptography encryption industry, which is rapidly\nevolving. As a result, there is limited information that investors can use in evaluating Arqit’s business, strategy, operating plan, results and prospects. Arqit\nintends to derive most of its revenues from the delivery of its symmetric key agreement product, QuantumCloudTM, which is a newly developed\ntechnology. It is difficult to predict future revenues and appropriately budget for expenses, and Arqit has limited insight into trends that may emerge and\naffect its business. If the assumptions Arqit uses to plan and operate its business are incorrect or change, its results of operations could differ materially\nfrom its expectations and Arqit’s business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\n8\nTable of Contents\nThe market adoption of Arqit’s product is not fully proven, is evolving and may develop more slowly than or differently from Arqit’s expectations. Its\nfuture success depends on the growth and expansion of these markets and its ability to adapt and respond effectively to evolving markets.\nThe market adoption of Arqit’s product is relatively new, rapidly evolving, and not fully proven. Accordingly, it is difficult to predict customer adoption\nand renewals and demand for its products and services, the entry of competitive products, the success of existing competitive products, or the future growth\nrate, expansion, longevity, and the size of the market for its products. The expansion of and its ability to penetrate these new and evolving markets depends\non a number of factors, including: the cost, performance, and perceived value associated with its products, and the extent to which its products improve\nsecurity and are easy to use for its customers. If Arqit experiences security incidents or disruptions in delivery or service, the market for its products may be\nnegatively affected. If its products do not continue to achieve market acceptance, or there is a reduction in demand caused by decreased customer\nacceptance, technological challenges, weakening economic conditions, privacy, data protection and data security concerns, governmental regulation,\ncompeting technologies and products, or decreases in information technology spending or otherwise, the market for its products may not continue to\ndevelop or may develop more slowly than Arqit expects, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nArqit’s primary distribution channel is through channel partnerships, and therefore Arqit is dependent upon maintaining and increasing the number\nof channel partnerships, and developing annual recurring revenues through those channel partnerships, in order to continue to develop its business.\nArqit is in the early stages of commercializing its business, and in December 2022 began transitioning its distribution model from an enterprise license\nmodel to distribution through channel partners. There can be no certainty over the pace and scale of revenue growth generated from such relationships,\nwhich might take longer than anticipated to generate material revenues. In addition, Arqit is dependent upon maintaining its existing, and increasing the\nnumber of, channel partnerships in order to continue to develop its business and annual recurring revenues. If revenues from channel partner relationships\nfail to develop, take longer than expected to develop, or Arqit fails to maintain existing or increase the number of its channel partnerships, the impact could\nadversely affect its business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf Arqit fails to sell or otherwise monetize its satellite currently under construction, it may be required to recognize further impairment losses, write off\ncapitalized satellite costs or incur breakage fees under certain of its contracts related to satellite construction obligations.\nIn December 2022 Arqit updated its technology strategy to eliminate quantum satellites andt he associated ground infrastructure from its core\nQuantumCloudTM product offering. See “Item 4.B. Business Overview - Satellite Infrastructure.” In connection with this update, Arqit is planning to sell\nor otherwise monetize its quantum satellite currently under construction. In May 2023 Arqit retained an adviser to assist in the process of pursuing the sale\nof its satellite division amongst other potential transactions. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, Arqit reclassified its satellite assets from\n“intangible assets” to “assets classified as held for sale”, in connection with which it recognized an impairment loss of $17.6 million. If Arqit fails to sell its\nsatellite currently under construction, it may be required to recognize further impairment losses, write off capitalized satellite costs or incur breakage fees\nunder certain of its contracts related to satellite construction obligations. If such impairment losses or write offs are required or additional expenses are\nincurred, Arqit’s results of operations could differ materially from its expectations and Arqit’s business, financial condition and results of operations could\nbe materially adversely affected.\nArqit will require additional capital to fund its operations, and if it is unable to obtain such capital, it will be unable to successfully continue to develop\nits business and commercialize its products.\nAs of September 30, 2023, Arqit had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $44.5 million. Although Arqit believes it has sufficient funds to fund its\noperations for the next twelve months as of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 20-F, it will require additional capital in order to successfully continue\nto develop its business and commercialize its products. There is no assurance that revenues from Arqit’s commercialization of its products will be sufficient\nto fund its operations in the future, or that additional funds will be available through other sources when required on terms that are acceptable to Arqit, or at\nall. If Arqit is not able to access the capital required to fund its operations, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially\nadversely affected.\n9\nTable of Contents\nArqit is reliant upon the lease of data center capacity and access to fiber optic infrastructure from third parties in order to commercialize its product.\nArqit leases its data centers and obtains access to fiber optic infrastructure from third parties and will be reliant on the continued operation of these data\ncenters and infrastructure to commercialize its product. While Arqit has electronic access to the components and infrastructure of its cloud platforms that\nare hosted by third parties, Arqit does not control the operation of these facilities. Consequently, Arqit may be subject to service disruptions as well as\nfailures to provide adequate support for reasons that are outside of its direct control. The data centers or the fiber optic infrastructure Arqit uses to deliver its\nproducts may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources, including earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, system failures, computer\nviruses, physical or electronic break-ins, human error or interference (including by disgruntled employees, former employees or contractors), and other\ncatastrophic events. Its data centers or the fiber optic infrastructure Arqit uses may also be subject to local administrative actions, changes to legal or\npermitting requirements and litigation to stop, limit or delay operations. Despite precautions taken at these facilities, such as disaster recovery, business\ncontinuity arrangements, and diversity of supply in the Arqit network, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the\nfacilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in interruptions or degradations in its services, impede its\nability to scale its operations or have other adverse impacts upon its business. In addition, if Arqit does not accurately plan for its infrastructure capacity\nrequirements and Arqit experiences significant strains on its data center capacity, Arqit may experience delays and additional expenses in arranging new\ndata centers, and its customers could experience performance degradation or service outages that may subject it to financial liabilities, result in customer\nlosses and materially harm its business. If Arqit is unable to efficiently and cost-effectively fix such errors at the data centers or fiber optic infrastructure or\nother problems that may be identified, this could damage its reputation and negatively impact its relationship with its customers. If Arqit is unable to\nsuccessfully maintain and manage the data centers and the fiber optic infrastructure that Arqit uses, Arqit’s business, financial condition and results of\noperations could be materially adversely affected.\nThe complexity of Arqit’s products could result in unforeseen delays or expenses from undetected defects, errors or reliability issues in software, which\ncould reduce the market adoption of its new products, damage its reputation with current or prospective customers and expose it to product liability and\nother claims and adversely affect its operating costs.\nArqit’s products are highly technical and complex and require high standards to implement and may experience defects, errors or reliability issues at\nvarious stages of development and commercial implementation. Arqit may be unable to timely correct problems that have arisen or correct such problems\nto its customers’ satisfaction. Additionally, undetected errors, defects or security vulnerabilities could result in litigation against Arqit, negative publicity\nand other consequences. Some errors or defects in its products may only be discovered after they have been tested, commercialized and deployed by\ncustomers. If that is the case, Arqit may incur significant additional development costs with respect to its products. These problems may also result in\nclaims, including class actions, against Arqit by its customers or others. Its reputation or brand may be damaged as a result of these problems, customers\nmay be reluctant to buy its products, and Arqit’s business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nArqit may not be able to adequately protect or enforce its intellectual property rights or prevent unauthorized parties from copying or reverse\nengineering its products or technology. Its efforts to protect and enforce its intellectual property rights and prevent third parties from violating its rights\nmay be costly.\nThe success of its products and business depend in part on its ability to obtain patents and other intellectual property rights and maintain adequate legal\nprotection for its products. As of the date of this Annual Report, Arqit had 1,966 claims on 41 pending or granted patents in the UK. Arqit relies on a\ncombination of patent, service mark, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish and\nprotect its proprietary rights, all of which provide only limited protection.\nArqit cannot assure you that any patents will be issued with respect to its currently pending patent applications or that any trademarks will be registered\nwith respect to its currently pending applications in a manner that provides adequate defensive protection or competitive advantages, if at all, or that any\npatents issued to Arqit or any trademarks registered by it will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Arqit may file for patents and trademarks in\nthe U.S., U.K. and in certain international jurisdictions, but such protections may not be available in all countries in which it operates or in which Arqit\nseeks to enforce its intellectual property rights, or may be difficult to enforce in practice. For example, the legal environment relating to intellectual\nproperty protection in certain emerging market countries where Arqit may operate in the future is relatively weaker, often making it difficult to create and\nenforce such rights. Its currently- registered intellectual property and any intellectual property that may be issued or registered, as applicable, in the future\nwith respect to pending or future applications may not provide sufficiently broad protection or may not prove to be enforceable in actions against alleged\ninfringers. Arqit cannot be certain that the steps Arqit has taken will prevent unauthorized use of its technology or the reverse engineering of its\ntechnology. Moreover, others may independently develop technologies that are competitive to or infringe its intellectual property.\n10\nTable of Contents\nProtecting against the unauthorized use of its intellectual property, products and other proprietary rights is expensive and difficult, particularly\ninternationally. Arqit believes that its intellectual property is foundational in the area of encryption technology and intends to enforce the intellectual\nproperty portfolio that Arqit has built. Unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or reverse engineer its technology or certain aspects of its products that it\nconsiders proprietary. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend its intellectual property rights, to prevent unauthorized parties from\ncopying or reverse engineering its products or technology to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to block the importation\nof infringing products into the U.S., U.K. or other jurisdictions in which Arqit seeks to protect its intellectual property rights.\nAny such litigation, whether initiated by Arqit or a third party, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources, either of which\ncould adversely affect its business, operating results and financial condition. Even if Arqit obtains favorable outcomes in litigation, Arqit may not be able\nto obtain adequate remedies, especially in the context of unauthorized parties copying or reverse engineering its products or technology.\nEffective patent, trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which its products are available\nand competitors based in other countries may sell infringing products in one or more markets. Failure to adequately protect its intellectual property rights\ncould result in its competitors offering similar products, potentially resulting in the loss of some of its competitive advantage, and Arqit’s business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nThird-party claims that Arqit is infringing intellectual property, whether successful or not, could subject it to costly and time-consuming litigation or\nexpensive licenses, and its business could be adversely affected.\nParticipants in Arqit’s industry typically protect their technology, especially embedded software, through copyrights and trade secrets in addition to patents.\nAs a result, there is frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights. Arqit may in\nthe future receive inquiries from other intellectual property holders and may become subject to claims that it infringes their intellectual property rights,\nparticularly as Arqit expands its presence in the market, expands to new use cases and faces increasing competition. In addition, parties may claim that the\nnames and branding of Arqit’s products infringe their trademark rights in certain countries or territories. If such a claim were to prevail, Arqit may have to\nchange the names and branding of its products in the affected territories and could incur other costs.\nArqit may in the future need to initiate infringement claims or litigation in order to try to protect its intellectual property rights. In addition to litigation\nwhere Arqit is a plaintiff, its defense of intellectual property rights claims brought against it or its customers or suppliers, with or without merit, could be\ntime- consuming, expensive to litigate or settle, could divert management resources and attention and could force Arqit to acquire intellectual property\nrights and licenses, which may involve substantial royalty or other payments and may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. Further, a party making\nsuch a claim, if successful, could secure a judgment that requires Arqit to pay substantial damages or obtain an injunction and Arqit may also lose the\nopportunity to license its technology to others or to collect royalty payments. An adverse determination could also invalidate or narrow Arqit’s intellectual\nproperty rights and adversely affect its ability to offer its products to its customers and may require that Arqit procure or develop substitute products that do\nnot infringe, which could require significant effort and expense. If any of these events were to materialize, Arqit’s business, financial condition and results\nof operations could be materially adversely affected.\nCertain of Arqit’s products contain third-party open source software components, and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source\nsoftware licenses could restrict its ability to sell its products or expose Arqit to other risks.\nArqit’s products contain software modules licensed to it by third-party authors under “open source” licenses. From time to time, there have been claims\nagainst companies that distribute or use open source software in their products and services, asserting that open source software infringes the claimants’ IP\nrights. Arqit could be subject to suits by parties claiming infringement of IP rights in what Arqit believes to be licensed open source software. Use and\ndistribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as, for example, open source licensors generally\ndo not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. Some open source licenses contain\nrequirements that Arqit makes available source code for modifications or derivative works Arqit creates based upon the type of open source software Arqit\nuses. If Arqit combines its proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, Arqit could, under certain open source licenses, be required\nto release the source code of its proprietary software to the public. This would allow its competitors to create similar products with lower development\neffort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of product sales for Arqit.\nAlthough Arqit monitors its use of open source software to avoid subjecting its products to conditions Arqit does not intend, the terms of many open source\nlicenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way that, for example, could impose\nunanticipated conditions or restrictions on its ability to commercialize its products. In this event, Arqit could be required to seek licenses from third parties\nto continue offering its products, to make its proprietary code generally available in\n11\nTable of Contents\nsource code form, to re-engineer its products or to discontinue the sale of its products if re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis, and\nArqit’s business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nArqit’s intellectual property applications, including patent applications, may not be approved or granted or may take longer than expected to be\napproved, which may have a material adverse effect on its ability to prevent others from commercially exploiting products similar to its.\nArqit cannot be certain that it is the first inventor of the subject matter to which it has filed a particular patent application or if it is the first party to file such\na patent application. The process of securing definitive patent protection can take five or more years. If another party has filed a patent application to the\nsame subject matter as Arqit has, Arqit may not be entitled to some or all of the protection sought by the patent application. Arqit also cannot be certain\nwhether the claims included in a patent application will ultimately be allowed in the applicable issued patent or the timing of any approval or grant of a\npatent application.\nFurther, the scope of protection of issued patent claims is often difficult to determine. As a result, Arqit cannot be certain that the patent applications that\nArqit files will issue, or that its issued patents will afford protection against competitors with similar technology. In addition, if its competitors may design\naround its registered or issued intellectual property, Arqit’s business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition to patented technology, Arqit relies on unpatented proprietary technology, trade secrets, designs, experiences, work flows, data, processes,\nsoftware and know-how.\nArqit relies on proprietary information (such as trade secrets, designs, experiences, work flows, data, know-how and confidential information) to protect\nintellectual property that may not be patentable or subject to copyright, trademark, trade dress or service mark protection, or that Arqit believes is best\nprotected by means that do not require public disclosure. Arqit generally seeks to protect this proprietary information by entering into confidentiality\nagreements, or consulting, services or employment agreements that contain non-disclosure and non-use provisions with its employees, consultants,\ncustomers, contractors and third parties. However, Arqit may fail to enter into the necessary agreements, and even if entered into, such agreements may be\nbreached or may otherwise fail to prevent disclosure, third-party infringement or misappropriation of its proprietary information, may be limited as to their\nterm and may not provide adequate remedies in the event of unauthorized disclosure or use of proprietary information. Arqit has limited control over the\nprotection of trade secrets used by its current or future manufacturing counterparties and suppliers and could lose future trade secret protection if any\nunauthorized disclosure of such information occurs. In addition, its proprietary information may otherwise become known or be independently developed\nby its competitors or other third parties. To the extent that Arqit’s employees, consultants, customers, contractors, advisors and other third parties use\nintellectual property owned by others in their work for it, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. Costly and\ntime- consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of its proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain protection for its\nproprietary information could adversely affect its competitive business position. Furthermore, laws regarding trade secret rights in certain markets where\nArqit operate may afford little or no protection to its trade secrets.\nArqit also relies on physical and electronic security measures to protect its proprietary information, but cannot provide assurance that these security\nmeasures will not be breached or provide adequate protection for its property. There is a risk that third parties may obtain and improperly utilize its\nproprietary information to its competitive disadvantage. Arqit may not be able to detect or prevent the unauthorized use of such information or take\nappropriate and timely steps to enforce its intellectual property rights, and Arqit’s business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially\nadversely affected.\nThe markets in which Arqit competes are characterized by rapid technological change, and competing product innovations could adversely affect\nmarket adoption of its products.\nWhile Arqit has invested substantial resources in technological development, and believes that its product is a unique innovation, continuing technological\nchanges in quantum technology and changes in the markets for its products could adversely affect adoption of its products, either generally or for particular\napplications. Arqit’s future success will depend upon its ability to develop and introduce a variety of new capabilities and innovations to its product\nofferings, as well as to introduce a variety of new product offerings, to address the changing needs of the markets in which Arqit offers its products. Delays\nin delivering new products that meet customer requirements could damage its relationships with customers and lead them to seek alternative sources of\nsupply. Delays in introducing products and innovations, the failure to choose correctly among technical alternatives or the failure to offer innovative\nproducts or configurations at competitive prices may cause existing and potential customers to purchase its competitors’ products or turn to alternative\ntechnology.\nIf Arqit is unable to devote adequate resources to develop products or cannot otherwise successfully develop products or system configurations that meet\ncustomer requirements on a timely basis or that remain competitive with technological alternatives, its products\n12\nTable of Contents\ncould lose market share, its revenue could decline, and Arqit’s business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nArqit’s business depends substantially on the efforts of its executive officers and highly skilled personnel. Arqit needs to attract and retain a large\nnumber of skilled, specialized and dedicated employees in different jurisdictions in order to grow and manage its business, and if Arqit loses the services\nof existing key employees or fail to achieve its recruitment goals, its operations may be disrupted.\nCompetition for highly-skilled personnel is often intense and Arqit may incur significant costs to attract and retain highly-skilled personnel. Arqit may not\nbe successful in attracting, integrating, or retaining qualified personnel to fulfill its current or future needs. As its business grows, Arqit will need to recruit\na large number of skilled employees in different jurisdictions in which it operates and expects to expand into in the future. Experienced and highly skilled\nemployees are in high demand, competition for these employees can be intense and Arqit’s ability to hire, attract and retain them depends on its ability to\nprovide competitive compensation. Arqit will also need to expend significant time and expense to train the employees that it hires and it may struggle to\nretain employees, and its competitors may actively seek to hire skilled personnel away from it. If Arqit fails to attract new personnel or to retain and\nmotivate its current personnel, its business and future growth prospects could be adversely affected.\nFailure to comply with governmental trade controls, including export and import control laws and regulations, sanctions, and related regimes could\nsubject Arqit to liability or loss of contracting privileges, limit its ability to compete in certain markets or harm its reputation with the governments.\nArqit’s products are subject to export controls in the U.S., U.K. and other jurisdictions, and Arqit incorporates encryption technology into its product\nofferings. Some of the underlying technology in Arqit’s products may be exported outside of these countries only with the required export authorizations,\nwhich may require a license, a license exception, or other appropriate government authorizations, including the filing of an encryption classification request\nor self-classification report.\nFurthermore, its activities are subject to the economic sanctions, laws and regulations of the U.S. and other jurisdictions. Such controls prohibit the\nshipment or transfer of certain products and services without the required export authorizations or export to countries, governments, and persons targeted by\napplicable sanctions. Arqit takes precautions to prevent its offerings from being exported in violation of these laws, including: (i) seeking to proactively\nclassify its platforms and obtain authorizations for the export and/or import of its platforms where appropriate, (ii) implementing certain technical controls\nand screening practices to reduce the risk of violations, and (iii) requiring compliance with U.S. export control and sanctions obligations in customer and\nvendor contracts. However, Arqit cannot guarantee the precautions it takes will prevent violations of export control and sanctions laws.\nAs discussed above, if Arqit misclassifies a product or service, export or provides access to a product or service in violation of applicable restrictions, or\notherwise fails to comply with export regulations, Arqit may be denied export privileges or subjected to significant per violation fines or other penalties,\nand its platforms may be denied entry into other countries. Any decreased use of its platforms or limitation on its ability to export or sell its platforms\nwould likely adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition. Violations of sanctions or export control laws can result in fines or\npenalties, including both civil and criminal penalties.\nArqit also notes that if it or its business partners or counterparties, including licensors and licensees, prime contractors, subcontractors, sublicensors,\nvendors, customers, or contractors, fail to obtain appropriate import, export, or re-export licenses or permits, notwithstanding regulatory requirements or\ncontractual commitments to do so, or if Arqit fails to secure such contractual commitments where necessary, Arqit may also face reputational harm as well\nas other negative consequences, including government investigations and penalties.\nNegative consequences for violations or apparent violations of trade control requirements may include the absolute loss of the right to sell Arqit’s platforms\nor services to the government of the U.S., or to other public bodies, or a reduction in its ability to compete for such sales opportunities. Further, complying\nwith export control and sanctions regulations for a particular sale may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities.\nOther countries in addition to the U.S. and U.K. also regulate the import and export of certain encryption and other technology, including import and export\nlicensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit Arqit’s ability to distribute its products or could limit its end-customers’ ability to implement\nits products in those countries. Changes in Arqit’s products or future changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of its\nplatform in international markets, prevent its end- customers with international operations from deploying its platform globally or, in some cases, prevent\nthe export or import of its products to certain countries, governments, or persons altogether. From time to time, various governmental agencies have\nproposed additional regulation of encryption technology. Any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation, increased\nexport and import controls, or change in the countries, governments, persons, or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased\n13\nTable of Contents\nuse of Arqit’s platform by, or in its decreased ability to export or sell its products to, existing or potential end-customers with international operations. If\nthere is any limitation on its ability to export or sell its products, Arqit’s business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely\naffected.\nFailures, or perceived failures, to comply with privacy, data protection, and information security requirements in the jurisdictions in which Arqit\noperates may adversely impact its business, and such legal requirements are evolving and may require improvements in, or changes to, its policies and\noperations.\nArqit’s current and potential future operations and sales are subject to laws and regulations addressing privacy and the collection, use, storage, disclosure,\ntransfer and protection of a variety of types of data. The primary data privacy laws applicable to Arqit include U.K. General Data Protection Regulation and\nthe U.K. Data Protection Act of 2018. These regimes may, among other things, impose data security requirements, disclosure requirements, and restrictions\non data collection, uses, and sharing that may impact its operations and the development of its business. Arqit’s products collect, store and process certain\ninformation and its products may evolve to collect additional information. Therefore, the full impact of these privacy regimes on its business is rapidly\nevolving across jurisdictions and remains uncertain at this time.\nArqit may also be affected by cyber-attacks and other means of gaining unauthorized access to its products, systems, and data. For instance, cyber criminals\nor insiders may target it or third parties with which Arqit has business relationships to obtain data, or in a manner that disrupts its operations or\ncompromises its products or the systems into which its products are integrated.\nArqit continually assesses the evolving privacy and data security regimes and implements measures that Arqit believes are appropriate in response. Since\nthese data security regimes are evolving, uncertain and complex, especially for a global business like Arqit’s, it may need to update or enhance its\ncompliance measures as its products, markets and customer demands further develop, and these updates or enhancements may require implementation\ncosts. In addition, Arqit may not be able to monitor and react to all developments in a timely manner and the compliance measures that Arqit adopts may\nprove ineffective.\nAny failure, or perceived failure, to comply with current and future regulatory or customer-driven privacy, data protection, and information security\nrequirements, or to prevent or mitigate security breaches, cyber-attacks, or improper access to, use of, or disclosure of data, or any security issues or cyber-\nattacks affecting Arqit, could result in significant liability, costs (including the costs of mitigation and recovery), and a material loss of revenue resulting\nfrom the adverse impact on Arqit’s reputation and brand, loss of proprietary information and data, disruption to its business and relationships, and\ndiminished ability to retain or attract customers and business partners. Such events may result in governmental enforcement actions and prosecutions,\nprivate litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity, and could cause customers and business partners to lose trust in Arqit, and its business, financial\ncondition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect Arqit’s business and result of operations.\nArqit’s functional currency is GBP and its reporting currency is U.S. dollars. Accordingly, fluctuations in the value of GBP relative to the U.S. dollar could\naffect its results of operations due to translational remeasurements. As its international operations expand, an increasing portion of its revenue and\noperating expenses will be denominated in non-GBP currencies. Accordingly, Arqit’s revenue and operating expenses will become increasingly subject to\nfluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. If Arqit is not able to successfully hedge against the risks associated with currency\nfluctuations, Arqit’s business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nArqit’s Business Combination Warrants are accounted for as liabilities and the changes in value of the warrants could have a material effect on its\nfinancial results.\nIn accordance with IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments and IAS 32 – Financial Instruments: Presentation, Arqit has determined that its Business Combination\nWarrants should be measured at fair value on its statement of financial position, with any changes in fair value to be reported each period in earnings on its\nstatement of comprehensive income. As a result of the recurring fair value measurement, Arqit’s financial statements may fluctuate on an interim basis,\nbased on factors which are outside of its control. Due to the recurring fair value measurement, Arqit expects that it will recognize non-cash gains or losses\non its Business Combination Warrants each reporting period and that the amount of such gains or losses could be material.\nInterruption or failure of Arqit’s information technology and communications systems could impact its ability to effectively provide its products and\nservices.\nThe availability and effectiveness of Arqit’s services depend on the continued operation of information technology and communications systems. Its\nsystems will be vulnerable to damage or interruption from, among others, physical theft, fire, terrorist attacks, natural\n14\nTable of Contents\ndisasters, power loss, war, telecommunications failures, viruses, denial or degradation of service attacks, ransomware, social engineering schemes, insider\ntheft or misuse or other attempts to harm its systems. Arqit utilizes reputable third-party service providers or vendors for all of its IT and communications\nsystems, and these providers could also be vulnerable to harms similar to those that could damage its systems, including sabotage and intentional acts of\nvandalism causing potential disruptions. Some of its systems will not be fully redundant, and its disaster recovery planning cannot account for all\neventualities. Any problems with its third-party cloud hosting providers could result in lengthy interruptions in its business. In addition, Arqit’s services\nand functionality are highly technical and complex technology which may contain errors or vulnerabilities that could result in interruptions in its business\nor the failure of its systems.\nIf any of Arqit’s third parties’ systems, its customers’ cloud or on-premises environments, or its internal systems are breached or if unauthorized access\nto customer or third-party data is otherwise obtained, public perception of its business may be harmed, and Arqit may lose business and incur losses or\nliabilities.\nArqit’s success depends in part on its ability to provide effective data security protection in connection with its platforms and services, and Arqit relies on\ninformation technology networks and systems to securely store, transmit, index, and otherwise process electronic information. Because its platforms and\nservices are used by its customers to encrypt large data sets that often contain proprietary, confidential, and/or sensitive information (including in some\ninstances personal or identifying information and personal health information), its software is perceived as an attractive target for attacks by computer\nhackers or others seeking unauthorized access, and its software faces threats of unintended exposure, exfiltration, alteration, deletion, or loss of data.\nAdditionally, because many of Arqit’s customers use its platforms to store, transmit, and otherwise process proprietary, confidential, or sensitive\ninformation, and complete mission critical tasks, they have a lower risk tolerance for security vulnerabilities in its platforms and services than for\nvulnerabilities in other, less critical, software products and services.\nArqit, and the third-party vendors upon which Arqit relies, have experienced, and may in the future experience, cybersecurity threats, including threats or\nattempts to disrupt its information technology infrastructure and unauthorized attempts to gain access to sensitive or confidential information. Its and its\nthird-party vendors’ technology systems may be damaged or compromised by malicious events, such as cyberattacks (including computer viruses,\nmalicious and destructive code, phishing attacks, and denial of service attacks), physical or electronic security breaches, natural disasters, fire, power loss,\ntelecommunications failures, personnel misconduct, and human error. Such attacks or security breaches may be perpetrated by internal bad actors, such as\nemployees or contractors, or by third parties (including traditional computer hackers, persons involved with organized crime, or foreign state or foreign\nstate-supported actors).\nCybersecurity threats can employ a wide variety of methods and techniques, which may include the use of social engineering techniques, are constantly\nevolving, and have become increasingly complex and sophisticated; all of which increase the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against\nthem.\nFurthermore, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until after\nthey are launched against a target, Arqit and its third-party vendors may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative\nmeasures. Although prior cyberattacks directed at Arqit have not had a material impact on its financial results, and Arqit is continuing to bolster its threat\ndetection and mitigation processes and procedures, Arqit cannot guarantee that future cyberattacks, if successful, will not have a material impact on its\nbusiness or financial results. While Arqit has security measures in place to protect its information and its customers’ information and to prevent data loss\nand other security breaches, there can be no assurance that Arqit will be able to anticipate or prevent security breaches or unauthorized access of its\ninformation technology systems or the information technology systems of the third-party vendors upon which Arqit relies. Despite its implementation of\nnetwork security measures and internal information security policies, data stored on personnel computer systems is also vulnerable to similar security\nbreaches, unauthorized tampering or human error.\nMany governments have enacted laws requiring companies to provide notice of data security incidents involving certain types of data, including personal\ndata. In addition, most of Arqit’s customers contractually require Arqit to notify them of data security breaches. If an actual or perceived breach of security\nmeasures, unauthorized access to its system or the systems of the third-party vendors that Arqit rely upon, or any other cybersecurity threat occurs, Arqit\nmay face direct or indirect liability, costs, or damages, contract termination, its reputation in the industry and with current and potential customers may be\ncompromised, its ability to attract new customers could be negatively affected, and its business, financial condition, and results of operations could be\nmaterially and adversely affected.\nFurther, unauthorized access to Arqit’s or its third-party vendors’ information technology systems or data or other security breaches could result in the loss\nof information; significant remediation costs; litigation, disputes, regulatory action, or investigations that could result in damages, material fines, and\npenalties; indemnity obligations; interruptions in the operation of its business, including its ability to provide new product features, new platforms, or\nservices to its customers; damage to its operation technology networks and information technology systems; and other liabilities. Moreover, its remediation\nefforts may not be successful. Any or all of these issues,\n15\nTable of Contents\nor the perception that any of them have occurred, could negatively affect Arqit’s ability to attract new customers, cause existing customers to terminate or\nnot renew their agreements, hinder Arqit’s ability to obtain and maintain required or desirable cybersecurity certifications, and result in reputational\ndamage, any of which could materially adversely affect its results of operations, financial condition, and future prospects. There can be no assurance that\nany limitations of liability provisions in Arqit’s license arrangements with customers or in its agreements with vendors, partners, or others would be\nenforceable, applicable, or adequate or would otherwise protect it from any such liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim.\nArqit maintains cybersecurity insurance and other types of insurance, subject to applicable deductibles and policy limits, but its insurance may not be\nsufficient to cover all costs associated with a potential data security incident. Arqit also cannot be sure that its existing general liability insurance coverage\nand coverage for cyber liability or errors or omissions will continue to be available on acceptable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover\none or more large claims or that the insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against Arqit\nthat exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in its insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large\ndeductible or co-insurance requirements, could result in its business, financial condition and results of operations being materially adversely affected.\nIf Arqit’s network and products do not interoperate with its customers’ internal networks and infrastructure or with third-party products, websites, or\nservices, its network may become less competitive and its results of operations may be harmed.\nArqit’s network and products must interoperate with its customers’ existing internal networks and infrastructure. These complex internal systems are\ndeveloped, delivered, and maintained by the customer and a myriad of vendors and service providers. As a result, the components of its customers’\ninfrastructure have different specifications, rapidly evolve, utilize multiple protocol standards, include multiple versions and generations of products, and\nmay be highly customized. Arqit must be able to interoperate and provide products to customers with highly complex and customized internal networks,\nwhich requires careful planning and execution between its customers, its customer support teams and, in some cases, its channel partners.\nFurther, when new or updated elements of its customers’ infrastructure or new industry standards or protocols are introduced, Arqit may have to update or\nenhance its network to allow it to continue to provide its products to customers.\nArqit may not deliver or maintain interoperability quickly or cost-effectively, or at all. These efforts require capital investment and engineering resources. If\nArqit fails to maintain compatibility of its network and products with its customers’ internal networks and infrastructures, its customers may not be able to\nfully utilize its network and products, and Arqit may, among other consequences, lose or fail to increase its market share and number of customers and\nexperience reduced demand for its products, and its business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Ordinary Shares and Warrants\nIt may be difficult to enforce judgments obtained against Arqit or its directors and officers in U.S. courts, to effect service of process on it or its\ndirectors or officers, and to recover in civil proceedings in the U.K. or elsewhere for U.S. securities law violations.\nThe majority of Arqit’s directors and executive officers reside outside of the U.S., and most of its assets and most of the assets of these persons are located\noutside of the U.S. Therefore, a judgment obtained against Arqit, or any of these persons, including a judgment based on the civil liability provisions of the\nU.S. federal securities laws, may not be collectible in the U.S. and may not be enforced by courts in other jurisdictions. It may also be difficult for its\nshareholders to effect service of process on these persons in the U.S. or to assert U.S. securities law claims in original actions instituted in the U.K. or\nelsewhere. U.K. courts may refuse to hear a claim based on an alleged violation of U.S. securities laws reasoning that U.K. is not the most appropriate\nforum in which to bring such a claim. In addition, even if a U.K. court agrees to hear a claim, it may determine that U.K. law, instead of U.S. law, is\napplicable to the claim. As a result of potential difficulties associated with enforcing a judgment against Arqit, its shareholders may not be able to collect\nany damages awarded by either a U.S. or foreign court.\nBecause Arqit is incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands, you may face difficulties in protecting your interests, and your ability to protect\nyour rights through the U.S. federal courts may be limited.\nArqit is an exempted company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands. As a result, it may be difficult for shareholders to effect service of\nprocess within the United States upon the directors or executive officers of Arqit, or enforce judgments obtained in the United States courts against the\ndirectors or officers of Arqit.\nThe corporate affairs of Arqit are governed by Arqit’s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, the Cayman Companies Act and the\ncommon law of the Cayman Islands. The rights of shareholders to take action against the directors, actions by\n16\nTable of Contents\nminority shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of the directors of Arqit under Cayman Islands law are to a large extent governed by the common\nlaw of the Cayman Islands. The common law of the Cayman Islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the Cayman Islands\nas well as from English common law, the decisions of whose courts are of persuasive authority, but are not binding on a court in the Cayman Islands. The\nrights of Arqit shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of Arqit directors under Cayman\nIslands law are different from what they would be under statutes or judicial precedent in some jurisdictions in the United States. In particular, the Cayman\nIslands has a less prescriptive body of securities laws as compared to the United States, and certain states, such as Delaware, may have more fully\ndeveloped and judicially interpreted bodies of corporate law. In addition, shareholders of Cayman Islands companies may not have standing to initiate a\nshareholders’ derivative action in a federal court of the United States.\nShareholders of Cayman Islands exempted companies like Arqit have no general rights under Cayman Islands law to inspect corporate records or to obtain\ncopies of the register of members of these companies. Arqit directors have discretion under our articles of association to determine whether or not, and\nunder what conditions, our corporate records may be inspected by our shareholders, but are not obliged to make them available to our shareholders. This\nmay make it more difficult for you to obtain the information needed to establish any facts necessary for a shareholder motion or to solicit proxies from other\nshareholders in connection with a proxy contest.\nThe courts of the Cayman Islands are unlikely (i) to recognize or enforce against Arqit judgments of courts of the United States predicated upon the civil\nliability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States or any state, and (ii) in original actions brought in the Cayman Islands, to impose\nliabilities against Arqit predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States or any state, so far as the liabilities\nimposed by those provisions are penal in nature. In those circumstances, although there is no statutory enforcement in the Cayman Islands of judgments\nobtained in the United States, the courts of the Cayman Islands will recognize and enforce a foreign money judgment of a foreign court of competent\njurisdiction without retrial on the merits based on the principle that a judgment of a competent foreign court imposes upon the judgment debtor an\nobligation to pay the sum for which judgment has been given provided certain conditions are met. For a foreign judgment to be enforced in the Cayman\nIslands, such judgment must be final and conclusive and for a liquidated sum, and must not be in respect of taxes or a fine or penalty, inconsistent with a\nCayman Islands judgment in respect of the same matter, impeachable on the grounds of fraud or obtained in a manner, or be of a kind the enforcement of\nwhich is, contrary to natural justice or the public policy of the Cayman Islands (awards of punitive or multiple damages may well be held to be contrary to\npublic policy). A Cayman Islands court may stay enforcement proceedings if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere.\nAs a result of all of the above, shareholders of Arqit may have more difficulty in protecting their interests in the face of actions taken by our management,\nmembers of our board or our controlling shareholders than they would as public shareholders of a United States company.\nThe grant and future exercise of registration rights and exercise of outstanding warrants may adversely affect the market price of Arqit ordinary\nshares.\nPursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement described elsewhere in this Annual Report, certain shareholders can each demand that Arqit register their\nregistrable securities under certain circumstances and will each have piggyback registration rights for these securities in connection with certain\nregistrations of securities that Arqit undertakes. Arqit will bear the cost of registering these securities.\nOn October 12, 2021, Arqit’s registration statement on Form F-1, which has since been post-effectively amended on Form F-3 (File No. 333-259982 the\n“Resale Registration Statement”) registering the resale by shareholders of 117,925,000 ordinary shares, 6,266,667 Business Combination Warrants and\n14,891,640 shares issuable upon exercise of Business Combination Warrants, became effective. The shareholders who registered shares and warrants for\nresale under the Resale Registration Statement have registration rights under the Registration Rights Agreement. The registration of these securities permits\nthe public sale of such securities. The registration and availability of such a significant number of securities for trading in the public market may have an\nadverse effect on the market price of Arqit ordinary shares.\nIn addition, in registered direct offerings in February 2023 and September 2023, Arqit issued a total of 7,500,000 February 2023 Investor Warrants, 550,000\nFebruary 2023 Placement Agent Warrants, 20,755,677 September 2023 Investor Warrants and 705,128 September 2023 Placement Agent Warrants. All of\nArqit’s outstanding warrants are currently exercisable and the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants have been registered under registration\nstatements. The exercise of a significant number of warrants may have an adverse effect on the market price of Arqit’s ordinary shares.\n17\nTable of Contents\nCertain shareholders that own a significant percentage of Arqit may have interests that conflict with Arqit’s or yours in the future.\nFour shareholders of Arqit beneficially own approximately 48.6% of the outstanding Arqit ordinary shares and currently exercisable warrants. See\n“Beneficial Ownership of Securities.” For so long as these shareholders continue to own a significant percentage of Arqit ordinary shares and warrants, they\nwill be able to significantly influence or effectively control the composition of the Arqit board of directors and the approval of actions requiring\nshareholder approval through their voting power. Accordingly, for such period of time, these shareholders will have significant influence with respect to\nArqit’s management, business plans and policies, including the appointment and removal of Arqit’s officers. In particular, for so long as these shareholders\ncontinue to own a significant percentage of the outstanding Arqit ordinary shares, they will be able to cause or prevent a change of control of Arqit or a\nchange in the composition of Arqit’s board of directors and could preclude any unsolicited acquisition of Arqit. The concentration of ownership could\ndeprive you of an opportunity to receive a premium for your Arqit ordinary shares as part of a sale of Arqit and ultimately might affect the market price of\nthe Arqit ordinary shares.\nThe price of Arqit’s ordinary shares may be volatile.\nThe price of Arqit’s ordinary shares may fluctuate due to a variety of factors, including:\n● actual or anticipated fluctuations in its interim and annual results and those of other public companies in industry; mergers and strategic alliances in\nthe industry in which it operates;\n● market prices and conditions in the industry in which it operates;\n● changes in government regulation;\n● potential or actual military conflicts or acts of terrorism;\n● the failure of securities analysts to publish research about us, or shortfalls in its operating results compared to levels forecast by securities analysts;\n● announcements or negative publicity concerning Arqit, its competitors or companies that have completed business combinations with special\npurpose acquisition companies; and\n● the general state of the securities markets.\nThese market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of Arqit’s ordinary shares, regardless of its operating performance.\nReports published by analysts, including projections in those reports that differ from Arqit’s actual results, could adversely affect the price and trading\nvolume of its ordinary shares.\nThe trading market for the Ordinary Shares is and will be influenced by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about Arqit or\nits business. Projections by such securities or industry analysts may vary widely and may not accurately predict the results Arqit actually achieves. Arqit’s\nshare price may decline if its actual results do not match the projections of these securities research analysts. Similarly, if one or more of the analysts who\nwrite reports on Arqit downgrades its stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about its business, its share price could decline. If one or more\nof these analysts ceases coverage of Arqit or fails to publish reports on it regularly, its share price or trading volume could decline. While Arqit’s\nmanagement expects research analyst coverage, if no analysts commence coverage of Arqit, the trading price and volume for its ordinary shares could be\nadversely affected.\nArqit’s ordinary shares may be involuntarily delisted from trading on Nasdaq if it fails to comply with the continued listing requirements. A delisting of\nArqit’s ordinary shares could reduce the liquidity of the ordinary shares and may inhibit or preclude its ability to raise additional capital.\nNasdaq requires Arqit to meet certain financial, public float, bid price and liquidity standards on an ongoing basis in order to continue the listing of its\nordinary shares. On October 19, 2023, Arqit received a notification from Nasdaq notifying the Company that it no longer satisfies Nasdaq Listing Rule\n5550(a)(2) because for the past 30 consecutive business days preceding the date of the notification, the bid price per share of Arqit’s ordinary shares had\nclosed below the $1.00 per share minimum bid price required for continued listing on Nasdaq (the “Minimum Bid Price Requirement”).\nUnder Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), if during the 180 calendar day period following the date of the notification, the closing bid price of Arqit’s\nordinary shares is at least $1.00 for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, the Company will regain compliance\n18\nTable of Contents\nwith the minimum bid price requirement and its ordinary shares will continue to be eligible for listing on Nasdaq absent noncompliance with any other\nrequirement for continued listing.\nIf Arqit does not regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement by the end of the initial 180 calendar day period, under Nasdaq Listing Rule\n5810(c)(3)(A)(ii), the Company may be eligible for an additional 180-day compliance period if it meets the continued listing requirement for the market\nvalue of its publicly held ordinary shares and all other initial listing standards for the Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the minimum bid price\nrequirement, and provides written notice of its intention to cure the minimum bid price deficiency during the second compliance period.\nIf Arqit does not regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement by the end of the compliance period, its ordinary shares will be subject to\ndelisting. If Arqit’s ordinary shares are delisted and it is not able to list its ordinary shares on another national securities exchange, Arqit’s shareholders\ncould face significant material adverse consequences, including limited availability of market quotations for Arqit’s ordinary shares and reduced liquidity\nfor the trading of its securities. In addition, Arqit could experience a decreased ability to issue additional securities and obtain additional capital in the\nfuture.\nArqit may be a passive foreign investment company, or “PFIC,” for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such classification for any taxable year, could\nresult in adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences for U.S. investors.\nIf Arqit were a PFIC for any taxable year (or portion thereof) that is included in the holding period of a U.S. Holder (as defined in the section entitled\n“Certain Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations”) of Arqit’s ordinary shares or warrants, the U.S. Holder may be subject to adverse U.S.\nfederal income tax consequences and may be subject to additional reporting requirements. As of the date hereof, Arqit has not made a determination as to\nits PFIC status for its most recent taxable year or its current taxable year, and it may be possible that Arqit is a PFIC for either such years. Arqit’s possible\nstatus as a PFIC is determined on an annual basis based on the composition of its assets, income, activities and market capitalization (which, depending on\nArqit’s stock price, may fluctuate significantly) in the relevant taxable year and therefore may be subject to change. Accordingly, there can be no assurance\nthat Arqit is not a PFIC for any taxable year. If Arqit is a PFIC during such U.S. Holder’s holding period for the ordinary shares or warrants, unless the U.S.\nHolder makes certain elections, Arqit will continue to be treated as a PFIC with respect to such U.S. Holder, even if it ceases to be a PFIC in future taxable\nyears. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the possible application of the PFIC rules to holders of Arqit securities. For a\nmore detailed explanation of the tax consequences of PFIC classification to U.S. Holders, see “Certain Material United States Federal Income Tax\nConsiderations — Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules.”\nRisks Related to Being a Public Company\nArqit’s management team has limited experience managing and operating a U.S. public company.\nMost of the members of Arqit’s management team have limited experience managing and operating a U.S. publicly traded company, interacting with U.S.\npublic company investors, and complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to U.S. public companies. Its transition to being a U.S. public\ncompany subjects Arqit to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the U.S. federal securities laws and the continuous scrutiny of\nsecurities analysts and investors. These new obligations and constituents will require significant attention from its senior management and could divert their\nattention away from the day-to-day management of its business. Arqit may not have adequate personnel with the appropriate level of knowledge,\nexperience, and training in the accounting policies, practices or internal controls over financial reporting required of U.S. public companies. The\ndevelopment and implementation of the standards and controls necessary for Arqit to achieve the level of accounting standards required of a public\ncompany may require costs greater than expected. To support its operations as a U.S. public company, Arqit plans to hire additional employees, which will\nincrease its operating costs in future periods. Should any of these factors materialize, Arqit’s business, financial condition and results of operations could be\nadversely affected.\nIf Arqit fails to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, its ability to produce timely and\naccurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.\nAs a U.S. public company, Arqit is subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”),\nand the rules and regulations of the applicable listing standards of Nasdaq subject to applicable exemptions as long as Arqit qualifies as Foreign Private\nIssuer and Emerging Growth Company. Arqit’s management expects that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase its legal,\naccounting and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming and costly and place significant strain on its personnel,\nsystems and resources.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that Arqit maintains effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial\nreporting. In particular, Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires Arqit to perform system and process evaluation and testing of its internal control\nover financial reporting to allow Arqit's management to report on the effectiveness of its\n19\nTable of Contents\ninternal control over financial reporting and to allow Arqit’s independent registered public accounting firm to attest to the effectiveness of such control\n(once Arqit becomes an accelerated filer). As an emerging growth company, Arqit’s management expects to avail itself of the exemption from the\nrequirement that its independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting under\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. See “— As an “emerging growth company,” Arqit cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements\napplicable to “emerging growth companies” will make the Arqit ordinary shares less attractive to investors.” However, Arqit may no longer avail itself of\nthis exemption when it ceases to be an emerging growth company. At such time, Arqit’s independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report\nthat is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which its internal control over financial reporting is documented, designed or operating.\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, Arqit identified certain material weaknesses in its internal controls. While Arqit remediated these internal\nweaknesses during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, it cannot assure you that there will not be additional material weaknesses or significant\ndeficiencies in its internal control over financial reporting in the future. Any additional or sustained failure to maintain internal control over financial\nreporting could severely inhibit Arqit’s ability to accurately report its financial condition or results of operations. If Arqit is unable to remediate the material\nweaknesses or to conclude in the future that its internal control over financial reporting is effective, it could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and\ncompleteness of its financial reports, the market price of Arqit’s shares could decline, and it could be subject to sanctions or investigations by Nasdaq, the\nSEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain\nother effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict Arqit’s future access to the capital markets.\nAny failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could have a material and adverse effect on Arqit’s\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition and could cause a decline in the trading price of the Arqit ordinary shares.\nAs a foreign private issuer, Arqit is exempt from a number of rules under the U.S. securities laws and is permitted to file less information with the SEC\nthan a U.S. company. This may limit the information available to holders of the Arqit ordinary shares.\nArqit is a foreign private issuer, as such term is defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act, however, under Rule 405, the determination of foreign private\nissuer status is made annually on the last business day of an issuer’s most recently completed second fiscal quarter and, accordingly, the next determination\nwill be made with respect to Arqit on March 31, 2024.\nAs a foreign private issuer, Arqit is not subject to all of the disclosure requirements applicable to public companies organized within the United States. For\nexample, Arqit is exempt from certain rules under the Exchange Act, that regulate disclosure obligations and procedural requirements related to the\nsolicitation of proxies, consents or authorizations applicable to a security registered under the Exchange Act, including the U.S. proxy rules under\nSection 14 of the Exchange Act (including the requirement applicable to emerging growth companies to disclose the compensation of its Chief Executive\nOfficer and the other two most highly compensated executive officers on an individual, rather than an aggregate, basis). In addition, Arqit’s officers and\ndirectors are exempt from the reporting and “short-swing” profit recovery provisions of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and related rules with respect to\ntheir purchases and sales of its securities. Moreover, while Arqit’s management expects to submit interim consolidated financial data to the SEC under\ncover of the SEC’s Form 6-K, it will not be required to file periodic reports and financial statements with the SEC as frequently or as promptly as U.S.\npublic companies and will not be required to file quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or current reports on Form 8-K under the Exchange Act. Furthermore,\nArqit ordinary shares are not listed on any market in the Cayman Islands and Arqit does not currently intend to list its ordinary shares on any market in the\nCayman Islands, Arqit’s home country. As a result, Arqit is not subject to the reporting and other requirements of companies listed in the Cayman Islands.\nAccordingly, there may be less publicly available information concerning Arqit’s business than there would be if Arqit were a public company organized in\nthe United States.\nArqit may lose its foreign private issuer status in the future, which could result in significant additional cost and expense.\nIn the future, Arqit would lose its foreign private issuer status if a majority of its shareholders, directors or management are U.S. citizens or residents and it\nfails to meet additional requirements necessary to avoid loss of foreign private issuer status. Although Arqit’s management has elected to comply with\ncertain U.S. regulatory provisions, its loss of foreign private issuer status would make such provisions mandatory. The regulatory and compliance costs to\nArqit under U.S. securities laws as a U.S. domestic issuer may be significantly higher. If Arqit is not a foreign private issuer, it will be required to file\nperiodic reports and registration statements on U.S. domestic issuer forms with the SEC, which are more detailed and extensive than the forms available to a\nforeign private issuer. For example, the annual report on Form 10-K requires domestic issuers to disclose executive compensation information on an\nindividual basis with specific disclosure regarding the domestic compensation philosophy, objectives, annual total compensation (base salary, bonus, and\nequity compensation) and potential payments in connection with change in control, retirement, death or disability, while the annual report on Form 20-F\npermits foreign private issuers to disclose compensation information on an aggregate basis. Arqit would also have to mandatorily comply with U.S. federal\nproxy requirements, and its officers, directors, and principal shareholders will become subject to the short-swing profit disclosure and recovery provisions\nof Section 16 of the Exchange Act. Arqit may also be required to\n20\nTable of Contents\nmodify certain of its policies to comply with good governance practices associated with U.S. domestic issuers. Such conversion and modifications will\ninvolve additional costs. In addition, Arqit may lose its ability to rely upon exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements on U.S. stock\nexchanges that are available to foreign private issuers.\nArqit has incurred and expects to continue to incur increased costs and obligations as a result of being a public company.\nAs a publicly traded company, Arqit has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that it was not required\nto incur in the recent past, particularly after it is no longer an “emerging growth company” as defined under the JOBS Act. In addition, new and changing\nlaws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer\nProtection Act and the rules and regulations promulgated and to be promulgated thereunder, as well as under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the JOBS Act, and\nthe rules and regulations of the SEC and national securities exchanges have created uncertainty for public companies and increased the costs and the time\nthat Arqit’s board of directors and management must devote to complying with these rules and regulations. Arqit’s management expects these rules and\nregulations to increase its legal and financial compliance costs and lead to a diversion of management time and attention from revenues generating\nactivities.\nFurthermore, the need to establish the corporate infrastructure demanded of a public company may divert management’s attention from its focus on Arqit’s\nbusiness strategy, which could prevent Arqit from improving its business, results of operations and financial condition. Arqit has made, and will continue\nto make, changes to its internal controls and procedures for financial reporting and accounting systems to meet its reporting obligations as a publicly traded\ncompany. However, the measures it takes may not be sufficient to satisfy Arqit’s obligations as a publicly traded company.\nFor as long as Arqit remains an “emerging growth company” as defined in the JOBS Act, it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various\nreporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies.” Arqit may remain an “emerging growth\ncompany” until September 2, 2026 (the fifth anniversary of the closing of the Business Combination) or until such earlier time that it has more than $1.235\nbillion in annual revenues, has more than $700 million in market value of Arqit’s ordinary shares held by non-affiliates, or issues more than $1.00 billion of\nnon-convertible debt over a three-year period. Further, there is no guarantee that the exemptions available to Arqit under the JOBS Act will result in\nsignificant savings. To the extent Arqit’s management chooses not to use exemptions from various reporting requirements under the JOBS Act, Arqit will\nincur additional compliance costs, which may impact earnings.\nAs an “emerging growth company,” Arqit cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to “emerging growth companies” will\nmake the Arqit ordinary shares less attractive to investors.\nArqit is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act, and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements\nthat are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to obtain an\nassessment of the effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting from its independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Additionally, to the extent that Arqit ceases to become a foreign private issuer, emerging growth company status\nwould allow it to include reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and to be exempt from the requirements of\nholding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nArqit’s management cannot predict if investors will find its Arqit ordinary shares less attractive because it will rely on these exemptions. If some investors\nfind Arqit’s ordinary shares less attractive as a result, there may be a less active market for the Arqit ordinary shares and its share price may be more\nvolatile.\nIf Arqit does not develop and implement all required accounting practices and policies, it may be unable to provide the financial information required\nof a U.S. publicly traded company in a timely and reliable manner.\nIf Arqit fails to develop and maintain effective internal controls and procedures and disclosure procedures and controls, it may be unable to provide\nfinancial information and required SEC reports that a U.S. publicly traded company is required to provide in a timely and reliable fashion. Any such delays\nor deficiencies could penalize Arqit, including by limiting its ability to obtain financing, either in the public capital markets or from private sources and hurt\nits reputation and could thereby impede its ability to implement its growth strategy.\n21\nTable of Contents\nITEM 4.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW\nOverview\nArqit is a cybersecurity company that has pioneered a unique symmetric key agreement technology which makes the communications links of any\nnetworked device or data at rest secure against current and future forms of cyber attack — even an attack from a quantum computer. Arqit delivers its\nsymmetric key agreement technology via its QuantumCloudTM.\nQuantumCloudTM is a software platform as a service that creates unbreakable software encryption keys that are low cost and easy to use within existing\ninformation technology standards with no new hardware and no major software upgrades or “rip and replace” required.\nThe software has potentially universal application to every edge device and cloud machine in the world. The security proofs for the design aspects of the\nkey-establishment protocols used to enable symmetric key agreement over classical IP network infrastructures within QuantumCloudTM were independently\nassured in 2022 by the University of Surrey, which is accredited as a Centre of Excellence for Cyber Security by the UK Government’s National Cyber\nSecurity Centre. Arqit believes that its symmetric key agreement platform is compliant with the NSA Commercial Solutions for Classified Symmetric Key\nManagement Requirements Annex 1.2 which dictates how Government agencies can incorporate quantum-safe symmetric key protections into solutions\nwhich use off-the-shelf commercial products to protect classified networks.\nArqit’s technology combines world-leading innovation in two areas: the secure distribution of replicated entropy to data centers and a software agent that\ncan be downloaded onto any device and makes the use of symmetric key encryption a scalable business model.\n● As part of the background technology that allows Arqit’s software agent to operate at end points, identical sets of random numbers (“replicated\nentropy”) must be delivered securely and frequently to data centers. Replicated entropy is an important constituent part of Arqit’s QuantumCloud™\nproduct. Arqit developed a propriety method for the secure distribution of replicated entropy to data centres using classical digital hardware and\nsoftware elements.\n● A second innovation is a small software agent downloaded from the QuantumCloud™ onto any form of device or integrated into any piece of\nsoftware. By exchanging information with the QuantumCloud™, which moderates a key agreement process with all parties involved in a unique\nway, this software agent is able to create new symmetric encryption keys in partnership with any other device or cloud machine, or in large groups\nof devices. Keys are never “delivered”, they are created, and so they cannot be intercepted. They are created at the end points in a manner that\nmeans they can never be known by a third party, and\n22\nTable of Contents\ncan be used once if necessary and replaced infinitely. Once created, the keys cannot be broken even by a universal quantum computer in a usable\ntime period, estimated to be in excess of millions of years.\nArqit began commercializing its products in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. Arqit sold its product to select early customers on a master\ndistribution agreement basis, an enterprise license basis and as a platform as a service, including BT plc, AUCloud and Nine23. Arqit announced in\nDecember 2022 that it will focus on selling its products on a Platform as a Service basis, primarily through channel partners and distributors, which is\nexpected to generate annual recurring revenue. Arqit platform as a service will be sold as standardized products to specific target markets or a Private\nInstance to customers to require control of the end-to-end technology. Arqit has announced channel partnerships and distribution agreements with Juniper,\nFortinet, AWS, TraxPay, Exclusive Networks, Sierra Nevada Corporation Mission Systems UK, SecureCloud+, DETASAD, Advanced International\nElectronic Equipment Company, and Carahsoft through which it will sell directly and indirectly to end customers. Arqit is currently engaged in discussions\nwith additional customers, channel partners and distributors.\nMarket Opportunity\nArqit believes that there will be significant market opportunities for its innovative products as a result of an expected transformation in the cyber encryption\nindustry over the next decade. The need for improved encryption, resulting from weaknesses in existing encryption architectures and the future threat of\nquantum computers, is an increased concern. Public key infrastructure or “PKI” is currently the most widely-used encryption technology. However, PKI is\nbecoming less secure as new technologies develop, and is not secure against quantum computers, which are expected to be of sufficient scale to break PKI\nwithin the next few years.\nFor example, the U.S. Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (the “NIST”), which leads efforts on mitigation of the\nquantum threat to cyber security, published a report in April 2021, “Getting Ready for Post-Quantum Cryptography: Exploring Challenges Associated with\nAdopting and Using Post-Quantum Cryptographic Algorithms”, in which it expressed concern that the alternatives currently proposed for making PKI\nstronger do not offer a sufficiently adequate or timely solution. Regarding the near term threat of quantum computers to cyber security, the NIST noted, “all\nsecret symmetric keys and private asymmetric keys that are now protected using current public-key algorithms, as well as the information protected under\nthose keys, will be subject to exposure,” and that “any information still considered to be private or otherwise sensitive will be vulnerable to exposure and\nundetected modification.”\nTherefore, consumers, businesses and governments across all geographies and industries will likely need to replace the existing cyber encryption\ntechnology used in almost all electronic interfaces in order to maintain cyber security. Symmetric encryption keys are secure against quantum computers.\nHowever, to date there has been no secure way to create and distribute symmetric keys electronically. In regards to available alternatives, the NIST stated,\n“There are multiple candidate classes for post-quantum cryptography. Unfortunately, each class has at least one requirement for secure implementation that\nmakes drop-in replacement unsuitable.” Separately, in May 2022, the U.S. National Security Agency stated that symmetric encryption keys are recommend\nfor use by federal agencies which wish to become quantum safe.\nNIST’s expressed concerns are amplified by the White House National Security Memorandum 10 dated May 4, 2022. The memorandum sets a crucial\ndeadline for government agencies – ensuring quantum-safe security for National Security Systems by the end of 2023. This mandate reflects the urgent need\nto safeguard classified information against the computational power of quantum computers. Memorandum 10 has made it clear that adoption of symmetric\nkey protections for NSS is the preferred solution. Arqit’s Symmetric Key Agreement platform delivers encryption in a manner that meets the demands of\nUS National Security Memorandum 10 and National Security Agency Commercial Solutions for Classified Symmetric Key Management Requirements\nAnnex version 2.1.\nUnlike solutions utilizing Post-Quantum Cryptographic Algorithms proposed by other parties, Arqit believes it has the only commercially available\nsymmetric key encryption system which is the preferred cryptographic architecture of both NIST and The White House.\nArqit believes that it has developed an almost universal solution to previously identified issues with delivery of symmetric encryption keys, particularly\nscalability and zero-trust. Arqit’s pioneering technology provides a simple, cost-effective and secure way to create and distribute symmetric keys\nelectronically that can be applied universally across geographies, industries and devices, making it well placed to take advantage of this significant\nupcoming market opportunity.\nTotal Addressable Market\nAccording to Gartner (Gartner, Inc., Forecast: Information Security and Risk Management, Worldwide, 2021-2027, 3Q23 Update, Published September 29,\n2023), it is estimated that the global addressable market for information security services will be $289 billion by the end of 2027. Arqit believes that every\nconnected service is vulnerable to current and future attacks on PKI, in particular by\n23\nTable of Contents\nquantum computers in the near to mid-term. This vulnerability will affect cyber security on every connected end point, network device and cloud machine\nglobally, and Arqit believes that its product is the only known method to create encryption keys at large scale, high efficiency and low cost though a cloud\nplatform that is secure against quantum computer attack. As a result, Arqit has assumed that the entire information security market represents its total\naddressable market.\nArqit’s Technology\nEncryption is the foundation of the communications technology everyone uses. However, the technology we rely on for encryption in most cases was\ndeveloped over 30 years ago. There are well-known vulnerabilities in this technology today, and near term developments in quantum computing will\nsignificantly increase risks.\nThe origins of encryption are in symmetric encryption keys — long truly random numbers. The number of permutations involved in guessing a 256 digit\nsymmetrical key is estimated to be equal to all of the atoms in the Milky Way. Even a universal quantum computer would take on average more than the\nage of the universe to perform this guess, because there are no mathematics involved in creating a random number, a quantum computer will offer no\nmeaningful advantage in speeding this up over classical computers.\nTherefore symmetric encryption keys are computationally secure, but to date there has been no secure way to create and distribute symmetric keys\nelectronically at mass market scale. As a result, “public key infrastructure” or “PKI” was invented, which involves two parties sharing the performance of a\ncalculation which is difficult to emulate in a practical time period. The internet has driven the adoption of PKI, not because it was the most secure, but\nbecause it was flexible enough to be reverse engineered into something that was already created. PKI is a flexible tool, but it is vulnerable to attack,\nespecially given the development of the Internet of Things, cloud-based interfaces and other transformational technologies.\nThe problem will imminently become more profound because, unlike symmetric encryption keys, PKI will be vulnerable to quantum computer attack.\nAlthough quantum computers are currently operating at relatively modest scale, quantum computers of sufficient scale to break PKI may be available within\na few years.\nThe universal and long-term answer to this threat is not to make the mathematics used in PKI more difficult given it is not sustainable or practical to try to\ndefeat an infinitely capable computing machine with math. The answer lies in finding a secure way to create and distribute symmetric encryption keys,\nwhich is what Arqit has invented.\nArqit has discovered a way to create symmetric encryption keys at end points when they are needed, at scale, securely, at any kind of end point device and\nin groups of any size. With Arqit’s technology, symmetric encryption keys are never “delivered”, they are created at endpoints, and so their creation cannot\nbe intercepted.\nAn important element in the creation of Arqit’s symmetric encryption keys is replicated entropy distributed at multiple data centers. The replicated entropy\nis utilized via a software agent on the end point device in the key creation process. Through its proprietary method of distribution, Arqit is able to securely\ndeliver replicated entropy to data centers globally using a set of classical digital hardware and software elements. Distributed replicated entropy is\nfundamental to the creation at end points of symmetric encryption within Arqit’s QuantumCloudTM.\nArqit delivers replicated entropy to data centers that host the Arqit QuantumCloud™ system. End point devices that download Arqit’s software agent are\nable to securely authenticate into QuantumCloud™ at different data centers which then moderate a key agreement process by sharing cryptographic\ninformation with the end points. From the combination of elements of shared secrets that can be shared by the parties, the end points are then able to create a\nnew shared symmetric encryption key. The end point keys are zero trust, never known by a third party – including Arqit - and they are computationally\nsecure even against a quantum attack. The created symmetric encryption keys can be used inside an AES256 algorithm which is already incorporated in all\nstandard networking software systems, or any other symmetric algorithm, and therefore Arqit’s product is very simple to implement. The U.S. National\nSecurity Agency has declared that symmetric encryption is the most safe and easiest method to immediately become quantum safe.\n24\nTable of Contents\nThe Arqit technology includes three areas of innovation:\n● Secure Distribution of Replicated Entropy. Arqit embeds replicated entropy in data centers that host the Arqit QuantumCloudTM system which provides\nthe source for key creation. Arqit is able to securely deliver replicated entropy to data centers globally using a set of classical digital hardware and\nsoftware elements. Arqit does not distribute keys to data centers, it distributes replicated entropy, which are an input into a key creation process involving\nother areas of Arqit proprietary classical cryptography.\n● QuantumCloudTM Software. Arqit’s QuantumCloudTM software shares data across multiple data centers, encrypting each piece of data uniquely using a\nmanagement layer which never knows the customer data.\n● End Point Security. Arqit invented a novel form of end point security called “distributed secure communications cryptography” or “DSCC” whereby\nend points can create initial symmetric key- protected channels and limitless group or session keys. The end points rely on the QuantumCloudTM platform\nto deliver replicated entropy but create keys themselves, such that the keys are always unknowable by any third party. Arqit’s DSCC invention allows\nquantum-safe cryptography to be commercialized for the mass market.\nQuantumCloudTM Platform\nQuantumCloudTM is a platform as a service that creates a secure global mesh between different cloud providers and on-premises data centers around the\nglobe. QuantumCloudTM supplies the platform that enables end points to share data securely for the creation of new keys. It also allows Arqit to provide\nhighly secure services for customers to store, communicate and sign their data. This platform as a service architecture means that Arqit’s customers can\neasily integrate quantum safe cryptographic services into new or existing platforms.\nArqit can extend this secure platform to give customers access to their keys, in a quantum safe manner anywhere in the globe. QuantumCloudTM uses\ndifferent quantum keys at every layer of infrastructure and with each piece of data. The system ensures that data centers only communicate across quantum\nsafe channels. Within these channels, a form of technology divides data into separate pieces for storage across different data centers, and orders and records\nencrypted addresses at which the different pieces are stored. Transactions are signed with quantum keys and layered into this technology. Quantum keys are\nmoved inside the QuantumCloudTM using a novel symmetric key algorithm called “ARQ20”, which Arqit has patent pending for use exclusively within\nQuantumCloudTM. Finally, data is sent out to the secure end points inside the quantum encrypted channel achieved by the use of keys created using the\nDSCC process.\nAs a result, Arqit can store and transact data securely in the cloud and to include any form of end point device within this security boundary. There are\nmany applications of this, and Arqit expects to be able to make fundamental contributions to innovation in many industries. For example, blockchain\nsoftware can be made quantum safe by the use of Arqit’s new signing technology and digital wallets at the end point and their transactions can be secured.\nThe connected car market cannot safely operate in the long term unless the\n25\nTable of Contents\nencryption of its communications channels are secure. The expanded attack surface of 5G mobile networks and IoT deployments demand urgent\nimprovement, and no data stored in and transferred from the cloud can be relied upon for the long term without quantum safe security.\nThe ability to create new symmetric keys at the end points as moderated by QuantumCloudTM is an extremely important innovation, and is a step forward\nfor organizations who already use a legacy method of infrequently refreshing symmetric encryption keys. Many organizations in defense, financial services\nand critical national infrastructure have never trusted PKI and so used symmetric encryption keys by physically transporting them. However, even\nsymmetrical encryption keys that are physically transported must be refreshed to provide secrecy. The more times a key is used, the more likely an attacker\nmight learn about it over time, and the more opportunities there may be for it to be stolen. Therefore, QuantumCloudTM provides some very significant\nadvantages to such organizations.\nCompetitive Strengths\nArqit’s unique cybersecurity technology provides it with a number of competitive strengths.\nSymmetric keys are secure\nArqit’s platform creates symmetric encryption keys, which is a cyber-security technology that is secure against all forms of attack including by quantum\ncomputers. PKI is currently the most widely-used encryption technology, but it is failing to prevent escalating cyber-attacks like ransomware and is entirely\nvulnerable to attack by quantum computers, which are expected to become available within the next few years. A symmetric encryption key, once created,\nis computationally secure.\nThis means that it is regarded as impossible, even for a quantum computer, to guess a symmetric encryption key in less than millions of years. Arqit’s\ntechnology is built around this secure encryption tool.\nGroundbreaking and proprietary distribution technology\nThe importance of Arqit’s platform lies in its ability to “distribute” symmetric keys securely at scale by creating them at end points. Although symmetric\nencryption keys are secure, to date there has been no secure way to create and distribute symmetric keys electronically. Arqit’s groundbreaking technology\nhas solved these known issues. Its innovations create symmetric encryption keys at end points when they are needed, at scale, securely, at any kind of end\npoint device and in groups of any size. With Arqit’s technology, symmetric encryption keys are never “delivered”, they are created at endpoints, and so\nthey cannot be intercepted. This is a completely new way to create and distribute unbreakable symmetric keys that represents a groundbreaking, novel\ntechnology. The keys are created with what is known as a “zero trust model” which means that no third party computer ever has the key, or sufficient\ninformation to recreate or guess the key. The key is never transmitted in creation across any network. It is therefore not possible for any third party to know\nor guess the key during creation.\nSimple to implement\nSymmetric encryption keys are built into almost every major software system, so their use, along with a symmetric algorithm such as AES256, is very\nsimple to deploy with no major change to existing customer infrastructure. Symmetric encryption keys impose relatively low computational burdens on end\npoint devices, and Arqit’s lightweight agent is light enough to work on even the smallest of Internet of Things sensors.\nEasily scalable\nArqit’s software, fulfilled from the cloud, automatically creates keys in infinite volumes at minimal cost, resulting in low capital expenditure once\ndeployed. From an operating cost perspective, there is no human analysis or information processing required by Arqit’s product, so personnel costs are\nlimited to maintaining core infrastructure, marketing and customer support. These factors make Arqit’s products easily scalable for both Arqit and its\ncustomers.\nArqit’s Products\nQuantumCloudTM\nArqit’s core product is QuantumCloudTM, which is a platform as a service that, in conjunction with its software agent, creates keys in the cloud and at end\npoints. These keys can be used variously to encrypt channels, encrypt data at rest and sign transactions.\nThese products will be delivered in the cloud, requiring no extra infrastructure or hardware on the part of the customer, and with the use of simple\nlightweight agents at end points like servers, firewalls, mobile phones, cars or Internet of Things sensors.\n26\nTable of Contents\nAs a platform as a service QuantumCloudTM is broadly applicable across all geographies and sectors, delivering the same key creation functionality to all\napplications and use cases. This provides Arqit with the flexibility to identify and develop Software as a Service products in areas such as identity,\ndistributed ledger and financial payments which would have sufficient benefit and differentiation from the stronger, simpler encryption that Arqit provides\nto potentially give it a route to leadership in certain vertical markets, rather than selling to all legacy market participants.\nService Variants\n· Multi-Tenanted: This is Arqit’s standard service where customers use a shared service hosted in the cloud by Arqit on servers owned by Arqit\nand operated on a multi-tenanted basis. Pricing for this option will typically be a one-time fee per end point installation, as well as a fee per keys\ncreated. Pricing will vary depending on the number of end points and keys consumed.\n· Private Instance: QuantumCloudTM can also be sold as a private instance, typically for government customers who want total control over all\ninfrastructure.\n· Standardized Products: Arqit has developed standardized products to address specific customer use cases. Marketing standardized products is\nthe key focus of its sales efforts.\nStandardized Products\nArqit has developed a set of standardized products which address specific customer use cases. By standardizing a product Arqit can quickly meet an end\nmarket need with little or no customization for individual customers to begin utilizing its technology. To date, Arqit has announced three standardized\nproducts.\n· NetworkSecureTM: Arqit has developed a standardized interface for network devices, like firewalls, to agree quantum-safe symmetric keys and\nupgrade the security of VPN connections over Internet Security Protocol (“IPsec”) – a secure network protocol suite that authenticates and\nencrypts packets of data to provide secure encrypted communication between two computers over a network. To date, Arqit has integrated\nNetworkSecureTM into the firewall products of Juniper and Fortinet and is available for purchase through their respective distribution channels.\nArqit is in discussions with additional firewall and network device manufacturers regarding integrating NetworkSecureTM. Integrating into firewall\nand network devices makes the purchasing decision for the end customer simpler as upgrading to Arqit’s symmetric key cryptography becomes an\nup-sell rather than a discrete purchasing decision and implementation.\n· TradeSecureTM: TradeSecureTM generates and distributes digital trade finance instruments, protecting finance supply chains against disruption\nand fraud and improving their cash flow. TradeSecureTM can be deployed into any trade financing platform, giving customers quantum-safe\nsecurity against all current and future cyber threats. Using distributed ledger technology, Arqit provides customers with a unique referenceable and\ntransferable digital finance instrument - which is easier to manage than paper-based alternatives.\n· WalletSecureTM: An application product which makes any Ethereum-based digital wallet used to store and transact digital asset transactions\nquantum-safe. WalletSecureTM can secure the issuance of digital assets, the storage and transacting of digital assets and enforcing of real-time\nregulatory compliance. Arqit believes that the mainstream adoption of digital assets is accelerating and that providing long term security is\nimportant to financial services company adoption of digital asset technology. Not only can Arqit’s quantum-safe technology prevent today’s\ncybercriminals from stealing digital assets (even if they are able to steal the private keys held by the user), it also enables real-time regulatory\nenforcement, preventing non-compliant transactions before they occur.\nArqit expects to introduce additional standardized product in the future which have at their core Arqit’s QuantumCloudTM symmetric key technology.\nGo-to-Market Strategy\nArqit is focused on the following key end markets:\n· Telecommunications\n· Financial\nservices\n· Large\nenterprises\n27\nTable of Contents\n· Government\n· Defense\nArqit has entered into contracts for QuantumCloudTM service in several geographies and sectors, including AUCloud in Australia and BT and Nine23 in the\nUK.\nArqit’s initial go-to-market had been focused on developing an enterprise license sales model directly to customers. The May 2022 publication of the\nindependent review and assurance of the security proofs for the design aspects of the key-establishment protocols used to enable symmetric key agreement\nover classical IP network infrastructures within QuantumCloudTM in Arqit’s product by the University of Surrey, a GCHQ UK National Cyber Security\nCentre Accredited Centre of Excellence for Cyber Security, increased interest in Arqit’s symmetric key agreement software by leading technology\ncompanies. During 2022, Arqit shifted its focus to the establishment of channel partner relationships and announced agreements with Fortinet, AWS and\nTraxPay. Since the announcement of those channel partnerships, Arqit has established additional relationships with Juniper Networks, Sierra Nevada\nCorporation Mission Systems UK (SNC), SecureCloud+, Exclusive Networks, DETASAD, AIEE and Carahsoft. Pursuant to these relationships, channel\npartners will offer QuantumCloudTM and or Arqit’s standardized products directly or indirectly to customers as part of their integrated product offering.\nGoing forward Arqit intends to primarily focus on maximizing sales opportunities through these and other potential major technology partners. The\nfollowing are Arqit’s current channel and distribution partner relationships:\nService or Product: Channel and Distribution Partners:\nArqit QuantumCloud™ BT, AUCloud, Nine23, DETASAD, AIEE\nArqit NetworkSecure™ Juniper, Fortinet, BT, Exclusive Networks\nArqit TradeSecure™ Traxpay\nE, DndE TMAaSrkAeDt Focus: Channel and Distribution Partners:\nEnterprise BT, Traxpay, Exclusive Networks, AUCloud, Nine23, AIEE,\nDETASAD\nGovernment (including defence) VTC, LLC dba Total Site Solutions, SNC, BT, DETASAD,\nAIEE, SecureCloud+, AUCloud, Nine23, Exclusive Networks\nGeographic Focus: Channel and Distribution Partners:\nGlobal BT\nU.S. VTC, LLC dba Total Site Solutions, Exclusive Networks\nEurope Traxpay, Nine23, SecureCloud+\nMEA DETASAD, AIEE\nAsia AUCloud\nArqit expects to continue to use a direct enterprise sales model for certain customers, including government customers for specified programs.\nOther Technologies\nArqit may create other novel technologies which can be developed using its specific expertise in quantum physics, engineering and software. Where early\ncustomers can be identified to share risks in the development of such technologies, Arqit is likely to partner with such customers to develop technologies.\nCompetition\nArqit’s competitors are suppliers of QKD, quantum encryption and legacy encryption services. There have been a significant number of entrants into these\nmarkets in the last five years, mostly in the areas of QKD and post-quantum cryptography.\n· QKD Systems: These are predominantly fiber optic-based QKD systems that are limited by both distance as well as their point to point nature.\nAlthough they all have products in market, they are at early stages with a number of pilots requiring significant support from the QKD vendors.\nThe majority of these providers are targeting data center architectures with a product that has\n28\nTable of Contents\na limit of around 100 kilometers, meaning that it is only suitable in a metro area. With the cost, complexity and point to point nature of the\ntechnology, it is always going to be limited.\n· Post-Quantum Cryptography: There are number of companies that are creating services based on “post-quantum algorithms” which are\ncryptographic algorithms that are designed to extend the principles of PKI to be more secure against attack by a quantum computer. Such\nalgorithms can never be “provably secure” against quantum attack because they are mathematical in their construction, and therefore only secure\nuntil a quantum computer can be programmed to break them. According to the NIST, none of these algorithms represent a suitable “drop-in\nreplacement” for legacy encryption. These weaknesses, compared with the fact that Arqit’s keys are used inside algorithms like AES256 that are\nalready globally standardized gives Arqit strong differentiation.\n· Legacy Encryption Competitors: The legacy encryption key management market spans a number of different product categories from hardware\nsecurity modules to key management software, and along with most product categories has seen existing and new entrants into the market offering\n“as a service” versions of these products. The goal of these vendors is to reduce the management burden and costs of PKI and to reduce the\ndowntime risk by automating processes. They are therefore not direct competitors of Arqit as they are not addressing the near-term threat of\nquantum computers or other fundamental issues of PKI.\n· Traditional Key Management: There are a number of traditional incumbents in the key management space. Most of these vendors started as\nhardware security modules and have added additional key management software and other features. They are already being distributed by\nstart-ups in this sector as they have difficulty delivering functionality as a service to agile environments.\n· Machine Identity Management: New entrants into the key management market are aligning around “machine identity management” rather\nthan the pure traditional key management. However, the fundamental goal of these technologies are to mitigate the risks and shortcomings of\nPKI in the modern internet.\n· DevOps/Cloud Key Management: Where developers have been struggling to integrate PKI into their development pipelines, a number of the\ncloud providers and development automation frameworks have included key management into their platforms. Cloud providers are rarely seen\nproviding encryption services outside of their own platforms.\n· Manual Key Distribution: Finally there are companies who provide on premises appliances and human courier services for the current\nmethodology of using symmetric key encryption. The UK Government provides its own service through a department of the National Cyber\nSecurity Centre called the UK Key Production Agency, which is the master source of trust in the product of symmetric keys which are\ndelivered through these physical courier methods to a variety of government and commercial customers.\nSatellite Infrastructure\nArqit’s technology stack previously contemplated the use of satellite technology for the distribution of replicated entropy. Through innovation Arqit was\nable to replace satellite distribution with terrestrial distribution. Arqit announced in December 2022 that it expects that these changes to its technology\nstrategy may result in a portion of capitalized satellite costs recouped as a result of a sale of the satellite currently under construction, joint venture\ndevelopment and operation of the satellite, and or the licensing of its ARQ19 intellectual property. In May 2023 Arqit retained an adviser to assist in the\nprocess of pursing the sale of its satellite division amongst other potential transactions. An additional benefit would be the elimination of future capital and\noperating expenditures associated with use of satellites as part of its core product offering. Arqit continues to pursue such potential transactions. There can\nbe no certainty of the successful conclusion of any such transaction. Arqit intends to continue to perform under its satellite construction contracts with the\nEuropean Space Agency and QinetiQ Space NV until such time as final determination of how to proceed with its satellite under development, and income\nand expenses from those contracts has been and will be recognized by Arqit as “other operating income” as part of “profit on discontinued operations” in its\nfinancial statements, however recognition of significant future other operating income associated with the satellite asset held for sale is uncertain.\nIntellectual Property\nThe ability to protect its material intellectual property is paramount to Arqit’s business. Arqit relies upon a combination of protections afforded to owners of\npatents, designs, copyrights, trade secrets, and trademarks, along with employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements and other contractual restrictions\nto establish and protect its intellectual property rights. In particular, unpatented trade secrets in the fields of research, development and engineering are an\nimportant aspect of Arqit’s business by ensuring that its technology and\n29\nTable of Contents\nstrategic business assets remain confidential. Arqit pursues patent protection when it believes it has developed a patentable invention and the benefits of\nobtaining a patent outweigh the risks of making the invention public through patent filings.\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, Arqit has approximately 1,966 patent claims on 41 pending or granted patents in the UK. Arqit pursues global\nregistration of its domain names and products and services trademarks and as of the date of this Annual Report, Arqit had 28 registered trademarks.\nBased on the filing dates of Arqit’s existing patent applications, and assuming the patents are granted and renewed throughout their lifetimes, Arqit\ncurrently expects each patent right to provide protection for up to 20 years from the relevant filing dates which, as of the date of this Annual Report, range\nfrom June 4, 2018 to October 27, 2023.\nArqit regularly reviews its development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new inventions and is prepared to file additional patent\napplications when it determines it would benefit its business to do so.\nGroup Structure\nArqit Limited, a company limited by shares incorporated in England, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and is the Company’s primary\noperating subsidiary. Arqit Limited has five wholly-owned subsidiaries: Arqit Inc., a Delaware corporation, Arqit LLC, a Delaware limited liability\ncompany, Arqit Italia S.R.L., an entity organized in Italy, Arqit Quantum PTY Ltd, an entity organized in Australia and Arqit Quantum (Singapore) Pte.\nLtd, a limited liability Singapore company. None of Arqit Limited’s subsidiaries currently has any material operations. Arqit Limited also holds 50% of the\noutstanding share capital of Quantum Keep Limited, a company limited by shares incorporated in England. Quantum Keep Limited is a joint venture with\nDentons Nominees Limited and Middle East Limited, which together hold the remaining outstanding share capital. Quantum Keep Limited was formed to\ndevelop an application initially for use by law firms that verifies and stores identity information and associates customer records with that identity.\nGovernment Regulation\nInternational Traffic in Arms Regulations and Export Controls\nArqit is subject to U.S. and U.K. import and export control laws, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”) and Export\nAdministration Regulations (“EAR”) of the Bureau of Industry and Security of the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.K. Export Control Act 2002\n(as amended and extended by the Export Control Order 2008) and their respective implementing rules and regulations. The ITAR generally restricts the\nexport of hardware, software, technical data, and services that have defense or strategic applications. The EAR similarly regulates the export of hardware,\nsoftware, and technology that has commercial or “dual-use” applications (i.e., for both military and commercial applications) or that have less sensitive\nmilitary or space-related applications that are not subject to the ITAR. The regulations exist to advance the national security and foreign policy interests of\nthe U.S.\nThe U.S. government agencies responsible for administering the ITAR and the EAR have significant discretion in the interpretation and enforcement of\nthese regulations. The agencies also have significant discretion in approving, denying, or conditioning authorizations to engage in controlled activities. Such\ndecisions are influenced by the U.S. government’s commitments to multilateral export control regimes, particularly the Missile Technology Control Regime\nconcerning the spaceflight business.\nMany different types of internal controls and measures are required to ensure compliance with such export control rules. The inability to secure and\nmaintain other necessary export authorizations could negatively impact Arqit’s ability to compete successfully. Failure to comply with export control laws\nand regulations could expose Arqit to civil or criminal penalties, fines, investigations, more onerous compliance requirements, loss of export privileges,\ndebarment from government contracts, or limitations on its ability to enter into contracts with the U.S. or U.K. government. In addition, any changes in\nexport control regulations or U.S. or U.K. government licensing policy, such as that necessary to implement U.S. and U.K. government commitments to\nmultilateral control regimes, may restrict its operations. See “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Arqit’s Business and Operations — Failure to comply with\ngovernmental trade controls, including export and import control laws and regulations, sanctions, and related regimes could subject Arqit to liability or\nloss of contracting privileges, limit its ability to compete in certain markets or harm its reputation with the governments.”\nAnti-Bribery, Anti-Corruption and Sanctions Laws and Regulations\nArqit’s operations are subject to anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act,\nand economic and trade sanctions, including those administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Treasury, the U.S. Department of State\nand the European Union. These statutes generally prohibit providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business\nor securing any improper business advantage. Arqit may deal with both governments and state-owned business enterprises, the employees of which are\nconsidered foreign officials for purposes of these laws.\n30\nTable of Contents\nData Protection Laws and Regulations\nArqit’s operations and sales are subject to laws and regulations addressing privacy and the collection, use, storage, disclosure, transfer and protection of a\nvariety of types of data, including the UK Data Protection Act 2018, the UK General Data Protection Regulation, European Directive 2002/58/EC (the\nePrivacy Directive) and implementing national legislation and any data laws and regulations enacted in the United Kingdom post-Brexit. These regimes\nmay, among other things, impose data security requirements, disclosure requirements, and restrictions on data collection, uses, and sharing that may impact\nArqit’s operations and the development of its business. Arqit’s products collect, store and process certain information and its products may evolve to\ncollect additional information. Compliance with these and any other applicable privacy and data security laws and regulations is a rigorous and time-\nintensive process, and Arqit may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with new data protection rules. For further\ninformation, see “Item 3.D. Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Arqit’s Business — Failures, or perceived failures, to comply with privacy, data protection,\nand information security requirements in the jurisdictions in which Arqit operates may adversely impact its business, and such legal requirements are\nevolving and may require improvements in, or changes to, its policies and operations.”\nOther Regulations\nIn addition, Arqit is subject to laws and regulations relating to antitrust, competition, intellectual property and other matters. Arqit has implemented internal\ncontrols designed to minimize and detect potential violations of laws and regulations in a timely manner, but can provide no assurance that such policies\nand procedures will be followed at all times or will effectively detect and prevent violations of the applicable laws by one or more of its employees,\nconsultants, agents, or partners.\n4.C.

OPERATING RESULTS\nThis operating and financial review should be read together with the section captioned “Item 4, Information on the Company-4.B. Business Overview” and\nthe audited consolidated financial statements of the Company and the related notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Among\nother things, the audited consolidated financial statements include more detailed information regarding the basis of preparation for the following\ninformation. The audited consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with IFRS. This discussion contains\nforward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a\n31\nTable of Contents\nresult of many factors, such as those set forth under “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Form 20-F, our actual results may differ materially from those\nanticipated in these forward-looking statements. Please see “Cautionary Note About Forward-Looking Statements” in this Annual Report.\nOverview\nArqit is a cybersecurity company that has pioneered a unique symmetric key agreement technology which makes the communications links of any\nnetworked device or data at rest secure against current and future forms of cyber attack — even an attack from a quantum computer. Arqit delivers its\nsymmetric key agreement technology via its QuantumCloudTM.\nQuantumCloudTM is a software platform as a service that creates unbreakable software encryption keys that are low cost and easy to use within existing\ninformation technology standards with no new hardware and no major software upgrades or “rip and replace” required.\nThe software has potentially universal application to every edge device and cloud machine in the world. The security proofs for the design aspects of the\nkey-establishment protocols used to enable symmetric key agreement over classical IP network infrastructures within QuantumCloudTM were independently\nassured in 2022 by the University of Surrey, which is accredited as a Centre of Excellence for Cyber Security by the UK Government’s National Cyber\nSecurity Centre. Arqit believes that its symmetric key agreement platform is compliant with the NSA Commercial Solutions for Classified Symmetric Key\nManagement Requirements Annex 1.2 which dictates how Government agencies can incorporate quantum-safe symmetric key protections into solutions\nwhich use off-the-shelf commercial products to protect classified networks.\nArqit’s technology combines world-leading innovation in two areas: the secure distribution of replicated entropy to data centers and a software agent that\ncan be downloaded onto any device and makes the use of symmetric key encryption a scalable business model.\n● As part of the background technology that allows Arqit’s software agent to operate at end points, identical sets of random numbers (“replicated\nentropy”) must be delivered securely and frequently to data centers. Replicated entropy is an important constituent part of Arqit’s QuantumCloud™\nproduct. Arqit developed a propriety method for the secure distribution of replicated entropy to data centres using classical digital hardware and\nsoftware elements.\n● A second innovation is a small software agent downloaded from the QuantumCloud™ onto any form of device or integrated into any piece of\nsoftware. By exchanging information with the QuantumCloud™, which moderates a key agreement process with all parties involved in a unique\nway, this software agent is able to create new symmetric encryption keys in partnership with any other device or cloud machine, or in large groups\nof devices. Keys are never “delivered”, they are created, and so they cannot be intercepted. They are created at the end points in a manner that\nmeans they can never be known by a third party, and can be used once if necessary and replaced infinitely. Once created, the keys cannot be broken\neven by a universal quantum computer in a usable time period, estimated to be in excess of millions of years.\nArqit began commercializing its products in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. Arqit has already signed contracts for its services with large\ncompanies and government institutions. Arqit sold its product to select early customers on a master distribution agreement basis, an enterprise license basis\nand as a platform as a service, including BT plc, AUCloud and Nine23. Arqit announced in December 2022 that it will focus on selling its products on a\nPlatform as a Service basis, primarily through channel partners and distributors, which is expected to generate annual recurring revenue. Arqit platform as a\nservice will be sold as standardized products to specific target markets or a Private Instance to customers to require control of the end-to-end technology.\nArqit has announced channel partnerships and distribution agreements with Juniper, Fortinet, AWS, TraxPay, Exclusive Networks, Sierra Nevada\nCorporation Mission Systems UK, SecureCloud+, DETASAD, Advanced International Electronic Equipment Company, and Carahsoft through which it\nwill sell directly and indirectly to end customers. Arqit is currently engaged in discussions with additional customers, channel partners and distributors.\n32\nTable of Contents\nThe Business Combination\nArqit Limited was incorporated in England in 2017. In September 2021, the Company completed the Business Combination pursuant to which the\nCompany merged with and into Centricus Acquisition Corp., with the Company surviving the merger, and the security holders of Centricus Acquisition\nCorp. (other than those who elected to redeem their ordinary shares) became security holders of the Company, and the Company acquired all of the issued\nand outstanding share capital of Arqit Limited from the shareholders of Arqit Limited in exchange for ordinary shares of the Company, such that Arqit\nLimited is a direct wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.\nThe acquisition of Arqit Limited’s shares by the Company has been accounted for as a “reverse acquisition” in accordance with IFRS. Under this method of\naccounting, the Company will be treated as the “acquired” company for financial reporting purposes. This determination was primarily based on the fact\nthat Arqit Limited’s shareholders hold a majority of the voting power of the combined company, Arqit Limited’s operations substantially comprise the\nongoing operations of the combined company, Arqit Limited’s designees comprise a majority of the governing body of the combined company, and Arqit\nLimited’s senior management comprises the senior management of the combined company. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the acquisition of Arqit\nLimited’s shares by the Company has been treated as the equivalent of Arqit Limited issuing shares for the net assets of the Company, accompanied by a\nrecapitalization. It has been determined that the Company is not a business under IFRS, hence the transaction is accounted for within the scope of IFRS 2\n(Share-based Payments). In accordance with IFRS 2, the difference in the fair value of the Arqit Limited equity instruments deemed issued to the\nCompany’s shareholders over the fair value of identifiable net assets of the Company represents a service for listing, and is accounted for as a share-based\npayment which is expensed as incurred. The net assets will be stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. Operations\nprior to the acquisition of the Arqit Limited shares by the Company have been deemed to be those of Arqit Limited. Upon closing of the Business\nCombination, the Company became the successor SEC registrant, and Arqit Limited’s financial statements for previous periods have been included as part\nof the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, and to be disclosed in its future periodic reports filed with the\nSEC. The Company is a foreign private issuer as defined under Rule 405 under the Securities Act and prepares its financial statements denominated in U.S.\ndollars and in accordance with IFRS.\nKey Factors Affecting Operating Results\nArqit has not yet begun to generate material revenues through the commercialization of its products and believes that its performance and future success\ndepend on several factors that present significant opportunities for it but also pose risks and challenges, including those discussed below and in the section\nof this Annual Report entitled “Item 3.D, Risk Factors — Risks Related to Arqit’s Business and Operations”.\nAccounting for Business Combination\nThe acquisition of Arqit Limited’s shares by Arqit in connection with the Business Combination was accounted for as a “reverse acquisition” in accordance\nwith IFRS. Under this method of accounting, Arqit was treated as the “acquired” company for financial reporting purposes.\nThis determination was primarily based on the fact that Arqit Limited’s shareholders hold a majority of the voting power of the combined company, Arqit\nLimited’s operations substantially comprise the ongoing operations of the combined company, Arqit Limited’s designees are comprised a majority of the\ngoverning body of the combined company, and Arqit Limited’s senior management is the senior management of the combined company.\nAccordingly, for accounting purposes, the acquisition of Arqit Limited’s shares by Arqit is treated as the equivalent of Arqit Limited issuing shares for the\nnet assets of Arqit, accompanied by a recapitalization. It has been determined that Arqit is not a business under IFRS, hence the transaction is accounted for\nwithin the scope of IFRS 2 (Share-based Payments).\nIn accordance with IFRS 2, the difference in the fair value of the Arqit Limited equity instruments deemed issued to Arqit shareholders over the fair value\nof identifiable net assets of Arqit represents a service for listing, and is accounted for as a share-based payment which is expensed as incurred, and is\nreflected on Arqit’s consolidated statement of comprehensive income as “reverse acquisition expense.” Operations prior to the acquisition of the Arqit\nLimited shares by Arqit will be deemed to be those of Arqit Limited.\n33\nTable of Contents\nValuation of Warrants\nPursuant to the guidance in IFRS 9 (Financial Instruments), Arqit has determined that its Business Combination Warrants should be classified as derivative\nliabilities measured at fair value on its statement of financial position, with any changes in fair value to be reported each period in earnings on its statement\nof comprehensive income. As a result of the recurring fair value measurement, Arqit’s financial statements may fluctuate quarterly, based on factors which\nare outside of its control. Due to the recurring fair value measurement, Arqit expects that it will recognize non-cash gains or losses on its Business\nCombination Warrants each reporting period and that the amount of such gains or losses could be material.\nTechnologically Advanced Product Portfolio\nArqit has invented a unique symmetric key agreement technology which makes the communications links of any networked device secure against current\nand future forms of cyber attack — even an attack from a quantum computer. Arqit’s product, called QuantumCloud™, creates unbreakable software\nencryption keys that are low cost and easy to use. Arqit’s software is fulfilled from the cloud requiring no extra infrastructure or hardware on the part of the\ncustomer. Its products have broad application across industries, including 5G networks, connected autonomous vehicles, national security and financial\nservices network security. Arqit’s future success will be dependent on its ability to continue to execute against its product roadmap.\nCommencement of Commercialization and Partnerships\nArqit is early in the process to generate material revenues through the commercialization of its products, and in December 2022 began transitioning its\ndistribution model from an enterprise license model to distribution through channel partners. Arqit ultimately achieving profitability is dependent upon the\nsuccessful development, commercial introduction and acceptance of its products, the continued interest of potential customers in its products and the\nsuccessful negotiation of contracts with those customers. Should Arqit’s assumptions about the commercialization of its encryption technology prove overly\noptimistic or if Arqit is unable to develop, obtain or progress its partnerships, Arqit may fail to generate operating cash flow and may incur delays in its\nability to achieve profitability. This may also lead Arqit to make changes to its commercialization plans, which could result in cost overruns or\nunanticipated delays, which could in turn adversely impact margins and cash flows.\nSatellite Infrastructure\nIn December 2022 Arqit updated its technology strategy to eliminate quantum satellites andt he associated ground infrastructure from its core\nQuantumCloudTM product offering. See “Item 4.B. Business Overview - Satellite Infrastructure.”\nIn connection with this update, Arqit is planning to sell or otherwise monetize its quantum satellite currently under construction. During the fiscal year\nended September 30, 2023, Arqit reclassified its satellite assets from “intangible assets” to “assets classified as held for sale”, in connection with which it\nrecognised an impairment loss of $17.6 million. Arqit intends to continue to perform under its satellite construction contracts with the European Space\nAgency and QinetiQ Space NV until such time as final determination of how to proceed with its satellite under development, and income and expenses\nfrom those contracts will be recognised by Arqit as “other operating income” as part of “profit on discontinued operations” in its statement of\ncomprehensive income, however recognition of significant future other operating income associated with the satellite asset held for sale is uncertain. If\nArqit fails to sell its satellite currently under construction, it may be required to recognise further impairment losses, write off capitalized satellite costs or\nincur breakage fees under certain of its contracts related to satellite construction obligations.\nMarket Trends\nArqit believes there will be a transformation in the cyber encryption industry over the next decade as PKI, the most widely-used encryption technology, is\nbecoming less secure as new technologies develop, and is not secure against quantum computers, which are expected to become available within the next\nfew years. Arqit anticipates that there will be robust demand for its products as consumers, businesses and governments across all geographies and\nindustries will need to replace the existing cyber encryption technology used in almost all electronic interfaces in order to maintain cyber security and that,\nas a result, there is significant market opportunity for Arqit’s more secure cyber encryption products. Gartner estimates that the global addressable market\nfor information security services will be $289 billion by the end of 2027.\nThere will continue to be demand for more secure encryption products and Arqit is not currently aware of any competitors that offer or are developing\nencryption technology that addresses the threat of quantum computers. Arqit’s competitors are suppliers of QKD, quantum encryption and legacy\nencryption, each of which has inherent limitations. Therefore Arqit believes that it is well positioned to take advantage of this market opportunity. Arqit’s\nfuture growth and financial performance is highly dependent on the continued demand for its products and on its ability to successfully compete with any\ncurrent or new competitors.\n34\nTable of Contents\nMargin Improvements\nArqit believes that it has the opportunity to establish high margin unit economics when operating at scale as its software, fulfilled from the cloud,\nautomatically creates keys in infinite volumes at minimal cost, resulting in low capital expenditure once deployed. Its business model is positioned for\nscalability due to the low costs of software distribution, ability to leverage the same product platform across its partner base and limited personnel costs.\nFrom an operating cost perspective, there is no human analysis or information processing required by Arqit’s product, so personnel costs are limited to\nmaintaining core infrastructure, marketing and customer support. Arqit’s future performance will depend on its ability to deliver on these economies of\nscale with lower product costs to enable widespread adoption. Achievement of cash flow generation is dependent on order volume, which will dictate\npricing and margin. Achieving this scale is further dependent on successful adoption of Arqit’s products and expansion of its contracts with existing\ncustomers. While Arqit believes its unique technology provides a compelling value proposition for favorable margins and expects to achieve and maintain\nhigh margins on its products, emergence of competition in the cyber encryption industry may negatively impact its pricing, margins and market share.\nImpact of the COVID-19 Pandemic\nGiven the nature of its products and business operations, the COVID-19 pandemic did not have any material impact, positive or negative, on Arqit’s\nbusiness during the periods under review.\nKey Components of Statement of Comprehensive Income\nBasis of Presentation\nCurrently, Arqit conducts business through one operating segment, which is the provision of cybersecurity services. Prior to July 2021, Arqit was a pre-\nrevenue company and as of the date of this Annual Report, it still has only limited commercial operations relating to its core product — QuantumCloud™.\nIts activities to date have been conducted in the United Kingdom and the United States of America. Arqit’s historical results are reported in IFRS.\nRevenue\nArqit commenced commercialization and began generating revenue in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 through QuantumCloud™ — its core\nproduct. The majority of revenue is expected to be derived from the sale of QuantumCloud™ and other related services through channel partners.\nOther income\nOther income relates to income from the sale of property, plant and equipment.\nAdministrative Expenses\nAdministrative expenses primarily consist of the costs associated with employment of Arqit’s non-satellite construction staff, legal, insurance, accounting\nand consulting expenses, travel and marketing expenses such as public relations activities, rent and general office expenses.\nAdministrative expenses also include depreciation charges. Depreciation charges mainly relate to the depreciation of computer equipment calculated under\nthe straight-line depreciation method over the equipment’s estimated useful life. The rate used is between three and five years. Computer equipment is\nwritten off over three years.\nArqit operates an equity-settled share-based incentive scheme and its share-based charges are included as part of administrative expenses. In addition,\nchanges in the valuation of accounts denominated in currencies other than British pounds sterling are reflected in administrative expenses.\nArqit expects its administrative expenses to increase as its overall activity levels increase due to the commencement and expansion of commercial\noperations, and costs associated with being a public company.\n35\nTable of Contents\nImpairment Loss on Trade Receivables and Contract Assets\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2023, Arqit incurred impairment loss on trade receivables and contract assets as a result of impairment recognized in\nconnection with a provision for amounts owed to Arqit by Virgin Orbit Inc, which has filed for bankruptcy in the U.S.\nImpairment Losses on Intangible Assets\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, Arqit reclassified its satellite assets from “intangible assets” to “assets classified as held for sale”, and in\nconnection with this reclassification, Arqit recognized an impairment loss on its satellite assets.\nReverse Acquisition Expense\nArqit’s Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse acquisition under IFRS 2 (Share-based Payments) whereby Arqit Limited was deemed to\nhave issued shares in exchange for the net assets and listing status of Arqit. The deemed consideration was the fair value of the shares that Arqit Limited\nwould have had to issue to Arqit to acquire the same percentage equity interest in the combined entity that results from the reverse acquisition. The reverse\nacquisition expense represents the premium paid for obtaining the public listing, and is calculated the difference between the fair value of the deemed\nconsideration and the fair value of the net assets acquired, and is a non-recurring expense.\nNasdaq Listing Expense\nNasdaq listing expense primarily consists of legal and other professional fees incurred in preparation for and execution of the Business Combination, which\nare non-recurring.\nChange in Fair Value of Warrants\nArqit’s Business Combination Warrants are classified as financial liabilities at fair value, and the change in the fair value of the warrants is reflected in\nArqit’s consolidated statement of comprehensive income. A valuation of the warrants was performed as of each period end, and the difference between the\ntwo valuations is non-cash profit or loss that is reflected in Arqit’s consolidated statement of comprehensive income.\nFinance Costs\nFinance costs relate to interest costs on agreements subject to accounting recognition and measurement in accordance with IFRS 16 (Leases).\nFinance costs for the year ended September 30, 2021 also related to the accounting recognition and measurement of Arqit’s £3,500,000 convertible loan\nnotes issued June 21, 2019 and November 6, 2019 (the “Series B convertible loan notes”) in line with the requirements of IFRS, which were converted to\nequity in connection with the completion of the Business Combination and are no longer outstanding.\nThe Series B convertible loan notes had a 0% interest rate and were redeemable at the principal amount plus an amount equal to 20% of such principal\namount at any time on or after the maturity date. As the Series B convertible loan notes were redeemable at the request of the holder and convertible into a\nvariable number of equity instruments, they were treated as a financial liability in accordance with IFRS International Accounting Standards (“IAS”) 32. At\ninitial recognition on day one, the Series B convertible loan notes were measured at fair value, calculated by applying the prevailing market interest rate at\nthe time of issue, for similar non-convertible debt. As the discount unwound over the period from subscription date to maturity date, it was reflected as\nfinance costs in Arqit’s statement of comprehensive income.\nFinance income\nFinance income is related to bank interest income from Arqit’s deposits of cash and cash equivalents.\nProfit from Discontinued Operations\nProfit from discontinued operations is the profit from Arqit’s satellite assets classified as held for sale, and includes other operating income from Arqit’s\nESA contract net of administrative expenses associated with its satellite construction activities. Arqit previously reported income from its agreement with\nthe European Space Agency (“ESA”) for the partial funding of the construction of its satellites as “other operating income” as a component of “operating\nprofit/(loss)”, however during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, Arqit reclassified its satellite assets from “intangible assets” to “assets classified as\nheld for sale”, and therefore income from the ESA\n36\nTable of Contents\nagreement has been reclassified by Arqit as a component of “profit on discontinued operations” in its statement of comprehensive income for the fiscal year\nended September 30, 2023. Corresponding reclassifications have also been made to the statements of comprehensive income for the fiscal years ended\nSeptember 30, 2022 and 2021.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended September 30, 2023 and 2022\nThe following table presents Arqit’s historic operating results:\nYear ended Year ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 September 30, 2022 Variance\n$'000 $'000 $'000 %\nRevenue 640 7,212 (6,572) (91)%\nOther income 53 — 53 —%\nAdministrative expenses (55,201) (70,977) 15,776 (22)%\nImpairment loss on trade receivables and contract assets (12,335) — (12,335) —%\nImpairment losses on intangible assets (17,601) — (17,601) —%\nOperating (loss)/profit (84,444) (63,765) (20,679) 32%\nChange in fair value of warrants 10,638 117,394 (106,756) (91)%\nFinance costs (284) (221) (63) 28%\nFinance income 41 — 41 —%\n(Loss)/profit before tax (74,049) 53,408 (127,457) (239)%\nIncome tax 141 — 141 —%\n(Loss)/proft from continuing operations (73,908) 53,408 (127,316) (238)%\nProfit from discontinued operations 3,515 11,667 (8,152) (69)%\n(Loss)/profit for the financial year (70,393) 65,075 (135,468) (208)%\nRevenue\nRevenue decreased by $6.572 million from $7.212 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 to $0.640 million for the year ended September 30, 2023.\nThe decrease was due to the time required to establish revenue generation through channel partnerships following Arqit’s change in sales model from\nprimarily enterprise sales to sales through channel partners during the year ended September 30, 2023.\nOther income\nOther income increased by $0.53 million for the year ended September 30, 2023 from $nil for the year ended September 30, 2022.

The decrease was primarily the result of decreases in foreign exchange due to the difference in year end rates as at\nSeptember 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, and decreases in share based compensation as a result of the switch to the RSU scheme in the year ended\nSeptember 30, 2022. These decreases were partially offset in part by increases in professional fees and staff costs.\nImpairment Loss on Trade Receivables and Contract Assets\nArqit incurred impairment loss on trade receivables and contract assets of $12.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2023 as a result of impairment\nrecognised in connection with a provision for amounts owed to Arqit by Virgin Orbit Inc., which has filed for bankruptcy in the U.S. No impairment loss on\ntrade receivables and contract assets was recognized for the year ended September 30, 2022.\nImpairment Losses on Intangible Assets\nArqit incurred impairment losses on intangible assets of $17.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2023 as a result of impairment recognised in\nconnection with the reclassification of its satellite assets from “intangible assets” to “assets classified as held for sale”. No impairment losses on intangible\nassets were recognized for the year ended September 30, 2022.\nChange in Fair Value of Warrants\nThe change in fair value of Business Combination Warrants represents the difference in valuation of Arqit’s warrants as of September 30, 2023, compared\nwith the valuation as of September 30, 2022, which was non-cash profit of $10.638 million for the year ended September 30, 2023, compared with a non-\ncash profit of $117.394 million for the year ended September 30, 2022.\nFinance Costs\nFinance costs increased by $0.063 million from $0.221 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 to $0.284 million for the year ended September 30,\n2023. The increase was due to a new lease being signed for the U.S. office in the year resulting in higher finance costs.\nFinance income\nFinance income increased to $0.041 million for the year ended September 30, 2023 from $nil for the year ended September 30, 2022. Finance income for\nthe year ended September 30, 2023 related to bank interest income from Arqit’s deposits of cash and cash equivalents.\nProfit from Discontinued Operations\nProfit from discontinued operations decreased by $8.152 million from $11.667 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 to $3.515 million for the\nyear ended September 30, 20233. During the year ended September 30, 2023, Arqit reached fewer revenue recognition milestones under the ESA contract,\ncompared with the number of milestones during the year ended September 30, 2022.\n38\nTable of Contents\nComparison of the Years Ended September 30, 2022 and 2021\nThe following table presents Arqit’s historic operating results:\nYear ended Year ended\nSeptember 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 Variance\n$'000 $'000 $'000 %\nRevenue 7,212 48 7,164 14,925%\nAdministrative expenses (70,977) (14,559) (56,418) 388%\nReverse acquisition expense — (155,460) 155,460 —\nNasdaq listing expense — (2,590) 2,590 —\nOperating (loss)/profit (63,765) (172,561) 108,796 (63)%\nChange in fair value of warrants 117,394 (98,090) 215,484 (220)%\nFinance costs (221) (1,078) 857 (79)%\nProfit/(loss) before tax 53,408 (271,729) 325,138 (120)%\nProfit/(loss) from continuing operations 53,408 (271,729) 325,138 (120)\nProfit from discontinued operations 11,667 — 11,667 —\nProfit/(loss) for the financial year 65,075 (271,729) 336,805 (124)%\nRevenue\nRevenue increased by $7.164 million from $0.048 million for the year ended September 30, 2021 to $7.212 million for the year ended September 30, 2022.\nThe increase was primarily due to the continued ramp up of Arqit’s commercial operations during the year ended September 30, 2022.\nAdministrative Expenses\nThe following table summarizes Arqit’s administrative expenses for the periods presented:\nYear ended Year ended\nSeptember 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 Variance\n$'000 $'000 $'000 %\nStaff costs 21,148 10,936 10,212 93%\nCapitalisation of staff costs (4,920) (3,478) (1,442) 41%\nProfessional fees 6,355 4,733 1,622 34%\nProperty costs 754 187 567 303%\nShare based compensation 21,742 165 21,577 13,077%\nDepreciation 1,292 53 1,239 2,338%\nForeign exchange 13,535 623 12,912 2,073%\nOther administrative costs 11,071 1,340 9,730 725%\n70,977 14,559 56,418 388%\nTotal administrative expenses have increased by $56.418 million from $14.559 million for the year ended September 30, 2021 to $70.977 million for the\nyear ended September 30, 2022.\nThe increase was in part due to an increase in share based compensation expense of $21.742 million as the result of the granting of restricted share units\n(“RSUs”) to employees and an increase in foreign exchange expense of $13.535 million as the result of market fluctuations from trading in different\ncurrencies. In addition, personnel-related costs increased by $10.212 million (across all administrative functions), reflecting an increase in head count to\nsupport the expansion and growth of Arqit’s business.\nOther administrative costs, which consist of marketing, IT costs and other non-material costs, also increased by $9.734 million as the result of growth in\nbusiness activity levels.\nReverse Acquisition Expense\nArqit did not incur reverse acquisition expense for the year ended September 30, 2022, compared with $155.460 million for the year ended September 30,\n2021. Reverse acquisition expenses represent the non-cash premium paid for obtaining the public listing in connection with the Business Combination\nwhich closed on September 3, 2021, and was therefore a one-time, non-recurring expense for the year ended September 30, 2021.\n39\nTable of Contents\nNasdaq Listing Expense\nArqit did not incur Nasdaq listing expense for the year ended September 30, 2022, compared with $2.590 million for the year ended September 30, 2021.\nNasdaq listing expense primarily consisted of non-recurring legal and other professional fees incurred in preparation for and execution of the Business\nCombination which closed on September 3, 2021, and was therefore a one-time, non-recurring expense for the year ended September 30, 2021.\nChange in Fair Value of Warrants\nThe change in fair value of Business Combination Warrants represents the difference in valuation of Arqit’s warrants as of September 30, 2022, compared\nwith the valuation as of September 30, 2021, which was non-cash profit of $117,394 million for the year ended September 30, 2022, compared with non-\ncash loss of $98.090 million for the year ended September 30, 2021.\nFinance Costs\nFinance costs decreased by $0.857 million from $1.078 million for the year ended September 30, 2021 to $0.221 million for the year ended September 30,\n2021. The increase was primarily due to lower interest expense during the period as the result of convertible loans converting to equity in connection with\nthe Business Combination closing on September 3, 2021. The balance consisted of interest costs incurred on the lease agreements entered into during the\nyear ended September 30, 2022.\nProfit from Discontinued Operations\nProfit from discontinued operations increased by $11.667 million in the year ended September 30, 2022 from nil for the year ended September 30, 2021.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2020, Arqit met milestones under the ESA contract which permitted it to recognize project revenue during that\nperiod, compared with no revenue recognition during the year ended September 30, 2021.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nArqit is exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact Arqit’s financial position due to\nadverse changes in financial market prices and rates. It is, and has been throughout the period under review, Arqit’s policy not to use or trade in derivative\nfinancial instruments. Arqit’s financial instruments comprise its cash and cash equivalents and various items such as trade creditors that arise directly from\nits operations. The main purpose of Arqit’s financial assets and liabilities is to provide finance for its operations in the near term.\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nArqit would be exposed to interest rate risk if it borrows funds, when required, at variable interest rates. There is currently no exposure to interest rate risk.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss where counterparties are not able to meet their obligations. Arqit’s policy is that surplus cash, when not used to pay\nliabilities, is placed on deposit with its main relationship banks and with other banks or money market funds based on a minimum credit rating of A3/A-\nand maximum exposure. There is no significant concentration of risk to any single counterparty. Arqit considers that the credit quality of the various\nreceivables is good in respect of the amounts outstanding and therefore credit risk is considered to be low. There is no significant concentration of risk. The\ncarrying amount of financial assets, represents Arqit’s maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date assuming that any security held has no value.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nArqit operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to British pounds\nsterling and Euro. Arqit holds British pounds sterling, U.S. dollar and Euro bank accounts in order to limit its exposure. Arqit is also exposed to foreign\nexchange risk to the extent that its ultimate parent entity has a U.S. dollar functional currency.\nLiquidity Risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk that Arqit does not have sufficient financial resources available to meet its obligations as they fall due. Arqit manages liquidity risk\nby continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, matching the expected cash flow timings of financial assets and liabilities with the use of cash\nand cash equivalents, borrowings, overdrafts and committed revolving credit facilities with a\n40\nTable of Contents\nminimum of 12 months to maturity. Future borrowing requirements are forecast on a monthly basis and funding headroom is maintained above forecast\npeak requirements to meet unforeseen events.\nJOBS Act\nOn April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for\nqualifying public companies. Arqit qualifies as an “emerging growth company” under the JOBS Act.\nArqit is in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on the reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions\nset forth in the JOBS Act, if, as an “emerging growth company,” Arqit chooses to rely on such exemptions it may not be required to, among other things, (i)\nprovide an auditor’s attestation report on its system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (ii)\ncomply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a\nsupplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis), (iii)\nprovide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and\nConsumer Protection Act (applicable only if Arqit ceased to be a foreign private issuer), and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation related items such\nas the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO’s compensation to median employee compensation\n(applicable only if Arqit ceased to be a foreign private issuer). These exemptions will apply until September 3, 2026 (five years following the closing of the\nBusiness Combination) or until Arqit is no longer an “emerging growth company,” whichever is earlier. Although emerging growth companies are\npermitted under the JOBS Act to comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded)\ncompanies, Arqit does not intend to take advantage of the option to delay compliance.\n5.B. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nArqit began to generate revenue from its principal business operations — the provision of cybersecurity services — in the fiscal year ended September 30,\n2021. Prior to then, as a pre-revenue company, the net losses Arqit has incurred since inception are consistent with its strategy and budget. Arqit will\ncontinue to incur net losses in accordance with its operating plan as it begins commercialization of its products.\nIn the period under review, Arqit has funded its operations, capital expenditure and working capital requirements through public offerings of its securities\nincluding proceeds from (1) completion of the business combination in September 2021, (2) sales of ordinary shares under its ATM Program (as defined\nbelow) and (3) sales of ordinary shares in registered direct offerings in February 2023 and September 2023. Historically, Arqit also funded its operations\nfrom capital contributions, loans and borrowings from certain venture investors and grants from the UK government’s Future Fund, including convertible\nloan notes that were converted into ordinary shares in connection with the Business Combination. Arqit’s primary uses of liquidity in the period under\nreview have been working capital requirements as it continues to increase commercialization of its products.\nIn December 2022, Arqit filed a registration statement on Form F-3 in order to establish an at-the-market equity offering program (the “ATM Program”)\npursuant to which it may issue and sell ordinary shares with an aggregate offering price of up to $30.0 million. Arqit has no obligation to sell any such\nshares under its ATM Program. Actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by the Group from time to time, including, among others,\nwhether additional capital is required, market conditions, the trading price of Arqit’s ordinary shares, determination of the appropriate sources of funding\nfor the Group, and potential uses of available funding. Arqit intends to use the net proceeds from the offering of such shares, if any, for general corporate\npurposes. In the year ended September 30, 2023, Arqit issued 7,814,459 shares under the ATM Program, generating proceeds to the Company before fees\nand expenses of approximately $11.5 million.\nIn February 2023, Arqit completed a registered direct offering in which it sold 10,000,000 ordinary shares, together with warrants to purchase 7,500,000\nordinary shares (the “February 2023 Investor Warrants”) at a combined purchase price of $2.00 per share and accompanying warrant, generating proceeds\nto the Company before fees and expenses of approximately $20.0 million. The February 2023 Investor Warrants have an exercise price of $2.00 per share,\nare currently exercisable and will expire on February 22, 2028. In addition, in connection with the February 2023 registered direct offering Arqit issued\nwarrants to purchase 550,000 ordinary shares (the “February 2023 Placement Agent Warrants”) to H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC or its designees. The\nFebruary 2023 Placement Agent Warrants have an exercise price of $2.50 per share, are currently exercisable and will expire on February 22, 2028.\n41\nTable of Contents\nIn September 2023, Arqit completed a registered direct offering in which it sold 20,755,677 ordinary shares, together with warrants to purchase 20,755,677\nordinary shares (the “September 2023 Investor Warrants”) at a combined purchase price of $0.78 per share and accompanying warrant, generating proceeds\nto the Company before fees and expenses of approximately $16.2 million. The September 2023 Investor Warrants have an exercise price of $0.78 per share,\nare currently exercisable and will expire on September 12, 2028. In addition, in connection with the September 2023 registered direct offering Arqit issued\nwarrants to purchase 705,128 ordinary shares (the “September 2023 Placement Agent Warrants”) to H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC or its designees. The\nSeptember 2023 Placement Agent Warrants have an exercise price of $0.975 per share, are currently exercisable and will expire on September 8, 2028. The\nSeptember 2023 registered direct offering included the sale of 7,935,164 ordinary shares, together with 7,935,164 September 2023 Investor Warrants at a\ncombined offering price of $0.78 per ordinary share and accompanying warrant to existing shareholders Heritage Assets SCSP, Ropemaker Nominees\nLimited and Carlo Calabria. Arqit director Manfredi Lefebvre d’Ovidio has sole investment and voting power over the shares held by Heritage Assets\nSCSP, and Arqit director Stephen Chandler is on the investment committee of Notion Capital Managers LLP, which is the beneficial owner of the\nCompany shares held by Ropemaker Nominees Limited, and Carlo Calabria is an Arqit director. See “Item 7.B. Related Party Transactions.”\nCash Flows Summary\nThe following table shows a summary of Arqit’s cash flows for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 and 2021.\nYear ended Year ended Year ended\nSeptember 30, September 30, September 30,\n2023 2022 2021\nNet cash generated from/(used in): $'000 $'000 $'000\nOperating activities (32,825) (26,719) (24,035)\nInvesting activities (16,082) (24,432) (9,305)\nFinancing activities 44,853 22,176 120,105\nNet (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents (4,054) (28,975) 86,765\nCash Flows Used in Operating Activities\nCash flows used in operating activities to date have primarily resulted from personnel related costs, fluctuations in trade payables and other current assets\nand liabilities. As Arqit expects to continue to increase hiring in connection with further expansion of its commercial operations, it expects its cash used in\noperating activities to increase significantly before it starts to generate material cash flows from commercialization of its products.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2023 cash used in operating activities was $32.825 million. The primary factors affecting operating cash flows during\nthe period were a net loss of $74.049 million and adjustments for non-cash items of $37.708 million.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2022 cash used in operating activities was $26.720 million. The primary factors affecting operating cash flows during\nthe period were a net profit of $53.408 million and adjustments for non-cash items of $91.796 million.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2021 cash used in operating activities was $24.035 million. The primary factors affecting operating cash flows during\nthe period were a net loss of $271.729 million, and adjustments for non-cash items of $253.769 million.\nArqit’s non-cash items primarily consist of fair value movement on warrant valuation, listing service expense, share-based charges and depreciation, while\nmovements in working capital are primarily driven by changes in trade and other payables.\nCash Flows Used in Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $16.082 million for the year ended September 30, 2023, compared with $24.432 million for the year ended\nSeptember 30, 2022 and $9.305 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. The year over year increase between 2021 and 2022 was primarily\nattributable to the costs incurred in the development of intangible fixed assets. The decrease in cash used in investing activities between 2022 and 2023 was\nas a result of lower capital expenditure on property, plant, and equipment and lower staff costs capitalized into the development of intangible fixed assets.\nCash Flows Generated from Financing Activities\nNet cash generated from financing activities was $44.853 million for the year ended September 30, 2023, compared with$ 22.176 million for the year ended\nSeptember 30, 2022 and $120.105 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. Net cash provided by financing\n42\nTable of Contents\nactivities for the year ended September 30, 2023 was primarily related to proceeds from the Company’s issuance of shares under its ATM Program and in\nregistered direct offerings in February 2023 and September 2023. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended September 30, 2022, was\nlimited to proceeds from shares issued upon the exercise of Business Combination Warrants, and net cash provided by financing activities for the year\nended September 30, 2021 was related to funds raised in connection with the Business Combination.\n5.C. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, PATENTS AND LICENSES, ETC.\nArqit’s policy regarding research and development expenses is consistent with the requirements of IAS 38. Research costs are expensed as incurred through\nthe income statement, while development costs are capitalized after technical and commercial feasibility of the asset for sale or use have been established.\nCapitalized development costs are recorded as intangible assets and amortized from the point at which the asset is ready for use.\nFor the periods ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, there were no research costs reflected in the statement of comprehensive income. This is\nprimarily due to the research phase being deemed as complete in 2018. For all periods presented, eligible costs have been treated as development costs and\ncapitalized. As described in the “Risk Factors” section and elsewhere in this Annual Reports, government regulations and policies can make developing or\nmarketing our technologies expensive or uncertain due to various restrictions. See “Item 3. Key Information—3.D. Risk Factors” and “Item 4. Information\non the Company—4.B. Business Overview—Government Regulation.” For further information on our research and development policies and additional\nproduct information, see “Item 4. Information on the Company— 4.B. Business Overview.”\n5.D. TREND INFORMATION\nOther than as described in Item 3.D. “Risk Factors” and in Item 5.A. “Operating Results—Key Factors Affecting Operating Results—Market Trends” of\nthis Annual Report, which are incorporated by reference herein, we are not aware of any trends, uncertainties, demands, commitments or events since the\nbeginning of our year ended September 30, 2023 that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our net revenues, income from operations,\nprofitability, liquidity or capital resources, or that would cause the disclosed financial information to be not necessarily indicative of future operating results\nor financial condition.\n5.E. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nArqit’s financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting\nStandards Board. While significant accounting policies are described in more detail elsewhere in this Annual Report, management believes that the\nfollowing accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements.\nWarrants valuation\nEstimating the fair value of warrants requires a determination of the most appropriate valuation model, which depends on the terms and conditions of the\nwarrant. This estimate also requires determination of the most appropriate inputs to the valuation model including equity value, exercise price, volatility,\ndividend yield, risk free rate and exercise period and making assumptions about them. For the measurement of the fair value of warrants at both the\nacquisition and the reporting date, Arqit uses a Binomial Option Pricing Model. The assumptions and models used for this estimation are disclosed in the\nnotes to Arqit’s audited consolidated financial statements.\nDeemed Acquisition Cost\nA ‘reverse acquisition’ is a transaction in which the legal acquirer - i.e. the entity that issues the securities (listed entity) becomes the acquiree for\naccounting purposes and the legal acquiree becomes the acquirer for accounting purposes.\nThe reverse acquisition is accounted for under IFRS 2 (Share-based Payments) whereby the legal acquiree Arqit Limited is deemed to have issued shares in\nexchange for the net assets and listing status of Arqit. The deemed consideration is the fair value of the shares that Arqit Limited would have had to issue to\nArqit to acquire the same percentage equity interest in the combined entity that results from the reverse acquisition.\nThe deemed acquisition cost is recognised in profit or loss and is the difference between the fair value of the deemed consideration and the fair value of the\nnet assets acquired. It represents the premium paid for obtaining the public listing. Detail on the reverse acquisition of Arqit is disclosed in the notes to\nArqit’s audited consolidated financial statements.\n43\nTable of Contents\nCapitalization of Development Costs\nArqit capitalizes costs for product development projects. Initial capitalization of costs is based on management’s judgement that technological and\neconomic feasibility is confirmed, usually when a product development project has reached a defined milestone according to an established project\nmanagement model, and all other recognition criteria within IAS 38 can be demonstrated. In determining the amounts to be capitalized, management makes\nassumptions regarding the expected future cash generation of the project, discount rates to be applied and the expected period of benefits. At September 30,\n2023, the carrying amount of capitalized development costs were $3.414 million, compared with $40.291 million at September 30, 2022 and $18.235\nmillion at September 30, 2021.\nShare-Based Compensation\nEstimating fair value for share-option payment transactions requires determination of the most appropriate valuation model, which depends on the terms and\nconditions of the grant. This estimate also requires determination of the most appropriate inputs to the valuation model including the expected life of the\nshare option or appreciation right, volatility and dividend yield and making assumptions about them. For the measurement of the fair value of equity settled\ntransactions with employees at the grant date, Arqit uses a Black Scholes valuation. The assumptions and models used for estimating fair value for share-\nbased payment transactions are disclosed in the notes to Arqit’s audited consolidated financial statements.\nCompensation expense for RSUs is determined based upon the market price of the shares underlying the awards on the date of the grant and expensed over\nthe vesting period, which is generally a one to five year service period. The compensation expense is adjusted based on actual forfeitures.\nDeferred Tax Asset\nJudgement is required to determine whether deferred tax assets are recognised in the statement of financial position. Deferred tax assets, arising from\nunutilised tax losses, require Arqit to assess the likelihood it will generate sufficient taxable earnings in future periods, in order to utilise recognised\ndeferred tax assets. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, Arqit’s ability to realise the net deferred tax\nassets recorded at the reporting date could be impacted.\nAssets held for sale\nArqit’s management uses its professional judgement based on offers and commercial appraisal. As at September 30, 2023, assets held for sale are\nrecognized at fair value less costs to sell. Judgement is required when estimating expected fair value until any sale is contractually concluded. Changes in\nthe economic environment or other facts and circumstances may cause revisions to these assumptions and could result in a material change to the realizable\nvalue of Arqit’s assets held for sale within the next financial year.\nITEM 6.

COMPENSATION\nHistorical Executive Officer and Director Compensation\nThe aggregate cash compensation paid by Arqit and its subsidiaries to its executive officers and directors for the year ended September 30, 2023 was\n$3,056,583. This amount includes $112,275, set aside or accrued to provide pension, severance, retirement or similar benefits or expenses.\nAs of September 30, 2023, 1,519,980 options to purchase ordinary shares and 1,474,953 RSUs had been granted to Arqit’s executive officers and directors.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2023, 422,463 shares were issued to Arqit’s executive officers and directors in connection with the vesting of RSUs,\nand 76,772 options granted to Arqit’s executive officers and directors vested.\nExecutive Officer and Director Compensation\nArqit’s policies with respect to the compensation of its executive officers and directors are administered by its board of directors in consultation with the\ncompensation committee. The compensation decisions regarding Arqit’s executives is based on the need to attract individuals with the skills necessary for\nthe company to achieve its business plan, to reward those individuals fairly over time, and to retain those individuals who continue to perform at or above\nthe company’s expectations.\nArqit has an executive compensation program that is competitive with other similarly-situated companies in its industry. This includes a base salary, cash\nannual bonus and long-term equity compensation awards that are, in each case, consistent with market practices and designed to incentivize, motivate and\nretain key employees. Each of Arqit’s executive officers and employees is party to an employment agreement with Arqit, all of which are in substantially\nthe same form. Under their respective agreements, each executive officer and employee is compensated with an annual base salary and most are also\neligible for an annual discretionary bonus. In addition, each executive officer and employee is subject to a perpetual confidentiality covenant, and non-\ncompetition and non-solicitation restrictive covenants during the term of employment and for a period of three to twelve months after the termination of\nemployment. Each of the agreements also includes agreement by the executive officer or employee to assign all intellectual property rights created during\nthe course of employment to Arqit. The agreements include a notice period of one week to one month if either Arqit or the executive officer\n46\nTable of Contents\nor employee wishes to terminate the agreement, other than for cause, in which case termination is effective immediately. Arqit may provide payment in lieu\nof such notice or may require the executive officer or employee to be placed on garden leave.\nArqit has a compensation plan for its directors. Arqit, working with the compensation committee, has set director compensation at a level comparable with\nthose directors with similar positions at comparable companies. Each non-executive director receives an annual cash retainer of $60,000. Each director who\nserves as the chairman of a committee receives an additional $20,000 per year and each other member of a committee receives an additional $10,000\nper year per committee. Directors have the option to elect to receive their cash compensation in the form of either cash or RSUs. In addition, directors will\nbenefit from an annual grant of 15,000 RSUs which will be awarded in accordance with Arqit’s incentive award plan.\nEquity Compensation — Incentive Award Plan\nArqit’s board of directors adopted an incentive award plan (the “Incentive Award Plan”) in order to facilitate the grant of cash and equity incentives to its\ndirectors, employees (including executive officers) and consultants and its affiliates and to enable it and certain of its affiliates to obtain and retain services\nof these individuals, which is essential to Arqit’s long-term success.\nThe purpose of the Incentive Award Plan is to enhance Arqit’s ability to attract, retain and motivate persons who make (or are expected to make) important\ncontributions by providing these individuals with equity ownership opportunities and/or equity-linked compensatory opportunities. Equity awards and\nequity- linked compensatory opportunities are intended to motivate high levels of performance and align the interests of directors, employees and\nconsultants with those of stockholders by giving directors, employees and consultants the perspective of an owner with an equity or equity-linked stake in\nthe company and providing a means of recognizing their contributions to our success. Arqit’s board of directors believes that equity awards are necessary to\nremain competitive in its industry and are essential to recruiting and retaining the highly qualified employees who help us meet our goals.\nThe aggregate number of ordinary shares available for issuance under the Incentive Award Plan, excluding awards granted, is equal to 8.4% of the sum of\nthe total number of issued and outstanding ordinary shares as of November 17, 2023, which equals an aggregate pool of 17.4 million ordinary shares. Prior\nto the completion of the Business Combination, Arqit Limited granted options over Arqit Limited ordinary shares to its employees, consultants and\nadvisors. The holders of each of these options agreed to exchange these options for equivalent options to acquire ordinary shares, 6,303,402 of which\nremain outstanding as of September 30, 2023, which were issued under amended option agreements with terms consistent with the Incentive Award Plan.\nIn addition, 2,784,610 restricted shares units (net of forfeitures) were granted during the year ended September 30, 2023, leaving 3,966,134 ordinary shares\navailable for issuance in respect of future grants of awards under the Incentive Award Plan. The compensation committee may make grants of awards under\nthe Incentive Award Plan to key employees, in forms and amounts to be determined by the compensation committee based on the recommendations of an\nindependent compensation consultant.\n6.C. BOARD PRACTICES\nBoard Composition\nDirector Independence\nThe Nasdaq corporate governance rules require that a majority of the board of directors be independent. An “independent director” is defined generally as a\nperson who has no material relationship with the listed company (either directly or as a partner, stockholder, or officer of an organization that has a\nrelationship with the listed company). Arqit has six directors, four of whom – directors Calabria, Chandler, d’Ovidio, and Ritchie – the board has\ndetermined qualify as independent directors as defined in the Nasdaq corporate governance rules.\nClasses of Directors\nThe board of directors is divided into three staggered classes of directors. At each annual meeting of its shareholders, a class of directors will be elected for\na three-year term to succeed the same class whose term is then expiring, as follows:\n· the Class I director is Stephen\nChandler;\n· the Class II directors include Nick Pointon and Carlo Calabria;\nand\n· the Class III directors include David Williams, Manfredi Lefebvre d’Ovidio and Garth\nRitchie.\n47\nTable of Contents\nRisk Oversight\nThe board of directors oversees the risk management activities designed and implemented by its management.

Arqit’s management, including its executive officers, are primarily responsible for managing the\nrisks associated with the operation and business of the company and provides appropriate updates to the board of directors and the audit committee. The\nboard of directors delegates to the audit committee oversight of its risk management process, and its other committees also consider risk as they perform\ntheir respective committee responsibilities. All committees report to the board of directors as appropriate, including when a matter rises to the level of\nmaterial or enterprise risk.\nCommittees of the Board of Directors\nArqit has established a separately standing audit committee, nominations and corporate governance committee and compensation committee.\nAudit Committee\nListing Requirements\nAs permitted by Nasdaq Listing Rules, we have elected as a “foreign private issuer\" to follow home country corporate governance practices with respect to\nour audit committee composition in lieu of the otherwise applicable Nasdaq corporate governance requirements.

These responsibilities include:\n· retaining and terminating our independent auditors, subject to ratification by the board of directors, and in the case of retention, subject to\nratification by the shareholders;\n· pre-approving audit and non-audit services to be provided by the independent auditors and related fees and\nterms;\n· overseeing the accounting and financial reporting processes of\nArqit;\n· managing audits of Arqit’s financial\nstatements;\n· preparing all reports as may be required of an audit committee under the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange\nAct;\n· reviewing with management and Arqit’s independent auditor its annual and interim financial statements prior to publication, filing, or submission\nto the SEC;\n· recommending to the board of directors the retention and termination of the internal auditor, and the internal auditor’s engagement fees and terms,\nas well as approving the yearly or periodic work plan proposed by the internal auditor;\n· reviewing with Arqit’s general counsel and/or external counsel, as deemed necessary, legal and regulatory matters that may have a material impact\non the financial statements;\n· identifying irregularities in Arqit’s business administration, inter alia, by consulting with the internal auditor or with the independent auditor, and\nsuggesting corrective measures to the board of directors;\n48\nTable of Contents\n· reviewing policies and procedures with respect to transactions (other than transactions related to compensation or terms of services) between Arqit\nand its officers and directors, affiliates of officers or directors, or transactions that are not in the ordinary course of business and deciding whether\nto approve such acts and transactions; and\n· establishing procedures for handling employee complaints relating to the management of Arqit’s business and the protection to be provided to such\nemployees.\nNominations and Corporate Governance Committee\nArqit’s nominations and corporate governance committee is comprised of Manfredi Lefebvre d’Ovidio and Carlo Calabria.

The board of directors adopted a nominations and corporate governance\ncommittee charter setting forth the responsibilities of the committee, which include:\n· overseeing and assisting the board of directors in reviewing and recommending nominees for election of\ndirectors;\n· assessing the performance of the members of the board of directors;\nand\n· establishing and maintaining effective corporate governance policies and practices, including, but not limited to, developing and recommending to\nthe board of directors a set of corporate governance guidelines applicable to Arqit’s business.\nCompensation Committee\nArqit’s compensation committee is comprised of Garth Ritchie and Carlo Calabria, all of whom are independent directors. Carlo Calabria serves as the\nchairperson of the compensation committee. The board of directors adopted a compensation committee charter setting forth the responsibilities of the\ncommittee.\nThe purpose of the compensation committee is to review and approve compensation paid to our officers and directors and to administer our incentive\ncompensation plans, including authority to make and modify awards under such plans.\nCode of Ethics\nArqit has a Code of Ethics that applies to all of its employees, officers, and directors. This includes Arqit’s principal executive officer, principal financial\nofficer, and principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions. Arqit will disclose on its website any future amendments of\nthe Code of Ethics or waivers that exempt any principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, persons\nperforming similar functions, or directors from provisions in the Code of Ethics.\nCompensation Recovery Policy\nWe have adopted a compensation recovery policy to provide for the recovery of erroneously-awarded incentive compensation, as required by the Dodd-\nFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, final SEC rules and applicable listing standards.\nLimitation on Liability and Indemnification of Officers and Directors\nCayman Islands law does not limit the extent to which a company’s memorandum and articles of association may provide for indemnification of officers\nand directors, except to the extent any such provision may be held by the Cayman Islands courts to be contrary to public policy, such as to provide\nindemnification against willful default, fraud or the consequences of committing a crime. The amended and restated memorandum and articles of\nassociation provide for indemnification of Arqit’s officers and directors to the maximum extent permitted by law, including for any liability incurred in\ntheir capacities as such, except through their own actual fraud, willful default or willful neglect. In addition, Arqit entered into indemnification agreements\nwith each of its executive officers and directors. The indemnification agreements provide the indemnitees with contractual rights to indemnification, and\nexpense advancement and reimbursement, to the fullest extent permitted under Cayman Islands law, subject to certain exceptions contained in those\nagreements. Arqit has a policy of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance that insures Arqit’s officers and directors against the cost of defense, settlement\nor payment of a judgment in some circumstances and insures Arqit against its obligations to indemnify its officers and directors.\nThese indemnification obligations may discourage shareholders from bringing a lawsuit against Arqit’s officers or directors for breach of their fiduciary\nduty. These provisions also may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against Arqit’s officers and directors, even though such an\naction, if successful, might otherwise benefit Arqit and its shareholders. Furthermore, a\n49\nTable of Contents\nshareholder’s investment may be adversely affected to the extent Arqit pays the costs of settlement and damage awards against its officers and directors\npursuant to these indemnification provisions.\nArqit believes that these provisions, the insurance and the indemnity agreements are necessary to attract and retain talented and experienced officers and\ndirectors.\n6.D.

On September 8, 2023, the lead plaintiffs filed an amended version of the\ncomplaint (the “Federal Complaint”), which alleges the same general theory as the original complaint and asserts claims under Sections 10(b), 14(a), and\n20(a) and Sections 11, 12(a)(2), and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”). On November 15, 2023, the court set a briefing schedule which\nrequires the defendants to file their motion to dismiss by January 12, 2024. The lead plaintiffs’ response to the motion to dismiss is due on March 12, 2024,\nand defendants’ reply is due on April 26, 2024.\nSimilarly, on April 18, 2023, a putative class action was filed against Arqit and certain of its directors in the Supreme Court of the State of New York\n(Index No. 153555/2023) (the “State Court Action”). The State Court Action is based on nearly identical allegations as the Federal Complaint, and asserts\nclaims under Sections 11, 12(a)(2), and 15 of the Securities Act. On October 2, 2023, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint, asserting the same causes of\naction as in the original state court complaint. On November 1, 2023, Defendants filed a motion to stay the State Court Action pending resolution of the\nfederal action. The plaintiff’s response to the motion to stay is due on December 1, 2023.\nArqit believes it has strong defenses and intends to vigorously defend against the nearly identical claims in both the Federal Complaint and the State Court\nAction. The proceedings are subject to uncertainties inherent in the litigation process. Arqit cannot predict the outcome of this matter or estimate the\npossible loss or range of possible loss, if any.\nArqit is also cooperating with an SEC investigation relating to the business combination between Arqit and Centricus Acquisition Corp., including by\nvoluntarily producing documents. The SEC has informed Arqit that this is a fact-finding inquiry.\nDividend Policy\nWe have not paid any cash dividends on our ordinary shares to date. Our board of directors will consider whether or not to institute a dividend policy. It is\npresently intended that we will retain our earnings for use in business operations and, accordingly, it is not anticipated that our board of directors will\ndeclare dividends in the foreseeable future.\n8.B.

MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION\nThe following description of the material terms of the securities of the Company includes a summary of specified provisions of the Articles. This\ndescription is qualified by reference to the Articles, which are attached as Exhibit 1.1 to this Annual Report.\nThe Company is a Cayman Islands exempted company (company number 374857) and its affairs are governed by the Articles, the Cayman Companies Act\nand the common law of the Cayman Islands. The Company is authorized to issue 469,000,001 ordinary shares, $0.0001 par value each and 30,999,999\npreference shares, $0.0001 par value each. The Company currently has only one class of issued ordinary shares, which have identical rights in all respects\nand rank equally with one another.\nNew Ordinary Shares\nHolders of ordinary shares are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters to be voted on by shareholders.\nThere is no cumulative voting with respect to the election of directors, with the result that the holders of more than 50% of the shares voted for the election\nof directors can elect all of the directors.\nHolders of ordinary shares do not have any conversion, preemptive or other subscription rights and there is no sinking fund or redemption provisions\napplicable to the ordinary shares.\nDividends\nSubject to the foregoing, the payment of cash dividends in the future, if any, will be at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend upon such\nfactors as earnings levels, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, the Company’s overall financial condition, available distributable reserves and any\nother factors deemed relevant by the board of directors.\nLiquidation\nOn a winding-up or other return of capital, subject to any special rights attaching to any other class of shares, holders of ordinary shares will be entitled to\nparticipate in any surplus assets in proportion to their shareholdings.\nDifferences in Company Law\nCayman Islands companies are governed by the Cayman Companies Act. The Cayman Companies Act is modelled on English Law but does not follow\nrecent English Law statutory enactments and differs from laws applicable to United States corporations and their shareholders. Set forth below is a\nsummary of the material differences between the provisions of the Cayman Companies Act applicable to the Company and the laws applicable to\ncompanies incorporated in the United States and their shareholders.\nMergers and Similar Arrangements\nIn certain circumstances, the Cayman Companies Act allows for mergers or consolidations between two Cayman Islands companies, or between a Cayman\nIslands exempted company and a company incorporated in another jurisdiction (provided that is facilitated by the laws of that other jurisdiction).\nWhere the merger or consolidation is between two Cayman Islands companies, the directors of each company must approve a written plan of merger or\nconsolidation containing certain prescribed information. That plan or merger or consolidation must then be authorized by either (a) a special resolution\n(usually a majority of two thirds of the voting shares voted at a general meeting) of the shareholders of\n54\nTable of Contents\neach company; and (b) such other authorization, if any, as may be specified in such constituent company’s articles of association. No shareholder resolution\nis required for a merger between a parent company (i.e., a company that owns at least 90% of the issued shares of each class in a subsidiary company) and\nits subsidiary company.\nThe consent of each holder of a fixed or floating security interest of a constituent company must be obtained, unless the court waives such requirement. If\nthe Registrar of Companies of the Cayman Islands is satisfied that the requirements of the Cayman Companies Act (which includes certain other\nformalities) have been complied with, the Registrar of Companies of the Cayman Islands will register the plan of merger or consolidation.\nWhere the merger or consolidation involves a foreign company, the procedure is similar, save that with respect to the foreign company, the directors of the\nCayman Islands exempted company are required to make a declaration to the effect that, having made due enquiry, they are of the opinion that the\nrequirements set out below have been met: (i) that the merger or consolidation is permitted or not prohibited by the constitutional documents of the foreign\ncompany and by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the foreign company is incorporated, and that those laws and any requirements of those constitutional\ndocuments have been or will be complied with; (ii) that no petition or other similar proceeding has been filed and remains outstanding or order made or\nresolution adopted to wind up or liquidate the foreign company in any jurisdictions; (iii) that no receiver, trustee, administrator or other similar person has\nbeen appointed in any jurisdiction and is acting in respect of the foreign company, its affairs or its property or any part thereof; and (iv) that no scheme,\norder, compromise or other similar arrangement has been entered into or made in any jurisdiction whereby the rights of creditors of the foreign company are\nand continue to be suspended or restricted.\nWhere the surviving company is the Cayman Islands exempted company, the directors of the Cayman Islands exempted company are further required to\nmake a declaration to the effect that, having made due enquiry, they are of the opinion that the requirements set out below have been met: (i) that the\nforeign company is able to pay its debts as they fall due and that the merger or consolidation is bona fide and not intended to defraud unsecured creditors of\nthe foreign company; (ii) that in respect of the transfer of any security interest granted by the foreign company to the surviving or consolidated company\n(a) consent or approval to the transfer has been obtained, released or waived; (b) the transfer is permitted by and has been approved in accordance with the\nconstitutional documents of the foreign company; and (c) the laws of the jurisdiction of the foreign company with respect to the transfer have been or will\nbe complied with; (iii) that the foreign company will, upon the merger or consolidation becoming effective, cease to be incorporated, registered or exist\nunder the laws of the relevant foreign jurisdiction; and (iv) that there is no other reason why it would be against the public interest to permit the merger or\nconsolidation.\nWhere the above procedures are adopted, the Cayman Companies Act provides for a right of dissenting shareholders to be paid a payment of the fair value\nof their shares upon their dissenting to the merger or consolidation if they follow a prescribed procedure. In essence, that procedure is as follows: (a) the\nshareholder must give his written objection to the merger or consolidation to the constituent company before the vote on the merger or consolidation,\nincluding a statement that the shareholder proposes to demand payment for his shares if the merger or consolidation is authorized by the vote; (b) within\n20 days following the date on which the merger or consolidation is approved by the shareholders, the constituent company must give written notice to each\nshareholder who made a written objection; (c) a shareholder must within 20 days following receipt of such notice from the constituent company, give the\nconstituent company a written notice of his intention to dissent including, among other details, a demand for payment of the fair value of his shares;\n(d) within seven days following the date of the expiration of the period set out in paragraph (b) above or seven days following the date on which the plan of\nmerger or consolidation is filed, whichever is later, the constituent company, the surviving company or the consolidated company must make a written offer\nto each dissenting shareholder to purchase his shares at a price that the company determines is the fair value and if the company and the shareholder agree\nthe price within 30 days following the date on which the offer was made, the company must pay the shareholder such amount; and (e) if the company and\nthe shareholder fail to agree a price within such 30 day period, within 20 days following the date on which such 30 day period expires, the company (and\nany dissenting shareholder) must file a petition with the Cayman Islands courts to determine the fair value and such petition must be accompanied by a list\nof the names and addresses of the dissenting shareholders with whom agreements as to the fair value of their shares have not been reached by the company.\nAt the hearing of that petition, the court has the power to determine the fair value of the shares together with a fair rate of interest, if any, to be paid by the\ncompany upon the amount determined to be the fair value. Any dissenting shareholder whose name appears on the list filed by the company may participate\nfully in all proceedings until the determination of fair value is reached. These rights of a dissenting shareholder are not available in certain circumstances,\nfor example, to dissenters holding shares of any class in respect of which an open market exists on a recognized stock exchange or recognized interdealer\nquotation system at the relevant date or where the consideration for such shares to be contributed are shares of any company listed on a national securities\nexchange or shares of the surviving or consolidated company.\n55\nTable of Contents\nMoreover, Cayman Islands law has separate statutory provisions that facilitate the reconstruction or amalgamation of companies in certain circumstances,\nschemes of arrangement will generally be more suited for complex mergers or other transactions involving widely held companies, commonly referred to in\nthe Cayman Islands as a “scheme of arrangement” which may be tantamount to a merger. In the event that a merger was sought pursuant to a scheme of\narrangement (the procedures for which are more rigorous and take longer to complete than the procedures typically required to consummate a merger in the\nUnited States), the arrangement in question must be approved by a majority in number of each class of shareholders and creditors with whom the\narrangement is to be made and who must in addition represent three-fourths in value of each such class of shareholders or creditors, as the case may be, that\nare present and voting either in person or by proxy at an annual general meeting, or extraordinary general meeting summoned for that purpose. The\nconvening of the meetings and subsequently the terms of the arrangement must be sanctioned by the Cayman Islands courts. While a dissenting shareholder\nwould have the right to express to the court the view that the transaction should not be approved, the court can be expected to approve the arrangement if it\nsatisfies itself that:\n· we are not proposing to act illegally or beyond the scope of our corporate authority and the statutory provisions as to majority vote have been\ncomplied with;\n· the shareholders have been fairly represented at the meeting in\nquestion;\n· the arrangement is such as a businessman would reasonably approve;\nand\n· the arrangement is not one that would more properly be sanctioned under some other provision of the Cayman Companies Act or that would\namount to a “fraud on the minority.”\nIf a scheme of arrangement or takeover offer (as described below) is approved, any dissenting shareholder would have no rights comparable to appraisal\nrights (providing rights to receive payment in cash for the judicially determined value of the shares), which would otherwise ordinarily be available to\ndissenting shareholders of United States corporations.\nSqueeze-out Provisions\nWhen a takeover offer is made and accepted by holders of 90% of the shares to whom the offer relates within four months, the offeror may, within a two-\nmonth period, require the holders of the remaining shares to transfer such shares on the terms of the offer. An objection can be made to the Cayman Islands\ncourts, but this is unlikely to succeed unless there is evidence of fraud, bad faith, collusion or inequitable treatment of the shareholders.\nFurther, transactions similar to a merger, reconstruction and/or an amalgamation may in some circumstances be achieved through means other than these\nstatutory provisions, such as a share capital exchange, asset acquisition or control, or through contractual arrangements of an operating business.\nShareholders’ Suits\nMaples and Calder (Cayman) LLP, our Cayman Islands legal counsel, is not aware of any reported class action having been brought in a Cayman Islands\ncourt. Derivative actions have been brought in the Cayman Islands courts, and the Cayman Islands courts have confirmed the availability for such actions.\nIn most cases, we will be the proper plaintiff in any claim based on a breach of duty owed to us, and a claim against (for example) our officers or directors\nusually may not be brought by a shareholder. However, based both on Cayman Islands authorities and on English authorities, which would in all likelihood\nbe of persuasive authority and be applied by a court in the Cayman Islands, exceptions to the foregoing principle apply in circumstances in which:\n· a company is acting, or proposing to act, illegally or beyond the scope of its\nauthority;\n· the act complained of, although not beyond the scope of the authority, could be effected if duly authorized by more than the number of votes\nwhich have actually been obtained; or\n· those who control the company are perpetrating a “fraud on the\nminority.”\nA shareholder may have a direct right of action against us where the individual rights of that shareholder have been infringed or are about to be infringed.\nEnforcement of Civil Liabilities\nThe Cayman Islands has a different body of securities laws as compared to the United States and provides less protection to investors. Additionally,\nCayman Islands companies may not have standing to sue before the Federal courts of the United States.\n56\nTable of Contents\nWe have been advised by Maples and Calder (Cayman) LLP, our Cayman Islands legal counsel, that the courts of the Cayman Islands are unlikely (i) to\nrecognize or enforce against us judgments of courts of the United States predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the\nUnited States or any state; and (ii) in original actions brought in the Cayman Islands, to impose liabilities against us predicated upon the civil liability\nprovisions of the federal securities laws of the United States or any state, so far as the liabilities imposed by those provisions are penal in nature. In those\ncircumstances, although there is no statutory enforcement in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in the United States, the courts of the Cayman\nIslands will recognize and enforce a foreign money judgment of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction without retrial on the merits based on the principle\nthat a judgment of a competent foreign court imposes upon the judgment debtor an obligation to pay the sum for which judgment has been given provided\ncertain conditions are met. For a foreign judgment to be enforced in the Cayman Islands, such judgment must be final and conclusive and for a liquidated\nsum, and must not be in respect of taxes or a fine or penalty, inconsistent with a Cayman Islands judgment in respect of the same matter, impeachable on\nthe grounds of fraud or obtained in a manner, or be of a kind the enforcement of which is, contrary to natural justice or the public policy of the Cayman\nIslands (awards of punitive or multiple damages may well be held to be contrary to public policy). A Cayman Islands court may stay enforcement\nproceedings if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere.\nSpecial Considerations for Exempted Companies\nWe are an exempted company with limited liability under the Cayman Companies Act. The Cayman Companies Act distinguishes between ordinary\nresident companies and exempted companies. Any company that is registered in the Cayman Islands but conducts business mainly outside of the Cayman\nIslands may apply to be registered as an exempted company. The requirements for an exempted company are essentially the same as for an ordinary\ncompany except for the exemptions and privileges listed below:\n· an exempted company does not have to file an annual return of its shareholders with the Registrar of Companies of the Cayman\nIslands;\n· an exempted company’s register of members is not open to\ninspection;\n· an exempted company does not have to hold an annual general\nmeeting;\n· an exempted company may issue shares with no par\nvalue;\n· an exempted company may obtain an undertaking against the imposition of any future taxation (such undertakings are usually given for 200 years\nin the first instance);\n· an exempted company may register by way of continuation in another jurisdiction and be deregistered in the Cayman\nIslands;\n· an exempted company may register as a limited duration company;\nand\n· an exempted company may register as a segregated portfolio\ncompany.\n“Limited liability” means that the liability of each shareholder is limited to the amount unpaid by the shareholder on the shares of the company (except in\nexceptional circumstances, such as involving fraud, the establishment of an agency relationship or an illegal or improper purpose or other circumstances in\nwhich a court may be prepared to pierce or lift the corporate veil).\nIndemnification of Directors and Executive Officers and Limitation of Liability\nCayman Islands law does not limit the extent to which a company’s articles of association may provide for indemnification of officers and directors, except\nto the extent any such provision may be held by the Cayman Islands courts to be contrary to public policy, such as to provide indemnification against\nwillful default, willful neglect, civil fraud or the consequences of committing a crime. The Articles permit indemnification of officers and directors for any\nliability, action, proceeding, claim, demand, costs damages or expenses, including legal expenses, incurred in their capacities as such unless such liability\n(if any) arises from actual fraud, willful neglect or willful default which may attach to such directors or officers. This standard of conduct is generally the\nsame as permitted under the Delaware General Corporation Law for a Delaware corporation. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements\nwith our directors and senior executive officers that provide such persons with additional indemnification beyond that provided in the Articles.\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers or persons controlling us under the\nforegoing provisions, we have been informed that, in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities\nAct and is therefore unenforceable.\n57\nTable of Contents\nAnti-Takeover Provisions in the Articles\nSome provisions of the Articles may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or management that shareholders may consider\nfavorable, including a provision that authorizes our board of directors to issue preference shares in one or more series and to designate the price, rights,\npreferences, privileges and restrictions of such preference shares without any further vote or action by our shareholders.\nSuch shares could be issued quickly with terms calculated to delay or prevent a change in control of our company or make removal of management more\ndifficult. If our board of directors decides to issue these preference shares, the price of our ordinary shares may fall and the voting and other rights of the\nholders of our ordinary shares may be materially adversely affected.\nHowever, under Cayman Islands law, our directors may only exercise the rights and powers granted to them under the Articles for a proper purpose and for\nwhat they believe in good faith to be in the best interests of our company.\nDirectors’ Fiduciary Duties\nUnder Delaware corporate law, a director of a Delaware corporation has a fiduciary duty to the corporation and its shareholders. This duty has two\ncomponents: the duty of care and the duty of loyalty. The duty of care requires that a director act in good faith, with the care that an ordinarily prudent\nperson would exercise under similar circumstances. Under this duty, a director must inform himself or herself of, and disclose to shareholders, all material\ninformation reasonably available regarding a significant transaction.\nThe duty of loyalty requires that a director act in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation. A director must not\nuse his or her corporate position for personal gain or advantage. This duty prohibits self-dealing by a director and mandates that the best interest of the\ncorporation and its shareholders take precedence over any interest possessed by a director, officer or controlling shareholder and not shared by the\nshareholders generally. In general, actions of a director are presumed to have been made on an informed basis, in good faith and in the honest belief that the\naction taken was in the best interests of the corporation. However, this presumption may be rebutted by evidence of a breach of one of the fiduciary duties.\nShould such evidence be presented concerning a transaction by a director, a director must prove the procedural fairness of the transaction, and that the\ntransaction was of fair value to the corporation.\nUnder Cayman Islands law, directors and officers owe the following fiduciary duties:\n· duty to act in good faith in what the director or officer believes to be in the best interests of the company as a\nwhole;\n· duty to exercise powers for the purposes for which those powers were conferred and not for a collateral\npurpose;\n· directors should not improperly fetter the exercise of future\ndiscretion;\n· duty to exercise powers fairly as between different sections of\nshareholders;\n· duty not to put themselves in a position in which there is a conflict between their duty to the company and their personal interests;\nand\n· duty to exercise independent\njudgment.\nIn addition to the above, directors also owe a duty of care which is not fiduciary in nature. This duty has been defined as a requirement to act as a\nreasonably diligent person having both the general knowledge, skill and experience that may reasonably be expected of a person carrying out the same\nfunctions as are carried out by that director in relation to the company and the general knowledge skill and experience of that director.\nAs set out above, directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position of conflict and this includes a duty not to engage in self-dealing, or to otherwise\nbenefit as a result of their position. However, in some instances what would otherwise be a breach of this duty can be forgiven and/or authorized in advance\nby the shareholders provided that there is full disclosure by the directors. This can be done by way of permission granted in the amended and restated\nmemorandum and articles of association or alternatively by shareholder approval at general meetings.\n58\nTable of Contents\nShareholder Action by Written Consent\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, a corporation may eliminate the right of shareholders to act by written consent by amendment to its\ncertificate of incorporation. The Articles provide that shareholders may approve corporate matters by way of a unanimous written resolution signed by or on\nbehalf of each shareholder who would have been entitled to vote on such matter at a general meeting without a meeting being held.\nShareholder Proposals\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, a shareholder has the right to put any proposal before the annual meeting of shareholders, provided it\ncomplies with the notice provisions in the governing documents. A special meeting may be called by the board of directors or any other person authorized\nto do so in the governing documents, but shareholders may be precluded from calling special meetings.\nThe Cayman Companies Act provides shareholders with only limited rights to requisition a general meeting and does not provide shareholders with any\nright to put any proposal before a general meeting. However, these rights may be provided in a company’s articles of association. The Articles do not permit\nour shareholders to requisition either an annual general meeting or an extraordinary general meeting, or to put forth a proposal at a general meeting. As a\nCayman Islands exempted company, we are not obliged by law to call annual general meetings.\nCumulative Voting\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, cumulative voting for elections of directors is not permitted unless the corporation’s certificate of\nincorporation specifically provides for it. Cumulative voting potentially facilitates the representation of minority shareholders on a board of directors since\nit permits the minority shareholder to cast all the votes to which the shareholder is entitled on a single director, which increases the shareholder’s voting\npower with respect to electing such director. As permitted under Cayman Islands law, the Articles do not provide for cumulative voting. As a result, our\nshareholders are not afforded any less protections or rights on this issue than shareholders of a Delaware corporation.\nRemoval of Directors\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, a director of a corporation with a classified board may be removed only for cause with the approval of a\nmajority of the issued and outstanding shares entitled to vote, unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. Under the Articles, directors may\nbe removed only for cause by a special resolution (usually a majority of two thirds of the voting shares voted at a general meeting) of our shareholders. A\ndirector will also cease to be a director if he or she (i) becomes bankrupt or makes any arrangement or composition with his creditors; (ii) dies or is found to\nbe or becomes of unsound mind; (iii) resigns his office by notice in writing; (iv) the director absents himself or herself (for the avoidance of doubt, without\nbeing represented by proxy) from three consecutive meetings of the board of directors without special leave of absence from the directors, and the directors\npass a resolution that he or she has by reason of such absence vacated office; or (v) all of the other directors (being not less than two in number) determine\nthat he or she should be removed as a director for “Cause” (i.e., a conviction for a criminal offence involving dishonesty or engaging in conduct which\nbrings a director or the Company into disrepute or which results in a material financial detriment to the Company) (and not otherwise), either by a resolution\npassed by all of the other directors at a meeting of the directors duly convened and held in accordance with the Articles or by a resolution in writing signed\nby all of the other directors.\nTransactions with Interested Shareholders\nThe Delaware General Corporation Law contains a business combination statute applicable to Delaware corporations whereby, unless the corporation has\nspecifically elected not to be governed by such statute under its certificate of incorporation, it is prohibited from engaging in certain business combinations\nwith an “interested shareholder” for three years following the date that such person becomes an interested shareholder. An interested shareholder generally\nis a person or a group who or which owns or owned 15% or more of the target’s outstanding voting stock within the past three years. This has the effect of\nlimiting the ability of a potential acquirer to make a two-tiered bid for the target in which all shareholders would not be treated equally. The statute does not\napply if, among other things, prior to the date on which such shareholder becomes an interested shareholder, the board of directors approves the transaction\nwhich resulted in the person becoming an interested shareholder. This encourages any potential acquirer of a Delaware corporation to negotiate the terms of\nany acquisition transaction with the target’s board of directors.\nCayman Islands law has no comparable statute. As a result, we cannot avail ourselves of the types of protections afforded by the Delaware business\ncombination statute. However, although Cayman Islands law does not regulate transactions between a company and its significant shareholders, it does\nprovide that such transactions must be entered into bona fide in the best interests of the company and for a proper corporate purpose and not with the effect\nof constituting a fraud on the minority shareholders.\n59\nTable of Contents\nDissolution; Winding Up\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, unless the board of directors approves the proposal to dissolve, dissolution must be approved by\nshareholders holding 100% of the total voting power of the corporation. Only if the dissolution is initiated by the board of directors may it be approved by a\nsimple majority of the corporation’s outstanding shares. Delaware law allows a Delaware corporation to include in its certificate of incorporation a\nsupermajority voting requirement in connection with dissolutions initiated by the board.\nUnder Cayman Islands law, a company may be wound up by either an order of the courts of the Cayman Islands or by a special resolution of its members\nor, if the company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due, by an ordinary resolution of its members. The court has authority to order winding up in a\nnumber of specified circumstances including where it is, in the opinion of the court, just and equitable to do so.\nUnder the Articles, if the Company is wound up, the liquidator of our company may distribute the assets with the sanction of an ordinary resolution of the\nshareholders and any other sanction required by law.\nVariation of Rights of Shares\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, a corporation may vary the rights of a class of shares with the approval of a majority of the outstanding\nshares of such class, unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise.\nUnder the Articles, if our share capital is divided into more than one class of shares, the rights attached to any such class may, whether or not the Company\nis being wound up, be varied without the consent of the holders of the issued shares of that class where such variation is considered by the directors not to\nhave a material adverse effect upon such rights; otherwise, any such variation shall be made only with the consent in writing of the holders of not less than\ntwo thirds of the issued shares of that class or with the approval of a resolution passed by a majority of not less than two thirds of the votes cast at a separate\nmeeting of the holders of the shares of that class.\nAmendment of Governing Documents\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, a corporation’s governing documents may be amended with the approval of a majority of the outstanding\nshares entitled to vote on the matter, unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. As permitted by Cayman Islands law, the Articles may only\nbe amended by a special resolution of the shareholders.\nRights of Non-Resident or Foreign Shareholders\nThere are no limitations imposed by the Articles on the rights of non-resident or foreign shareholders to hold or exercise voting rights on our shares. In\naddition, there are no provisions in the Articles governing the ownership threshold above which shareholder ownership must be disclosed.\nDirectors’ Power to Issue Shares\nSubject to applicable law, our board of directors is empowered to issue or allot shares or grant options and warrants with or without preferred, deferred, or\nother rights or restrictions.\nInspection of Books\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, any shareholder of a corporation may for any proper purpose inspect or make copies of the corporation’s\nstock ledger, list of shareholders and other books and records.\nHolders of our shares have no general right under Cayman Islands law to inspect or obtain copies of our register of members or our corporate records.\n60\nTable of Contents\nDirectors\nAppointment and Removal\nThe Directors are divided into three classes designated as Class I, Class II and Class III, respectively. Directors were assigned to each class in accordance\nwith a resolution or resolutions adopted by the board of Directors. At the 2024 annual general meeting of the Company, the term of office of the Class III\nDirectors shall expire and Class III Directors shall be elected for a full term of three years. At the 2025 annual general meeting of the Company, the term of\noffice of the Class I Directors shall expire and Class I Directors shall be elected for a full term of three years. At the 2026 annual general meeting of the\nCompany, the term of office of the Class II Directors shall be elected for a full term of three years. At each succeeding annual general meeting of the\nCompany, Directors shall be elected for a full term of three years to succeed the Directors of the class whose terms expire at such annual general meeting.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article, each Director shall hold office until the expiration of his term, until his successor shall have been\nduly elected and qualified or until his or her earlier death, resignation or removal.\nThere is no cumulative voting with respect to the appointment of directors.\nAn ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general\nmeeting of the company, is required to elect a director.\nThe office of a Director shall be vacated if all of the other Directors (being not less than two in number) determine that he or she should be removed as a\nDirector for Cause (and not otherwise) (as such term is defined in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association), either by a resolution\npassed by all of the other Directors at a meeting of the Directors duly convened and held in accordance with the Articles or by a resolution in writing signed\nby all of the other Directors.\nEnforceability of Civil Liability under Cayman Islands Law\nThe Company has been advised by Maples and Calder (Cayman) LLP, its Cayman Islands legal counsel, that the courts of the Cayman Islands are unlikely\n(i) to recognize, or enforce against the Company, judgments of courts of the United States predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws\nof the United States or any State; and (ii) in original actions brought in the Cayman Islands, to impose liabilities against the Company predicated upon the\ncivil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any State, so far as the liabilities imposed by those provisions are penal in nature. In\nthose circumstances, although there is no statutory enforcement in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in the United States, the courts of the Cayman\nIslands will recognize and enforce a foreign money judgment of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction without retrial on the merits based on the principle\nthat a judgment of a competent foreign court imposes upon the judgment debtor an obligation to pay the sum for which judgment has been given provided\ncertain conditions are met. For a foreign judgment to be enforced in the Cayman Islands, such judgment must be final and conclusive and for a liquidated\nsum, and must not be in respect of taxes or a fine or penalty, inconsistent with a Cayman Islands judgment in respect of the same matter, impeachable on\nthe grounds of fraud or obtained in a manner, or be of a kind the enforcement of which is, contrary to natural justice or the public policy of the Cayman\nIslands (awards of punitive or multiple damages may well be held to be contrary to public policy). A Cayman Islands court may stay enforcement\nproceedings if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere. There is recent Privy Council authority (which is binding on the Cayman Islands court)\nin the context of a reorganization plan approved by the New York Bankruptcy Court which suggests that due to the universal nature of\nbankruptcy/insolvency proceedings, foreign money judgments obtained in foreign bankruptcy/insolvency proceedings may be enforced without applying\nthe principles outlined above. However, a more recent English Supreme Court authority (which is highly persuasive but not binding on the Cayman Islands\ncourt), has expressly rejected that approach in the context of a default judgment obtained in an adversary proceeding brought in the New York Bankruptcy\nCourt by the receivers of the bankruptcy debtor against a third party, and which would not have been enforceable upon the application of the traditional\ncommon law principles summarized above and held that foreign money judgments obtained in bankruptcy/insolvency proceedings should be enforced by\napplying the principles set out above, and not by the simple exercise of the Courts’ discretion. Those cases have now been considered by the Cayman\nIslands court. The Cayman Islands court was not asked to consider the specific question of whether a judgment of a bankruptcy court in an adversary\nproceeding would be enforceable in the Cayman Islands, but it did endorse the need for active assistance of overseas bankruptcy proceedings. We\nunderstand that the Cayman Islands court’s decision in that case has been appealed and it remains the case that the law regarding the enforcement of\nbankruptcy/ insolvency related judgments is still in a state of uncertainty.\n61\nTable of Contents\nAnti-Money Laundering — Cayman Islands\nIf any person in the Cayman Islands knows or suspects or has reasonable grounds for knowing or suspecting that another person is engaged in criminal\nconduct or money laundering or is involved with terrorism or terrorist financing and property and the information for that knowledge or suspicion came to\ntheir attention in the course of business in the regulated sector, or other trade, profession, business or employment, the person will be required to report such\nknowledge or suspicion to (i) the Financial Reporting Authority of the Cayman Islands, pursuant to the Proceeds of Crime Act (As Revised) of the Cayman\nIslands if the disclosure relates to criminal conduct or money laundering, or (ii) a police officer of the rank of constable or higher, or the Financial\nReporting Authority, pursuant to the Terrorism Act (As Revised) of the Cayman Islands, if the disclosure relates to involvement with terrorism or terrorist\nfinancing and property.

TAXATION\nCertain Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations\nGeneral\nThe following discussion summarizes certain United States federal income tax considerations generally applicable to the ownership and disposition of the\nCompany’s ordinary shares and Business Combination Warrants (collectively referred to herein as the “Company Securities”) by U.S. Holders (as defined\nbelow). This discussion is limited to certain United States federal income tax considerations to beneficial owners of the Company Securities that hold such\nCompany Securities as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”)\n(generally, property held for investment). This discussion assumes that any distributions made (or deemed made) by the Company on the Company\nSecurities and any consideration received (or deemed received) by a holder in consideration for the sale or other disposition of the Company Securities will\nbe in U.S. dollars. This discussion does not address the U.S. federal income tax consequences to holders of any warrants other than the Business\nCombination Warrants.\nThis discussion is a summary only and does not describe all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to the ownership and disposition of the Company\nSecurities by an investor in light of its particular circumstances, including but not limited to, the alternative minimum tax, the Medicare tax on net\ninvestment income and the different consequences that may apply to investors that are subject to special rules under U.S. federal income tax laws, including\nbut not limited to:\n· banks, financial institutions or financial services\nentities;\n· broker-\ndealers;\n· taxpayers that are subject to the mark-to-market tax accounting\nrules;\n64\nTable of Contents\n· tax-exempt\nentities;\n· governments or agencies or instrumentalities\nthereof;\n· insurance\ncompanies;\n· regulated investment\ncompanies;\n· real estate investment\ntrusts;\n· expatriates or former long-term residents of the United\nStates;\n· persons that actually or constructively own five percent or more (by vote or value) of the Company’s\nshares;\n· persons that acquired the Company Securities pursuant to an exercise of employee share options, in connection with employee share incentive\nplans or otherwise as compensation;\n· persons that hold the Company Securities as part of a straddle, constructive sale, hedge, wash sale, conversion or other integrated or similar\ntransaction;\n· U.S. Holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S.\ndollar;\n· controlled foreign\ncorporations;\n· passive foreign investment companies;\nand\n· partnerships (or entities or arrangements classified as partnerships or other pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes) and any\nbeneficial owners of such partnerships or other pass-through entities.\nIf a partnership (or other entity or arrangement classified as a partnership or other pass-through entity for United States federal income tax purposes) is the\nbeneficial owner of the Company Securities, the United States federal income tax treatment of a partner, member or other beneficial owner in such\npartnership or other pass-through entity generally will depend on the status of the partner, member or other beneficial owner and the activities of the\npartnership or other pass-through entity. Partnerships and other pass-through entities holding the Company Securities, as well as partners, members or other\nbeneficial owners of such partnerships or other pass-through entities, are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences to them of\nthe ownership and disposition of the Company Securities.\nMoreover, the discussion below is based upon the provisions of the Code, the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder and administrative and judicial\ninterpretations thereof, all as of the date hereof, and such provisions may be repealed, revoked, modified or subject to differing interpretations, possibly on\na retroactive basis, which may result in United States federal income tax consequences different from those discussed below. Furthermore, this discussion\ndoes not address any aspect of United States federal non-income tax laws, such as gift or estate tax laws, or state, local or non-United States tax laws.\nThe Company has not sought, and does not expect to seek, a ruling from the United States Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) as to any United States federal\nincome tax consequence described herein. The IRS may disagree with the discussion herein, and its determination may be upheld by a court. Moreover,\nthere can be no assurance that future legislation, regulations, administrative rulings or court decisions will not adversely affect the accuracy of the\nstatements in this discussion.\nTHIS DISCUSSION IS ONLY A SUMMARY OF CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH\nTHE OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANY’S ORDINARY SHARES AND BUSINESS COMBINATION WARRANTS. EACH\nINVESTOR IN THE ORDINARY SHARES OR WARRANTS IS URGED TO CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO THE\nPARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES TO SUCH INVESTOR OF THE OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF THE ORDINARY SHARES OR\nWARRANTS, INCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF ANY UNITED STATES FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL, AND NON-\nUNITED STATES TAX LAWS.\nFor purposes of this summary, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of ordinary shares or Business Combination Warrants who or that is, for United States\nfederal income tax purposes:\n· an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United\nStates;\n65\nTable of Contents\n· a corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation) organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of\nColumbia;\n· an estate whose income is subject to United States federal income tax regardless of its source;\nor\n· a trust, if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more United\nStates persons (as defined in the Code) have authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) it has a valid election in effect under\nTreasury regulations to be treated as a United States person (as defined in the Code).\nTaxation of Distributions\nSubject to the passive foreign investment company (“PFIC”) rules discussed below, a U.S. Holder generally will be required to include in gross income as\ndividends in the year actually or constructively received by the U.S. Holder the amount of any distribution of cash or other property (other than certain\ndistributions of the Company’s shares or rights to acquire the Company’s shares) paid on the Company’s ordinary shares to the extent the distribution is\npaid out of the Company’s current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined under United States federal income tax principles). Distributions in\nexcess of such earnings and profits generally will be applied against and reduce the U.S. Holder’s basis in its ordinary shares (but not below zero) and, to\nthe extent in excess of such basis, will be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of such ordinary shares (the treatment of which is described under “—\nGain or Loss on Sale or Other Taxable Disposition of Ordinary Shares and Business Combination Warrants” below).\nDividends paid by the Company will be taxable to a corporate U.S. Holder at regular rates and will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction\ngenerally allowed to domestic corporations in respect of dividends received from other domestic corporations. With respect to non-corporate U.S. Holders,\ndividends generally will be taxed as “qualified dividend income” at the lower applicable long-term capital gains rate (see “— Gain or Loss on Sale or\nOther Taxable Disposition of Ordinary Shares and Business Combination Warrants” below) only if the ordinary shares are readily tradable on an\nestablished securities market in the United States, certain holding period and at-risk requirements are met, the Company is not a PFIC in the taxable year in\nwhich the dividend was paid or in the previous year, and certain other requirements are met. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the\navailability of such lower rate for any dividends paid with respect to the ordinary shares.\nGain or Loss on Sale or Other Taxable Disposition of Ordinary Shares and Business Combination Warrants\nSubject to the PFIC rules discussed below, a U.S. Holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss on the sale or other taxable disposition of the ordinary\nshares or Business Combination Warrants (including a redemption of Business Combination Warrants that is treated as a taxable disposition). Any such\ncapital gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder’s holding period for such ordinary shares or Business Combination\nWarrants exceeds one year. Long-term capital gain realized by a non-corporate U.S. Holder may be taxed at reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of\ncapital losses is subject to certain limitations.\nThe amount of gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder on a sale or other taxable disposition of the ordinary shares or Business Combination Warrants\ngenerally will be equal to the difference between (i) the sum of the amount of cash and the fair market value of any property received in such disposition of\nthe ordinary shares or Business Combination Warrants and (ii) the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in its ordinary shares or Business Combination Warrants\nso disposed of. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in its ordinary shares or Business Combination Warrants generally will equal the U.S. Holder’s\nacquisition cost reduced, in the case of an ordinary share, by any prior distributions treated as a return of capital. See “Exercise, Lapse or Redemption of a\nBusiness Combination Warrant” below for a discussion regarding a U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the ordinary share acquired pursuant to the exercise of a\nBusiness Combination Warrant.\nExercise, Lapse or Redemption of a Business Combination Warrant\nA U.S. Holder generally will not recognize gain or loss upon the acquisition of an ordinary share on the exercise of a Business Combination Warrant for\ncash. A U.S. Holder’s tax basis in an ordinary share received upon exercise of the Business Combination Warrant generally will equal the sum of the U.S.\nHolder’s initial investment in the Business Combination Warrant and the exercise price of such Business Combination Warrant. It is unclear whether a U.S.\nHolder’s holding period for the ordinary share received will commence on the date of exercise of the Business Combination Warrant or the day following\nthe date of exercise of the Business Combination Warrant; in either case, the holding period will not include the period during which the U.S. Holder held\nthe Business Combination Warrant. If a Business Combination Warrant is allowed to lapse unexercised, a U.S. Holder generally will recognize a capital\nloss equal to such holder’s tax basis in the Business Combination Warrant.\n66\nTable of Contents\nThe tax consequences of a cashless exercise of a Business Combination Warrant are not clear under current law. Subject to the PFIC rules discussed below,\na cashless exercise may not be taxable, either because the exercise is not a realization event or because the exercise is treated as a recapitalization for\nUnited States federal income tax purposes. In either situation, a U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the ordinary shares received generally should equal the U.S.\nHolder’s tax basis in the Business Combination Warrants exercised therefor. If the cashless exercise was not a realization event, it is unclear whether a U.S.\nHolder’s holding period for the ordinary shares received would be treated as commencing on the date of exercise of the Business Combination Warrants or\nthe day following the date of exercise of the Business Combination Warrants; in either case, the holding period will not include the period during which the\nU.S. Holder held the Business Combination Warrants. If the cashless exercise were treated as a recapitalization, the holding period of the ordinary shares\nreceived would include the holding period of the Business Combination Warrants.\nIt is also possible that a cashless exercise could be treated in part as a taxable exchange in which gain or loss would be recognized. In such event, a U.S.\nHolder could be deemed to have surrendered a number of Business Combination Warrants representing to a number of ordinary shares with an aggregate\nfair market value equal to the aggregate exercise price for the total number of Business Combination Warrants to be exercised. In such case, subject to the\nPFIC rules discussed below, the U.S. Holder would recognize capital gain or loss with respect to the Business Combination Warrants deemed surrendered\nin an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of ordinary shares that would have been received in a regular exercise of the Business\nCombination Warrants deemed surrendered and the U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the Business Combination Warrants deemed surrendered. In this case, a U.S.\nHolder’s aggregate tax basis in the ordinary shares received would equal the sum of the U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the Business Combination Warrants\ndeemed exercised and the aggregate exercise price of such Business Combination Warrants. It is unclear whether a U.S. Holder’s holding period for the\nordinary shares would commence on the date of exercise of the Business Combination Warrants or the day following the date of exercise of the Business\nCombination Warrants; in either case, the holding period will not include the period during which the U.S. Holder held the Business Combination Warrants.\nDue to the absence of authority on the United States federal income tax treatment of a cashless exercise, including when a U.S. Holder’s holding period\nwould commence with respect to the ordinary shares received, there can be no assurance regarding which, if any, of the alternative tax consequences and\nholding periods described above would be adopted by the IRS or a court of law. Accordingly, U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the\ntax consequences of a cashless exercise.\nSubject to the PFIC rules described below, if the Company redeems Business Combination Warrants for cash pursuant to the redemption provisions\ndescribed in Exhibit 2.9 “Description of Securities” to this Annual Report under the heading “— Warrants — Public Shareholders’ Warrants” or if the\nCompany purchases Business Combination Warrants in an open market transaction, such redemption or purchase generally will be treated as a taxable\ndisposition to the U.S. Holder, taxed as described above under “— Gain or Loss on Sale or Other Taxable Disposition of Ordinary Shares and Business\nCombination Warrants.”\nPossible Constructive Distributions\nThe terms of each Business Combination Warrant provide for an adjustment to the number of ordinary shares for which the Business Combination Warrant\nmay be exercised or to the exercise price of the Business Combination Warrant in certain events, as discussed in Exhibit 2.9 “Description of Securities” to\nthis Annual Report under the heading “— Warrants — Public Shareholders’ Warrants.” An adjustment which has the effect of preventing dilution generally\nis not taxable. The U.S. Holders of the Business Combination Warrants would, however, be treated as receiving a constructive distribution from the\nCompany if, for example, the adjustment increases such U.S. Holders’ proportionate interest in the Company’s assets or earnings and profits (e.g., through\nan increase in the number of ordinary shares that would be obtained upon exercise or through a decrease in the exercise price of the Business Combination\nWarrants), which adjustment may be made as a result of a distribution of cash or other property to the holders of the ordinary shares. Such constructive\ndistribution to a U.S. Holder of Business Combination Warrants would be treated as if such U.S. Holder had received a cash distribution from the Company\ngenerally equal to the fair market value of such increased interest (taxed as described above under “— Taxation of Distributions”).\n67\nTable of Contents\nPassive Foreign Investment Company Rules\nA foreign (i.e., non-U.S.) corporation will be classified as a PFIC for United States federal income tax purposes if either (i) at least 75% of its gross income\nin a taxable year, including its pro rata share of the gross income of any corporation in which it is considered to own at least 25% of the shares by value, is\npassive income or (ii) at least 50% of its assets in a taxable year (ordinarily determined based on fair market value and averaged quarterly over the year),\nincluding its pro rata share of the assets of any corporation in which it is considered to own at least 25% of the shares by value, are held for the production\nof, or produce, passive income. Passive income generally includes, among other things, dividends, interest, rents and royalties (other than rents or royalties\nderived from the active conduct of a trade or business) and gains from the disposition of assets giving rise to passive income. For purposes of the PFIC asset\ntest, cash and other assets readily convertible into cash are considered passive assets, and the aggregate fair market value of the assets of a publicly traded\nnon-U.S. corporation generally is treated as being equal to the sum of the aggregate value of the outstanding stock and the total amount of the liabilities of\nsuch corporation (the “Market Capitalization”) and the excess of the fair market value of such corporation’s assets as so determined over the book value of\nsuch assets is generally treated as goodwill that is a non-passive asset to the extent attributable to such corporation’s non-passive income.\nAs of the date hereof, the Company has not made a determination as to its PFIC status for its most recent taxable year or its current taxable year, and it may\nbe possible that the Company is a PFIC for either such years. The Company’s possible status as a PFIC is determined on an annual basis based on the\ncomposition of its assets, income, activities and Market Capitalization in the relevant taxable year and therefore may be subject to change. For example,\nbecause cash is generally considered to be an asset held for the production of passive income and the value of the Company’s assets for purposes of the\nasset test will generally be determined based on the market price of the Company’s ordinary shares, the Company’s PFIC status will depend in large part on\nthe market price of the Company’s ordinary shares (which may fluctuate significantly) and how quickly the Company spends the cash proceeds received in\nconnection with the Business Combination. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Company is not a PFIC for any taxable year. In addition, the\nCompany’s U.S. counsel expresses no opinion with respect to the Company’s PFIC status for any taxable year.\nIt is not entirely clear how various aspects of the PFIC rules apply to the Business Combination Warrants. Section 1298(a)(4) of the Code provides that, to\nthe extent provided in Treasury regulations, any person who has an option to acquire stock in a PFIC shall be considered to own such stock in the PFIC for\npurposes of the PFIC rules. No final Treasury regulations are currently in effect under Section 1298(a)(4) of the Code. However, proposed Treasury\nregulations under Section 1298(a)(4) of the Code have been promulgated with a retroactive effective date (the “Proposed PFIC Option Regulations”). Each\nU.S. Holder is urged to consult its tax advisors regarding the possible application of the Proposed PFIC Option Regulations to an investment in the Business\nCombination Warrants. Solely for discussion purposes, the following discussion assumes that the Proposed PFIC Option Regulations will apply to the\nBusiness Combination Warrants.\nAlthough the Company’s PFIC status is determined annually, an initial determination that the Company is a PFIC generally will apply for subsequent years\nto a U.S. Holder who held (or was deemed to hold) ordinary shares or Business Combination Warrants while the Company is a PFIC, whether or not the\nCompany meets the test for PFIC status in those subsequent years. If the Company is determined to be a PFIC for any taxable year (or portion thereof) that\nis included in the holding period of a U.S. Holder of the ordinary shares or Business Combination Warrants and, in the case of the ordinary shares, the U.S.\nHolder did not timely make either a mark-to-market election or a qualified electing fund (“QEF”) election for the Company’s first taxable year as a PFIC in\nwhich the U.S. Holder held (or was deemed to hold) ordinary shares, as described below, such U.S. Holder generally will be subject to special rules (such\nspecial rules, the “Default PFIC Regime”) with respect to (i) any gain recognized by the U.S. Holder on the sale or other disposition of its ordinary shares or\nBusiness Combination Warrants (which may include gain realized by reason of transfers of ordinary shares or Business Combination Warrants that would\notherwise qualify as nonrecognition transactions for U.S. federal income tax purposes) and (ii) any “excess distribution” made to the U.S. Holder (generally,\nany distributions to such U.S. Holder during a taxable year of the U.S. Holder that are greater than 125% of the average annual distributions received by\nsuch U.S. Holder in respect of the ordinary shares during the three preceding taxable years of such U.S. Holder or, if shorter, the portion of such U.S.\nHolder’s holding period for the ordinary shares that preceded the taxable year of the distribution).\nUnder the Default PFIC Regime:\n· the U.S. Holder’s gain or excess distribution will be allocated ratably over the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the ordinary shares or Business\nCombination Warrants;\n· the amount allocated to the U.S. Holder’s taxable year in which the U.S. Holder recognized the gain or received the excess distribution, or to the\nperiod in the U.S. Holder’s holding period before the first day of the Company’s first taxable year in which the Company is a PFIC, will be taxed\nas ordinary income;\n68\nTable of Contents\n· the amount allocated to each other taxable year (or portion thereof) of the U.S. Holder and included in its holding period will be taxed at the\nhighest tax rate in effect for that year and applicable to the U.S. Holder without regard to the U.S. Holder’s other items of income and loss for\nsuch year; and\n· an additional amount equal to the interest charge generally applicable to underpayments of tax will be imposed on the U.S. Holder with respect to\nthe tax attributable to each such other taxable year of the U.S. Holder.\nIn general, if the Company is determined to be a PFIC, a U.S. Holder may be able to avoid the Default PFIC Regime described above in respect to the\nordinary shares (but, under current law, not the Business Combination Warrants) by making a timely and valid QEF election (if eligible to do so) to include\nin income its pro rata share of the Company’s net capital gains (as long-term capital gain) and other earnings and profits (as ordinary income), on a current\nbasis, in each case whether or not distributed, in the taxable year of the U.S. Holder in which or with which the Company’s taxable year ends. A U.S.\nHolder generally may make a separate election to defer the payment of taxes on undistributed income inclusions under the QEF rules, but if deferred, any\nsuch taxes will be subject to an interest charge.\nIf a U.S. Holder makes a QEF election with respect to its ordinary shares in a year after the Company’s first taxable year as a PFIC in which the U.S. Holder\nheld (or was deemed to hold) ordinary shares, then notwithstanding such QEF election, the Default PFIC Regime discussed above, adjusted to take into\naccount the current income inclusions resulting from the QEF election, will continue to apply with respect to such U.S. Holder’s ordinary shares, unless the\nU.S. Holder makes a purging election under the PFIC rules. Under one type of purging election, the U.S. Holder will be deemed to have sold such ordinary\nshares at their fair market value and any gain recognized on such deemed sale will be treated as an excess distribution, as described above. As a result of\nsuch purging election, the U.S. Holder will have additional basis (to the extent of any gain recognized on the deemed sale) and, solely for purposes of the\nPFIC rules, a new holding period in the ordinary shares.\nUnder current law, a U.S. Holder may not make a QEF election with respect to its Business Combination Warrants to acquire ordinary shares. As a result, if\na U.S. Holder sells or otherwise disposes of such Business Combination Warrants (other than upon exercise of such Business Combination Warrants) and\nthe Company were a PFIC at any time during the U.S. Holder’s holding period of such Business Combination Warrants, any gain recognized generally will\nbe treated as an excess distribution, taxed as described above. If a U.S. Holder that exercises such Business Combination Warrants properly makes and\nmaintains a QEF election with respect to the newly acquired ordinary shares (or has previously made a QEF election with respect to their ordinary shares),\nthe QEF election will apply to the newly acquired ordinary shares. Notwithstanding such QEF election, the Default PFIC Regime discussed above, adjusted\nto take into account the current income inclusions resulting from the QEF election, will continue to apply with respect to such newly acquired ordinary\nshares (which, while not entirely clear, generally will be deemed to have a holding period for purposes of the PFIC rules that includes the period the U.S.\nHolder held the Business Combination Warrants), unless the U.S. Holder makes a purging election under the PFIC rules. U.S. Holders are urged to consult\ntheir tax advisors as to the application of the rules governing purging elections to their particular circumstances.\nThe QEF election is made on a shareholder-by-shareholder basis and, once made, can be revoked only with the consent of the IRS. A U.S. Holder generally\nmakes a QEF election by attaching a completed IRS Form 8621 (Information Return by a Shareholder of a Passive Foreign Investment Company or\nQualified Electing Fund), including the information provided in a PFIC annual information statement, to a timely filed United States federal income tax\nreturn for the tax year to which the election relates. Retroactive QEF elections generally may be made only by filing a protective statement with such return\nand if certain other conditions are met or with the consent of the IRS. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the availability and tax\nconsequences of a retroactive QEF election under their particular circumstances.\nIn order to comply with the requirements of a QEF election, a U.S. Holder must receive a PFIC annual information statement from the Company. There is\nno assurance, however, that the Company will have timely knowledge of its status as a PFIC in the future or that the Company will timely provide the\nrequired information for such years. The failure of the Company to provide such information on an annual basis could prevent a U.S. Holder from making a\nQEF election or result in the invalidation or termination of a U.S. Holder’s prior QEF election.\nIf a U.S. Holder has made a QEF election with respect to its ordinary shares, and the Default PFIC Regime discussed above does not apply to such shares\n(because of a timely QEF election for the Company’s first taxable year as a PFIC in which the U.S. Holder holds (or is deemed to hold) such shares or a\npurge of the PFIC taint pursuant to a purging election, as described above), any gain recognized on the sale of the ordinary shares generally will be taxable\nas capital gain and no additional interest charge will be imposed under the PFIC rules. As discussed above, if the Company is a PFIC for any taxable year, a\nU.S. Holder of ordinary shares that has made a QEF election will be currently taxed on its pro rata share of the Company’s earnings and profits, whether or\nnot distributed for such year. A subsequent distribution of such earnings and profits that were previously included in income generally should not be\ntaxable when distributed to such U.S. Holder. The tax basis of a U.S. Holder’s shares in a QEF will be increased by amounts that are included in\n69\nTable of Contents\nincome, and decreased by amounts distributed but not taxed as dividends, under the above rules. In addition, if the Company is not a PFIC for any taxable\nyear, such U.S. Holder will not be subject to the QEF inclusion regime with respect to the ordinary shares for such a taxable year.\nAlternatively, if a U.S. Holder, at the close of its taxable year, owns shares in a PFIC that are treated as marketable stock, the U.S. Holder may make a\nmark-to-market election with respect to such shares for such taxable year. If the U.S. Holder makes a valid mark-to-market election for the first taxable year\nof the U.S. Holder in which the U.S. Holder holds (or is deemed to hold) ordinary shares and for which the Company is determined to be a PFIC, such U.S.\nHolder generally will not be subject to the Default PFIC Regime described above with respect to its ordinary shares. Instead, in general, the U.S. Holder\nwill include as ordinary income in each taxable year the excess, if any, of the fair market value of its ordinary shares at the end of its taxable year over its\nadjusted basis in its ordinary shares. These amounts of ordinary income would not be eligible for the favorable tax rates applicable to qualified dividend\nincome or long-term capital gains. The U.S. Holder also will recognize an ordinary loss in respect of the excess, if any, of its adjusted basis in its ordinary\nshares over the fair market value of its ordinary shares at the end of its taxable year (but only to the extent of the net amount of previously included income\nas a result of the mark-to-market election). The U.S. Holder’s basis in its ordinary shares will be adjusted to reflect any such income or loss amounts, and\nany further gain recognized on a sale or other taxable disposition of its ordinary shares will be treated as ordinary income and any further loss recognized\nwill be treated as ordinary loss (but only to the extent of the net amount of income previously included as a result of a mark-to-market election, and any loss\nin excess of such prior inclusions generally would be treated as capital loss). Under current law, a mark-to-market election may not be made with respect to\nBusiness Combination Warrants. The mark-to-market election is available only for stock that is regularly traded on a national securities exchange that is\nregistered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including Nasdaq, or on a foreign exchange or market that the IRS determines has rules sufficient\nto ensure that the market price represents a legitimate and sound fair market value. If made, a mark-to-market election would be effective for the taxable\nyear for which the election was made and for all subsequent taxable years unless the ordinary shares ceased to qualify as “marketable stock” for purposes of\nthe PFIC rules or the IRS consented to the revocation of the election. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the availability and\ntax consequences of a mark-to-market election in respect to the ordinary shares under their particular circumstances.\nThe Company is a holding company which conducts its business activities through one or more non-U.S. subsidiaries. If the Company is a PFIC and, at any\ntime, have a non-U.S. subsidiary that is classified as a PFIC, U.S. Holders generally would be deemed to own a portion of the shares of such lower-tier\nPFIC, and generally could incur liability for the deferred tax and interest charge under the Default PFIC Regime described above if the Company receives a\ndistribution from, or dispose of all or part of the Company’s interest in, the lower- tier PFIC or the U.S. Holders otherwise were deemed to have disposed of\nan interest in the lower-tier PFIC, even though the US Holders may not receive proceeds from any such distribution or disposition. There is no assurance\nthat the Company will have timely knowledge of the status of any such lower-tier PFIC, or that any such lower-tier PFIC will provide the required\ninformation necessary for a U.S. Holder to make or maintain a QEF election with respect to such lower-tier PFIC. A mark-to-market election generally\nwould not be available with respect to such lower-tier PFIC. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the tax issues raised by lower-tier\nPFICs.\nA U.S. Holder that owns (or is deemed to own) shares in a PFIC during any taxable year of the U.S. Holder, may have to file an IRS Form 8621 (whether or\nnot a QEF or mark-to-market election is made) and such other information as may be required by the U.S. Treasury Department. Failure to do so, if\nrequired, will extend the statute of limitations until such required information is furnished to the IRS.\nThe rules dealing with PFICs and with the QEF, purging, and mark-to-market elections are very complex and are affected by various factors in addition to\nthose described above. Accordingly, U.S. Holders of the ordinary shares and Business Combination Warrants should consult their own tax advisors\nconcerning the application of the PFIC rules to the ordinary shares and Business Combination Warrants under their particular circumstances.\nTax Reporting\nCertain U.S. Holders who are individuals and certain entities will be required to report information with respect to such U.S. Holder’s investment in\n“specified foreign financial assets” on IRS Form 8938 (Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets), subject to certain exceptions. Specified foreign\nfinancial assets generally include any financial account maintained with a non-U.S. financial institution and should also include the Company Securities if\nthey are not held in an account maintained with a U.S. financial institution. Persons who are required to report specified foreign financial assets and fail to\ndo so may be subject to substantial penalties, and the period of limitations on assessment and collection of United States federal income taxes may be\nextended in the event of a failure to comply. Potential investors are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the foreign financial asset and other\nreporting obligations and their application to an investment in the Company Securities.\n70\nTable of Contents\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nDividend payments with respect to the ordinary shares and proceeds from the sale, exchange or redemption of, the ordinary shares or Business Combination\nWarrants may be subject to information reporting to the IRS and possible United States backup withholding. Backup withholding will not apply, however,\nto a U.S. Holder who furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and makes other required certifications, or who is otherwise exempt from backup\nwithholding and establishes such exempt status.\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited against a holder’s United States federal income tax\nliability, and a holder generally may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules, by timely filing the appropriate\nclaim for refund with the IRS and furnishing any required information.\nCayman Islands Tax Considerations\nThe following is a discussion on certain Cayman Islands income tax consequences of an investment in the securities of the company. The discussion is a\ngeneral summary of present law, which is subject to prospective and retroactive change. It is not intended as tax advice, does not consider any investor’s\nparticular circumstances and does not consider tax consequences other than those arising under Cayman Islands law.\nUnder existing Cayman Islands Laws, payments of dividends and capital in respect of our securities will not be subject to taxation in the Cayman Islands\nand no withholding will be required on the payment of a dividend or capital to any holder of the securities nor will gains derived from the disposal of the\nsecurities be subject to Cayman Islands income or corporate tax. The Cayman Islands currently has no income, corporate or capital gains tax and no estate\nduty, inheritance tax or gift tax.\nNo stamp duty is payable in respect of the issue of the warrants. An instrument of transfer in respect of a warrant is stampable if executed in or brought into\nthe Cayman Islands.\nNo stamp duty is payable in respect of the issue of our ordinary shares or on an instrument of transfer in respect of such shares.\nThe Company has been incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands as an exempted company with limited liability and, as such, has applied for and\nreceived an undertaking from the Financial Secretary of the Cayman Islands in the following form:\nThe Tax Concessions Law Undertaking as to Tax Concessions\nIn accordance with the Tax Concessions Law, the following undertaking is hereby given to Arqit Quantum Inc. (the “Company”):\n1. That no law which is hereafter enacted in the Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations shall apply to the\ncompany or its operations; and\n2. In addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations or which is in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax shall be\npayable:\n2.1 on or in respect of the shares, debentures or other obligations of the company; or\n2.2 by way of the withholding in whole or part, of any relevant payment as defined in the Tax Concessions Law.\nThese concessions shall be for a period of twenty years from the 28th day of April 2021.\n10.F.

The SEC maintains an Internet site at www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and\ninformation statements and other information we have filed electronically with the SEC. As a foreign private issuer, we are exempt under the Exchange Act\nfrom, among other things, the rules prescribing the furnishing and content of proxy\n71\nTable of Contents\nstatements, and our executive officers, directors and principal shareholders are exempt from the reporting and short-swing profit recovery provisions\ncontained in Section 16 of the Exchange Act. In addition, we are not required under the Exchange Act to file periodic reports and financial statements with\nthe SEC as frequently or as promptly as U.S. companies whose securities are registered under the Exchange Act.\n10.I.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-\n15(f) under the Exchange Act) and for the assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial\nreporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements\nfor external purposes in accordance with IFRS. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the\nmaintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that\ntransactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples, (iii) provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and\ndirectors, and (iv) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could\nhave a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and\noperation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2023 based upon the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and\nChief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\nAs disclosed in “Item 15. Controls and Procedures” in our Annual Report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, our management\nidentified certain material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting related to certain controls not being in place for the full fiscal year, an\nineffective IT general control environment and insufficient accounting and finance personnel with IFRS technical accounting knowledge.\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, management implemented our previously disclosed remediation plan that included: (1) strengthening\nour compliance functions with support of external providers and recruiting additional experienced hires to assist in our risk assessment process and the\ndesign and implementation of controls responsive to those risks; (2) providing certain staff with additional training on the appropriate validation and\nevidencing of source data inputs; (3) reviewing all areas, such as payroll and implementing controls to remediate segregation of duties conflicts; (4) hiring\nmore experience qualified finance resources to strengthen the financial reporting process; and (5) implementing controls around user access and approval\nworkflows in our financial systems.\nDuring the year, we completed our testing of the operating effectiveness of the implemented controls and found them to be effective. As a result, we have\nconcluded the material weakness has been remediated as of September 30, 2023\nAttestation Report of the Registered Accounting Firm\nThis Annual Report does not include an attestation report of the company’s independent registered public accounting firm because we qualify as an\nemerging growth company as such term is defined in the JOBS ACT and as such, we are exempted from such attestation requirement.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nDuring the period covered by this annual report on Form 20-F, there were changes in our internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in\nRules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over\nfinancial reporting, as disclosed above in “Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.”\n73\nTable of Contents\n16.A. AUDIT COMMITTEE AND FINANCIAL EXPERT\nThe board of directors has determined that Stephen Chandler qualifies as an “audit committee financial expert” as defined under rules and regulations of\nthe SEC and satisfies the “independence” requirements set forth in Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act.\n16.B. CODE OF ETHICS\nWe have adopted a code of ethics applicable to our directors, officers and employees. This includes our principal executive officer, principal financial\nofficer, and principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions. Our Code of Ethics is intended to meet the definition of\n“code of ethics” under Item 16B of 20-F under the Exchange Act. We will disclose on our website any amendment to, or waiver from, a provision of our\nCode of Ethics that applies to our directors or executive officers to the extent required under the rules of the SEC or Nasdaq. The code of ethics is available\non our website as: ir.arqit.uk/investors/corporate-governance/governance-documents. The information contained on our website is not incorporated by\nreference in this Annual Report.\n16.C. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES\nOur audit committee of the board of directors is required to pre-approve the audit and non-audit services to be performed by our independent registered\npublic accounting firm and associated fees prior to the engagement with respect to such services. Pursuant to this policy, which is designed to assure that\nsuch engagements do not impair the independence of our auditors, the audit committee pre-approves annually a catalogue of specific audit and non-audit\nservices that may be performed by our independent registered public accounting firm.\n12 Months Ended 12 Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 September 30, 2022\nPKF Littlejohn LLP\nAudit Fees £ 110,000 £ 95,000\nAudited-Related Fees £ 30,000 £ 20,000\nTotal £ 140,000 £ 115,000\n16.D.

CHANGE IN REGISTRANT’S CERTIFYING ACCOUNTANT\nNot Applicable.\n16.G. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nWe are a “foreign private issuer” (as such term is defined in Rule 3b-4 under the Exchange Act) and our ordinary shares and warrants are listed on Nasdaq.\nThe Nasdaq Listing Rules allow foreign private issuers, such as us, to follow home country corporate governance practices (in our case Cayman Islands\nLaws) in lieu of the otherwise applicable Nasdaq corporate governance requirements. In order to rely on this exception, we are required to disclose each\nNasdaq Listing Rule that we do not follow and describe the home country practice we do follow in lieu thereof.\nWe currently rely on this “foreign private issuer exemption” with respect to shareholder approval requirements and audit committee composition. We will\nseek shareholder approval for all corporate actions requiring such approval under requirements of Cayman Islands Laws, rather than seeking approval for\ncorporate actions in accordance with Nasdaq Capital Market Listing Rule 5635. In particular, under this Nasdaq Capital Market rule, shareholder approval\nis generally required for: (i) an acquisition of shares or assets of another company that involves the issuance of 20% or more of the acquirer’s shares or\nvoting rights or if a director, officer or 5% shareholder has greater than a 5% interest in the target company or the consideration to be received; (ii) the\nissuance of shares leading to a change of control; (iii) adoption or amendment of equity compensation arrangements; and (iv) issuances of 20% or more of\nthe shares or voting rights (including securities convertible into, or exercisable for, equity) of a listed company via a private placement (or via sales by\ndirectors, officers or 5% shareholders) if such equity is issued (or sold) at below the greater of the book or market value of shares. Cayman Islands Laws do\nnot require shareholder approval prior to any of the foregoing types of issuances. In addition, we will\n74\nTable of Contents\nmaintain an audit committee comprised of independent directors as required by the Nasdaq Listing Rules, however we will follow any applicable\nrequirements of Cayman Islands Laws in respect of other audit committee composition requirements.\n16.H.

In our opinion, the consolidated\nfinancial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Group as of September 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021, and the results of\nits operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, in conformity with International Financial Reporting\nStandards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.\nBasis for opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Group’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Group’s\nconsolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\n(United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Group in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the\napplicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Group is not required to\nhave, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or\nfraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by\nmanagement, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis\nfor our opinion.\nCritical audit matters\nCritical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated\nto those charged with governance and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especially\nchallenging, subjective, or complex judgements. The communication of critical audit matters do not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements,\ntaken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nCritical Audit Matter How we addressed the matter in our audit\nClassification and recoverability of satellite and satellite division (note\n13)\nAt the year-end, management intend to sell (in part or in whole) the Our work in this area included:\nQuantum satellite currently under construction, or alternatively the satellite\ndivision.

General information and significant accounting policies\nGeneral information\nArqit Quantum Inc. (the “Company”) is a Cayman Islands exempted limited liability company with registered number 374857. The address of its registered\noffice and its principal place of trading is c/o Maples Corporate Services Limited, PO Box 309, Ugland House, Grand Cayman, KY1-1104, Cayman\nIslands.\nThese consolidated financial statements comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”).\nThe principal activity of the Group is provision of cybersecurity services via terrestrial platforms.\nThe Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Securities Act, and may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting\nrequirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but limited to, not being required to comply\nwith the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and reduced disclosure\nobligations regarding executive compensation.\nBasis of preparation\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the IASB. The\nfinancial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis, other than investor warrants held at fair value through profit or loss, and the accounting\npolicies set out below have been consistently applied. The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical\naccounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies.\nThe consolidated financial statements have been presented in United States Dollars “USD” which is also the Group’s functional currency. All values are\nrounded to the nearest units (USD '000), except when otherwise indicated.\nOn September 3, 2021, the Company acquired Arqit Limited through a share for share exchange. The acquisition is not a business combination and Arqit\nLimited is identified as the acquirer for accounting purposes and as such the transaction is a reverse acquisition. As the acquisition is not a business\ncombination (refer to note 9), the transaction falls within IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payments’. In line with the IFRIC guidance, the transaction is accounted for\nas follows:\na. The assets and liabilities of the accounting acquirer are recognised and measured in the consolidated financial statements at their pre-combination\ncarrying amounts.\nb. The identifiable net assets of the Company, as legal acquirer, is recognised in accordance with paragraph 10 of IFRS 2 at their fair value at grant\ndate\nc. Any difference in the fair value of the shares deemed to have been issued and the fair value of the Company’s assets and liabilities is charged to the\nConsolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as a share-based payment expense and represents in substance the cost of acquiring a Nasdaq\nlisting.\nBasis of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries as at September 30, 2023.\nSubsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns\nfrom its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The subsidiaries are fully consolidated from\nthe date on which control is transferred to the Group and deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.\nF-8\nTable of Contents\nArqit Quantum Inc.\nNotes to the Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the year ended 30 September 2023\nThe financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same financial year as the parent company, applying consistent accounting policies\nthroughout the Group. Inter-company balances and transactions, including unrealised profits or losses are eliminated on consolidation.\nComparative information\nThe Arqit Limited financial statements have been translated into USD in accordance with IAS 21 ‘The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates’. This\nstandard requires that assets and liabilities be translated using the exchange rate at year end, and income, expenses and cash flow items are translated using\nthe rate that approximates the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions (i.e. the average rate for the year). The foreign exchange differences on\ntranslation of Arqit Limited are recognised in other comprehensive income.\nGoing Concern\nThe directors believe that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis. In assessing whether the going concern assumption\nis appropriate, the Directors have taken into account all relevant available information about the current and future position of the Group and Company. As\npart of their assessment, the Directors have also taken into account the ability to raise additional funding whilst maintaining sufficient cash resources to\nmeet all commitments.\nFollowing the close of the business combination transaction in September 2021 the Company had $87m as at 30 September 2021, $49m as at 30 September\n2022, and $44m as at 30 September 2023. Based on business forecasts, this is sufficient to enable the Group to grow according to its plans.\nThe Company has prepared detailed forecasts with strong cost control measures in place to enable the Group to grow according to its plans. Given the\ncurrent economic and political climate and uncertainties, the Company has controls in place to monitor spend and ensure that it can continue to operate for\nthe foreseeable period.\nBased on the above, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group and Company will have adequate resources to continue in operational\nexistence for the foreseeable future, such that they will be able to realise their assets and discharge their liabilities in the normal course of business for a\nperiod of at least 12 months from the date of signing these financial statements, and beyond. Therefore, the financial statements are prepared on the going\nconcern basis.\nStandards, interpretations and amendments to published standards\nThe Group has adopted the following standards and amendments to standards for the first time for their annual reporting period commencing 1 October\n2022, none of which had a material impact:\n● Amendments to IAS 1: Presentation of Financial Statements – Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current (effective for periods\ncommencing on or after 1 January 2023);\n● Amendments to IAS 1: Presentation of Financial Statements – Disclosure of Accounting Policies (effective for periods commencing on or after 1\nJanuary 2023);\n● Amendments to IAS 8: Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors – Definition of Accounting Estimates (effective for\nperiods commencing on or after 1 January 2023);\n● Amendments to IAS 12: Deferred Tax Related to Assets and Liabilities Arising from a Single Transaction (effective for periods commencing on or\nafter 1 January 2023);\nThe Group has not early adopted the following new and amended standards that have been issued but are not yet effective:\n● Amendments to IFRS 16: Leases – Liability in a Sale and Leaseback (effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2024);\nF-9\nTable of Contents\nArqit Quantum Inc.\nNotes to the Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the year ended 30 September 2023\n● Amendments to IAS 1: Presentation of Financial Statements – Non-current Liabilities with Covenants (effective for periods commencing on or after\n1 January 2024); and\n● Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28: Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture (effective date is\ndeferred indefinitely)\nThe directors of the Company anticipate that the application of all new and amended standards will have no material impact on the future results of the\nGroup in the foreseeable future.\nOperating Segments\nThe Directors consider the Group to operate within one operating segment, being the provision of cybersecurity services via terrestrial platforms.\nGovernment grants\nGovernment grants are recognised only when there is reasonable assurance that (a) the entity will comply with any conditions attached to the grant and\n(b) the grant will be received.\nGrants related to research and development are included in non-current or current liabilities as deferred income and recognised in profit or loss over the\nperiod necessary to match them with the costs that they are intended to compensate. The grants will be systematically amortised to profit or loss over a\nperiod matching the useful life of the acquired asset.\nIntangible assets - Research and development expenditure\nResearch costs are expensed through the income statement as they are incurred. Under IAS 38, development costs are only capitalised after technical and\ncommercial feasibility of the asset for sale or use have been established. The Company must intend and be able to complete the asset and either use it or sell\nit and be able to demonstrate how the asset will generate future economic benefit. Capitalised development costs are recorded as intangible assets and\namortised from the point at which the asset is ready for use.\nAmortisation on intangible assets in use is calculated under the straight-line method to write off the amortisable amount of the intangible assets over their\nestimated useful lives. The principal annual rates used for this purpose are between five and ten years. QuantumCloudTM is written off over seven years.\nThe amortisation method, useful lives and residual values are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period to ensure that the\namounts, method and years of amortisation are consistent with previous estimates and the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits\nembodied in the items of the intangible assets.\nIntangible assets not yet subject to amortisation are tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that\nthey might be impaired. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount. The\nrecoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and value in use.\nCurrent and deferred income tax\nThe current income tax expense or credit is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of financial position\ndate in the countries where the Company operates and generates taxable income, adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to\ntemporary differences and to unused tax losses. Management periodically evaluate positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which\napplicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax\nauthorities.\nThe research and development (“R&D”) tax credit is calculated using the current rules as prescribed by HMRC. The estimation is based on the actual UK\nR&D projects that qualify for the scheme that have been carried out in the period. This is treated on a accruals basis when the R&D tax credit has been\ncalculated for the relevant period.\nF-10\nTable of Contents\nArqit Quantum Inc.\nNotes to the Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the year ended 30 September 2023\nDeferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their\ncarrying amounts in the financial statements. However, the deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or\nliability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit nor loss.\nDeferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to\napply when the related deferred income tax assets is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset\nwhere there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and where the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority.\nDeferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences\ncan be utilised.\nRevenue\nThe Company adopts IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ for revenue including other income which is recognised in accordance with this\nstandard. Revenue from services related to the Quantum Cloud product has been recognised in the year once the service has been performed and accepted\nby the customer. Other income represents income derived from contracts for the provision of goods and services by the Company to customers in exchange\nfor consideration in the ordinary course of the Company’s activities.\nPerformance obligations\nUpon approval by the parties to a contract, the contract is assessed to identify each promise to transfer either a distinct good or service or a series of distinct\ngoods or services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. Goods and services are distinct and accounted for as\nseparate performance obligations in the contract if the customer can benefit from them either on their own or together with other resources that are readily\navailable to the customer and they are separately identifiable in the contract.\nTransaction price\nAt the start of the contract, the total transaction price is estimated as the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange\nfor transferring the promised goods and services to the customer, excluding sales taxes. The transaction price does not include estimates of consideration\nresulting from contract modifications, such as change orders, until they have been approved by the parties to the contract.\nThe total transaction price is allocated to the performance obligations identified in the contract in proportion to their relative standalone selling prices. Given\nthe bespoke nature of many of the Company’s products and services, which are designed and/or manufactured under contract to the customer’s individual\nspecifications, there are sometimes no observable standalone selling prices. Instead, standalone selling prices are typically estimated based on expected\ncosts.\nThe Company utilizes a practical expedient in the standard to not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing\ncomponent, when it is expected at contract inception, that the period between when the entity transfers a promised good or service to a customer and when\nthe customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less.\nContract liabilities\nContract liabilities represent the obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which consideration has been received, or consideration is due,\nfrom the customer.\nThe Company utilizes a practical expedient in the standard to recognise the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when incurred, if the\namortisation period of the asset that would otherwise be recognised is one year or less.\nF-11\nTable of Contents\nArqit Quantum Inc.\nNotes to the Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the year ended 30 September 2023\nAccounting for Joint Ventures\nA joint venture is an arrangement in which the Group has joint control, whereby the Group has the rights to the net assets of the arrangement as opposed to\nthe rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities.\nThis is initially recognised as an investment at cost and subsequently accounted for using the equity method in accordance with IAS 28 Investments in\nAssociates and Joint Ventures.\nFinancial instruments\nA financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of on entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another.\n(a) Financial assets\nInitial recognition and measurement\nFinancial assets are classified, at initial recognition, and subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income, or fair\nvalue through profit or loss.\nThe classification of financial assets at initial recognition that are debt instruments depends on the financial asset’s contractual cash flow characteristics and\nthe Company’s business model for managing them. The Company initially measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset\nnot at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs.\nIn order for a financial asset to be classified and measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income, it needs to give rise to cash\nflows that are ‘solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI)’ on the principal amount outstanding.\nPrincipal for the purpose of this test is defined as the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition and may change over the life of the financial asset,\nfor example, if there are repayments of principal or amortization of the premium/discount. The most significant elements of interest within a debt instrument\nare typically the consideration for the time value of money and credit risk. To make the SPPI assessment, the Company applies judgement and considers\nrelevant factors such as the currency in which the financial asset is denominated, and the period for which the interest rate is set.\nThis assessment is referred to as the SPPI test and is performed at an instrument level.\nThe Company’s business model for managing financial assets refers to how it manages its financial assets in order to generate cash flows. The business\nmodel determines whether cash flows will result from collecting contractual cash flows, selling the financial assets, or both.\nSubsequent measurement\nFor purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in four categories:\n● Financial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments)\n● Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income with recycling of cumulative gains and losses (debt instruments)\n● Financial assets designated at fair value through other comprehensive income with no recycling of cumulative gains and losses upon derecognition\n(equity instruments)\n● Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss\nF-12\nTable of Contents\nArqit Quantum Inc.\nNotes to the Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the year ended 30 September 2023\nFinancial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments)\nThis category is the most relevant to the Company. The Company measures financial assets at amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met:\n● The financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows; and\n● The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal\namount outstanding.\nFinancial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest rate (“EIR”) method and are subject to impairment. Interest\nreceived is recognised as part of finance income in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. Gains and losses are recognised in profit\nor loss when the asset is derecognised, modified or impaired. The Company’s financial assets at amortised cost include trade receivables (not subject to\nprovisional pricing) and other receivables.\nOffsetting financial instruments\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the consolidated statement of financial position when, and only when, the\nGroup currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts; and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the assets and settle\nthe liabilities simultaneously.\nDerecognition\nA financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a Company of similar financial assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e., removed\nfrom the Company’s consolidated statement of financial position) when:\n● The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or\n● The Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without\nmaterial delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and either (a) the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of\nthe asset, or (b) the Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the\nasset.\nImpairment of financial assets\nThe Company recognises an allowance for expected credit losses (“ECLs”) for all debt instruments not held at fair value. For trade receivables (not subject\nto provisional pricing) and other receivables due in less than 12 months, the Company applies the simplified approach in calculating ECLs, as permitted by\nIFRS 9. Therefore, the Company does not track changes in credit risk, but instead, recognises a loss allowance based on the financial asset’s lifetime ECL\nat each reporting date.\nThe Company considers a financial asset in default when contractual payments are 90 days past due. However, in certain cases, the Company may also\nconsider a financial asset to be in default when internal or external information indicates that the Company is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual\namounts in full before taking into account any credit enhancements held by the Company.\nA financial asset is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual cash flows and usually occurs when past due for more\nthan one year and not subject to enforcement activity. At each reporting date, the Company assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost are\nimpaired. A financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial\nasset have occurred.\n(b) Financial liabilities\nFinancial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, payables, or as\nderivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. All financial liabilities are recognised\nF-13\nTable of Contents\nArqit Quantum Inc.\nNotes to the Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the year ended 30 September 2023\ninitially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs. The Company’s financial liabilities\ninclude trade and other payables and loans.\nSubsequent measurement\nThe measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below:\nFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss\nFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition\nas at fair value through profit or loss. Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near\nterm. This category also includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Company that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge\nrelationships as defined by IFRS 9. Separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging\ninstruments. Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.\nLoans and borrowings and trade and other payables\nAfter initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings and trade and other payables are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR\nmethod. Gains and losses are recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income when the liabilities are derecognised, as well as\nthrough the EIR amortisation process.\nAmortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR\namortisation is included as finance costs in the statement of comprehensive income.\nThis category generally applies to trade and other payables.\nDerecognition\nA financial liability is derecognised when the associated obligation is discharged or cancelled or expires.\nWhen an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are\nsubstantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The\ndifference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in profit or loss and other comprehensive income.\nBorrowings\nBorrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised costs. Any difference\nbetween the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value are recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the\neffective interest rate method. Borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.\nBorrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Company has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after\nthe balance sheet date.\nConvertible loan notes\nConvertible loan notes are assessed on inception and classified as either a liability, equity or a compound financial instrument in accordance with IAS 32.\nWhen a convertible loan note is assessed to be wholly equity it is recognised immediately in other reserves.\nWhen a convertible loan note is assessed a liability, it is treated as a hybrid instrument containing a host debt contract and an embedded derivative liability\n(written call option over own shares). The embedded derivative is measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss. Should it be\nconcluded that the equity component of the combined instrument may be sufficiently significant\nF-14\nTable of Contents\nArqit Quantum Inc.\nNotes to the Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the year ended 30 September 2023\nto preclude it from obtaining a reliable estimate of the fair value of the entire instrument, the combined instrument is measured at cost less impairment.\nWhen a convertible loan note is assessed as a compound financial instrument, the net proceeds received from the issue of convertible bonds are split\nbetween a liability element and an equity component at the date of issue. The fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market\ninterest rate for similar nonconvertible debt. The difference between the proceeds of issue of the convertible bonds and the fair value assigned to the liability\ncomponent, representing the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the Company, is included in equity and is not remeasured. The liability\ncomponent is carried at amortised cost. Any difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability that has been extinguished and the\nconsideration paid is recognised in profit or loss as other income or finance costs. As per note 16, the convertible loan note B and Future Fund liability\nwere converted to equity in September 2021.\nThe interest expense on the liability component is calculated by applying the prevailing market interest rate, at the time of issue, for similar non-convertible\ndebt to the liability component of the instrument. The difference between this amount and the interest paid is added to the carrying amount of the\nconvertible bonds.\nDefined contribution pension\nFor defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or\nvoluntary basis. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognized as employee benefit\nexpense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognized as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is\navailable.Employee leave entitlements\nEmployee entitlements to annual leave are recognized when they accrue to employees. A provision is made for the estimated liability for annual leave as a\nresult of services rendered by employees up to the end of the reporting period. Employee entitlements to sick leave and maternity leave are not recognized\nuntil the time of leave.\nNon-financial assets\nAt each reporting date, the Company reviews the carrying amount of its non-financial assets to determine whether there is any indication for impairment. If\nsuch indication exists, then the assets recoverable amount is estimated.\nFor impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash flows from continuing to use the asset (CGU). The\nrecoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its fair value less cost to sell or its value in use.\nAn impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds the recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in profit or\nloss.\nShare-based compensation\nShare options\nWhere share options are awarded to employees, the fair value of the options at grant date is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income over the\nvesting period. Nonmarket vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to vest at each reporting date\nso that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based on the number of options or warrants that eventually vest. Market\nvesting conditions are factored into the fair value of the options granted. The cumulative expense is not adjusted for failure to achieve a market vesting\ncondition.\nThe fair value of the award also considers non-vesting conditions. These are either factors beyond the control of either party (such as a target based on an\nindex) or factors which are within the control of one or other of the parties (such as the Company keeping the scheme open or the employee maintaining any\ncontributions required by the scheme).\nF-15\nTable of Contents\nArqit Quantum Inc.\nNotes to the Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the year ended 30 September 2023\nWhere the terms and conditions of options are modified before they vest, the increase in the fair value of the options, measured immediately before and after\nthe modification, is also charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income over the remaining vesting period.\nWhere equity instruments are granted to persons other than employees, the Statement of Comprehensive Income is charged with fair value of goods and\nservices received.\nThe share option charge was calculated using the Black Scholes Option pricing model which requires the use of various estimates and assumptions (note\n19).\nWhen share options lapse, any amounts credited to the share-based payments reserve are released to the retained earnings reserve.\nRSUs (Restricted Stock Units)\nWhere RSUs are granted to employees, the fair value of the RSUs at grant date is based upon the market price of the shares underlying the awards and this\nis charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income over the vesting period. There are no internal performance conditions. The expense charged is\nadjusted based on actual forfeitures.\nWarrants\nWarrants are classified as derivatives and are initially recognised at their fair value on the date of inception of the contract. The Company’s warrants are\nsubsequently re-measured at each reporting date with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss. The warrants are valued using the Binomial Option\nPricing Model.\nAs the fair value of the warrants fluctuate with movement in the underlying Arqit Quantum Inc share price, these warrants are considered a derivative as a\nvariable amount of cash will be settled on exercise.\nForeign currencies\nFunctional and presentation currency\nItems included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which\nthe entity operates (the “functional currency”). The functional currency of Arqit Quantum Inc. is U.S. dollars. The Group financial statements are presented\nin U.S Dollars which is considered to be the Group’s presentation currency.\nTransactions and balances\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transactions or valuation where\nitems are re-measured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at period-end\nexchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.\nNon-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial\ntransactions.\nGroup companies\nThe results and financial position of all the Group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyper-inflationary economy) that have a functional currency\ndifferent from the presentation currency are translated as follows:\na) assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date are translated at the closing rate as at that balance sheet date;\nb) income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates; and\nF-16\nTable of Contents\nArqit Quantum Inc.\nNotes to the Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the year ended 30 September 2023\nc) all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and all other cash amounts with maturities of three months or less.\nProperty, plant and equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at historic cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any.\nDepreciation is calculated under the straight-line method to write off the depreciable amount of the assets over their estimated useful lives. Depreciation of\nan asset does not cease when the asset becomes idle or is retired from active use unless the asset is fully depreciated. The principal annual rates used for this\npurpose are between three and five years. Computer equipment is written off over 3 years, office equipment is written off over 5 years and furniture and\nfittings are written off over 5 years.\nThe depreciation method, useful lives and residual values are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period to ensure that the\namounts, method and years of depreciation are consistent with previous estimates and the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits\nembodied in the items of the property, plant and equipment.\nSubsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when the cost is incurred and it is\nprobable that the future economic benefits associated with the asset will flow to the Group and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. The carrying\namount of parts that are replaced is derecognised. The costs of the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognised in profit or loss as\nincurred. Costs also comprise the initial estimate of dismantling and removing the asset and restoring the site on which it is located for which the Group are\nobligated to incur when the asset is acquired, if applicable.\nAssets and liabilities held for sale and discontinued operations\nAny non-current assets meeting the criteria for classification as held for sale are disclosed separately on the face of the statement of financial position.\nThese assets are measured at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and are not depreciated. If the asset is an investment in an\nequity-accounted entity, then equity-accounting ceases when the investment is classified as an asset held for sale. The results of any operations meeting the\ncriteria for classification as a discontinued operation are presented separately in the income statement.\nFor the sale to be highly probable, management must be committed to a plan for sale and must have started an active programme to find a buyer and\ncomplete the plan. The disposal group must be actively marketed at a price which is reasonable in relation to its fair value. These requirements will\ngenerally be met when an Authority to Negotiate for the sale has been approved and signed. Each transaction must be reviewed to confirm:\n● That there is an active programme to find a buyer and complete the plan. Indicators that this point has been reached may include, among other\nthings, that there is a data room up and running or in preparation, an auction has commenced, or discussions are under way with a third party.\n● That the sale is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.\nEvents or circumstances may extend the period to complete the sale beyond one year. An extension of the period required to complete a sale does not\npreclude an asset (or disposal group) from being classified as held for sale if the delay is caused by events or circumstances beyond the entity's control and\nthere is sufficient evidence that the entity remains committed to its plan to sell the asset (or disposal group).\nThe net results of discontinued operations are presented separately in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income (and the comparatives restated).\nF-17\nTable of Contents\nArqit Quantum Inc.\nNotes to the Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the year ended 30 September 2023\nLeases\nAt inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to\ncontrol the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\nAs a lessee\nAt commencement or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, the Group allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease\ncomponent on the basis of its relative stand-alone prices. However, for the leases of property the Group has elected not to separate non-lease components\nand account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.\nThe Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which\ncomprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs\nincurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any\nlease incentives received.\nThe right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term, unless the lease\ntransfers ownership of the underlying asset to the Group by the end of the lease term or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Group will exercise\na purchase option. In that case the right-of-use asset will be depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset, which is determined on the same basis\nas those of property and equipment. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain\nremeasurements of the lease liability.\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest\nrate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses its incremental\nborrowing rate as the discount rate.\nThe Group determines its incremental borrowing rate by obtaining interest rates from various external financing sources and makes certain adjustments to\nreflect the terms of the lease and type of the asset leased.\nLease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:\n● fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments;\n● variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date;\n● amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; and the exercise price under a purchase option that the Group is reasonably certain\nto exercise, lease payments in an optional renewal period if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, and penalties for early\ntermination of a lease unless the Group is reasonably certain not to terminate early.\nThe lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising\nfrom a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the Group’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, if the\nGroup changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option or if there is a revised in-substance fixed lease\npayment.\nWhen the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in\nprofit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.\nThe Group presents right-of-use assets that do not meet the definition of investment property and lease liabilities in the statement of financial position.\nF-18\nTable of Contents\nArqit Quantum Inc.\nNotes to the Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the year ended 30 September 2023\nShort-term leases and leases of low-value assets\nThe Group has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases of low-value assets and short-term leases, including IT equipment.\nThe Group recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nShare capital\nOrdinary shares are classified as equity. Any incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax,\nfrom the proceeds.\nFinancial risk management\nThe Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including currency risk, fair value interest rate risk, cash flow interest rate risk\nand price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.\nRisk management is overseen by the Board of Directors. The Board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies\ncovering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial\ninstruments, and investment of excess liquidity.\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the\nmeasurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. In estimating the fair value of an\nasset or a liability, the Group takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability if market participants would take those characteristics into\naccount when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.\nIn addition, for financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are categorised into Level 1, 2 or 3 based on the degree to which the inputs to the fair\nvalue measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety, which are described as follows:\n● Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date;\n● Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly;\nand\n● Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.\nPlease see note 26 for financial instruments and fair value disclosures.\nCritical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty\nIn the application of the Group’s accounting policies, management is required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts\nof assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on experience and other factors\nthat are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which\nthe estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future\nperiods. The directors consider the below to be the critical judgements in respect of the period.\nWarrants valuation\nEstimating the fair value of warrants requires a determination of the most appropriate valuation model, which depends on the terms and conditions of the\nwarrant. This estimate also requires determination of the most appropriate inputs to the valuation model including equity value, exercise price, volatility,\ndividend yield, risk free rate and exercise period and making assumptions about them. For the\nF-19\nTable of Contents\nArqit Quantum Inc.\nNotes to the Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the year ended 30 September 2023\nmeasurement of the fair value of warrants at both the acquisition and the reporting date, the Group uses a Binomial Option Pricing Model. The assumptions\nand models used for this estimation are disclosed in note 18.\nDeemed acquisition cost\nA ‘reverse acquisition’ is a transaction in which the legal acquirer - i.e. the entity that issues the securities (listed entity) becomes the acquiree for\naccounting purposes and the legal acquiree becomes the acquirer for accounting purposes.\nThe reverse acquisition is accounted for under IFRS 2 “Share-based Payments” whereby the legal acquiree Arqit Limited is deemed to have issued shares\nin exchange for the net assets and listing status of Arqit Quantum Inc. The deemed consideration is the fair value of the shares that Arqit Limited would\nhave had to issue to Arqit Quantum Inc to acquire the same percentage equity interest in the combined entity that results from the reverse acquisition.\nThe deemed acquisition cost is recognised in profit or loss and is the difference between the fair value of the deemed consideration and the fair value of the\nnet assets acquired. It represents the premium paid for obtaining the public listing. Detail on the reverse acquisition of Arqit Quantum Inc. is included in\nnote 9.\nCapitalisation of development costs\nThe Group capitalises costs for product development projects. Initial capitalisation of costs is based on management’s judgement that technological and\neconomic feasibility is confirmed, usually when a product development project has reached a defined milestone according to an established project\nmanagement model, and all other recognition criteria within IAS 38 can be demonstrated. In determining the amounts to be capitalised, management makes\nassumptions regarding the expected future cash generation of the project, discount rates to be applied and the expected period of benefits. At September 30,\n2023, the carrying amount of capitalised development costs were $3.414 million (2022: $40.291 million, 2021: $18.235 million).\nShare-based compensation\nEstimating fair value for share option payment transactions requires determination of the most appropriate valuation model, which depends on the terms and\nconditions of the grant. This estimate also requires determination of the most appropriate inputs to the valuation model including the expected life of the\nshare option or appreciation right, volatility and dividend yield and making assumptions about them. For the measurement of the fair value of equity settled\ntransactions with employees at the grant date, the Group uses a Black Scholes valuation. The assumptions and models used for estimating fair value for\nshare-based payment transactions are disclosed in note 19.\nCompensation expense for RSUs is determined based upon the market price of the shares underlying the awards on the date of the grant and expensed over\nthe vesting period, which is generally a one to five year service period. The compensation expense is adjusted based on actual forfeitures.\nDeferred tax asset\nJudgement is required to determine whether deferred tax assets are recognised in the statement of financial position. Deferred tax assets, arising from\nunutilised tax losses, require the Group to assess the likelihood it will generate sufficient taxable earnings in future periods, in order to utilise recognised\ndeferred tax assets. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, the ability of the Group to realise the net\ndeferred tax assets recorded at the reporting date could be impacted.\nAssets held for sale\nThe Group's management uses its professional judgement based on offers and commercial appraisal. As at 30 September 2023, assets held for sale are\nrecognised at fair value less costs to sell. Judgement is required when estimating expected fair value until any sale is contractually concluded. Changes in\nthe economic environment or other facts and circumstances may cause revisions to these assumptions and could result in a material change to the realizable\nvalue of the Group's assets held for sale within the next financial year.\nF-20\nTable of Contents\nArqit Quantum Inc.\nNotes to the Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the year ended 30 September 2023\n2.

The share\noptions and RSUs are dilutive and therefore have been included in the calculation for diluted earnings per share.\nThe average market value of the Company’s shares for the purpose of calculating the dilutive effect of share options and RSUs was based on quoted market\nprices for the year during which the options were outstanding.\nPrior to the reverse recapitalisation, the EPS of the combined company is presented on the basis of Arqit Limited shares outstanding, adjusted using the\nshare exchange ratio of 46.06.\n9. Business combination agreement\nOn May 12, 2021, Centricus Acquisition Corp. (“Centricus”/ “CAC”), Arqit Limited (“AL”), and the shareholders of AL entered into a Business\nCombination Agreement whereby: (i) on September 2, 2021, Centricus merged with and into Arqit Quantum Inc (“the Company” / “AQI”), with the\nCompany surviving the merger, and the security holders of Centricus became security holders of the Company, and (ii) on September 3, 2021, the\nCompany acquired all of the issued and outstanding share capital of AL from the shareholders of AL in exchange for ordinary shares of the Company, such\nthat AL is a direct wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.\nIn consideration for the merger between the Company and Centricus, each Centricus shareholder received one ordinary share and one warrant of the\nCompany for each ordinary share and warrant they held in Centricus, respectively. Each ordinary share of AL was acquired by the Company in exchange\nfor 46.06 ordinary shares of AQI.\nThe merger of the Company and Centricus does not meet the definition of an IFRS 3 business combination. At the date of the merger, Centricus did not\nmeet the definition of a business under IFRS 3 and as such the merger constitutes a reverse acquisition as opposed to a business combination.\nConcurrently with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, the Company and Centricus entered into subscription agreements with PIPE\nInvestors who agreed to subscribe for and purchase an aggregate of 7,100,000 ordinary shares in the Company at $10.00 per share for gross proceeds of\n$71,000,000.\nAfter market close on September 3, 2021, Centricus’ ordinary shares, units and warrants ceased trading on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, and beginning\non September 7, 2021, the Company’s ordinary shares and warrants began trading on Nasdaq under the symbols \"ARQQ\" and “ARQQW”, respectively.\nPlease see note 18 for further detail on the valuation of the warrants.\nThe acquisition of the share capital of AL by the Company whereby AL becomes a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, constitutes a reverse\nacquisition as the previous shareholders of AL own a substantial majority of the Ordinary Shares of the Company. As the\nCompany previously had no investment activities and was engaged in acquiring AL and raising equity financing to provide the required funding for the\noperations of the acquisition and re-listing on the NASDAQ exchange, it did not meet the definition of a business as prescribed in IFRS 3. Accordingly, this\nreverse acquisition does not constitute a business combination and is accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payments and associated IFRIC\nguidance.\nF-25\nTable of Contents\nArqit Quantum Inc.\nNotes to the Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the year ended 30 September 2023\nAlthough, the reverse acquisition is not a business combination, the Company has become a legal parent and is required to apply IFRS 10 and prepare\nconsolidated financial statements. The Directors accounted for the transaction by applying reverse acquisition methodology, but rather than recognising\ngoodwill, the difference between the equity value given up by the AL shareholders and the share of the fair value of net assets gained by the AL\nshareholders is charged to the statement of profit or loss as a share based payment charge (the deemed acquisition cost), and represents in substance, the\ncost of acquiring a NASDAQ quoted listing. In accordance with reverse acquisition accounting principles, these consolidated financial statements represent\na continuation of the financial statements of AL and include:\na) The assets and liabilities of AL at their pre-acquisition carrying amounts and the results for both years; and\nb) The assets and liabilities of the Company as at September 3,2021, and its results from September 3, 2021 to September 30, 2021. Included in group\nprofit/ (loss) for was a loss of $651,973 generated by the Company for the period September 3, 2021 to September 30, 2021.\nOn September 3, 2021 the Company issued 90,000,000 ordinary shares to acquire 1,954,174 shares of AL. However, as AL is determined to be the\naccounting acquirer, the fair value of the shares deemed to have been issued by AL to acquire the Company is determined as $223,517,945.\nThe fair value is based on an enterprise valuation of Arqit Limited using a market approach. The number of shares deemed issued by Arqit Limited to Arqit\nQuantum Inc. is 485,326 and represents the number of shares that would need to be issued to acquire the same percentage equity interest in the combined\nentity that results from the reverse acquisition. The fair value of Arqit Limited shares deemed issued at September 3, 2021 was determined using the\nfollowing level 3 fair value inputs:\nValuation\nFair value technique Unobservable input Range\n485,326 Ordinary Shares in Arqit Limited\ndeemed issues in reverse acquisition $ 223,517,945 Market comparable companies Revenue multiple 12-17 x\nEBITDA multiple 20-30 x\nuFCF multiple 20-25 x\nRevenue growth rate (CAGR) 9.1 %\nDiscount 20 %\nThe fair value of net assets of Arqit Quantum Inc at September 3, 2021 was $68,049,006 as follows:\n$\nCash and cash equivalents 107,035,478\nTrade and other receivables 1,961,889\nWarrant liabilities (29,948,361)\nTrade and other payables (11,000,000)\nNet assets 68,049,006\nDue to the short-term nature of cash and cash equivalents and trade and other payables, the carrying value approximated the fair value at September 3,\n2021.\nThe fair value of the Company warrants was based on a binomial tree valuation approach, reflecting the contractual exercise period, warrant price,\nredemption provisions, and prevailing market data as at the Valuation Dates. This technique was used based on the terms of the warrants. In the case of the\nPrivate Warrants, a discount for lack of marketability (“DLOM”) was applied since these may only be transferred to a specified group of permitted\ntransferees, therefore limiting the depth of the market.\nThe difference between the deemed cost and the fair value of the net assets acquired therefore amounted to $55,459,939 and was expensed in accordance\nwith IFRS 2 as the deemed reverse acquisition cost to profit or loss.\nF-26\nTable of Contents\nArqit Quantum Inc.\nNotes to the Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the year ended 30 September 2023\nAny transaction costs associated with the issuing of shares were deducted directly from equity. Mixed costs that relate to both share issuance and listing on\nthe stock exchange were apportioned based on the number of new shares issued to the total shares. $16,914,223 was directly attributable to the share\nissuance and deducted from equity.\nOther reserves arose as a result of the reverse acquisition:\n$\nPre-acquisition losses of AQI (18,237,443)\nPre-acquisition reserves of AQI 26,285,329\nAL share capital at acquisition 269\nAL share premium at acquisition 20,210,904\nReverse acquisition expense 155,459,939\nTransaction costs (16,914,223)\n166,804,775\nIncluded in Group profit/ (loss) for the year is a loss of $651,973 generated by the Company (accounting acquiree) for the period September 3, 2021 to\nSeptember 30, 2021.\nAs additional consideration for the shares in AL, earnout shares may be granted if an earnout condition is met. The earnout condition being if at any time\nduring the three years following the share acquisition closing date, the closing price of the ordinary shares of the Company during such period is equal to or\nexceeds $12.50 per share for any twenty trading days during a thirty consecutive trading day period, the Company will issue to the original shareholders of\nAL their pro rata portion of the earnout shares being 10,000,000 additional AQI shares.

Following that announcement, the group initiated\na partner search process to consider wholesale capacity sales or joint ventures, and received indications that an outright sale of the business might be viable.\nAs a result, Arqit retained an adviser in May 2023 to assist in the process pursuing the sale of its satellite division amongst other potential transactions. The\nsatellite division consists of satellite assets under construction, patents, customer contracts and an engineering team.\nF-30\nTable of Contents\nArqit Quantum Inc.\nNotes to the Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the year ended 30 September 2023\n(ii) Assets and liabilities held for sale\nThe following major classes of assets and liabilities relating to these operations have been classified as held for sale in the consolidated statement of\nfinancial position as at 30 September:\n2023 2022 2021\n$'000 $'000 $'000\nProperty, plant and equipment — — —\nInvestment property — — —\nIntangible assets 38,677 — —\nTrade and other receivables — — —\nOther financial assets — — —\nAssets held for sale 38,677 — —\nDeferred government grants 5,869 — —\nEmployee benefits — — —\nOther financial liabilities — — —\nLiabilities held for sale 5,869 — —\nThe impact on the statement of comprehensive income is as below:\n2023 2022 2021\n$'000 $'000 $'000\nOther operating income 4,986 12,843 —\nAdministrative expenses (1,471) (1,176) —\nProfit from discontinued operations 3,515 11,667 —\nThe net cash flows associated with the discontinued operations are as follow:\n2023 2022 2021\n$'000 $'000 $'000\nNet cash used in operating activities 4,986 12,843 —\nNet cash used in investing activities (12,438) (25,021) (8,881)\nNet cash used in financing activities 1,316 2,161 2,459\nNet cash flows for the year (6,136) (10,017) (6,422)\nNet cash flow of the assets held for sale is indicative of the cash investment Arqit made in developing the quantum satellite.\nF-31\nTable of Contents\nArqit Quantum Inc.\nNotes to the Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the year ended 30 September 2023\n14.

Warrants\nWarrant liabilities\nWarrants in connection with the Business Combination are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss. The warrants are valued at\nthe acquisition date September 3, 2021, for the purpose of determining the deemed acquisition cost. At this date, Arqit Limited (accounting acquiree)\nacquired all the assets and liabilities of the Company at their fair value. A further valuation of the warrants is performed at September 30, 2022, and 2023\nfor the year end.\nThe key terms of the warrants are:\nWarrant exercise\nWarrants are exercisable:\n− In the period from 8 February 2022 (“First Exercise Date”), being the later of one year from the closing of Centricus’ the\nInitial\nPublic Offering or 30 days after the Business Combination;\n− to 3 September 2026 (“Expiry Date”), being the date five years after the Business Combination (“the Exercise Period”); and\n− in exchange for one ordinary AQI Share (NASDAQ: ARQQ) (“Share”) for a price of $11.50 (“Exercise Price”).\nPublic warrant redemption\nThe following terms apply to Public Warrants only:\n− AQI may redeem the Public Warrants in whole and not in part during the Exercise Period for $0.10 per Warrant if the Shares trade at or above\n$10.00 but less than $18.00 per share for a 20 out of 30 trading day period ending three trading days before the Company sends the notice of\nredemption to the warrant holders; and\n− AQI may redeem the Public Warrants in whole and not in part during the Exercise Period for $0.01 per Warrant if the Shares trade above $18.00\nfor a 20 out of 30 trading day period ending three trading days before the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders.\nPrivate warrant redemption\nThe following terms apply to Private Warrants only:\n− AQI may redeem the Private Warrants in whole and not in part during the Exercise Period for $0.10 per Warrant if the Shares trade at or above\n$10.00 but less than $18.00 per share for a 20 out of 30 trading day period ending three trading days before the Company sends the notice of\nredemption to the warrant holders.\n− AQI may not redeem the Private Warrants in whole and not in part if the Shares trade above $18.00; and\n− Private Warrant holders may not transfer their warrants to any party not defined as a permitted transferee.\nExercise after redemption notice\nThe Company is required to provide investors with 30 days’ notice of intention to redeem the Warrants (the “Redemption Notice Period”).\nDuring the Redemption Notice Period, warrant holders may elect to exercise their Warrants on a cash basis (i.e. by paying the Exercise Price of $11.50 for a\nShare).\nF-35\nTable of Contents\nArqit Quantum Inc.\nNotes to the Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the year ended 30 September 2023\nIf redemption is triggered by the Shares trading between $10.00 and $18.00 per share, warrant holders may elect for a “Make Whole Exercise” in exchange\nfor a pre-determined number of Shares on a cashless basis. The number of Make Whole shares is determined on the basis of:\n(1) the 10-day volume-weighted average price of the Shares in the 10 trading days following the notice of redemption, and\n(2) the number of months elapsed since the business combination.\nIFRS 13 Fair Value prescribes a fair value hierarchy made up of 3 levels of inputs based on the reliability of the underlying data used in establishing the fair\nvalue. Public warrant liabilities at fair value through profit and loss are level 2 instruments. Level 2 of the hierarchy includes instruments that are not traded\nin an active market and is determined using valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on entity-\nspecific estimates. Private warrant liabilities are classified as level 3 instruments. The fair value is determined using the fair value of the public warrants,\nadjusted for a lack of marketability discount because these warrants may only be transferred to a specified group of permitted transferees, therefore limiting\nthe depth of the market (refer to note 25). The key inputs into the Binomial Option Pricing Model were as follows: dividend yield (nil %), volatility (45%)\nand risk-free rate (4.16%). Volatility was calculated using a set of comparable companies.\nNumber of Number of Fair value of\nPrivate Public warrant\nwarrants warrants liability\n$'000\nAt date of acquisition (3 September 2021) 6,266,667 8,624,973 29,948\nChange in fair value — — 98,090\nBalance at 30 September 2021 6,266,667 8,624,973 128,038\nWarrants exercised — (1,852,736) —\nChange in fair value — — (117,394)\nBalance at 30 September 2022 6,266,667 6,772,237 10,644\nWarrants exercised — — —\nChange in fair value — — (10,638)\nBalance at 30 September 2023 6,266,667 6,772,237 6\nEquity settled registered direct warrants\nIn February 2023, Arqit entered into a securities purchase agreement with investors pursuant to which it sold1 0,000,000 ordinary shares, together with\nwarrants to purchase 7,500,000 ordinary shares at a combined purchase price of $2.00 per share and accompanying warrant.

The fair value of public warrants is determined using level 2 inputs. Level 2 of the hierarchy includes instruments that are not traded in an active\nmarket and is determined using valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on entity-specific\nestimates. Private warrants are classified as a level 3 financial instrument. The fair value is determined using the fair value of the public warrants, adjusted\nfor a lack of marketability discount of 7.5% because these warrants may only be transferred to a specified group of permitted transferees, therefore limiting\nthe depth of the market.\nFair value Fair value\nCarrying value Level 2 Level 3\n30 September 30 September 30 September\n$'000 2023 2023 2023\nWarrant liability 6 3 3\n6 3 3\nF-43\nTable of Contents\nArqit Quantum Inc.\nNotes to the Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the year ended 30 September 2023\nFair value Fair value\nCarrying value Level 2 Level 3\n30 September 30 September 30 September\n$'000 2022 2022 2022\nWarrant liability 10,644 5,756 4,888\n10,644 5,756 4,888\nMarket risk\nIt is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Group’s policy not to use or trade in derivative financial instruments. The Group’s financial\ninstruments comprise its cash and cash equivalents and various items such as trade debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations. The main\npurpose of the financial assets and liabilities is to provide finance for the Group’s operations in the period.\nInterest rate risk management\nThe Group would be exposed to interest rate risk if the Group borrows funds, when required, at variable interest rates. There is currently no exposure to\ninterest rate risk.\nCredit risk\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss where counterparties are not able to meet their obligations. Group policy is that surplus cash, when not used to repay\nborrowings, is placed on deposit with the Group’s main relationship banks and with other banks or money market funds based on a minimum credit rating\nof A3/A- and maximum exposure.\nThere is no significant concentration of risk to any single counterparty.\nManagement consider that the credit quality of the various receivables is good in respect of the amounts outstanding and therefore credit risk is considered\nto be low. There is no significant concentration of risk.\nThe carrying amount of financial assets, as detailed above, represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date assuming that any\nsecurity held has no value.\nHaving considered the Group’s exposure to bad debts and the probability of default by customers, no expected credit losses have been recognised in\naccordance with IFRS 9.\nForeign Exchange risk\nThe Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to Sterling\n(“£”) and Euro (“€”). The Group holds Sterling, US Dollar and Euro bank accounts in order to limit its exposure.\nThe Group is also exposed to foreign exchange risk to the extent that its ultimate parent entity has a US dollar functional currency. This is limited to the\nparent consolidated accounts.\nF-44\nTable of Contents\nArqit Quantum Inc.\nNotes to the Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the year ended 30 September 2023\nThe table below summarises the FX exposure on the net monetary position of each group entity against its respective functional currency, expressed in the\ngroup’s presentation currency.\nYear ended 30/09/2023 £'000\nParent —\nUK subsidiary 117,530\nTotal 117,530\nThe reasonable shifts in exchange rates below are based on historic volatility.\nIf the $/£ rates moved by +/- 11.39% then the effect on profit would be as follows:\nYear ended 30/09/2023 $'000\nReasonable shift (11.39)%\nTotal effect on Loss of +ve movements (13,388)\nTotal effect on Loss of -ve movements 13,388\nLiquidity risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group does not have sufficient financial resources available to meet its obligations as they fall due. The Group manages\nliquidity risk by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, matching the expected cash flow timings of financial assets and liabilities with the\nuse of cash and cash equivalents, borrowings, overdrafts and committed revolving credit facilities with a minimum of 12 months to maturity.\nFuture borrowing requirements are forecast on a monthly basis and funding headroom is maintained above forecast peak requirements to meet unforeseen\nevents.\nThe maturity profile of the anticipated future cash flows including interest, using the latest applicable relevant rate, based on the earliest date on which the\nGroup can be required to pay financial liabilities on an undiscounted basis, is as follows:\nTrade and Deferred Lease\n2023 other government Liabilities\n$'000 payables grants Total\nOn demand — — — —\nWithin one year 18,831 — 2,118 20,949\nMore than one year but less than two years — — 2,307 2,307\nMore than two year but less than five years — 24 3,977 4,001\nMore than five years — — — —\n18,831 24 8,402 27,257\nTrade and Deferred Lease\n2022 other government Liabilities\n$'000 payables grants Total\nOn demand — — — —\nWithin one year 22,655 — 1,154 23,809\nMore than one year but less than two years — — 1,760 1,760\nMore than two year but less than five years — 4,183 3,767 7,950\nMore than five years — — — —\n22,655 4,183 6,681 33,519\nF-45\nTable of Contents\nArqit Quantum Inc.\nNotes to the Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the year ended 30 September 2023\nTrade and Deferred\n2021 other government Convertible\n$'000 payables grants Loans loan notes Total\nOn demand — — — — —\nWithin one year 17,069 — — — 17,069\nMore than one year but less than two years — — — — —\nMore than two year but less than five years — 2,459 — — 2,459\nMore than five years — — — — —\n17,069 2,459 — — 19,528\n27.

This description is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the Articles and the forms of the warrants described\nherein. Unless otherwise stated or unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “the Company”, “we,” “us,” “our,” and “ours”\nrefer to Arqit Quantum Inc.\nGeneral\nThe Company is a Cayman Islands exempted company (company number 374857) and its affairs are governed by the Articles,\nthe Companies Act (As Revised) of the Cayman Islands, as may be amended from time to time (the “Cayman Companies Act”), and\nthe common law of the Cayman Islands.\nShare Capital\nThe Company is authorized to issue 469,000,001 ordinary shares, $0.0001 par value each and 30,999,999 preference shares,\n$0.0001 par value each.\nOrdinary Shares\nHolders of ordinary shares are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters to be voted on by shareholders.\nThere is no cumulative voting with respect to the election of directors, with the result that the holders of more than 50% of the\nshares voted for the election of directors can elect all of the directors.\nHolders of ordinary shares do not have any conversion, preemptive or other subscription rights and there is no sinking fund or\nredemption provisions applicable to the ordinary shares.\nDividends\nSubject to the foregoing, the payment of cash dividends in the future, if any, will be at the discretion of the board of directors\nand will depend upon such factors as earnings levels, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, the Company’s overall financial\ncondition, available distributable reserves and any other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors.\nLiquidation\nOn a winding-up or other return of capital, subject to any special rights attaching to any other class of shares, holders of\nordinary shares will be entitled to participate in any surplus assets in proportion to their shareholdings.\nDifferences in Company Law\nCayman Islands companies are governed by the Cayman Companies Act. The Cayman Companies Act is modelled on English\nLaw but does not follow recent English Law statutory enactments, and differs from laws applicable to United States corporations and\ntheir shareholders. Set forth below is a summary of the material differences between the provisions of the Cayman Companies Act\napplicable to the Company and the laws applicable to companies incorporated in the United States and their shareholders.\nMergers and Similar Arrangements\nIn certain circumstances, the Cayman Companies Act allows for mergers or consolidations between two Cayman Islands\ncompanies, or between a Cayman Islands exempted company and a company incorporated in another jurisdiction (provided that is\nfacilitated by the laws of that other jurisdiction).\nWhere the merger or consolidation is between two Cayman Islands companies, the directors of each company must approve a\nwritten plan of merger or consolidation containing certain prescribed information. That plan or merger or consolidation must then be\nauthorized by either (a) a special resolution (usually a majority of two thirds of the voting shares voted at a general meeting) of the\nshareholders of each company; and (b) such other authorization, if any, as may be specified in such constituent company’s articles of\nassociation. No shareholder resolution is required for a merger between a parent company (i.e., a company that owns at least 90% of\nthe issued shares of each class in a subsidiary company) and its subsidiary company.\nThe consent of each holder of a fixed or floating security interest of a constituent company must be obtained, unless the court\nwaives such requirement. If the Registrar of Companies of the Cayman Islands is satisfied that the requirements of the Cayman\nCompanies Act (which includes certain other formalities) have been complied with, the Registrar of Companies of the Cayman\nIslands will register the plan of merger or consolidation.\nWhere the merger or consolidation involves a foreign company, the procedure is similar, save that with respect to the foreign\ncompany, the directors of the Cayman Islands exempted company are required to make a declaration to the effect that, having made\ndue enquiry, they are of the opinion that the requirements set out below have been met: (i) that the merger or consolidation is\npermitted or not prohibited by the constitutional documents of the foreign company and by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the\nforeign company is incorporated, and that those laws and any requirements of those constitutional documents have been or will be\ncomplied with; (ii) that no petition or other similar proceeding has been filed and remains outstanding or order made or resolution\nadopted to wind up or liquidate the foreign company in any jurisdictions; (iii) that no receiver, trustee, administrator or other similar\nperson has been appointed in any jurisdiction and is acting in respect of the foreign company, its affairs or its property or any part\nthereof; and (iv) that no scheme, order, compromise or other similar arrangement has been entered into or made in any jurisdiction\nwhereby the rights of creditors of the foreign company are and continue to be suspended or restricted.\nWhere the surviving company is the Cayman Islands exempted company, the directors of the Cayman Islands exempted\ncompany are further required to make a declaration to the effect that, having made due enquiry, they are of the opinion that the\nrequirements set out below have been met: (i) that the foreign company is able to pay its debts as they fall due and that the merger or\nconsolidation is bona fide and not intended to defraud unsecured creditors of the foreign company; (ii) that in respect of the transfer\nof any security interest granted by the foreign company to the surviving or consolidated company (a) consent or approval to the\ntransfer has been obtained, released or waived; (b) the transfer is permitted by and has been approved in accordance with the\nconstitutional documents of the foreign company; and (c) the laws of the jurisdiction of the foreign company with respect to the\ntransfer have been or will be complied with; (iii) that the foreign company will, upon the merger or consolidation becoming effective,\ncease to be incorporated, registered or exist under the laws of the relevant foreign jurisdiction; and (iv) that there is no other reason\nwhy it would be against the public interest to permit the merger or consolidation.\nWhere the above procedures are adopted, the Cayman Companies Act provides for a right of dissenting shareholders to be\npaid a payment of the fair value of their shares upon their dissenting to the merger or consolidation if they follow a prescribed\nprocedure. In essence, that procedure is as follows: (a) the shareholder must give his written objection to the merger or consolidation\nto the constituent company before the vote on the merger or consolidation, including a statement that the shareholder proposes to\ndemand payment for his shares if the merger or consolidation is authorized by the vote; (b) within 20 days following the date on\nwhich the merger or consolidation is approved by the shareholders, the constituent company must give written notice to each\nshareholder who made a written objection; (c) a shareholder must within 20 days following receipt of such notice from the\nconstituent company, give the constituent company a written notice of his intention to dissent including, among other details, a\ndemand for payment of the fair value of his shares; (d) within seven days following the date of the expiration of the period set out in\nparagraph (b) above or seven days following the date on which the plan of merger or consolidation is filed, whichever is later, the\nconstituent company, the surviving company or the consolidated company must make a written offer to each dissenting shareholder to\n2\npurchase his shares at a price that the company determines is the fair value and if the company and the shareholder agree the price\nwithin 30 days following the date on which the offer was made, the company must pay the shareholder such amount; and (e) if the\ncompany and the shareholder fail to agree a price within such 30 day period, within 20 days following the date on which such 30 day\nperiod expires, the company (and any dissenting shareholder) must file a petition with the Cayman Islands courts to determine the fair\nvalue and such petition must be accompanied by a list of the names and addresses of the dissenting shareholders with whom\nagreements as to the fair value of their shares have not been reached by the company. At the hearing of that petition, the court has the\npower to determine the fair value of the shares together with a fair rate of interest, if any, to be paid by the company upon the amount\ndetermined to be the fair value. Any dissenting shareholder whose name appears on the list filed by the company may participate fully\nin all proceedings until the determination of fair value is reached. These rights of a dissenting shareholder are not available in certain\ncircumstances, for example, to dissenters holding shares of any class in respect of which an open market exists on a recognized stock\nexchange or recognized interdealer quotation system at the relevant date or where the consideration for such shares to be contributed\nare shares of any company listed on a national securities exchange or shares of the surviving or consolidated company.\nMoreover, Cayman Islands law has separate statutory provisions that facilitate the reconstruction or amalgamation of\ncompanies in certain circumstances, schemes of arrangement will generally be more suited for complex mergers or other transactions\ninvolving widely held companies, commonly referred to in the Cayman Islands as a “scheme of arrangement” which may be\ntantamount to a merger. In the event that a merger was sought pursuant to a scheme of arrangement (the procedures for which are\nmore rigorous and take longer to complete than the procedures typically required to consummate a merger in the United States), the\narrangement in question must be approved by a majority in number of each class of shareholders and creditors with whom the\narrangement is to be made and who must in addition represent three-fourths in value of each such class of shareholders or creditors,\nas the case may be, that are present and voting either in person or by proxy at an annual general meeting, or extraordinary general\nmeeting summoned for that purpose. The convening of the meetings and subsequently the terms of the arrangement must be\nsanctioned by the Cayman Islands courts. While a dissenting shareholder would have the right to express to the court the view that\nthe transaction should not be approved, the court can be expected to approve the arrangement if it satisfies itself that:\n● we are not proposing to act illegally or beyond the scope of our corporate authority and the statutory provisions as to\nmajority vote have been complied with;\n● the shareholders have been fairly represented at the meeting in question;\n● the arrangement is such as a businessman would reasonably approve; and\n● the arrangement is not one that would more properly be sanctioned under some other provision of the Cayman Companies\nAct or that would amount to a “fraud on the minority.”\n​If a scheme of arrangement or takeover offer (as described below) is approved, any dissenting shareholder would have no\nrights comparable to appraisal rights (providing rights to receive payment in cash for the judicially determined value of the shares),\nwhich would otherwise ordinarily be available to dissenting shareholders of United States corporations.\nSqueeze-out Provisions\nWhen a takeover offer is made and accepted by holders of 90% of the shares to whom the offer relates within four months, the\nofferor may, within a two-month period, require the holders of the remaining shares to transfer such shares on the terms of the offer.\nAn objection can be made to the Cayman Islands courts, but this is unlikely to succeed unless there is evidence of fraud, bad faith,\ncollusion or inequitable treatment of the shareholders.\n3\nFurther, transactions similar to a merger, reconstruction and/or an amalgamation may in some circumstances be achieved\nthrough means other than these statutory provisions, such as a share capital exchange, asset acquisition or control, or through\ncontractual arrangements of an operating business.\nShareholders’ Suits\nMaples and Calder (Cayman) LLP, our Cayman Islands legal counsel, is not aware of any reported class action having been\nbrought in a Cayman Islands court. Derivative actions have been brought in the Cayman Islands courts, and the Cayman Islands\ncourts have confirmed the availability for such actions. In most cases, we will be the proper plaintiff in any claim based on a breach\nof duty owed to us, and a claim against (for example) our officers or directors usually may not be brought by a shareholder. However,\nbased both on Cayman Islands authorities and on English authorities, which would in all likelihood be of persuasive authority and be\napplied by a court in the Cayman Islands, exceptions to the foregoing principle apply in circumstances in which:\n● a company is acting, or proposing to act, illegally or beyond the scope of its authority;\n● the act complained of, although not beyond the scope of the authority, could be effected if duly authorized by more than the\nnumber of votes which have actually been obtained; or\n● those who control the company are perpetrating a “fraud on the minority.”\n​A shareholder may have a direct right of action against us where the individual rights of that shareholder have been infringed\nor are about to be infringed.\nEnforcement of Civil Liabilities\nThe Cayman Islands has a different body of securities laws as compared to the United States and provides less protection to\ninvestors. Additionally, Cayman Islands companies may not have standing to sue before the Federal courts of the United States.\nWe have been advised by Maples and Calder (Cayman) LLP, our Cayman Islands legal counsel, that the courts of the Cayman\nIslands are unlikely (i) to recognize or enforce against us judgments of courts of the United States predicated upon the civil liability\nprovisions of the federal securities laws of the United States or any state; and (ii) in original actions brought in the Cayman Islands, to\nimpose liabilities against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States or any\nstate, so far as the liabilities imposed by those provisions are penal in nature. In those circumstances, although there is no statutory\nenforcement in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in the United States, the courts of the Cayman Islands will recognize and\nenforce a foreign money judgment of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction without retrial on the merits based on the principle that\na judgment of a competent foreign court imposes upon the judgment debtor an obligation to pay the sum for which judgment has been\ngiven provided certain conditions are met. For a foreign judgment to be enforced in the Cayman Islands, such judgment must be final\nand conclusive and for a liquidated sum, and must not be in respect of taxes or a fine or penalty, inconsistent with a Cayman Islands\njudgment in respect of the same matter, impeachable on the grounds of fraud or obtained in a manner, or be of a kind the enforcement\nof which is, contrary to natural justice or the public policy of the Cayman Islands (awards of punitive or multiple damages may well\nbe held to be contrary to public policy). A Cayman Islands court may stay enforcement proceedings if concurrent proceedings are\nbeing brought elsewhere.\nSpecial Considerations for Exempted Companies\nWe are an exempted company with limited liability under the Cayman Companies Act. The Cayman Companies Act\ndistinguishes between ordinary resident companies and exempted companies. Any\n4\ncompany that is registered in the Cayman Islands but conducts business mainly outside of the Cayman Islands may apply to be\nregistered as an exempted company. The requirements for an exempted company are essentially the same as for an ordinary company\nexcept for the exemptions and privileges listed below:\n● an exempted company does not have to file an annual return of its shareholders with the Registrar of Companies of the\nCayman Islands;\n● an exempted company’s register of members is not open to inspection;\n● an exempted company does not have to hold an annual general meeting;\n● an exempted company may issue shares with no par value;\n● an exempted company may obtain an undertaking against the imposition of any future taxation (such undertakings are\nusually given for 20 years in the first instance);\n● an exempted company may register by way of continuation in another jurisdiction and be deregistered in the Cayman\nIslands;\n● an exempted company may register as a limited duration company; and\n● an exempted company may register as a segregated portfolio company.\n“Limited liability” means that the liability of each shareholder is limited to the amount unpaid by the shareholder on the shares\nof the company (except in exceptional circumstances, such as involving fraud, the establishment of an agency relationship or an\nillegal or improper purpose or other circumstances in which a court may be prepared to pierce or lift the corporate veil).\nIndemnification of Directors and Executive Officers and Limitation of Liability\nCayman Islands law does not limit the extent to which a company’s articles of association may provide for indemnification of\nofficers and directors, except to the extent any such provision may be held by the Cayman Islands courts to be contrary to public\npolicy, such as to provide indemnification against willful default, willful neglect, civil fraud or the consequences of committing a\ncrime. The Articles permit indemnification of officers and directors for any liability, action, proceeding, claim, demand, costs\ndamages or expenses, including legal expenses, incurred in their capacities as such unless such liability (if any) arises from actual\nfraud, willful neglect or willful default which may attach to such directors or officers. This standard of conduct is generally the same\nas permitted under the Delaware General Corporation Law for a Delaware corporation. In addition, we have entered into\nindemnification agreements with our directors and senior executive officers that provide such persons with additional indemnification\nbeyond that provided in the Articles.\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers or persons\ncontrolling us under the foregoing provisions, we have been informed that, in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against\npublic policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.\nAnti-Takeover Provisions in the Articles\nSome provisions of the Articles may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or management that\nshareholders may consider favorable, including a provision that authorizes our board of directors to issue preference shares in one or\nmore series and to designate the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of such preference shares without any further\nvote or action by our shareholders.\n5\nSuch shares could be issued quickly with terms calculated to delay or prevent a change in control of our company or make\nremoval of management more difficult. If our board of directors decides to issue these preference shares, the price of our ordinary\nshares may fall and the voting and other rights of the holders of our ordinary shares may be materially adversely affected.\nHowever, under Cayman Islands law, our directors may only exercise the rights and powers granted to them under the Articles\nfor a proper purpose and for what they believe in good faith to be in the best interests of our company.\nDirectors’ Fiduciary Duties\nUnder Delaware corporate law, a director of a Delaware corporation has a fiduciary duty to the corporation and its\nshareholders. This duty has two components: the duty of care and the duty of loyalty. The duty of care requires that a director act in\ngood faith, with the care that an ordinarily prudent person would exercise under similar circumstances. Under this duty, a director\nmust inform himself or herself of, and disclose to shareholders, all material information reasonably available regarding a significant\ntransaction. The duty of loyalty requires that a director act in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the\ncorporation. A director must not use his or her corporate position for personal gain or advantage. This duty prohibits self-dealing by a\ndirector and mandates that the best interest of the corporation and its shareholders take precedence over any interest possessed by a\ndirector, officer or controlling shareholder and not shared by the shareholders generally. In general, actions of a director are presumed\nto have been made on an informed basis, in good faith and in the honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the\ncorporation. However, this presumption may be rebutted by evidence of a breach of one of the fiduciary duties. Should such evidence\nbe presented concerning a transaction by a director, a director must prove the procedural fairness of the transaction, and that the\ntransaction was of fair value to the corporation.\nUnder Cayman Islands law, directors and officers owe the following fiduciary duties:\n● duty to act in good faith in what the director or officer believes to be in the best interests of the company as a whole;\n● duty to exercise powers for the purposes for which those powers were conferred and not for a collateral purpose;\n● directors should not improperly fetter the exercise of future discretion;\n● duty to exercise powers fairly as between different sections of shareholders;\n● duty not to put themselves in a position in which there is a conflict between their duty to the company and their personal\ninterests; and\n● duty to exercise independent judgment.\n​In addition to the above, directors also owe a duty of care which is not fiduciary in nature. This duty has been defined as a\nrequirement to act as a reasonably diligent person having both the general knowledge, skill and experience that may reasonably be\nexpected of a person carrying out the same functions as are carried out by that director in relation to the company and the general\nknowledge skill and experience of that director.\nAs set out above, directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position of conflict and this includes a duty not to engage in\nself-dealing, or to otherwise benefit as a result of their position. However, in some instances what would otherwise be a breach of this\nduty can be forgiven and/or authorized in advance by the shareholders provided that there is full disclosure by the directors. This can\nbe done by way\n6\nof permission granted in the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association or alternatively by shareholder approval\nat general meetings.\nShareholder Action by Written Consent\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, a corporation may eliminate the right of shareholders to act by written consent\nby amendment to its certificate of incorporation. The Articles provide that shareholders may approve corporate matters by way of a\nunanimous written resolution signed by or on behalf of each shareholder who would have been entitled to vote on such matter at a\ngeneral meeting without a meeting being held.\nShareholder Proposals\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, a shareholder has the right to put any proposal before the annual meeting of\nshareholders, provided it complies with the notice provisions in the governing documents. A special meeting may be called by the\nboard of directors or any other person authorized to do so in the governing documents, but shareholders may be precluded from\ncalling special meetings.\nThe Cayman Companies Act provides shareholders with only limited rights to requisition a general meeting and does not\nprovide shareholders with any right to put any proposal before a general meeting. However, these rights may be provided in a\ncompany’s articles of association. The Articles do not permit our shareholders to requisition either an annual general meeting or an\nextraordinary general meeting, or to put forth a proposal at a general meeting. As a Cayman Islands exempted company, we are not\nobliged by law to call annual general meetings.\nCumulative Voting\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, cumulative voting for elections of directors is not permitted unless the\ncorporation’s certificate of incorporation specifically provides for it. Cumulative voting potentially facilitates the representation of\nminority shareholders on a board of directors since it permits the minority shareholder to cast all the votes to which the shareholder is\nentitled on a single director, which increases the shareholder’s voting power with respect to electing such director. As permitted under\nCayman Islands law, the Articles do not provide for cumulative voting. As a result, our shareholders are not afforded any less\nprotections or rights on this issue than shareholders of a Delaware corporation.\nRemoval of Directors\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, a director of a corporation with a classified board may be removed only for\ncause with the approval of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares entitled to vote, unless the certificate of incorporation\nprovides otherwise. Under the Articles, directors may be removed only for cause by a special resolution (usually a majority of two\nthirds of the voting shares voted at a general meeting) of our shareholders. A director will also cease to be a director if he or she\n(i) becomes bankrupt or makes any arrangement or composition with his creditors; (ii) dies or is found to be or becomes of unsound\nmind; (iii) resigns his office by notice in writing; (iv) the director absents himself or herself (for the avoidance of doubt, without being\nrepresented by proxy) from three consecutive meetings of the board of directors without special leave of absence from the directors,\nand the directors pass a resolution that he or she has by reason of such absence vacated office; or (v) all of the other directors (being\nnot less than two in number) determine that he or she should be removed as a director for “Cause” ​(i.e., a conviction for a criminal\noffence involving dishonesty or engaging in conduct which brings a director or the Company into disrepute or which results in a\nmaterial financial detriment to the Company) (and not otherwise), either by a resolution passed by all of the other directors at a\nmeeting of the\n7\ndirectors duly convened and held in accordance with the Articles or by a resolution in writing signed by all of the other directors.\nTransactions with Interested Shareholders\nThe Delaware General Corporation Law contains a business combination statute applicable to Delaware corporations whereby,\nunless the corporation has specifically elected not to be governed by such statute under its certificate of incorporation, it is prohibited\nfrom engaging in certain business combinations with an “interested shareholder” for three years following the date that such person\nbecomes an interested shareholder. An interested shareholder generally is a person or a group who or which owns or owned 15% or\nmore of the target’s outstanding voting stock within the past three years. This has the effect of limiting the ability of a potential\nacquirer to make a two-tiered bid for the target in which all shareholders would not be treated equally. The statute does not apply if,\namong other things, prior to the date on which such shareholder becomes an interested shareholder, the board of directors approves\nthe transaction which resulted in the person becoming an interested shareholder. This encourages any potential acquirer of a\nDelaware corporation to negotiate the terms of any acquisition transaction with the target’s board of directors.\nCayman Islands law has no comparable statute. As a result, we cannot avail ourselves of the types of protections afforded by\nthe Delaware business combination statute. However, although Cayman Islands law does not regulate transactions between a\ncompany and its significant shareholders, it does provide that such transactions must be entered into bona fide in the best interests of\nthe company and for a proper corporate purpose and not with the effect of constituting a fraud on the minority shareholders.\nDissolution; Winding Up\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, unless the board of directors approves the proposal to dissolve, dissolution\nmust be approved by shareholders holding 100% of the total voting power of the corporation. Only if the dissolution is initiated by the\nboard of directors may it be approved by a simple majority of the corporation’s outstanding shares. Delaware law allows a Delaware\ncorporation to include in its certificate of incorporation a supermajority voting requirement in connection with dissolutions initiated\nby the board.\nUnder Cayman Islands law, a company may be wound up by either an order of the courts of the Cayman Islands or by a\nspecial resolution of its members or, if the company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due, by an ordinary resolution of its\nmembers. The court has authority to order winding up in a number of specified circumstances including where it is, in the opinion of\nthe court, just and equitable to do so.\nUnder the Articles, if the Company is wound up, the liquidator of our company may distribute the assets with the sanction of\nan ordinary resolution of the shareholders and any other sanction required by law.\nVariation of Rights of Shares\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, a corporation may vary the rights of a class of shares with the approval of a\nmajority of the outstanding shares of such class, unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise.\nUnder the Articles, if our share capital is divided into more than one class of shares, the rights attached to any such class may,\nwhether or not the Company is being wound up, be varied without the consent of the holders of the issued shares of that class where\nsuch variation is considered by the directors not to have a material adverse effect upon such rights; otherwise, any such variation shall\nbe made only with the consent in writing of the holders of not less than two thirds of the issued shares of that class or\n8\nwith the approval of a resolution passed by a majority of not less than two thirds of the votes cast at a separate meeting of the holders\nof the shares of that class.\nAmendment of Governing Documents\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, a corporation’s governing documents may be amended with the approval of a\nmajority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote on the matter, unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. As\npermitted by Cayman Islands law, the Articles may only be amended by a special resolution of the shareholders.\nRights of Non-Resident or Foreign Shareholders\nThere are no limitations imposed by the Articles on the rights of non-resident or foreign shareholders to hold or exercise voting\nrights on our shares. In addition, there are no provisions in the Articles governing the ownership threshold above which shareholder\nownership must be disclosed.\nDirectors’ Power to Issue Shares\nSubject to applicable law, our board of directors is empowered to issue or allot shares or grant options and warrants with or\nwithout preferred, deferred, or other rights or restrictions.\nInspection of Books\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, any shareholder of a corporation may for any proper purpose inspect or make\ncopies of the corporation’s stock ledger, list of shareholders and other books and records.\nHolders of our shares have no general right under Cayman Islands law to inspect or obtain copies of our register of members\nor our corporate records.\nDirectors\nAppointment and removal\nThe Directors are divided into three classes designated as Class I, Class II and Class III, respectively. Directors were assigned\nto each class in accordance with a resolution or resolutions adopted by the board of Directors. At the 2023 annual general meeting of\nthe Company, the term of office of the Class II Directors shall expire and Class II Directors shall be elected for a full term of\nthree years. At the 2024 annual general meeting of the Company, the term of office of the Class III Directors shall expire and\nClass III Directors shall be elected for a full term of three years. At the 2025 annual general meeting of the Company, the term of\noffice of the Class I Directors shall expire and Class I Directors shall be elected for a full term of three years. At each succeeding\nannual general meeting of the Company, Directors shall be elected for a full term of three years to succeed the Directors of the class\nwhose terms expire at such annual general meeting. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article, each Director shall hold\noffice until the expiration of his term, until his successor shall have been duly elected and qualified or until his or her earlier death,\nresignation or removal.\nThere is no cumulative voting with respect to the appointment of directors.\nAn ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who\nattend and vote at a general meeting of the company, is required to elect a director.\nThe office of a Director shall be vacated if all of the other Directors (being not less than two in number) determine that he or\nshe should be removed as a Director for Cause (and not otherwise) (as such\n9\nterm is defined in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association), either by a resolution passed by all of the other\nDirectors at a meeting of the Directors duly convened and held in accordance with the Articles or by a resolution in writing signed by\nall of the other Directors.\nWarrants\nBusiness Combination Warrants\nThis section “\u0000Business Combination Warrants” contains a description of the warrants issued by the Company in connection\nwith the business combination transaction completed on September 3, 2021 pursuant to which Centricus Acquisition Corp. merged\nwith and into Arqit Quantum Inc., with Arqit Quantum Inc. as the surviving entity, following which Arqit Quantum Inc. acquired all\nof the outstanding share capital of Arqit Limited, with Arqit Limited becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Arqit Quantum Inc.\nPublic Business Combination Warrants\nEach whole warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase one ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to\nadjustment as discussed below, which became exercisable on February 8, 2022 (one year after the closing of Centricus’ IPO).\nPursuant to the Warrant Agreement, a warrantholder may exercise its warrants only for a whole number of ordinary shares. This\nmeans only a whole warrant may be exercised at a given time by a warrantholder. The warrants will expire on September 3, 2026\n(five years after closing of the Business Combination), at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.\nWe will not be obligated to deliver any ordinary shares pursuant to the exercise of a warrant and will have no obligation to\nsettle such warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the ordinary shares underlying the\nwarrants is then effective and a prospectus relating thereto is current, subject to our satisfying our obligations described below with\nrespect to registration, or a valid exemption from registration is available. No warrant will be exercisable and we will not be obligated\nto issue an ordinary share upon exercise of a warrant unless the ordinary share issuable upon such warrant exercise has been\nregistered, qualified or deemed to be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the registered holder of the warrants.\nIn the event that the conditions in the two immediately preceding sentences are not satisfied with respect to a warrant, the holder of\nsuch warrant will not be entitled to exercise such warrant and such warrant may have no value and expire worthless. In no event will\nwe be required to net cash settle any warrant.\nWe have agreed we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of a registration statement for\nthe registration, under the Securities Act, of the ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus\nrelating to those ordinary shares until the warrants expire or are redeemed, as specified in the Warrant Agreement; provided that if\nour ordinary shares are at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that they satisfy the\ndefinition of a “covered security” under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, we may, at our option, require holders of public\nwarrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a “cashless basis” in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the\nevent we so elect, we will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, but we will use our commercially\nreasonable efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available. If a\nregistration statement covering the ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective by the 60th day after the\nclosing of the initial business combination, warrantholders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and\nduring any period when we will have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a “cashless basis” in\naccordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption, but we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to\nregister or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available. In such event, each holder\nwould pay the exercise price by surrendering the warrants for that number of ordinary shares equal to the lesser of (A) the quotient\nobtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of ordinary shares underlying the warrants, multiplied by the excess of the “fair\nmarket value” ​(defined\n10\nbelow) less the exercise price of the warrants by (y) the fair market value and (B) 0.361 per whole warrant. The “fair market value” as\nused in this paragraph shall mean the volume weighted average price of the ordinary shares for the 10 trading days ending on the\ntrading day prior to the date on which the notice of exercise is received by the warrant agent.\nNo fractional ordinary shares will be issued upon exercise. If, upon exercise, a holder would be entitled to receive a fractional\ninterest in a share, we will round down to the nearest whole number of the number of ordinary shares to be issued to the holder.\nA holder of a warrant may notify us in writing in the event it elects to be subject to a requirement that such holder will not have\nthe right to exercise such warrant, to the extent that after giving effect to such exercise, such person (together with such person’s\naffiliates), to the warrant agent’s actual knowledge, would beneficially own in excess of 4.9% or 9.8% (as specified by the holder) of\nthe ordinary shares issued and outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise.\nRedemption of warrants for cash when the price per ordinary share equals or exceeds $18.00. We may redeem the\noutstanding warrants (except as described herein with respect to the private placement warrants):\n● in whole and not in part;\n● at a price of $0.01 per warrant;\n● upon a minimum of 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption to each warrantholder; and\n● if, and only if, the closing price of the ordinary shares equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the\nnumber of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant as described under the heading “— Warrants —\nBusiness Combination Warrants—Public Business Combination Warrants — Anti-Dilution Adjustments”) for any 20 trading\ndays within a 30-trading day period ending three trading days before we send the notice of redemption to the warrantholders.\n​We will not redeem the warrants as described above unless a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the\nissuance of the ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is then effective and a current prospectus relating to those\nordinary shares is available throughout the 30-day redemption period. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may\nexercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state\nsecurities laws.\nWe have established the last of the redemption criteria discussed above to prevent a redemption call unless there is at the time\nof the call a significant premium to the warrant exercise price. If the foregoing conditions are satisfied and we issue a notice of\nredemption of the warrants, each warrantholder will be entitled to exercise his, her or its warrant prior to the scheduled redemption\ndate. However, the price of the ordinary shares may fall below the $18.00 redemption trigger price (as adjusted for adjustments to the\nnumber of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant as described under the heading “— Warrants — Business\nCombination Warrants—Public Business Combination Warrants — Anti-Dilution Adjustments”) as well as the $11.50 (for whole\nshares) warrant exercise price after the redemption notice is issued.\nRedemption of warrants for ordinary shares when the price per ordinary share equals or exceeds $10.00. We may redeem the\noutstanding warrants:\n● in whole and not in part;\n11\n● at $0.10 per warrant upon a minimum of 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption provided that holders will be able to\nexercise their warrants on a cashless basis prior to redemption and receive that number of shares determined by reference to\nthe table below, based on the redemption date and the “fair market value” of our ordinary shares (as defined below) except as\notherwise described below;\n● if, and only if, the closing price of our ordinary shares equals or exceeds $10.00 per public share (as adjusted for adjustments\nto the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant as described under the heading “—\nWarrants — Business Combination Warrants—Public Business Combination Warrants — Anti-Dilution Adjustments”) for\nany 20 trading days within the 30-trading day period ending three trading days before we send the notice of redemption to\nthe warrantholders; and\n● if the closing price of the ordinary shares for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending on the third trading\nday prior to the date on which we send the notice of redemption to the warrantholders is less than $18.00 per share (as\nadjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant as described under\nthe heading “— Warrants — Business Combination Warrants—Public Business Combination Warrants — Anti-Dilution\nAdjustments”), the private placement warrants must also be concurrently called for redemption on the same terms as the\noutstanding public warrants, as described above.\nBeginning on the date the notice of redemption is given until the warrants are redeemed or exercised, holders may elect to\nexercise their warrants on a cashless basis. The numbers in the table below represent the number of ordinary shares that a\nwarrantholder will receive upon such cashless exercise in connection with a redemption by us pursuant to this redemption feature,\nbased on the “fair market value” of our ordinary shares on the corresponding redemption date (assuming holders elect to exercise\ntheir warrants and such warrants are not redeemed for $0.10 per warrant), determined for these purposes based on volume weighted\naverage price of our ordinary shares during the 10 trading days immediately following the date on which the notice of redemption is\nsent to the holders of warrants, and the number of months that the corresponding redemption date precedes the expiration date of the\nwarrants, each as set forth in the table below. We will provide our warrantholders with the final fair market value no later than one\nbusiness day after the 10-trading day period described above ends.\nThe share prices set forth in the column headings of the table below will be adjusted as of any date on which the number of\nshares issuable upon exercise of a warrant or the exercise price of a warrant is adjusted as set forth under the heading “— Anti-\nDilution Adjustments” below. If the number of shares issuable upon exercise of a warrant is adjusted, the adjusted share prices in the\ncolumn headings will equal the share prices immediately prior to such adjustment, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is\nthe exercise price of the warrant after such adjustment and the denominator of which is the price of the warrant immediately prior to\nsuch adjustment. In such an event, the number of shares in the table below shall be adjusted by multiplying such share amounts by a\nfraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares deliverable upon exercise of a warrant immediately prior to such adjustment\nand the denominator of which is the number of shares deliverable upon exercise of a warrant as so adjusted.

For an example\nwhere the exact fair market value and redemption date are not as set forth in the table above, if the volume weighted average price of\nour ordinary shares during the 10 trading days immediately following the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders\nof the warrants is $13.50 per share, and at such time there are 38 months until the expiration of the warrants, holders may choose to,\nin connection with this redemption feature, exercise their warrants for 0.298 ordinary shares for each whole warrant. In no event will\nthe warrants be exercisable on a cashless basis in connection with this redemption feature for more than 0.361 ordinary shares per\nwarrant (subject to adjustment). Finally, as reflected in the table above, if the warrants are out of the money and about to expire, they\ncannot be exercised on a cashless basis in connection with a redemption by us pursuant to this redemption feature, since they will not\nbe exercisable for any ordinary shares.\nThis redemption feature differs from the typical warrant redemption features used in some other blank check offerings, which\nonly provide for a redemption of warrants for cash (other than the private placement warrants) when the trading price for the ordinary\nshares exceeds $18.00 per share for a specified period of time. This redemption feature is structured to allow for all of the outstanding\nwarrants to be redeemed when the ordinary shares are trading at or above $10.00 per public share, which may be at a time when the\ntrading price of our ordinary shares is below the exercise price of the warrants. We have established this redemption feature to\nprovide us with the flexibility to redeem the warrants without the warrants having to reach the $18.00 per share threshold set forth\nabove under “— Redemption of warrants for cash when the price per ordinary share equals or exceeds $18.00.” Holders choosing to\nexercise their warrants in connection with a redemption pursuant to this feature will, in effect, receive a number of shares for their\nwarrants based on an option pricing model with a fixed volatility input as of the date of filing of this exhibit. This redemption right\nprovides us with an additional mechanism by which to redeem all of the outstanding warrants, and therefore have certainty as to our\ncapital structure as the warrants would no longer be outstanding and would have been exercised or redeemed. We will be required to\npay the applicable redemption price to warrantholders if we choose to exercise this redemption right and it will allow us to quickly\nproceed with a redemption of the warrants if we determine it is in our best interest to do so. As such, we would redeem the warrants in\nthis manner when we believe it is in our best interest to update our capital structure to remove the warrants and pay the redemption\nprice to the warrantholders.\nAs stated above, we can redeem the warrants when the ordinary shares are trading at a price starting at $10.00, which is below\nthe exercise price of $11.50, because it will provide certainty with respect to our capital structure and cash position while providing\nwarrantholders with the opportunity to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis for the applicable number of shares. If we choose to\nredeem the warrants when the ordinary shares are trading at a price below the exercise price of the warrants, this could result in the\nwarrantholders receiving fewer ordinary shares than they would have received if they had chosen to wait to exercise their warrants\nfor ordinary shares if and when such ordinary shares were trading at a price higher than the exercise price of $11.50.\nAnti-Dilution Adjustments. If the number of outstanding ordinary shares is increased by a capitalization or share dividend\npayable in ordinary shares, or by a split-up of ordinary shares or other similar event, then, on the effective date of such capitalization\nor share dividend, split-up or similar event, the number of ordinary shares issuable on exercise of each warrant will be increased in\nproportion to such increase in the outstanding ordinary shares. A rights offering made to all or substantially all holders of ordinary\nshares entitling holders to purchase ordinary shares at a price less than the “historical fair market value” ​(as defined below) will be\ndeemed a share dividend of a number of ordinary shares equal to the product of (i) the number of ordinary shares actually sold in\nsuch rights offering (or issuable under any other equity securities sold in such rights offering that are convertible into or exercisable\nfor ordinary shares) and (ii) one minus the quotient of (x) the price per ordinary share paid in such rights offering and (y) the\nhistorical fair market value. For these purposes, (i) if the rights offering is for securities convertible into or exercisable for ordinary\nshares, in determining the price payable for ordinary shares, there will be taken into account any consideration received for such\nrights, as well as any additional amount payable upon exercise or conversion and (ii) “historical fair market value” means the volume\nweighted average price of ordinary shares as reported during the 10 trading day period ending on the trading day prior to the\n14\nfirst date on which the ordinary shares trade on the applicable exchange or in the applicable market, regular way, without the right to\nreceive such rights.\nIn addition, if we, at any time while the warrants are outstanding and unexpired, pay a dividend or make a distribution in cash,\nsecurities or other assets to all or substantially all of the holders of the ordinary shares on account of such ordinary shares (or other\nsecurities into which the warrants are convertible), other than (a) as described above or (b) any cash dividends or cash distributions\nwhich, when combined on a per share basis with all other cash dividends and cash distributions paid on the ordinary shares during the\n365-day period ending on the date of declaration of such dividend or distribution does not exceed $0.50 (as adjusted to appropriately\nreflect any other adjustments and excluding cash dividends or cash distributions that resulted in an adjustment to the exercise price or\nto the number of ordinary shares issuable on exercise of each warrant) but only with respect to the amount of the aggregate cash\ndividends or cash distributions equal to or less than $0.50 per share, then the warrant exercise price will be decreased, effective\nimmediately after the effective date of such event, by the amount of cash and/or the fair market value of any securities or other assets\npaid on each ordinary share in respect of such event.\nIf the number of outstanding ordinary shares is decreased by a consolidation, combination, reverse share sub-division or\nreclassification of ordinary shares or other similar event, then, on the effective date of such consolidation, combination, reverse share\nsub-division, reclassification or similar event, the number of ordinary shares issuable on exercise of each warrant will be decreased in\nproportion to such decrease in outstanding ordinary shares.\nWhenever the number of ordinary shares purchasable upon the exercise of the warrants is adjusted, as described above, the\nwarrant exercise price will be adjusted by multiplying the warrant exercise price immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction\n(x) the numerator of which will be the number of ordinary shares purchasable upon the exercise of the warrants immediately prior to\nsuch adjustment and (y) the denominator of which will be the number of ordinary shares so purchasable immediately thereafter.\nIn case of any reclassification or reorganization of the outstanding ordinary shares (other than those described above or that\nsolely affects the par value of such ordinary shares), or in the case of any merger or consolidation of us with or into another\ncorporation (other than a consolidation or merger in which we are the continuing corporation and that does not result in any\nreclassification or reorganization of our outstanding ordinary shares), or in the case of any sale or conveyance to another corporation\nor entity of the assets or other property of us as an entirety or substantially as an entirety in connection with which we are dissolved,\nthe holders of the warrants will thereafter have the right to purchase and receive, upon the basis and upon the terms and conditions\nspecified in the warrants and in lieu of the ordinary shares immediately theretofore purchasable and receivable upon the exercise of\nthe rights represented thereby, the kind and amount of ordinary shares or other securities or property (including cash) receivable upon\nsuch reclassification, reorganization, merger or consolidation, or upon a dissolution following any such sale or transfer, that the\nholder of the warrants would have received if such holder had exercised their warrants immediately prior to such event. However, if\nsuch holders were entitled to exercise a right of election as to the kind or amount of securities, cash or other assets receivable upon\nsuch consolidation or merger, then the kind and amount of securities, cash or other assets for which each warrant will become\nexercisable will be deemed to be the weighted average of the kind and amount received per share by such holders in such\nconsolidation or merger that affirmatively make such election, and if a tender, exchange or redemption offer has been made to and\naccepted by such holders (other than a tender, exchange or redemption offer made by the company in connection with redemption\nrights held by shareholders of the company as provided for in the company’s amended and restated memorandum and articles of\nassociation or as a result of the redemption of ordinary shares by the company if a proposed initial business combination is presented\nto the shareholders of the company for approval) under circumstances in which, upon completion of such tender or exchange offer,\nthe maker thereof, together with members of any group (within the meaning of Rule 13d-5(b)(1) under the Exchange Act) of which\nsuch maker is a part, and together with any affiliate or associate of such maker (within the meaning of Rule 12b-2 under the\nExchange Act) and any members of any such group of which any such affiliate or associate is a part, own beneficially (within the\nmeaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) more than 50% of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares, the holder of a\nwarrant will be entitled to receive the highest amount of cash, securities or other\n15\nproperty to which such holder would actually have been entitled as a shareholder if such warrantholder had exercised the warrant\nprior to the expiration of such tender or exchange offer, accepted such offer and all of the ordinary shares held by such holder had\nbeen purchased pursuant to such tender or exchange offer, subject to adjustment (from and after the consummation of such tender or\nexchange offer) as nearly equivalent as possible to the adjustments provided for in the Warrant Agreement. If less than 70% of the\nconsideration receivable by the holders of ordinary shares in such a transaction is payable in the form of ordinary shares in the\nsuccessor entity that is listed for trading on a national securities exchange or is quoted in an established over-the-counter market, or is\nto be so listed for trading or quoted immediately following such event, and if the registered holder of the warrant properly exercises\nthe warrant within thirty days following public disclosure of such transaction, the warrant exercise price will be reduced as specified\nin the Warrant Agreement based on the Black-Scholes value (as defined in the Warrant Agreement) of the warrant. The purpose of\nsuch exercise price reduction is to provide additional value to holders of the warrants when an extraordinary transaction occurs during\nthe exercise period of the warrants pursuant to which the holders of the warrants otherwise do not receive the full potential value of\nthe warrants.\nThe warrants have been issued in registered form under a Warrant Agreement (the “Warrant Agreement”) between\nContinental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent, and us. The Warrant Agreement provides that the terms of the\nwarrants may be amended without the consent of any holder for the purpose of (i) curing any ambiguity or correct any mistake,\nincluding to conform the provisions of the Warrant Agreement to the description of the terms of the warrants and the Warrant\nAgreement set forth in this section, or defective provision, (ii) amending the provisions relating to cash dividends on ordinary shares\nas contemplated by and in accordance with the Warrant Agreement or (iii) adding or changing any provisions with respect to matters\nor questions arising under the Warrant Agreement as the parties to the Warrant Agreement may deem necessary or desirable and that\nthe parties deem to not adversely affect the rights of the registered holders of the warrants, provided that the approval by the holders\nof at least 50% of the then-outstanding public warrants is required to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the\nregistered holders. You should review a copy of the Warrant Agreement, which has been filed as an exhibit to its annual report on\nForm 20-F for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, for a complete description of the terms and conditions applicable to the\nwarrants.\nThe warrantholders do not have the rights or privileges of holders of ordinary shares and any voting rights until they exercise\ntheir warrants and receive ordinary shares. After the issuance of ordinary shares upon exercise of the warrants, each holder will be\nentitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters to be voted on by shareholders.\nIf, upon exercise of the warrants, a holder would be entitled to receive a fractional interest in a share, we will, upon exercise,\nround down to the nearest whole number the number of ordinary shares to be issued to the warrantholder.\nPrivate Placement Business Combination Warrants\nExcept as described below, the private placement warrants have terms and provisions that are identical to those of the\nwarrants. The private placement warrants (including the ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the private placement warrants)\nwill not be redeemable by us (except as described under “— Warrants — Public Business Combination Warrants — Redemption of\nwarrants when the price per ordinary share equals or exceeds $10.00”) so long as they are held by the Sponsor or its permitted\ntransferees (except as otherwise set forth herein). The Sponsor, or its permitted transferees, has the option to exercise the private\nplacement warrants on a cashless basis. If the private placement warrants are held by holders other than the Sponsor or its permitted\ntransferees, the private placement warrants will be redeemable by us in all redemption scenarios and exercisable by the holders on the\nsame basis as the warrants.\nExcept as described above under “— Public Business Combination Warrants — Redemption of warrants when the price per\nordinary share equals or exceeds $10.00,” if holders of the private placement warrants elect to exercise them on a cashless basis, they\nwould pay the exercise price by surrendering his,\n16\nher or its warrants for that number of ordinary shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of\nordinary shares underlying the warrants, multiplied by the excess of the “historical fair market value” (defined below) over the\nexercise price of the warrants by (y) the historical fair market value. For these purposes, the “historical fair market value” shall mean\nthe average reported closing price of the ordinary shares for the 10 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on\nwhich the notice of warrant exercise is sent to the warrant agent or on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of\nwarrants, as applicable. We have policies in place that restrict insiders from selling our securities except during specific periods of\ntime. Even during such periods of time when insiders will be permitted to sell our securities, an insider cannot trade in our securities\nif he or she is in possession of material non-public information. Accordingly, unlike Centricus public shareholders who could\nexercise their warrants and sell the ordinary shares received upon such exercise freely in the open market in order to recoup the cost\nof such exercise, the insiders could be significantly restricted from selling such securities. As a result, we believe that allowing the\nholders to exercise such warrants on a cashless basis is appropriate.\nRegistered Direct Warrants\nThis section “\u0000Registered Direct Warrants” contains a description of the following warrants issued by the Company in\nconnection with registered direct offerings: (i) 7,500,000 warrants to purchase its ordinary shares at an exercise price of $2.00 per\nshare, which were issued and became exercisable on February 22, 2023 (the “February 2023 Investor Warrants”); (ii) 550,000\nwarrants to purchase its ordinary shares at an exercise price of $2.50 per share, which were issued and became exercisable on\nFebruary 22, 2023 (the “February 2023 Placement Agent Warrants”); (iii) 20,755,677 warrants to purchase its ordinary shares at an\nexercise price of $0.78 per share, which were issued and became exercisable on September 12, 2023 (the “September 2023 Investor\nWarrants”); and (iv) 705,128 warrants to purchase its ordinary shares at an exercise price of $0.975 per share, which were issued and\nbecame exercisable on September 12, 2023 (the “September 2023 Placement Agent Warrants” and together with the February 2023\nInvestor Warrants, the February 2023 Placement Agent Warrants and the September 2023 Investor Warrants, the “Registered Direct\nWarrants”).\nDuration and Exercise Price\nThe February 2023 Investor Warrants have an exercise price of $2.00 per share, the February 2023 Placement Agent Warrants\nhave an exercise price of $2.50 per share, the September 2023 Investor Warrants have an exercise price of $0.78 per share, and the\nSeptember 2023 Placement Agent Warrants have an exercise price of $0.975 per share. The warrants are currently exercisable and\nwill be exercisable for five years from the date of issuance. The exercise price and number of ordinary shares issuable upon exercise\nare subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of share dividends, share splits, reorganizations or similar events affecting our\nordinary shares.\nWarrants will be issued in certificated form only.\nExercisability\nThe Warrants will be exercisable, at the option of each holder, in whole or in part, by delivering to us a duly executed exercise\nnotice accompanied by payment in full for the number of ordinary shares purchased upon such exercise (except in the case of a\ncashless exercise as discussed below). A holder (together with its affiliates) may not exercise any portion of such holder’s warrants to\nthe extent that the holder would own more than 4.99% (or, at the election of the purchaser, 9.99%) of our outstanding ordinary shares\nimmediately after exercise, except that upon at least 61 days’ prior notice from the holder to us, the holder may increase the amount\nof ownership of outstanding ordinary shares after exercising the holder’s Warrants up to 9.99% of the number of ordinary shares\noutstanding immediately after giving effect to the exercise, as such percentage ownership is determined in accordance with the terms\nof the Warrants. Purchasers in this offering may also elect prior to the issuance of Warrants to have the initial exercise limitation set\nat 9.99% of our ordinary shares.\n17\nCashless Exercise\nIf at the time of exercise of the warrant there is no effective registration statement registering, or the prospectus contained\ntherein is not available for the resale of ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrant, then the warrants will only be\nexercisable on a “cashless exercise” basis under which the holder will receive upon such exercise a net number of common shares\ndetermined according to a formula set forth in the warrants.\nFundamental Transactions\nIn the event of any fundamental transaction, as described in the warrants and generally including any merger with or into\nanother entity, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, tender offer or exchange offer, or reclassification of our ordinary shares,\nthen upon any subsequent exercise of a warrant, the holder will have the right to receive as alternative consideration, for each\nOrdinary Share that would have been issuable upon such exercise immediately prior to the occurrence of such fundamental\ntransaction, the number of ordinary shares of the successor or acquiring corporation or of our company, if it is the surviving\ncorporation, and any additional consideration receivable upon or as a result of such transaction by a holder of the number of ordinary\nshares for which the warrant is exercisable immediately prior to such event. In certain circumstances, the holder will have the right to\nreceive the Black Scholes Value of the warrant calculated pursuant to a formula set forth in the warrants, payable either in cash or in\nthe same type or form of consideration that is being offered and being paid to the holders of our ordinary shares as described in the\nwarrants.\nTransferability\nIn accordance with its terms and subject to applicable laws, a warrant may be transferred at the option of the holder upon\nsurrender of the warrant to us together with the appropriate instruments of transfer and payment of funds sufficient to pay any\ntransfer taxes (if applicable).\nFractional Shares\nNo fractional ordinary shares will be issued upon the exercise of the warrants. Rather, the number of ordinary shares to be\nissued will, at our election, either be rounded up to the nearest whole number or we will pay a cash adjustment in respect of such final\nfraction in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the exercise price.\nTrading Market\nUnlike our Business Combination Warrants, there is no established trading market for the Registered Direct Warrants, and we\ndo not expect a market to develop. The Registered Direct Warrants are distinct from, and are not fungible with, our Business\nCombination Warrants. We have not and do not intend to apply for a listing for the Registered Direct Warrants on any securities\nexchange or other nationally recognized trading system. Without an active trading market, the liquidity of the Registered Direct\nWarrants is and will be limited.\nRights as a Shareholder\nExcept as otherwise provided in the warrants or by virtue of the holders’ ownership of ordinary shares, the holders of warrants\ndo not have the rights or privileges of holders of our ordinary shares, including any voting rights, until such warrant holders exercise\ntheir warrants.\nEnforceability of Civil Liability under Cayman Islands Law\nThe Company has been advised by Maples and Calder (Cayman) LLP, its Cayman Islands legal counsel, that the courts of the\nCayman Islands are unlikely (i) to recognize, or enforce against the Company, judgments of courts of the United States predicated\nupon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any State; and (ii) in original actions brought in the\nCayman Islands, to impose liabilities against the Company predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the\nUnited States or any State, so far as the liabilities imposed by those provisions are penal in\n18\nnature. In those circumstances, although there is no statutory enforcement in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in the United\nStates, the courts of the Cayman Islands will recognize and enforce a foreign money judgment of a foreign court of competent\njurisdiction without retrial on the merits based on the principle that a judgment of a competent foreign court imposes upon the\njudgment debtor an obligation to pay the sum for which judgment has been given provided certain conditions are met. For a foreign\njudgment to be enforced in the Cayman Islands, such judgment must be final and conclusive and for a liquidated sum, and must not\nbe in respect of taxes or a fine or penalty, inconsistent with a Cayman Islands judgment in respect of the same matter, impeachable on\nthe grounds of fraud or obtained in a manner, or be of a kind the enforcement of which is, contrary to natural justice or the public\npolicy of the Cayman Islands (awards of punitive or multiple damages may well be held to be contrary to public policy). A Cayman\nIslands court may stay enforcement proceedings if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere. There is recent Privy Council\nauthority (which is binding on the Cayman Islands court) in the context of a reorganization plan approved by the New York\nBankruptcy Court which suggests that due to the universal nature of bankruptcy/insolvency proceedings, foreign money judgments\nobtained in foreign bankruptcy/insolvency proceedings may be enforced without applying the principles outlined above. However, a\nmore recent English Supreme Court authority (which is highly persuasive but not binding on the Cayman Islands court), has\nexpressly rejected that approach in the context of a default judgment obtained in an adversary proceeding brought in the New York\nBankruptcy Court by the receivers of the bankruptcy debtor against a third party, and which would not have been enforceable upon\nthe application of the traditional common law principles summarized above and held that foreign money judgments obtained in\nbankruptcy/insolvency proceedings should be enforced by applying the principles set out above, and not by the simple exercise of the\nCourts’ discretion. Those cases have now been considered by the Cayman Islands court. The Cayman Islands court was not asked to\nconsider the specific question of whether a judgment of a bankruptcy court in an adversary proceeding would be enforceable in the\nCayman Islands, but it did endorse the need for active assistance of overseas bankruptcy proceedings. We understand that the Cayman\nIslands court’s decision in that case has been appealed and it remains the case that the law regarding the enforcement of\nbankruptcy/​insolvency related judgments is still in a state of uncertainty.\nAnti-Money Laundering — Cayman Islands\nIf any person in the Cayman Islands knows or suspects or has reasonable grounds for knowing or suspecting that another\nperson is engaged in criminal conduct or money laundering or is involved with terrorism or terrorist financing and property and the\ninformation for that knowledge or suspicion came to their attention in the course of business in the regulated sector, or other trade,\nprofession, business or employment, the person will be required to report such knowledge or suspicion to (i) the Financial Reporting\nAuthority of the Cayman Islands, pursuant to the Proceeds of Crime Law (2020 Revision) of the Cayman Islands if the disclosure\nrelates to criminal conduct or money laundering, or (ii) a police officer of the rank of constable or higher, or the Financial Reporting\nAuthority, pursuant to the Terrorism Law (2018 Revision) of the Cayman Islands, if the disclosure relates to involvement with\nterrorism or terrorist financing and property. Such a report shall not be treated as a breach of confidence or of any restriction upon the\ndisclosure of information imposed by any enactment or otherwise.\nData Protection — Cayman Islands\nWe have certain duties under the Data Protection Act (As Revised) of the Cayman Islands (the “DPL”) based on\ninternationally accepted principles of data privacy.\nPrivacy Notice\nIntroduction\nThis privacy notice puts our shareholders on notice that through your investment in the Company you will provide us with\ncertain personal information which constitutes personal data within the meaning\n19\nof the DPL (“personal data”). In the following discussion, the “company” refers to us and our affiliates and/or delegates, except\nwhere the context requires otherwise.\nInvestor Data\nWe will collect, use, disclose, retain and secure personal data to the extent reasonably required only and within the parameters\nthat could be reasonably expected during the normal course of business.

OVERVIEW\nIn accordance with the applicable rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market (the “Nasdaq Rules”),\nSection 10D and Rule 10D-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange\nAct”) (“Rule 10D-1”), the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Arqit Quantum Inc. (the “Company”)\nhas adopted this Policy (the “Policy”) to provide for the recovery of erroneously awarded Incentive-\nbased Compensation from Executive Officers. All capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined\nherein shall have the meanings set forth in Section H, below.\nB. RECOVERY OF ERRONEOUSLY AWARDED COMPENSATION\n(1) In the event of an Accounting Restatement, the Company will reasonably promptly recover\nthe Erroneously Awarded Compensation Received in accordance with Nasdaq Rules and Rule 10D-\n1 as follows:\n(i) After an Accounting Restatement, the Compensation Committee (if composed entirely of\nindependent directors, or in the absence of such a committee, a majority of independent\ndirectors serving on the Board) (the “Committee”) shall determine the amount of any\nErroneously Awarded Compensation Received by each Executive Officer and shall promptly\nnotify each Executive Officer with a written notice containing the amount of any Erroneously\nAwarded Compensation and a demand for repayment or return of such compensation, as\napplicable.\n(a) For Incentive-based Compensation based on (or derived from) the Company’s stock\nprice or total shareholder return, where the amount of Erroneously Awarded\nCompensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the\ninformation in the applicable Accounting Restatement:\ni. The amount to be repaid or returned shall be determined by the Committee\nbased on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement\non the Company’s stock price or total shareholder return upon which the\nIncentive-based Compensation was Received; and\nii. The Company shall maintain documentation of the determination of such\nreasonable estimate and provide the relevant documentation as required to\nNasdaq.\n(ii) The Committee shall have discretion to determine the appropriate means of recovering\nErroneously Awarded Compensation based on the particular facts and circumstances.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, except as set forth in Section B(2) below, in no event may\nthe Company accept an amount that is less than the amount of Erroneously Awarded\nCompensation in satisfaction of an Executive Officer’s obligations hereunder.\n(iii) To the extent that the Executive Officer has already reimbursed the Company for any\nErroneously Awarded Compensation Received under any duplicative recovery obligations\nestablished by the Company or applicable law, it shall be appropriate for any such\nreimbursed amount to be credited to the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation that\nis subject to recovery under this Policy.\n(iv) To the extent that an Executive Officer fails to repay all Erroneously Awarded Compensation\nto the Company when due, the Company shall take all actions reasonable and appropriate to\nrecover such Erroneously Awarded Compensation from the applicable Executive Officer.\nThe applicable Executive Officer shall be required upon request to reimburse the Company\nfor any and all expenses reasonably incurred (including legal fees) by the Company in\nrecovering such Erroneously Awarded Compensation in accordance with the immediately\npreceding sentence.\n(2) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to take the\nactions contemplated by Section B(1) above if the Committee determines that recovery would\nbe impracticable and any of the following three conditions are met:\n(i) The Committee has determined that the direct expenses paid to a third party to assist in\nenforcing the Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered. Before making this\ndetermination, the Company must make a reasonable attempt to recover the Erroneously\nAwarded Compensation, documented such attempt(s) and provided such documentation to\nNasdaq;\n(ii) Recovery would violate home country law where that law was adopted prior to November 28,\n2022, provided that, before determining that it would be impracticable to recover any amount\nof Erroneously Awarded Compensation based on violation of home country law, the\nCompany has obtained an opinion of home country counsel, acceptable to Nasdaq, that\nrecovery would result in such a violation and a copy of the opinion is provided to Nasdaq; or\n(iii) Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits\nare broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to meet the requirements of\nSection 401(a)(13) or Section 411(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,\nand regulations thereunder.\nC. DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS\nThe Company shall file all disclosures with respect to this Policy required by applicable U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) filings and rules.\nD. PROHIBITION OF INDEMNIFICATION\nThe Company shall not be permitted to insure or indemnify any Executive Officer against (i) the loss\nof any Erroneously Awarded Compensation that is repaid, returned or recovered pursuant to the\nterms of this Policy, or (ii) any claims relating to the Company’s enforcement of its rights under this\nPolicy. Further, the Company shall not enter into any agreement that exempts any Incentive-\n2\nbased Compensation that is granted, paid or awarded to an Executive Officer from the application of\nthis Policy or that waives the Company’s right to recovery of any Erroneously Awarded\nCompensation, and this Policy shall supersede any such agreement (whether entered into before,\non or after the Effective Date of this Policy).\nE. ADMINISTRATION AND INTERPRETATION\nThis Policy shall be administered by the Committee, and any determinations made by the\nCommittee shall be final and binding on all affected individuals.\nThe Committee is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations\nnecessary, appropriate, or advisable for the administration of this Policy and for the Company’s\ncompliance with Nasdaq Rules, Section 10D, Rule 10D-1 and any other applicable law, regulation,\nrule or interpretation of the SEC or Nasdaq promulgated or issued in connection therewith.\nF. AMENDMENT; TERMINATION\nThe Committee may amend this Policy from time to time in its discretion and shall amend this Policy\nas it deems necessary. Notwithstanding anything in this Section F to the contrary, no amendment or\ntermination of this Policy shall be effective if such amendment or termination would (after taking into\naccount any actions taken by the Company contemporaneously with such amendment or\ntermination) cause the Company to violate any federal securities laws, SEC rule or Nasdaq rule.\nG. OTHER RECOVERY RIGHTS\nThis Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Executive Officers and, to the extent\nrequired by applicable law or guidance from the SEC or Nasdaq, their beneficiaries, heirs,\nexecutors, administrators or other legal representatives. The Committee intends that this Policy will\nbe applied to the fullest extent required by applicable law.
