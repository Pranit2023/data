I (the “Company”) announced today the closing of its initial public offering of 23,000,000 units, which includes 3,000,000 units issued pursuant to the exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option in full. The offering was priced at $10.00 per unit, resulting in gross proceeds of $230,000,000.\n\nThe Company’s units began trading on July 10, 2024 on the Nasdaq Global Market (“Nasdaq”) under the ticker symbol “SIMAU.” Each unit consists of one Class A ordinary share of the Company and one-half of one redeemable warrant, with each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share of the Company at an exercise price of $11.50 per share. Once the securities constituting the units begin separate trading, the Class A ordinary shares and warrants are expected to be listed on Nasdaq under the symbols “SIMA” and “SIMAW,” respectively.\n\nOf the proceeds received from the consummation of the initial public offering and a simultaneous private placement of warrants (as well as the exercise of the over-allotment option), $230,000,000 (or $10.00 per unit sold in the public offering) was placed in trust.\n\nThe Company is a blank check company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, amalgamation, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. The Company may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any business or industry or at any stage of its corporate evolution. The Company’s primary focus, however, will be in completing a business combination with a company in the healthcare industry. \n\nThe Company’s management team is led by Erich Spangenberg, its Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and David Kutcher, its Chief Financial Officer. The Company’s Board of Directors includes Delos (“Toby”) Marshall Cosgrove, M.D., Janine Grasso and Vincent Capone.\n\nCantor Fitzgerald & Co. acted as sole book-running manager for the offering.\n\nA registration statement relating to the securities was declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on July 9, 2024.
