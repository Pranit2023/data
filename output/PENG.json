The reconciliation of “GAAP gross profit” to “Non-GAAP gross profit” inadvertently omits the line item “Other” in the amount of $300,000 for both the three months and fiscal year ended August 30, 2024, which should have appeared below the line item “Cost of sales-related restructure.” The “Non-GAAP gross profit” line item as well as all other line items in the reconciliation table are correct.\n\n**SMART Global Holdings Is Now Penguin Solutions Q4 FY24 Revenue Across All Business Segments Up Sequentially**\n\nMILPITAS, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--  Penguin Solutions, Inc.

These statements include, but are not limited to, statements concerning or regarding future events and the future financial and operating performance of Penguin Solutions; statements regarding the extent and timing of and expectations regarding Penguin Solutions’ future revenues and expenses; statements regarding Penguin Solutions’ strategic transformation and priorities; statements regarding long-term effective tax rates; and statements regarding the business and financial outlook for the next fiscal year described under “Business Outlook” above. \n\nThese statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements often use words such as “anticipate,” “target,” “expect,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “goal,” “believe,” “could,” and other words of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements provide our current expectations or forecasts of future events, circumstances, results or aspirations and are subject to a number of significant risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are outside of our control, including but not limited to: global business and economic conditions and growth trends in technology industries (including trends and markets related to AI), our customer markets and various geographic regions; uncertainties in the geopolitical environment; the ability to manage our cost structure; disruptions in our operations or supply chain as a result of global pandemics or otherwise; changes in trade regulations or adverse developments in international trade relations and agreements; changes in currency exchange rates; overall information technology spending; appropriations for government spending; the success of our strategic initiatives including our rebranding and related strategy, any potential collaborations and additional investments in new products and additional capacity; acquisitions of companies or technologies and the failure to successfully integrate and operate them or customers’ negative reactions to them; issues, delays or complications in integrating the operations of Stratus Technologies; failure to achieve the intended benefits of the sale of SMART Brazil and its business; limitations on or changes in the availability of supply of materials and components; fluctuations in material costs; the temporary or volatile nature of pricing trends in memory or elsewhere; deterioration in customer relationships; our dependence on a select number of customers and the timing and volume of customer orders; production or manufacturing difficulties; competitive factors; technological changes; difficulties with, or delays in, the introduction of new products; slowing or contraction of growth in the memory market, LED market or other markets in which we participate; changes to applicable tax regimes or rates; changes to the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets, including any potential inability to realize these assets in the future; prices for the end products of our customers; strikes or labor disputes; deterioration in or loss of relations with any of our limited number of key vendors; the inability to maintain or expand government business; and the continuing availability of borrowings under term loans and revolving lines of credit and our ability to raise capital through debt or equity financings. \n\nThese and other risks, uncertainties and factors are described in greater detail under the sections titled “Risk Factors,” “Critical Accounting Estimates,” “Results of Operations,” “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and our other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, such risks, uncertainties and factors as outlined above and in such filings do not constitute all risks, uncertainties and factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from such forward-looking statements. Accordingly, investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements that we make in this press release speak only as of the date of this press release. Except as required by law, we do not undertake to update the forward-looking statements contained in this press release to reflect the impact of circumstances or events that may arise after the date that the forward-looking statements were made. \n\n**Statement Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThis press release and the accompanying tables contain the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP effective tax rate, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP weighted-average shares outstanding, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share and Adjusted EBITDA. Penguin Solutions management uses these non-GAAP measures to supplement Penguin Solutions’ financial results under GAAP. Management uses these measures to analyze its operations and make decisions as to future operational plans and believes that this supplemental non-GAAP information is useful to investors in analyzing and assessing the Company’s past and future operating performance. These non-GAAP measures exclude certain items, such as share-based compensation expense; amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets (consisting of amortization of developed technology, customer relationships and trademarks/trade names acquired in connection with business combinations); acquisition-related inventory adjustments; diligence, acquisition and integration expense; restructure charges; impairment of goodwill; changes in the fair value of contingent consideration; gains (losses) from changes in currency exchange rates; amortization of debt issuance costs; gain (loss) on extinguishment or prepayment of debt; other infrequent or unusual items and related tax effects and other tax adjustments. While amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets is excluded, the revenues from acquired companies is reflected in the Company’s non-GAAP measures and these intangible assets contribute to revenue generation. Management believes the presentation of operating results that exclude certain items provides useful supplemental information to investors and facilitates the analysis of the Company’s core operating results and comparison of operating results across reporting periods. Management also uses adjusted EBITDA, which represents GAAP net income (loss), adjusted for net interest expense; income tax provision (benefit); depreciation and amortization expense; share-based compensation expense; acquisition-related inventory adjustments; diligence, acquisition and integration expense; restructure charges; impairment of goodwill; changes in the fair value of contingent consideration; gain (loss) on extinguishment or prepayment of debt and other infrequent or unusual items. \n\nIn fiscal 2024, for our non-GAAP reporting, we began to utilize a long-term projected non-GAAP effective tax rate of 28%, which includes the tax impact of pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments and reflects currently available information as well as other factors and assumptions. While we expect to use this normalized non-GAAP effective tax rate through fiscal 2025, this long-term non-GAAP effective tax rate may be subject to change for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in our geographic earnings mix or changes to our strategy or business operations. Our GAAP effective tax rate can vary significantly from quarter to quarter based on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, discrete items which are recorded in the period they occur, the tax effects of certain items of income or expense, significant changes in our geographic earnings mix or changes to our strategy or business operations. We are unable to predict the timing and amounts of these items, which could significantly impact our GAAP effective tax rate, and therefore we are unable to reconcile our forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate measure to our GAAP effective tax rate. \n\nNon-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP, as they exclude important information about Penguin Solutions’ financial results, as noted above. The presentation of these adjusted amounts varies from amounts presented in accordance with GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to amounts reported by other companies. In addition, adjusted EBITDA does not purport to represent cash flow provided by, or used for, operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be used as a measure of liquidity. Investors are encouraged to review the “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures” tables below. \n\n**About Penguin Solutions**\n\nThe most exciting technological advancements are also the most challenging for companies to adopt.

For our specialty\nmemory products, we have developed a high-volume, fully automated\n9\nreliability testing and screening capability that substantially exceeds standard industry practices. These capabilities enable\nus to reduce the occurrence of early-life failures and weak module fallout, which can save our customers from the\nsignificant expenses associated with replacing products that fail after field deployment.\nOptimized LED\nWhile we do not own or operate wafer fabrication facilities, we have capabilities for subsequent stages of the product\nmanufacturing cycle. In our manufacturing facilities in Huizhou, China, we receive LED chips from third-party wafer\nfabrication facilities, prepare and package dies into LED components, test components, and in some cases, assemble\ncomponents on substrates or printed circuit boards to manufacture LED products. Through our years of investment and\nexperience, we have developed expertise in LED technology that results in brighter, more efficient and lower cost LED\nchips and components for a broad range of lighting applications.\nCustomers\nWe believe that our customers look to us as a strategic partner based on our high-performance, high-availability,\napplication-specific products, quality, technical support and global footprint. We also provide customized, integrated supply\nchain services for certain customers to assist them with the management and execution of their procurement and\ndistribution processes. We believe our close collaboration with customers, customer-specific designs, long-lifecycle\nsolutions and proprietary supply chain services create significant customer value. Our products are generally manufactured\non a build-to-order basis. Our sales are made primarily pursuant to customer purchase orders and are not based on long-\nterm supply agreements.\nWe sell our products and solutions directly and through third-party channels, including distributors, value-added resellers,\nindependent software vendors and systems integrators, to a diversified base of local and global OEM, enterprise and\ngovernment customers.\nIn Advanced Computing, we sell Penguin Computing products to enterprise and government customers in AI cloud\nservices, energy, hyperscale and education markets; Penguin Edge products to OEM customers, system integrators and\nthrough distribution to government, telecom infrastructure, industrial, network edge computing and transportation markets;\nand Stratus products and services to financial services, telecom, oil and gas, transportation, healthcare, retail and industrial\nautomation customers. We also offer IoT endpoint applications such as smart city, digital health, digital signage and smart\nbuildings.\nIn our Integrated Memory segment, we sell to OEM customers in industrial, government, networking and communications,\nenterprise storage and other vertical markets.\nOur Optimized LED segment sells LED chips and components to manufacturers and electronic component distributors. We\nsell our Optimized LED products and solutions using both channel and direct sales to a diverse base of local and global\nOEM and contract manufacturers that together support a broad range of customers. We also utilize third-party sales\nrepresentatives that generally do not maintain product inventory. A substantial portion of our Optimized LED products are\nsold to distributors that stock inventory and sell our products to their customers, which include value-added resellers,\nmanufacturers who incorporate our products into their own manufactured goods and end-users of our products. Like other\nglobal semiconductor component suppliers, our Optimized LED segment has historically experienced seasonally lower\nsales during the earlier part of the calendar year and may see similar trends in the future.\nIn 2024, 2023 and 2022, sales to our ten largest end customers (including sales to contract manufacturers and original\ndesign manufacturers (“ODMs”) at the direction of such end customers) accounted for 58%, 60% and 62% of total net\nsales, respectively. See “PART II – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements – Concentrations.”\nSuppliers\nTo address the needs of our customers, we have developed and maintained relationships with leading suppliers and\ncontract manufacturers located in Asia, Europe and the Americas. Our semiconductor suppliers include many of the world’s\nlargest memory manufacturers, including Samsung Semiconductor, Inc., Micron Technology, Inc., SK hynix, Inc. and Kioxia\nHoldings Corporation. They also include some of the world’s largest providers of computing, communications and graphics\nprocessers, including Intel Corporation, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.,\n10\nNVIDIA Corporation and TD Synnex Corporation; as well as providers of subsystems including Intel and Giga-Byte\nTechnology Co., Ltd.; networking products including Juniper Networks, Inc.; and suppliers of software products. Our\ncontract manufacturers include NEC Corporation, Advantech Co., Ltd. and Celestica Inc. We often work with our suppliers\nin bidding for customers’ design-in opportunities. We also work closely with our suppliers to better ensure that needed\nmaterials are available and delivered on time. Our established global network of materials sourcing helps ensure that our\npricing remains competitive and allows us to provide a stable source of supply for our customers.\nWe believe that our longstanding relationships with leading suppliers put us in a favorable position to procure sufficient\nquantities of materials, including during periods of industry shortages. Our flexible and responsive global manufacturing\ncapabilities, inventory management systems and global IT system allow us to move materials from one site to another in a\ncost-efficient manner and often deploy what might otherwise be excess inventory among other products and customers. In\nour Advanced Computing and Integrated Memory segments, we purchase a significant portion of our materials from\nsuppliers on a purchase order basis and generally do not have long-term commitments from our suppliers. Our Optimized\nLED segment has a number of supply agreements with third-party providers for LED chips in wafer or discrete form.\nGlobal macroeconomic headwinds have resulted in significant supply shortages across the supply chain. These shortages\nhave increased the cost of materials needed to manufacture our products and have impacted our ability to manufacture\nproducts for our customers. Many of these issues relate to reduced investment in capacity by our suppliers as well as local\ngovernment policies that have affected the ability of our suppliers’ employees to work. Additionally, airline freight capacity\nlimitations have increased our freight cost and affected the timeliness of some deliveries.\nSales, Support and Marketing\nWe sell our products both directly and through third-party channels to global OEMs as well as enterprise, government and\nother end customers located across North America, Asia and Europe. Our sales and marketing efforts are conducted\nthrough an integrated process that engages our direct sales force, e-commerce, customer service representatives and on-\nsite field application engineers (“FAE”) alongside a network of independent sales representatives, distributors, integrators\nand resellers. Larger customers are also often supported by dedicated sales and support teams. Our sales and marketing\nefforts also include a high level of involvement from our senior executives.\nOur on-site FAEs work closely with our sales team to provide product design support to our customers. Our FAEs\ncollaborate with our customers, providing us insight into their business models and product roadmaps and enabling us to\nidentify early-stage opportunities that can help grow our business. Our integrated sales network and FAEs together allow\nus to be more responsive to our customers and more successful in navigating each customer’s unique and often complex\ndesign qualification and/or bid proposal processes.\nOur marketing activities include advertising in technical journals; publishing articles in leading industry periodicals; hosting\nwebinars; publishing white papers, electronic newsletters and blogs; and utilizing direct email solicitation. We participate in\nmany industry trade shows worldwide and have active memberships in a number of industry organizations, including the\nJoint Electron Device Engineering Council (“JEDEC”), SD Card Association, Storage Networking Industry Association,\nGen-Z Consortium, CXL Consortium, Trusted Computing Group, Open Compute Project, Sensor Open Systems\nArchitecture Consortium, Peripheral Component Interconnect Special Interest Group and Illuminating Engineering Society\n(“IES”).\nResearch and Development\nThe timely development of new products and services is essential to maintaining our competitive position. Our primary\nresearch and development (“R&D”) activities are conducted at our R&D centers in the United States (Durham, North\nCarolina; Fremont, California; Irvine, California; Maynard, Massachusetts; Newark, California; Tempe, Arizona and\nTewksbury, Massachusetts) and in Huizhou, China; Bangalore, India; New Taipei City, Taiwan; and Penang, Malaysia. Our\nR&D activities focus on driving innovation in our products and services as well as continuous process improvement for\nprocurement, test and manufacturing.\nOur research and product development for Advanced Computing includes high-availability server architecture and design,\nhigh-availability software development (including virtualization, operating systems and systems\n11\nmanagement); server selection and occasional design; designs to enable integration of racks and clusters; storage system\ndesign and evaluation; high-performance network design; component testing for switches; cables and interface devices;\ndevelopment of software-defined storage systems; and embedded computer boards and systems.\nOur product development in Integrated Memory includes innovations for next-generation DRAM products, including DDR5,\nmobile DRAM, hybrid memories such as hybrid volatile and non-volatile DRAM, emerging interconnect standards such as\nCXL, enterprise memory and Flash-based products, and associated firmware development.\nR&D in our Optimized LED segment includes innovations for next-generation LED products, including chips, packages for\nhigh-power general illumination, next generation direct-view video displays and specialty applications such as horticulture\nlighting, architectural, torch and emergency vehicles. We plan to continue R&D focused on the innovation and design of\nthese and other new products that address the needs of our customers, with a focus on faster-growing markets.\nWe continue to develop a broad offering of Flash-based products for industrial, government, communications and\nenterprise storage and compute markets. Our engineering team is focused on firmware development, systems engineering\nand integration, system and platform validation, applications, and product and reliability engineering for new products.\nOur advanced engineering and design capabilities enable us to address our customers’ increasingly complex needs. We\ndesign our products to be compatible with existing industry standards and, where appropriate, develop and promote new\nstandards and provide custom solutions to meet customers’ requirements. An important aspect of our R&D is\nunderstanding the challenges presented by our customers’ requirements and addressing them using our industry\nknowledge, proprietary technologies and technical expertise. By working closely with our customers and suppliers, we are\nable to deliver technically advanced products designed to meet customer-specific needs with competitive solutions that\nsatisfy our customers’ memory, storage and compute requirements; shorten their time-to-market; and enhance the\nperformance of their end products and applications.\nR&D expenses were $81.5 million, $90.6 million and $77.5 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of August 30,\n2024, we had approximately 340 R&D personnel worldwide.\nCompetition\nOur businesses compete with numerous global and local companies. The principal competitive factors in our markets\ninclude the ability to meet customer-specific requirements and provide high product quality, strong technical support,\ntechnologically advanced products and services, advanced testing capabilities, flexible and global delivery options, reliable\nsupply and reasonable pricing.\nAcross our Penguin Solutions business segments, our principal competitors include:\n• Specialty memory products providers;\n• Memory semiconductor manufacturers that also manufacture DRAM modules and Flash products;\n• Supply chain service providers, including distributors and third-party logistics providers;\n• Compute and storage systems providers;\n• Semiconductor and subsystem manufacturers;\n• Embedded computing platforms and systems providers;\n• Providers of SoMs and SBCs;\n• LED product manufacturers;\n• Enterprise IT server vendors; and\n• Manufacturers of industrial computers.\nWith respect to our Advanced Computing segment, within our Stratus business we primarily compete with manufacturers of\nenterprise servers and industrial computers. Our Penguin Computing business competes primarily with global\nmanufacturers of HPC and AI products and services. For Penguin Edge products, primary competitors include makers of\nruggedized computer boards and systems as well as manufacturers of edge computing devices, SoMs and SBCs.\n12\nWithin our Integrated Memory segment, we compete against memory module providers and, to a lesser extent, large\nsemiconductor manufacturers that utilize a portion of their capacity to manufacture memory modules.\nWithin our Optimized LED segment, we compete with companies that manufacture and/or sell nitride-based LED chips as\nwell as manufacturers of LED components concentrated primarily in indoor and outdoor lighting; specialty lighting including\ntorch lamps (flashlights), horticulture and color-changing architectural lighting; signs and signals; and transportation.\nSome of our global competitors are large international companies that have substantially greater financial, technical,\nmarketing, distribution and other resources as well as greater name recognition and longer-standing relationships with\ncustomers and suppliers than we do. These competitors tend to have limited customization and service capabilities and are\ngenerally focused on higher-volume memory, storage or compute products that are manufactured to industry-standard\nspecifications. We believe that our close collaboration with customers, customer-specific designs, long-lifecycle solutions,\nsuperior products and proprietary supply chain services create significant customer loyalty that may provide an advantage\nwhen competing against large international companies.\nIn addition, some of our competitors are also our suppliers or customers. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks Related to\nOur Business – We depend on a select number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue” and “– We depend on\na small number of sole or limited source suppliers.”\nIntellectual Property\nIntellectual property is an important aspect of our business. We actively seek to protect and leverage our intellectual\nproperty to promote our business interests. As of August 30, 2024, we owned or exclusively licensed approximately 1,732\npatents, which are set to expire between 2024 to 2044, and had 310 pending patent applications. We continually review\nour development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property, which we work to protect as\nappropriate. We believe the duration and scope of our most relevant patents are sufficient to support our business, which\nas a whole is not significantly dependent on any particular patent or other intellectual property rights.\nTo protect our intellectual property, we rely upon a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws;\ncontractual restrictions such as nondisclosure agreements, licenses and intellectual property assignment agreements; and\npolicies and procedures. We pursue the registration of our domain names and trademarks in various jurisdictions and\nregister trademarks in the United States and other countries as warranted. We maintain a policy requiring our employees,\ncontractors, consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements to control\naccess to our proprietary information. Additionally, we actively monitor data on our computer networks to assure\ncompliance with data use policies. However, these laws, procedures and policies provide only limited protection and any of\nour intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, infringed or misappropriated. Furthermore, the laws of\ncertain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, which means that we\nmay be unable to protect our proprietary technology in certain jurisdictions.\nWhile many of our products contain proprietary aspects and are protected by patents, some of our products are built\naround mature industry standards and have less patent protection. For these products, we rely on trade secrets and know-\nhow to protect our proprietary interests. The absence of patent protection means that we cannot prevent our competitors\nfrom reverse-engineering and duplicating those products. Moreover, some of our product solutions incorporate open\nsource software that is available under public licenses such as the GNU General Public License. We maintain policies and\nprocedures to evaluate open source software used in our products and strive to minimize the risk of our proprietary\nintellectual property being inadvertently pulled under such licenses.\nHuman Capital\nAt Penguin Solutions, we put people first by nurturing a culture that supports creativity and growth. We value our\nemployees and understand the importance of their contributions as well as personal development. We believe that at the\nbest workplaces, employees feel inspired, engaged, valued and included. As part of our “people first” mindset, we are\ndedicated to advancing our people strategy by developing our talent, maintaining an engaged workforce and offering\nprograms and rewards that attract and retain the best talent. At the core of our people\n13\nstrategy is a commitment to maintaining a safe and inclusive culture and ensuring that our workforce represents the\ndiversity of the communities where we work.\nEmployees\nAs of August 30, 2024, we had approximately 2,700 full-time employees (excluding contractors) in locations across the\nglobe, including in the United States, China and Malaysia. We have never experienced a work stoppage at any of our\nlocations and take pride in our good employee relations.\nEmployee Engagement and Development\nContinuous growth requires ongoing investment in people, innovation and new opportunities. We are always improving our\ncommunications between employees and management teams in order to advance our company goals and enhance the\nemployee experience. We aim to develop capable leadership that can meet the challenges of business growth while\ninstilling a supportive and inclusive company culture. At all locations, we provide our employees with performance\nassessments and evaluations. We place a priority on identifying talent throughout the organization and providing them with\ndevelopment and coaching opportunities through our newly adopted annual talent calibration and succession planning\nprocess. We also provide employees with access to technical and leadership training and training on workplace culture and\nenrichment, covering topics such as harassment, healthy work environments, inclusion and global ethics and compliance.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nWe are committed to diversity, equity and inclusion, which we believe starts at the top with an executive team that includes\nleaders from different backgrounds. We value diversity and inclusion and are proud that our employees represent various\nraces, religious beliefs, genders, ages, national origins and points of view. We know that our diverse teams bring valuable\nperspectives and insights that help us consistently raise the bar and drive innovation forward. This philosophy applies to all\nlevels of our organization, including our executive leadership team and our Board of Directors.\nWe are committed to providing employees with an inclusive and nondiscriminatory work environment, which is outlined in\nour non-discrimination policy. Through this policy, we articulate people-oriented, fair treatment principles for the\nrecruitment, promotion, performance evaluation, compensation, training and retirement of all employees. We have\nestablished a Global Diversity Council (“GDC”) focused on creating a working environment that offers equal opportunity\nemployment so that all workers are treated with fairness and respect. The GDC enables us to expand on our strategy to\nnurture a diverse and inclusive work environment through initiatives such as employee resource groups and the\nrecruitment of more diverse leadership.\nWellness, Health and Safety\nWe strive to provide and maintain a safe work environment and prioritize employee well-being throughout our operations.\nOur wellness program is supported by a committee that provides information and events throughout the year on health as\nwell as mental and financial well-being. We also support mental health and wellness through our Employee Assistance\nProgram, which offers free and confidential counseling and support for our employees and members of their households.\nCompensation and Benefits\nWe offer compensation and benefits programs designed to motivate and reward our employees based on our pay-for-\nperformance philosophy. We are committed to paying market competitive wages to attract key talent and work to help to\nensure pay equality across our diverse workforce. Our bonus program links employee compensation to Penguin Solutions’\nbusiness performance. We also offer an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, equity compensation, retirement benefits and, in\nthe United States, a 401(k) match program.\nEnvironmental Regulations\nOur operations and properties are subject to various federal, state, local, foreign and international environmental laws and\nregulations that govern, among other things, environmental licensing and registries, protection of flora and fauna, air and\nnoise emissions, use of water resources, wastewater discharges, management and disposal of\n14\nhazardous and non-hazardous materials and wastes, reverse logistics (take-back policy) and remediation of releases of\nhazardous materials. We cannot be certain that future identification of environmental concerns or conditions, more vigorous\nregulatory enforcement, enactment of more stringent laws and regulations or other unanticipated events will not arise in the\nfuture. These developments could give rise to material environmental liabilities and related costs that could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAvailable Information\nOur address in the Cayman Islands is c/o Walkers Corporate Limited, 190 Elgin Avenue, George Town, Grand Cayman,\nCayman Islands, KY1-9008.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and\nour consolidated financial statements and related notes. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be\nmaterially and adversely affected if any of these risks occurs and, as a result, the market price of our ordinary shares could\ndecline and you could lose all or part of your investment. As noted above in “Item 1. Business,” the financial results and\noperations of SMART Brazil have been presented as discontinued operations. While the divestiture of our SMART Brazil\nbusiness continues to pose certain risks and uncertainties described below, unless otherwise noted, the financial results\nincluded in the risks below relate solely to our continuing operations and do not include the operations of SMART Brazil.\nThis Annual Report also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See “Cautionary Note\nRegarding Forward-Looking Statements” for additional information. Our actual results could differ materially and adversely\nfrom those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks facing our\ncompany described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nRisk Factor Summary\nThe following is a summary of the principal risks described below in this Annual Report. The following summary should not\nbe considered an exhaustive summary of the material risks facing us, and it should be read in conjunction with the “Risk\nFactors” section and the other information contained in this Annual Report.\nRisks Related to Our Business\n• Changing worldwide economic conditions could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\n• Our operating results

data privacy and security laws, or that of our customers,\nsuppliers or business partners, could expose us to losses.\n• Some of our offerings utilize open source software, which may pose particular risks to our proprietary software,\nproducts and services in a manner that could harm our business or make it easier for competitors to enter our\nmarkets and compete with us.\n• We could be prevented from selling or developing our software if our licenses are not enforceable or are modified\nso as to become incompatible with other open source licenses.\n• Our indemnification obligations to our customers and suppliers could require us to pay substantial damages.\n• We may need to raise additional funds, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\n• We have in the past made, and may in the future make, acquisitions, investments and/or alliances, which involve\nnumerous risks.\n• We may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of recent acquisitions or the sale of our SMART Brazil business.\n• We have incurred, and may in the future incur, impairment charges related to our goodwill, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n• We may incur liabilities relating to additional Brazilian withholding tax in connection with the sale of our Brazil\nbusiness.\n• The sale of our Brazil business could impair our ability to protect our trademarks and brand.\n• If we are not able to maintain, develop and enhance our brand and our reputation, our business and results of\noperations may be adversely affected.\n• We rely on third parties to sell a portion of our products and services.\n• We may be unable to protect our intellectual property.\n• Legal proceedings and claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or\nfinancial condition.\n• We may be required to pay royalties or obtain licenses to sell certain products.\n• Changes in tax laws or potential adjustments by tax authorities could materially increase our tax expense, and our\nability to use our tax attributes is limited.\n• We reversed the valuation allowance for a significant portion of our deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of\n2023, and we may not be able to realize these assets in the future. Our deferred tax assets may also be subject to\nadditional valuation allowances, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations\nand financial condition.\n• We could incur substantial costs or liabilities as a result of violations of environmental laws.\n• We may be unable to complete environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) initiatives, in whole or in part, which\ncould lead to less opportunity for us to have ESG investors and partners and could negatively impact our\nreputation or options for capital acquisition.\n• Our worldwide operations, and those of our suppliers, business partners and customers, may be disrupted by\nevents outside of our control.\nRisks Related to Our International Operations\n• Our business is subject to the risks generally associated with international business operations.\n• We are subject to the taxation requirements of the jurisdictions in which we operate, and if we fail to qualify for\ncertain tax incentives or to comply with local tax regulations, we may suffer financial losses.\n• Changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or\nfinancial condition.\n• We are a holding company. If enacted, exchange controls may limit our ability to receive dividends and other\ndistributions from our foreign subsidiaries.\n• High rates of inflation in the future would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\n• We may have limited legal recourse under the laws of China if disputes arise under our agreements with third\nparties.\nRisks Related to Our Debt\n• Our indebtedness, and the terms of our debt instruments, including our credit agreement and the agreements\ngoverning our convertible notes and capped call transactions, could impair our financial condition, harm our ability\nto operate our business or hinder third-party acquisition attempts, and affect the value of our debt and ordinary\nshares.\n17\nRisks Related to Investments in Cayman Islands Companies\n• We are a Cayman Islands company and, because the rights of shareholders under Cayman Islands law differ from\nthose under U.S. law, shareholders may have difficulty protecting their shareholder rights or enforcing a judgment\nof U.S. courts against us in the Cayman Islands.\nRisks Related to Our Ordinary Shares\n• The trading price of our ordinary shares has been and may continue to be volatile, and actual or perceived future\nsales of our ordinary shares could cause our share price to fall.\n• If our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting estimates are based on assumptions that change or\nprove to be incorrect, our results of operations could fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors,\nresulting in a decline in the market price of our ordinary shares.\n• Anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents may discourage our acquisition by a third party, which\ncould limit shareholders’ opportunity to sell their ordinary shares at a premium.\n• We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our ordinary shares in the foreseeable future.\nGeneral Risk Factors\n• Worldwide economic and political conditions, including terrorist attacks as well as other factors, may adversely\naffect our operations and cause fluctuations in demand for our products.\n• We and others are subject to a variety of laws, regulations, or industry standards that may have a material adverse\neffect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\n• Our success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled employees.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nChanging worldwide economic conditions could adversely affect our operating results and\nfinancial condition.\nThe United States and global economies are facing increased levels of inflation, higher interest rates and potential\nrecession. Adverse changes in economic conditions could harm our operating results and financial conditions in a variety of\nways. For example, regional or global economic downturns could adversely affect demand for our products, which could\nadversely affect our revenue and potentially result in write-offs of excess or obsolete inventory. Inflation could also drive\nincreases in our costs of revenue and operations, which we may not be able to successfully pass along to our customers.\nHigher interest rates could result in increased cash usage to service our variable rate indebtedness and increase the cost\nto us of refinancing our indebtedness.\nOur operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter, which make them difficult to predict.\nOur quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future. As a result, our past quarterly\noperating results are not necessarily indicative of future performance. Furthermore, we may not be able to maintain the\nmargins we have achieved in recent periods. Our operating results in any given quarter can be and have been influenced\nby numerous factors, many of which we are unable to predict or are outside of our control, including:\n• the loss of, significant reduction in, or variability in the timing of sales to, or demand from, one or more key\ncustomers, which can be affected by factors such as the timing of customer deployments or customer budget\nconsiderations;\n• the acquisition of other companies or technologies, the failure to successfully integrate and operate them, or\ncustomers’ or suppliers’ negative reactions to them;\n• a disruption in, or termination of, our supply relationship with one or more key suppliers;\n• supply shortages that may impact our ability to manufacture products for our customers and may result in rising\nprices of the materials we need to manufacture our products;\n• our failure to develop new or enhanced products and introduce them in a timely manner;\n• the timing of our entry into new contracts or timing of revenues recognized from our customers, which can be\naffected by factors such as singular large-scale projects in one period not recurring in subsequent periods or\ncustomer decisions as to the completion of delivery and system go-live events; and\n18\n• other factors described in this “Risk Factors” section.\nDue to the various factors mentioned above and other factors, the results of any prior quarterly or annual period should not\nbe relied upon as an indication of our future operating performance. In one or more future periods, as has happened in the\npast, our results of operations may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In that event, the\nmarket price of our ordinary shares would likely decline. In addition, the market price of our ordinary shares may fluctuate\nor decline regardless of our operating performance.\nWe have experienced losses in the past and may experience losses in the future.\nOur business has experienced quarterly and annual operating losses. For example, in 2024, we had a net loss of $52.5\nmillion. Our ability to achieve or maintain profitability depends in part on revenue growth from, among other things,\nincreased demand for our integrated memory solutions, products and related service offerings in our current markets,\ngrowth in our Advanced Computing and Optimized LED segments, the performance of our acquired companies as well as\nour ability to expand into new markets, including those related to AI. We may not be successful in achieving the revenue\nand revenue growth necessary to maintain profitability. Moreover, as we continue to expend substantial funds for research\nand development projects, enhancements to sales and marketing efforts, integration of acquisitions and to otherwise\noperate our business, we cannot assure you that we will achieve or maintain profitability on an annual or quarterly basis\neven if our revenue does grow.\nWe compete in historically cyclical markets.\nHistorically, the markets in which we compete have been highly cyclical and have experienced significant downturns often\nconnected with, or in anticipation of, maturing product lifecycles of both component suppliers and electronic equipment\nmanufacturers and/or declines in general economic conditions. These downturns have been characterized by diminished\nproduct demand, production overcapacity, high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of selling prices and inventory\nvalues. Our business depends on the continued growth of technology utilization, the electronics industry and on end-user\ndemand for our customers’ products. Economic downturns often have had an adverse effect upon manufacturers and end-\nusers of electronics products. The timing of new product developments, the lifecycle of existing electronics products and\nthe level of acceptance and growth of new products can also affect demand for our products. Downturns in the markets we\nserve could have a significant negative impact on the demand for our products. Additionally, due to changing conditions,\nour customers have experienced and may in the future experience periods of excess inventory that could have a significant\nadverse impact on our sales. During a downturn in any of the markets that we serve, there is also a higher risk that some\nof our trade receivables become delinquent or even uncollectible and that our inventory would decrease in value. We\ncannot predict the timing or the severity of the cycles within our industries. In particular, it is difficult to predict how long and\nto what levels any industry upturn or downturn, or general economic strength or weakness, will last or develop. Reduced\ndemand for our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nFluctuations in average selling prices may have a material adverse effect on our business,\nresults of operations and financial condition.\nThe markets for our Integrated Memory products have historically been characterized by declines in average selling prices.\nOur average selling prices may decline due to several factors, including general declines in demand for our products and\nexcess supply of DRAM and Flash memory components, including as a result of overcapacity. In the past, transitions to\nsmaller design geometries and other factors causing overcapacity in memory markets have led to significant increases in\nthe worldwide supply of memory components. If not accompanied by increases in demand, supply increases usually result\nin significant declines in component prices and, in turn, declines in the average selling prices and profit margins of our\nproducts. During periods of oversupply, our net sales may decline if we fail to increase sales volume of existing products or\nto introduce and sell new products in quantities sufficient to offset declines in selling prices. Our efforts to increase sales or\nto introduce new products to offset the impact of declines in average selling prices may not be successful. Furthermore, our\ncompetitors and customers also impose significant pricing pressures on us. Declines in average selling prices have in the\npast had, and may again in the future have, a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition. Declines in average selling prices also might enable OEMs to pre-install higher density memory modules into\nnew systems at existing price points, thereby reducing the demand for future memory upgrades. In addition, our net sales\nand gross profit may be negatively affected by shifts in our product mix during periods of declining average selling prices.\n19\nTariffs or other trade restrictions or taxes have had in the past, and could have in the future, an\nadverse impact on our operations.\nWe source materials from and sell and manufacture products in foreign countries, including China, making the price and\navailability of our merchandise susceptible to international trade risks and other international conditions. For example, any\neconomic and political uncertainty caused by the U.S. tariffs imposed on goods from China, among other potential\ncountries, and any corresponding tariffs or currency devaluations from China or such other countries in response, has\nnegatively impacted, and may in the future, negatively impact, demand and/or increase the cost for certain of our products,\nparticularly within our LED business. In addition, many of our customers rely heavily on international trade. The imposition\nof tariffs, duties, border adjustment taxes or other trade restrictions by the United States could also result in the adoption of\nnew or increased tariffs or other trade restrictions by other countries. Tariffs may in the future increase our cost of materials\nand may cause us to increase prices to our customers which we believe may reduce demand for our products. Our price\nincreases may not be sufficient to fully offset the impact of tariffs and may result in lowering our margin on products sold. If\nthe United States Government increases or implements additional tariffs, or if additional tariffs or trade restrictions are\nimplemented by other countries, the resulting trade barriers could have a significant adverse impact on our suppliers, our\ncustomers and on our business. We are not able to predict future trade policy of the United States (including any potential\nchanges in U.S. trade policy if there is a change in administration) or of any foreign countries in which we operate or\npurchase goods, or the terms of any trade agreements or their impact on our business. The adoption and expansion of\ntrade restrictions and tariffs, quotas and embargoes, the occurrence of a trade war or other governmental action related to\ntariffs or trade agreements or policies, has the potential to adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, our\ncustomers, our suppliers and the world and U.S. economies, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, operating results and financial condition.\nWe depend on a select number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue.\nOur principal customers include global distributors, enterprise users, government agencies and OEMs that compete in the\ncomputing, networking, communications, storage, aerospace, government, mobile, industrial automation, IoT, industrial IoT,\ngovernment, military and lighting markets. In 2024, 2023 and 2022, sales to our ten largest end customers (including sales\nto contract manufacturers or ODMs at the direction of such end customers) accounted for 58%, 60% and 62% of net sales,\nrespectively. In 2024, 2023 and 2022, we had one, one and three customers account individually for over 10% of our net\nsales. In some cases, our customers also compete with us and/or are our major suppliers. We expect that sales to\nrelatively few customers, including distributors in our Optimized LED business, will continue to account for a significant\npercentage of our net sales for the foreseeable future. However, we can provide no assurance that any of these customers\nor any of our other customers will continue to utilize our products or our services at current levels, or at all, since sales of\nour products are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders and are not based on long-term supply agreements. Although\nwe have master agreements with some of our customers, these agreements govern the terms and conditions of the\nrelationship and do not typically contain requirements for them to purchase minimum volumes. Because of the uncertainty\nof the timing and volume of orders from our customers, sales to our customers have varied from period to period and may\nvary significantly in the future, and our ability to forecast our sales have been, and may in the future be, difficult. Our\ncustomer concentration may also subject us to perceived or actual bargaining leverage that our key customers may have,\ngiven their relative size and importance to us. Since a large percentage of our sales is to a small number of customers that\nare primarily large enterprises or OEMs, these customers are able to exert, have exerted and we expect will continue to\nexert, pressure on us to make concessions on price and on terms and conditions which can adversely affect our business,\nresults of operations and financial condition. If our key customers seek to negotiate their agreements on terms less\nfavorable to us and we accept such unfavorable terms, such unfavorable terms may have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, our services include point-in-time services, such as\ndesign and implementation, as well as longer-term managed services that are typically subject to renewal after an initial\nterm of a year or sometimes longer. Accordingly, unless and until we diversify and expand our customer base, our future\nsuccess will significantly depend upon the timing and volume of business from our largest customers and the financial and\noperational success of these customers. Furthermore, many of our customer and supplier markets are characterized by a\nlimited number of large companies. Industry consolidation and company failures could decrease the number of potential\nsignificant customers for our products and services. The decrease in the number of potential significant customers will\nincrease our reliance on key customers and, due to the increased size of these companies, may negatively impact our\nbargaining position and thus our profit margins. If we were to lose one of our key customers or have a key customer cancel\na key program or otherwise significantly\n20\nreduce its volume of business with us or fail to pay us in full for the goods or services purchased from us, our sales and\nprofitability would be materially reduced and our business and financial condition would be seriously harmed.\nIssues in the development of, our investment in, and use of AI or AI solutions, combined with\nan uncertain regulatory environment, may result in a material adverse impact on our business,\nresults of operations and financial condition, reputational harm, liability or other adverse\nconsequences to our business operations.\nWe are making significant investments in AI initiatives, including designing, building, deploying and managing AI and high-\nperformance computing infrastructure. AI technologies, markets and related demand trends are complex and rapidly\nevolving, and we face significant competition from other companies, including companies with greater resources than ours,\nand an evolving regulatory landscape. If we fail to develop and timely offer AI solutions or keep pace with the product\nofferings of our competitors, or if demand for such products does not grow as anticipated, our business could be adversely\naffected. We may incur significant costs, resources, investments and delays and not achieve a return on investment or\ncapitalize on opportunities presented by AI.\nThe introduction of AI technologies into new or existing products may result in new or enhanced governmental or regulatory\nscrutiny, litigation, confidentiality or security risks, ethical concerns, or other complications that could materially and\nadversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Existing laws and regulations may apply to us or\nour customers in new ways, and new laws and regulations may be instituted, the effects of which are difficult to predict.\nThe intellectual property ownership and license rights, including copyright, surrounding AI technologies has not been fully\naddressed by courts or national or local laws or regulations, and any use or adoption of third-party AI technologies into our\nproducts and services may result in exposure to claims of copyright infringement or other intellectual property\nmisappropriation.\nAdditionally, the rapid evolution of AI technologies requires the application of resources to help to ensure that AI is\nimplemented responsibly in order to minimize unintended, harmful impact. The development and use of AI technologies\npresents emerging ethical and social issues, and if we enable or offer solutions that draw scrutiny or controversy due to\ntheir perceived or actual impact on customers or on society as a whole, we may experience brand or reputational harm,\ncompetitive harm and/or legal liability.\nThe markets that we serve are highly competitive.\nThe markets that we serve are characterized by intense competition. Our competitors include many large domestic and\ninternational companies that have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution and other resources,\ngreater name recognition, broader product lines, lower cost structures and longer-standing relationships with customers\nand suppliers than we do. As a result, our competitors may be able to respond better to new or emerging technologies,\nsuch as generative AI, or standards and to changes in customer requirements. Further, some of our competitors are in\nbetter financial and marketing positions from which to influence industry acceptance of a particular product or service\nstandard or competing technology than we are. Our competitors may also be able to devote greater resources to the\ndevelopment, promotion and sale of products and services, and may be able to deliver competitive products and services\nat a lower price than we can. In addition to competing with certain portions of our product and services offerings, certain of\nour competitors are also our significant customers, suppliers, or both. Finally, China’s stated national policy to be a global\nleader in all segments of the semiconductor industry by 2030 has resulted in and may continue to cause increased\ncompetitive capability in China.\nAcross all of our markets, we also expect to face new companies that may enter our existing or future markets with similar\nor alternative offerings, which may be less costly or provide additional features. We also face competition from current and\nprospective customers that evaluate our capabilities against the merits of manufacturing products or developing solutions\ninternally. Competition may also arise due to the development of cooperative relationships among our current and potential\ncompetitors and/or suppliers or third parties to increase the ability of their offerings to address the needs of our prospective\ncustomers. Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors and/or suppliers may emerge\nand acquire significant market share.\nCompetitive pressure has led in the past and may continue to lead to intensified price competition resulting in lower net\nsales and lower profit margins which could negatively impact our financial performance. Our efforts to\n21\nmaintain and improve our competitive position, or our failure to do so, could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be unable to optimally match purchasing and production to customer demand, which\nmay have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nIn most cases we do not obtain long-term purchase orders or commitments from our customers, but instead we work with\nour customers to develop non-binding estimates or forecasts of future requirements. Utilizing these non-binding estimates\nor forecasts, we make significant decisions based on our estimates of customer requirements including determining the\nlevels of business that we will seek and accept, production scheduling, component purchasing and procurement\ncommitments, inventory levels, product development or customization, personnel and production facility needs and other\nresource requirements. Customers may cancel, reduce or delay orders that were either previously made or anticipated,\noften with little or no notice to us, and generally without penalty, which can result in us having underutilized resources or\nexcess materials. Conversely, customers may require rapid increases in production, which can challenge our resources\nand can reduce profit margins. We may not have sufficient capacity at any given time to meet our customers’ demands. As\nmany of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed, reduction in customer demand has had in the past, and\ncould in the future have, a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAdditionally, we have had in the past and expect we could again have in the future, inventory write-downs and/or write-offs\ndue to obsolescence, excess quantities (including due to decreased demand) and declines in market value below our\ncosts. In particular, if product obsolescence causes product demand to decrease or we fail to forecast demand accurately,\nwe could be required to write-off inventory or record underutilization charges, which would have a negative impact on our\nprofit margins and our profitability. Any one or more of these occurrences could have a negative impact on our results of\noperations and financial condition.\nOur future success depends on our ability to develop new products and services.\nThe markets that we serve are subject to rapid technological change, product obsolescence, frequent new product\nintroductions and feature enhancements, changes in end-user requirements, evolving industry standards, and frequent\ninnovations and disruptions in the markets in which we compete for products and services. Our ability to successfully\ncompete and to continue to grow our business depends in significant part upon our ability to develop, introduce and sell\nnew and enhanced products and services on a timely and cost-effective basis, and to anticipate and respond to changing\ncustomer requirements and competition. We have invested and expect to continue to invest heavily in research and\ndevelopment for new and innovative products, including AI solutions. In addition, we have invested and expect to continue\nto invest significant time and capital into developing infrastructure, employee training and marketing efforts to expand our\nservices offerings. However, there can be no guarantee that our evolving business strategy or our efforts will be successful\nor that our new products or services will gain market acceptance, be price competitive or result in any significant increase\nin our net sales. If these investments fail to provide the expected returns, then such failure could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAdditionally, we have experienced, and may experience in the future, delays and unanticipated expenses in the\ndevelopment and introduction of new products and services. A failure to develop products with required feature sets or\nperformance standards, or delays in the development, introduction and qualification of new products or services, could\nsignificantly reduce our return on investment as well as our net sales, provide a competitor a first-to-market advantage and\nallow a competitor to achieve greater market share, or cause our customers to cancel their orders (generally without\npenalty), all of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur customers often require that our products undergo a lengthy and expensive process of\nevaluation and qualification without any assurance of net sales.\nOur products are often incorporated into customers’ systems at the design stage. We rely on OEM and other customers to\nselect our product designs, which we refer to as design wins, and then to qualify our products for production buys. With\nOEM and other customers, we often incur significant expenditures in the development of new products without any\nassurance that the customer will select our products for purchase. Furthermore, even if\n22\na customer designs one of our products into its system, we cannot be assured that they will qualify or use our product in\nproduction, that the customer’s product will be commercially successful or that we will receive significant orders as a result\nof that design win or qualification. Generally, our customers are not obligated to purchase our products even if we achieve\na design win. If we are unable to achieve design wins or if our customers’ systems incorporating our products are not\ncommercially successful, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nIn addition, because the qualification process is both product-specific and platform-specific, our existing customers\nsometimes require us to re-qualify our products, or to qualify our new products, for use in new platforms or applications,\nwhich can be time-consuming and cause reductions in our net sales during the design and qualification period. Likewise,\nwhen our suppliers discontinue production of components, it may be necessary for us to design and qualify new products\nfor our customers. Such customers may require of us or we may decide to purchase an estimated quantity of discontinued\ncomponents necessary to help to ensure a steady supply of existing products until products with new components can be\nqualified. Purchases of this nature may not be available, or they may affect our liquidity. Additionally, our estimation of\nquantities required during a transition may be incorrect, which could adversely impact our results of operations through lost\nrevenue opportunities or charges related to excess and obsolete inventory.\nWe must devote substantial resources, including design, engineering, sales, marketing and management efforts, to qualify\nour products with existing and prospective customers in anticipation of sales. Significant delays in the qualification process\ncould result in an inability to keep up with rapid technological change or new, competitive technologies. If we delay or do\nnot succeed in qualifying a product with an existing or prospective customer, we will not be able to sell that product to that\ncustomer, which may result in us losing potential revenue and holding excess or obsolete inventory, any of which may have\na material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf our OEM customers decide to utilize standardized solutions instead of our specialty\nproducts, our net sales and market share may decline.\nMany of our specialty products are specifically designed for our OEM customers’ systems or products. In an effort to\nreduce costs, a number of our OEM customers design standardized or commodity components, modules or subsystems\ninto their products. Although we also manufacture standard components, modules and subsystems, an increase in such\nefforts by our customers could reduce the demand for our higher priced specialized or customized solutions, which in turn\nwould have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, when customers\nutilizing custom solutions choose to adopt a standard instead of custom or specialty components, modules or subsystems,\nnew competitors producing standard components, modules or subsystems may take a portion of our customers’ business\npreviously purchased from us.\nWe depend on a small number of sole or limited source suppliers.\nWe are dependent upon a small number of sole or limited source suppliers for certain materials, including certain critical\ncomponents or subsystems, we use in manufacturing our products. Purchases from our two largest suppliers were $0.4\nbillion, $0.5 billion and $0.9 billion in each of 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Certain of our suppliers also compete with\nus in one or more of our markets. We purchase almost all of our materials from our suppliers on a purchase order basis\nand generally do not have long-term commitments from suppliers. Our suppliers are not required to supply us with any\nminimum quantities, and there is no assurance that our suppliers will supply the quantities of components we may need to\nmeet our production goals.\nThe markets in which we operate have in the past experienced, are currently experiencing, and may in the future\nexperience, shortages and long lead times in certain materials, including certain critical components, we use in\nmanufacturing our products. These shortages cause some suppliers to place their customers, including us, on supply\nallocation. As a result, we may not be able to obtain the materials that we need to fill customer orders in a timely fashion or\nat all. If any of our suppliers experience quality control or intellectual property infringement problems, this may further\nimpact our ability to fill customer orders. Furthermore, our products that utilize that supplier’s materials may be disqualified\nby one or more of our customers and we may not be able to fill their orders.\nA disruption in or termination of our supply relationship with any of our significant suppliers or our inability to develop\nrelationships with new suppliers, if required, would cause delays, disruptions or reductions in product\n23\nmanufacturing and shipments or require product redesigns which could damage relationships with our customers, increase\nour costs, reduce our margins or increase the prices we need to charge for our products and could materially and\nadversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAdditionally, there are increasing expectations in various jurisdictions that companies monitor the environmental and social\nperformance of their suppliers, including compliance with a variety of labor practices, as well as consider a wider range of\npotential environmental and social matters, including the end-of-life considerations for products. Compliance can be costly,\nrequire us to establish or augment programs to diligence or monitor our suppliers, or to design supply chains to avoid\ncertain regions altogether. Failure to comply with such regulations can result in fines, reputational damage, or import\nineligibility for our products or product components, or otherwise adversely impact our business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nWe may be unable to adapt to technological change.\nThe industries in which we conduct business are characterized by constant and rapid technological changes and product\nobsolescence. For example, new manufacturing process technologies using smaller feature sizes and offering better\nperformance characteristics are generally introduced every one to two years. The introduction of new manufacturing\nprocess technologies allows us to increase the functionality of our products while at the same time optimizing performance\nparameters, decreasing power consumption and/or increasing storage capacity. In order to remain competitive, it is\nessential that we secure the capabilities to develop and qualify new manufacturing process technologies. If we are delayed\nin transitioning to new technologies, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially\nadversely affected.\nIf the lifecycle of a product is shortened as a result of the introduction of a new technology, we may be forced to transition\nour manufacturing capabilities to a new configuration more quickly than originally planned. This can result in increased\ncapital and other expenditures and decreases in demand for the older technology products. As a result, we may be\nrequired to record additional obsolescence charges or an impairment on our long-lived assets, including facilities and\nequipment, as well as intangible assets, which would increase our expenses. When new technologies are introduced, our\ncapacity and the capacity of our suppliers to manufacture the new products often cannot meet the demand or expected\ntimelines, and product shortages or delays can arise. If we or our suppliers cannot support such demand or expected\ntimelines, we may not be able to fill customer orders or participate in new markets as they emerge, and our relationships\nwith customers and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted.\nWe may not be able to maintain or improve our manufacturing efficiency.\nOur manufacturing efficiency can significantly affect our results of operations, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to\nmaintain or increase our manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors. During periods when we are\nimplementing new process technologies, manufacturing facilities may not be fully productive and may experience higher\nthan acceptable defect rates. We may fail to achieve acceptable yields or may experience product delivery delays as a\nresult of, among other things, capacity constraints, delays in the development of new process technologies, increased\ndefect rates, changes in our process technologies, upgrades or expansion of existing facilities, impurities or other\ndifficulties in the manufacturing process. Any of these occurrences could adversely impact our relationships with\ncustomers, cause harm to our reputation in the marketplace, cause customers to move future business to our competitors\nor cause us to make financial concessions to our customers. Improving our manufacturing efficiency in future periods is\ndependent on our ability to:\n• develop advanced process technologies and advanced products that utilize those technologies;\n• successfully transition to more advanced process technologies;\n• continue to reduce test times;\n• ramp product and process technology improvements rapidly and effectively to commercial volumes across our\nfacilities;\n• achieve acceptable levels of manufacturing output and yields, which may decrease as we implement more\nadvanced technologies; and\n• maintain our quality controls and rely upon the quality and process controls of our suppliers.\n24\nDisruption of our operations at any one of our manufacturing facilities would substantially\nharm our business.\nWe rely on a limited number of production facilities for each of our various product lines. A disruption at one of our\nmanufacturing facilities could adversely impact our manufacturing operations and consequently our customer relations and\nour business. Such a disruption could result from, among other things, severe or chronic weather conditions, including in\nconnection with climate change, local outbreaks of infectious diseases, sustained process abnormalities, government\nintervention, waste disposal issues, power failures or other circumstances, or from ramp-up related challenges, such as\nobtaining sufficient raw materials, hiring of qualified factory personnel, installation and efficient operation of new equipment\nand management and coordination of our logistics networks within our global operations. We maintain insurance to protect\nagainst certain claims associated with business interruption, however, our insurance may not cover all or any part of a\nparticular loss. Since a large percentage of our production is done in a small number of facilities, a disruption to operations,\nor a loss that is in excess of, or excluded from, our insurance coverage could adversely impact our business, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to a number of procurement laws and regulations.\nWith respect to a portion of our business, we must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the\naward, administration and performance of government contracts in the United States and other countries. Government\ncontract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and impose certain risks and costs on our\nbusiness. A violation of specific laws and regulations by us, our employees, others working on our behalf, a supplier or a\nventure partner, could harm our reputation and result in the imposition of fines and penalties, the termination of our\ncontracts, suspension or debarment from bidding on or being awarded contracts, loss of our ability to export products or\nservices and civil or criminal investigations or proceedings. A termination arising out of our default may expose us to liability\nand may have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders. Additionally, if an audit or\ninvestigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties and administrative\nsanctions, including reductions of the value of contracts, contract modifications or terminations, forfeiture of profits,\nsuspension of payments, penalties, fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the government. We\ncould also suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us. Similar government\noversight exists in most other countries where we conduct business.\nContracts with the United States Government may be terminated, cancelled or modified.\nCertain of the United States Government programs in which we participate as a contractor or subcontractor may extend for\nseveral years and include one or more base years and one or more option years. Under some contracts, the government\ngenerally has the right not to exercise options to extend or expand our contracts and may otherwise terminate, cancel,\nmodify or curtail our contracts at its convenience. Any decision by a government agency not to exercise contract options or\nto terminate, cancel, modify or curtail any major programs or contracts would adversely affect our revenues, revenue\ngrowth and profitability. We may experience periodic performance issues under certain of our contracts. Depending on the\nnature and value of the contract, a performance issue or termination for default could cause our actual results to differ from\nthose anticipated and could harm our reputation and our operating results and financial condition.\nProducts that fail to meet specifications, are defective or that are otherwise incompatible with\nend uses could impose significant costs on us.\nIf our products are defectively manufactured, contain defective components or are used in defective or malfunctioning\nsystems, we could be subject to warranty and product liability claims and product recalls, safety alerts or advisory notices.\nFor example, certain of our products are used in transportation safety devices in the rail industry. These products are\ncertified by independent auditors to safety integrity level 4 standards. In the event that our products fail to perform as\nexpected, accidents and significant losses could occur. While our contracts for the sale of these products typically contain\ndisclaimers, there can be no assurance that we would be insulated from liability in the event of an accident. While we have\nproduct liability insurance coverage, it may not be adequate to satisfy claims made against us. We also may be unable to\nobtain insurance in the future at satisfactory rates or in adequate amounts. Investigations, warranty and product liability\nclaims and product recalls, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition and\n25\nreputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers. In addition, we may determine that it is in our best interest to\naccept product returns in circumstances where we are not contractually obligated to do so to maintain good relations with\nour customers. Accepting product returns may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. Further,\nquality issues in customer installations have occurred in the past and could occur in the future, which have in the past\naffected, and could possibly affect in the future, customer relationships, demand for products and our reputation. Quality\nissues and potential impact to our reputation may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nActual or perceived failures or breaches of our information and security systems, or those of\nour customers, suppliers or business partners, could expose us to losses.\nWe rely on computer systems, hardware, software, technology infrastructure and online sites and networks for both internal\nand external operations that are critical to our business (collectively, “IT Systems”). We own and manage some of these IT\nSystems but also rely on third parties for a range of IT Systems and related products and services.\nWe have experienced cybersecurity incidents in the past, though none have materially impacted our Company, including\nour operations or financial condition. There can be no guarantee that future cyberattacks or incidents will not materially\nimpact our Company generally or our IT Systems or data or that of critical service providers specifically. We face numerous\nand evolving cybersecurity risks that threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our IT Systems and data. Those\nrisks include data security incidents, cybersecurity events, data breaches, ransomware attacks or other compromises of\nthe IT Systems we or that our vendors use to provide services or process data on our behalf, which may lead to\ncompromised network security and misappropriation or compromise of our information or that of third parties, system\ndisruptions or lead to shutdowns. Cyberattack actors include criminal hackers, hacktivists, state-sponsored intrusions, and\nmay involve industrial espionage, employee malfeasance and human or technological error. Computer hackers and others\nroutinely attempt to breach the security of technology products, services and systems, and to fraudulently induce\nemployees, customers and other third parties to disclose information or unwittingly provide access to systems or data. The\nrisk of such attacks includes attempted breaches not only of our own products, services and systems, but also those of\ncustomers, contractors, business partners, vendors and other third parties.\nOur products, services and systems may be used in critical company, customer, government or other third-party\noperations, or involve the storage, processing and transmission of sensitive data, including valuable intellectual property,\nclassified information, other proprietary or confidential data, regulated data and personal information of employees,\ncustomers and others. In our on-demand and hosted solutions, such as POD, we process, store and transmit data\nprovided by our customers, which may include sensitive and personal data. We also manage, store, transmit and otherwise\nprocess various sensitive personal or confidential data related to our company and our employees in the regular course of\nbusiness. Successful breaches, employee malfeasance or human or technological error could result in, for example,\nunauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse, loss or destruction of company, customer, government or other\nthird party data or systems; theft of sensitive, regulated, classified or confidential data including personal information and\nintellectual property; the loss of access to critical data or systems through distributed denial-of-service attacks, denial-of-\nservice attacks, ransomware attacks, supply chain attacks, destructive attacks or other means; and business delays,\nservice or system disruptions or denials of service. Further, hardware and operating system software and applications that\nwe produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including “bugs” and other\nproblems that could interfere with the operation of such systems. Given the nature of complex systems, software and\nservices like ours, and the scanning tools that we deploy across our networks, infrastructure and products, we regularly\nidentify and track security vulnerabilities. We are unable to comprehensively guarantee patches or confirm that measures\nare in place to mitigate all such vulnerabilities, or that patches will be applied before vulnerabilities are exploited by a threat\nactor. If attackers are able to exploit critical vulnerabilities before patches are installed or mitigating measures are\nimplemented, significant compromises could impact our and our customers’ systems and data.\nThe information technology systems we and our vendors use are vulnerable to outages, breakdowns or other damage or\ninterruption from service interruptions, system malfunction, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication and\nelectrical failures. For example, in July 2024, a software update by CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (“CrowdStrike”), a\ncybersecurity technology company, caused widespread crashes of Windows systems into which it was integrated. Although\nwe have not experienced any material impacts as a result of the CrowdStrike software update, we could in the future\nexperience similar third-party software-induced interruptions to our operations, which would adversely affect our business,\nresults of operations and financial condition.\n26\nCyberattacks are expected to accelerate on a global basis in both frequency and magnitude as threat actors are becoming\nincreasingly sophisticated in using techniques and tools (including AI) that circumvent controls, evade detection and even\nremove forensic evidence. Further, the use of AI by us, our customers, suppliers, and third-party service providers, among\nothers, may also introduce unique vulnerabilities. As a result, there can be no assurance that the systems we have\ndesigned to protect against cyberattacks, or our cybersecurity risk management program and processes, will be fully\nimplemented, complied with or sufficient to identify, detect or prevent material consequences arising from such attacks in\nthe future. In addition, we have acquired and continue to acquire companies that may have cybersecurity vulnerabilities\nand/or unsophisticated security measures, which could expose us to significant cybersecurity, operational, and financial\nrisks.\nThe costs to address product defects or any of the foregoing security problems and security vulnerabilities before or after a\ncyber incident could be significant. Remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays or\ncessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales, manufacturing, distribution or\nother critical functions. We could lose existing or potential customers for outsourcing services or other information\ntechnology solutions in connection with any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products. In addition,\nbreaches of our IT Systems or security measures and the unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive\nor confidential data about us or our customers or other third parties could expose us, our customers or other third parties\naffected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in regulatory enforcement, litigation and potential liability,\ndamage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business. Further, we rely in certain limited capacities on third-\nparty data management providers and other vendors whose own security vulnerabilities or problems may have similar\ndetrimental effects on us.\nActual or perceived non-compliance with applicable data privacy and security laws, or that of\nour customers, suppliers or business partners, could expose us to losses.\nWe are subject to laws, rules and regulations in the United States and other countries relating to the collection, use,\ntransmission, processing and security of user and other data. Our ability to execute transactions and to possess, process,\ntransmit and use personal information and data in conducting our business, for example with respect to our marketing\nefforts, which include email marketing and telemarketing, subjects us to legislative and regulatory obligations that, among\nother things, may require us to expend time, financial and other resources to monitor and interpret ever-evolving and\ncomplex data privacy and security laws.\nIn particular, certain states have adopted new or modified privacy and security laws and regulations that may apply to our\nbusiness, for example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) imposes obligations on businesses that process\npersonal information of California residents. Among other things, the CCPA: requires disclosures to such residents about\nthe data collection, use and disclosure practices of covered businesses; provides such individuals expanded rights to\naccess, delete and correct their personal information and opt-out of certain transfers of personal information; and provides\nsuch individuals with a private right of action and statutory damages for data breaches. The enactment of the CCPA has\nprompted a wave of similar laws being passed in the United States, which creates the potential for a patchwork of\noverlapping but different state laws. For example, since the CCPA went into effect, certain other states, including Colorado,\nConnecticut, Delaware, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New\nHampshire, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Virginia, have all enacted comprehensive data privacy\nlegislation. We cannot predict the full impact of these laws on our business or operations. Many other states are currently\nreviewing or proposing the need for greater regulation of the collection, sharing, use and other processing of information\nrelated to individuals for marketing purposes or otherwise, and there remains increased interest at the federal level as well.\nAdditionally, other jurisdictions outside of the United States have or have recently enacted privacy and cybersecurity laws,\nsuch as the EU and the European Union where the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) took effect in May 2018,\ncreating the potential for a patchwork of overlapping but different laws.\nWe have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant expenses to comply with mandatory privacy and security standards\nand protocols under applicable laws, regulations, industry standards and contractual obligations. Despite such\nexpenditures, we may face regulatory and other legal actions in the event of perceived or actual non-compliance with such\napplicable obligations. Many of these laws would also require us to notify regulators and customers, employees or other\nindividuals of any data security breach as described above. The various data privacy enactments impose significant\nobligations and compliance with these requirements depends in part on\n27\nhow particular regulators apply and interpret them. Even though we believe we are generally in compliance with applicable\nlaws, rules and regulations relating to privacy and data security, these laws are in some cases relatively new and the\ninterpretation and application of these laws are uncertain. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with data privacy\nlaws, rules, regulations, industry standards and other requirements could result in proceedings or actions against us by\nindividuals, consumer rights groups, government agencies or others. We could incur significant costs in investigating and\ndefending such claims and, if found liable, pay significant damages or fines or be required to make changes to our\nbusiness. Further, these proceedings and any subsequent adverse outcomes may subject us to significant negative\npublicity and an erosion of trust. If any of these events were to occur, our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition could be materially adversely affected.\nSome of our offerings utilize open source software, which may pose particular risks to our\nproprietary software, products and services in a manner that could harm our business.\nMany of our Advanced Computing offerings, including Linux-based products and Penguin Solutions’ ClusterWare products,\nincorporate software components licensed under various open source licenses. The terms of many open source licenses to\nwhich we are subject have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and there is a risk that open source software\nlicenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide or\ndistribute our products or services. We could face claims from third parties claiming ownership of, or demanding release of,\nthe open source software or derivative works that we developed using such software, which could implicate aspects of our\nproprietary code. These claims could result in litigation and could require us to make our software source code freely\navailable to the public, purchase a costly license or cease offering the implicated products or services. Such claims may\nrequire us to re-engineer our offerings to avoid an undesirable open source license or infringement, which may be costly\nand time-consuming. Additionally, some open source software may include generative AI technologies or other software\nthat incorporates or relies on generative AI models or other AI technologies. The use of such software may expose us to\nrisks as the intellectual property ownership and license rights, including copyrights, surrounding AI technologies, has not\nbeen fully interpreted by courts or national or local laws or regulations, and any use or adoption of third-party AI\ntechnologies into our products and services may result in exposure to claims of copyright infringement or other intellectual\nproperty misappropriation.\nIn addition to risks related to open source license requirements, usage of open source software can lead to greater risks\nthan use of third-party commercial software. Increased risks arise in part because open source licensors generally do not\nprovide updates, warranties, support, indemnities or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the\nquality of the code, including with respect to security vulnerabilities where open source software may be more susceptible.\nThese third-party open source providers could experience service outages, data loss, privacy breaches, cyberattacks,\nransomware and other events relating to the applications and services they provide that could diminish the utility of these\nservices, which could harm our business as a result. To the extent that Advanced Computing offerings depend upon the\nsuccessful operation and continued updates and support of the open source software it uses, any undetected errors or\ndefects in this open source software could prevent the deployment or impair the functionality of Advanced Computing\nofferings, delay the release of new product solutions, result in a failure of our offerings and injure our reputation. If open\nsource programmers fail to adequately further develop and enhance open source technologies, we would have to rely on\nother parties to develop and enhance our offerings or we would need to develop and enhance our offerings with our own\nresources. We cannot predict whether further developments and enhancements to these technologies would be available\nfrom reliable alternative sources. Moreover, if third-party software programmers fail to adequately further develop and\nenhance open source technologies, the development and adoption of these technologies could be stifled and our offerings\ncould become less competitive. Any of these risks could be difficult to eliminate or manage and, if not addressed, could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOpen source software may make it easier for competitors, some of which may have greater\nresources than we have, to enter our markets and compete with us.\nOne of the characteristics of open source software is that anyone may modify and redistribute the existing open source\nsoftware and use it to compete with us. Such competition can develop without the degree of overhead and lead time\nrequired by traditional proprietary software companies. It is possible for competitors with greater\n28\n\nresources than ours to develop their own open source solutions or acquire a smaller business that has developed open\nsource offerings that compete with our offerings, potentially reducing the demand for, and putting price pressure on, our\nofferings. In addition, some competitors make their open source software available for free download and use on an ad hoc\nbasis or may position their open source software as a loss leader. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete\nsuccessfully against current and future competitors or that competitive pressure and/or the availability of open source\nsoftware will not result in price reductions, reduced operating margins and loss of market share. Additionally, any failure by\nus to provide high-quality technical support, or the perception that we do not provide high-quality technical support, could\nharm our reputation and negatively impact our ability to sell subscriptions for our open source offerings to existing and\nprospective customers. If we are unable to differentiate our open source offerings from those of our competitors or compete\neffectively with other open source offerings, our business, financial condition, operation results and cash flows could be\nadversely affected.\nIn our Advanced Computing business, we regularly contribute software source code under open source licenses and have\nmade other technology we developed available under other open licenses, and we include open source software in our\nproducts. For example, we have contributed certain technology related to our products to the OCP Foundation, a non-profit\nentity that shares and develops such information with the technology community, under the Open Web Foundation License.\nAs a result of our open source contributions and the use of open source in our products, we may license or be required to\nlicense or disclose code and/or innovations that turn out to be material to our business and may also be exposed to\nincreased litigation risk. As a result of making certain of our technology available to third parties, the value of our brands\nand other intangible assets may be diminished and competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our products,\nservices and methods of operations which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. Likewise, if\nthe protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use or appropriation by third parties, the value\nof our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished and competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our\nproducts, services and methods of operations. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and\nfinancial results.\nWe could be prevented from selling or developing our software if our licenses are not\nenforceable or are modified so as to become incompatible with other open source licenses.\nA number of our Advanced Computing offerings have been developed and licensed under the GNU General Public License\nand similar open source licenses. These licenses state that any program licensed under them may be liberally copied,\nmodified and distributed. It is possible that a court would hold these licenses to be unenforceable or that someone could\nassert a claim for proprietary rights in a program developed and distributed under them. Additionally, if any of the open\nsource components of our offerings may not be liberally copied, modified or distributed, then our ability to distribute or\ndevelop all or a portion of our offerings could be adversely impacted. In addition, licensors of open source software\nemployed in our offerings may, from time to time, modify the terms of their license agreements in such a manner that those\nlicense terms may become incompatible with other open source licenses in our offerings or our end user license\nagreement, and thus could, among other consequences, prevent us from distributing the software code subject to the\nmodified license.\nOur indemnification obligations to our customers and suppliers could require us to pay\nsubstantial damages.\nA number of our product sales and product purchase agreements provide that we will defend, indemnify and hold harmless\nour customers and suppliers from damages and costs which may arise from various matters including, without limitation,\nproduct warranty claims or claims for injury or damage resulting from defects in, or usage of, our products or the products\nof our suppliers. In addition, we currently have in effect a number of agreements in which we agree to defend, indemnify\nand hold harmless our customers and suppliers from damages and costs which may arise from the infringement or alleged\ninfringement by our products of third-party patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights. We periodically have to\nrespond to claims and may have to litigate indemnification obligations in the future.\nIndemnification obligations could require us to expend significant amounts of money to defend claims and/or to pay\ndamages or settlement amounts. We maintain insurance to protect against certain claims associated with the use of our\nproducts; however, our insurance may not cover all or any part of a claim asserted against us. Our\n29\ninsurance does not cover intellectual property infringement in most instances. A claim brought against us that is in excess\nof, or excluded from, our insurance coverage could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nWe may need to raise additional funds, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at\nall.\nWe may need to raise additional funds, which we may seek to obtain through, among other avenues, public or private\nequity offerings and debt financings. Additional funds may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we issue\nequity or convertible debt securities to raise additional funds, our existing shareholders may experience dilution and the\nnew equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our then existing shareholders.\nIf we incur additional debt, it may increase our leverage relative to our earnings or to our equity capitalization, as well as\nimpose financial and operating covenants that could restrict the operations of our business. In a rising interest rate\nenvironment, debt financing will become more expensive and may have higher transactional and servicing costs. In\naddition, our existing indebtedness may limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future, as discussed in greater\ndetail below under “Risks Relating to Our Debt – Our indebtedness could impair our financial condition and harm our ability\nto operate our business.”\nIn 2024, 2023 and 2022, we spent $19.4 million, $39.4 million and $20.4 million, respectively, on capital expenditures,\nwhich we used, among other things, to expand manufacturing and test capacity as well as research and development. In\nthe first quarter of 2023, we closed our acquisition of Stratus Technologies. The consideration for this acquisition consisted\nof approximately $225 million in cash, plus an earnout of up to $50 million based on the gross profit performance of the\nStratus Technologies business during the first full 12 fiscal months following the closing of the acquisition. In the second\nquarter of 2024, we paid in full $50.0 million related to the earnout. We plan to continue exploring additional acquisition\nopportunities in the future.\nIn July 2024, we entered into an agreement with SK Telecom Co., Ltd. (“SK”), pursuant to which we agreed to sell to SK\n200,000 convertible preferred shares (“CPS”) for an aggregate price of $200.0 million (the “Investment”). The closing of the\nInvestment remains subject to regulatory approvals and clearances and there can be no assurance that the Investment will\nclose on the timeline that we expect, or at all.\nIf adequate capital is not available when needed, we may be required to modify our business model and operations to\nreduce spending. This could cause us to be unable to execute our business plan, take advantage of future opportunities or\nrespond to competitive pressures or customer requirements. It may also cause us to delay, scale back or eliminate some or\nall of our research and development programs, or to reduce or cease operations, which could adversely impact our\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have in the past made, and may in the future make, acquisitions, investments and/or\nalliances, which involve numerous risks.\nAs part of our business and growth strategy, we have in the past and may in the future acquire or make significant\ninvestments in businesses, products or technologies, such as our acquisitions of Stratus Technologies, Cree’s LED\nbusiness, SMART EC, SMART Wireless and Penguin Computing. Any acquisitions or investments would expose us to the\nrisks commonly encountered in acquisitions of businesses or technologies. Such risks include, among others:\n• problems integrating the purchased operations, technologies, systems, processes, products or personnel;\n• unanticipated costs or expenses associated with an acquisition or investment, including write-offs of tangible\nassets as well as goodwill or other intangible assets;\n• negative effects on profitability resulting from an acquisition or investment;\n• adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;\n• the risk that suppliers (such as Wolfspeed, Inc.) or customers of an acquired business are unable or unwilling to do\nbusiness with us following the acquisition;\n• risks associated with entering markets in which we have little or no prior experience, such as the market for LED\nproducts that we entered following our acquisition of Cree’s LED business and markets with complex government\nregulations;\n• loss of key employees of the acquired business; and\n• litigation arising from an acquired company’s operations.\n30\nProblems encountered in connection with an acquisition could divert the attention of management, utilize scarce corporate\nresources and otherwise harm our business. Acquisitions may also lead to increased operational complexity, and\neffectively streamlining operations and processes of acquired businesses or entities requires management attention and\nexpenditures. If we make any future acquisitions, we could issue ordinary shares that would dilute our existing\nshareholders’ percentage ownership, incur substantial additional debt (such as the Purchase Price Note we issued in\nconnection with the acquisition of Cree’s LED business), expend cash and reduce our cash reserves or assume additional\nliabilities. Furthermore, acquisitions may require material charges and could result in adverse tax consequences,\nsubstantial depreciation, deferred compensation charges, liabilities under earnout provisions, the amortization of amounts\nrelated to deferred compensation and identifiable purchased intangible assets or impairment of goodwill or other\nintangibles, any of which could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are unable\nto predict whether or when any prospective acquisition candidate will become available or the likelihood that any\nacquisition will be completed. We may expend significant resources and management time pursuing an acquisition that we\nare unable to consummate. Even if we do find suitable acquisition opportunities, we may not be able to consummate the\nacquisitions on commercially acceptable terms or at all, or may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions we\ndo undertake, including our acquisition of Cree’s LED business. Our investments in private companies are subject to risk of\nloss of investment capital. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products\nthey may have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. We could lose our entire\ninvestment in these companies.\nWe may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of recent acquisitions.\nWe closed the acquisition of Stratus Technologies in August 2022. As we continue to integrate this business into our\noperations and portfolio, our ability to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may be impacted by\nthe following:\n• difficulties in the assimilation and successful integration of the operations, sales functions, technologies, products,\nsystems, processes, personnel and development capabilities;\n• failure to maintain and expand the customer bases of our acquired business;\n• difficulties in leveraging the Stratus Technologies research and development and product development capabilities\nto expand our products portfolio;\n• our failure to protect and expand their intellectual property and patent portfolios;\n• unanticipated costs, including write-offs of tangible assets as well as goodwill or other intangible assets, litigation or\nother contingent liabilities associated with the acquisition;\n• the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns;\n• adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;\n• risks associated with entering markets in which we have little or no prior experience and markets with complex\ngovernment regulations; and\n• loss of key employees of the acquired business.\nAny of these risks or other risks arising from the integration of Stratus Technologies’ business into our operations could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and could cause the impact of\nthe acquisition to be dilutive to our company.\nWe have incurred, and may in the future incur, impairment charges related to our goodwill,\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nWe have a significant amount of goodwill. As of August 30, 2024, we had goodwill of $162.0 million, which represented\n11% of our total assets as of such date. The carrying value of goodwill may be reduced if we determine that goodwill is\nimpaired. We test goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators of an\nimpairment exist, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying\nvalue. The testing of goodwill for impairment requires us to make significant estimates about future performance and cash\nflows, as well as other assumptions. These estimates can be affected by numerous factors, including potential changes in\neconomic, industry or market conditions; changes in business operations; changes in competition or changes in the price\nof our ordinary shares and market capitalization and other relevant events and factors affecting the fair value of the\nreporting unit. Changes in these\n31\nfactors, or changes in actual performance compared with estimates of our future performance, may affect the fair value of\ngoodwill and could result in an impairment charge.\nWe may incur liabilities relating to additional Brazilian withholding tax in connection with the\nsale of our Brazil business.\nIn connection with the sale of a majority of our interest in SMART Brazil to Lexar Europe, Lexar Europe withheld (from the\npurchase price otherwise payable to us) Brazilian capital gains tax (Iposto de Renda na Fonte Sobre Ganho de Capital),\nwith such tax being imposed on the excess of the purchase price over our tax basis in the SMART Brazil equity interests\nsold by us. The calculation of tax basis was based on our interpretation of current Brazilian law. We believe our\ninterpretation and calculations are correct, but if the Brazilian tax authorities were to successfully challenge our\ndetermination of the amount of withholding tax due, we would be required to indemnify Lexar Europe in respect of any\nadditional withholding taxes (together with any interest and penalties imposed). The amount of such additional withholding\ntaxes and our liability in respect of such taxes could be substantial.\nWe may not achieve the intended benefits of the sale of our Brazil business.\nWe may not realize some or all of the anticipated benefits from the sale of our Brazil business and such failure to realize\nanticipated benefits could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe sale of our Brazil business could impair our ability to protect our trademarks and brand.\nIn connection with the sale of our SMART Brazil business, we permitted Lexar Europe and the divested businesses to use\nof the word “SMART” in combination with pre-approved words and logos in trademarks, domain names, logos and other\nsource identifiers solely in Brazil (the “New Marks”). To prevent potential consumer confusion and protect our brands, and\nas a closing condition to the sale of our SMART Brazil business, we entered into an agreement with Lexar Europe and the\ndivested subsidiaries that includes a number of restrictions on Lexar Europe’s and the divested business’ use of the New\nMarks, including that: (i) the New Marks may not be used outside of Brazil or in connection with products that will be\nconsumed or exported outside of Brazil, (ii) the New Marks may only be used in connection with certain business and\nproducts, (iii) the word “SMART” may not be used alone as a brand name or source identifier and (iv) the New Marks must\ncomply with certain font, style, format and color restrictions to avoid similarity with our logos.\nWhile we have the foregoing contractual protections, there are no assurances (i) that Lexar Europe and the divested\nbusinesses will adhere to the contract or (ii) that customers or potential customers of our products and of Lexar Europe’s\nand its affiliates’ products will not have confusion as to source given the joint use of “SMART,” which could lead to dilution\nof our rights in our “SMART” marks and/or reputational harm. If disputes arise in the future with respect to the contractual\nrestrictions, we may not be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction. Although we changed\nour name from SMART Global Holdings, Inc. to Penguin Solutions, Inc. on October 15, 2024, the “SMART” brand is critical\nto our business and any consumer confusion, tarnishing or dilution of the “SMART” brand may have a material impact on\nour business.\nIf we are not able to maintain, develop and enhance our brand and our reputation, our business\nand results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe believe that maintaining, developing and enhancing our brand and our reputation is critical to our relationships with our\nexisting customers, suppliers and business partners and our ability to attract new customers and business partners. The\nsuccessful promotion of our business will depend on a number of factors, including our marketing efforts, and ultimately our\nability to continue to develop attractive products and to continue to provide services valued by customers. Although we\nbelieve it is important for our growth, our brand promotion activities may not be successful or yield increased revenue.\nOn October 15, 2024, we rebranded and changed our name from SMART Global Holdings, Inc. to Penguin Solutions, Inc.\nThis rebranding is a continuation of our strategic transformation over the past several years and reflects our focus on\ndelivering leading-edge solutions that seek to solve the complexity of AI. However, customers, suppliers and business\npartners may be confused by the name change and investors may not\n32\nperceive the expected benefits of our rebranding or business strategic efforts, which could materially and adversely impact\nour business, results of operations, financial condition and trading price of our ordinary shares.\nWe rely on third parties to sell a portion of our products and services.\nSales of our products to some of our OEM customers are accomplished, in part, through the efforts of third-party sales\nrepresentatives and, particularly in the case of our LED business, third-party distributors. We are unable to predict the\nextent to which these third-party sales representatives and distributors will be successful in marketing and selling our\nproducts. Moreover, many of these third-party sales representatives and distributors also market and sell competing\nproducts and may more aggressively pursue sales of our competitors’ products. Our third-party sales representatives and\ndistributors may terminate their relationships with us at any time on short or no notice. Our future performance may also\ndepend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain additional third-party sales representatives and distributors that will be\nable to market and support our products effectively, especially in markets in which we have not previously sold our\nproducts. If we cannot retain our current third-party sales representatives and distributors or recruit additional or\nreplacement third-party sales representatives and distributors or if these sales representatives or distributors are not\neffective, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be unable to protect our intellectual property.\nOur success is dependent, in part, upon protecting our intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of trade\nsecrets, trademarks, copyrights, patents and other forms of intellectual property, contractual restrictions and confidentiality\nprocedures to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Much of the intellectual property created in our Integrated\nMemory and Advanced Computing segments exists in the form of know-how and trade secrets. As such, few patents are\nsought or procured on products created in these business areas. The absence of patent protection for these products\nmeans that we cannot prevent our competitors from reverse-engineering, independently developing, or duplicating them,\nwhich could harm our competitive position, sales and results of operations.\nWe seek to protect our confidential proprietary information, in part, by confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements and\ninvention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, advisors, contractors and collaborators. However, we\ncannot be certain that such agreements have been entered into with all relevant parties, and we cannot be certain that our\ntrade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain\naccess to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. In addition, our\ntrade secrets, know-how, and other proprietary information may be stolen, used in an unauthorized manner, or\ncompromised through a direct intrusion by private parties or foreign actors, including those affiliated with or controlled by\nstate actors. Such misappropriation of our proprietary information can occur through cyber intrusions into our computer\nsystems, physical theft through corporate espionage, or other means. It can also occur through other routes, including by\nour collaborators, licensees that do not comply with the terms of licenses, potential licensees that were ultimately not\ngranted licenses, or other parties who reverse engineer our solutions. See also “Actual or perceived failures or breaches of\nour information and security systems, or those of our customers, suppliers or business partners, could expose us to\nlosses.” If any of our confidential proprietary information were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a\ncompetitor, we would have no right to prevent such competitor from using that technology or information to compete with\nus, which could harm our competitive position.\nWe also protect our intellectual property through patent protection, particularly in our Optimized LED segment, but our\npatents do not cover all of our technologies, methods and systems and our competitors or others may design around our\npatented technologies. If any of our issued patents are found to be invalid or if any of our patent applications are rejected,\nour ability to exclude competitors from making, using, importing or selling the same or similar products as us could be\ncompromised. Further, when we seek patent protection for a particular technology, there is no assurance that the\napplications we file will result in issued patents or that if patents do issue as a result that they will allow us to effectively\nblock competitors creating competing technology.\nWe also rely on trademark registrations and have registered, or have applied to register, those trademarks that we believe\nare important to our business with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in many foreign jurisdictions. We\ncannot assure that our applications will be approved or that these registrations will prevent imitation, counterfeiting or other\ninfringement of our name or the infringement of our other intellectual property rights. Third parties may also oppose our\ntrademark applications and registrations or otherwise challenge our use\n33\nof the trademarks. Imitation, unauthorized use, or misuse of our name or trademarks in a manner that projects lesser\nquality or carries a negative connotation of our brand image or services could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. To assert control over the use of our trademarks, we rely on\ncontractual protections with our customers and we implement quality control measures and monitoring techniques intended\nto protect our trademarks from unauthorized use or other misuse. However, no assurances can be given that those\ncontracts will not be breached, and we cannot be certain that the actions we have taken to establish, police and protect our\ntrademarks or our resources will be adequate to prevent or detect infringing use by others. If disputes arise in the future,\nwe may not be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction.\nIn addition, because we conduct a substantial portion of our operations and sell a large percentage of our products outside\nof the United States, our ability to protect our intellectual property may be constrained. The laws of certain countries in\nwhich we operate our business or sell products may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same ways\nas the laws in the United States. As such, we may not be able to effectively leverage or defend our intellectual property\nrights in foreign countries and markets due to applicable intellectual property laws and procedures, which could undermine\nour business interests. It is also possible that certain of our suppliers or other partners will either not protect or not respect\nour intellectual property rights, and that we may have difficulty enforcing our intellectual property rights while maintaining\nour business relationships with those partners. Moreover, policing unauthorized use of our technologies, trade secrets and\nintellectual property may be difficult, expensive and time-consuming, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may\nnot be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the United States and where mechanisms for enforcement of\nintellectual property rights may be weak. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from\ninfringing upon, misappropriating or otherwise violating our intellectual property rights. Our inability to secure or enforce our\nintellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nLegal proceedings and claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of\noperations or financial condition.\nWe are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, claims or government and\nadministrative investigations, including any identified under “Item 3. Legal Proceedings.” For example, from time to time,\nthird parties may assert claims against us alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights on technologies that are\nimportant to our business. In addition, litigation or other actions may be necessary to protect our intellectual property rights,\nto determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against third party claims of infringement\nand/or invalidity. The steps we take to prevent misappropriation, infringement or other violation of the intellectual property\nof others may not be successful. Litigation and other legal and administrative processes, whether as plaintiff, defendant or\notherwise, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention and could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, whether or not such litigation or other\nprocesses are ultimately determined in our favor. In the event of an adverse result in, or a settlement of, a litigation matter,\nwe could be required to pay substantial damages or settlement amounts; cease the manufacture, use, import and sale of\ncertain products or components; expend significant resources to develop or acquire rights to use non-infringing technology;\nand/or discontinue the use of certain processes or obtain licenses and pay one-time fees and/or on-going royalties to use\nthe infringing or allegedly infringing technology. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could result in unexpected\nexpenses or require us to recognize an impairment of our assets, which would reduce the value of our assets and increase\nour expenses.\nWe may be required to pay royalties or obtain licenses to sell certain products.\nThe markets in which we operate are constantly undergoing rapid technological change and evolving industry standards.\nFrom time to time, third parties may claim that we are infringing upon technology to which they have proprietary rights and\nthat we require a license to manufacture and/or sell certain of our products. If we are unable to supply certain products at\ncompetitive prices due to royalty payments we are required to make or at all because we were unable to secure a required\nlicense, our customers might make claims against us, cancel orders or seek other suppliers to replace us, all of which\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n34\nChanges in tax laws or potential adjustments by tax authorities could materially increase our\ntax expense.\nWe are a multinational company subject to tax in multiple tax jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rates could be\nunfavorably affected by the resolution of issues arising from a variety of sources, including: tax audits with various tax\nauthorities in the United States and abroad; adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases\nin expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including write-offs of acquired in-process research and development and\nimpairments of goodwill in connection with acquisitions; changes in available tax credits; changes in tax laws or regulations\nor tax rates; changes in the interpretation or application of tax laws; increases or decreases in the amount of net sales or\nearnings in countries with particularly high or low statutory tax rates; changes in exemptions from taxes in certain\njurisdictions or in connection with certain transactions; or changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nTaxable income in any jurisdiction is dependent in part upon acceptance of our operational practices and intercompany\ntransfer pricing by local tax authorities as being on an arm’s length basis. Due to inconsistencies in application of the arm’s\nlength standard among taxing authorities, as well as lack of adequate treaty-based protection, transfer pricing challenges\nby tax authorities could, if successful, substantially increase our income tax expense. While we enjoy beneficial tax\ntreatment in certain foreign jurisdictions, most notably Malaysia, we are subject to meeting specific conditions in order to\nreceive the beneficial treatment, and such beneficial treatment is subject to change. Further changes in tax laws could\narise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project that was undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Co-\noperation and Development (“OECD”). For example, the OECD introduced an international tax framework under Pillar Two\nwhich includes a global minimum tax rate of 15%. This framework has been implemented by several jurisdictions, including\njurisdictions in which we operate, with effect from January 1, 2024, and many other jurisdictions are in the process of\nimplementing it. The effect of Pillar Two taxes will be applicable for our fiscal year ending August 29, 2025. We continue to\nmonitor jurisdictions that are expected to implement Pillar Two in the future, and we are in the process of evaluating the\npotential impact of the enactment of Pillar Two by such jurisdictions on our consolidated financial statements.\nAdditionally, we regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from tax examinations in the United States and\nabroad to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result\nfrom current examinations. We believe such estimates to be reasonable; however, there can be no assurance that the final\ndetermination of any examinations will be in the amounts of our estimates.\nAny significant variance in the results of an examination as compared to our estimates, any failure to continue to receive\nany beneficial tax treatment in any of our foreign locations or any increase in our future effective tax rates due to any of the\nfactors set forth above or otherwise could reduce net income and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nOur ability to use our tax attributes is limited.\nAs of August 30, 2024, we had U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $27.9 million and $41.0 million,\nrespectively. If not utilized, the federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2025. State net operating loss\ncarryforwards of $40.8 million will begin to expire in 2029, while the remaining state net operating loss carryforwards do not\nexpire. In addition, we have U.S. federal and state research and development credit carryforwards of $8.5 million and $6.1\nmillion, respectively, and $1.2 million of foreign tax credit carryforwards. If not utilized, the federal research and foreign tax\ncredits will begin to expire in 2031 and 2032, respectively. If not utilized, $2.1 million of state credits will begin to expire in\n2029, while $4.0 million of state credits do not expire. In addition, we had Section 163(j) interest expense carryforwards of\n$100.0 million from the acquisition of Stratus Technologies which do not expire. Net operating loss carryforwards in Hong\nKong of $33.9 million do not expire.\nFederal and state tax attributes can be subject to an annual limitation under the provisions of Section 382 of the Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and state tax laws. Further, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Code, if\na corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss\ncarryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change taxable income may be limited. In general, an\n“ownership change” will occur if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by certain “5-percent shareholders”\n(including groups of shareholders) that exceeds 50 percentage points (by value) over a rolling three-year period. Similar\nrules may apply under state tax laws. Our net operating loss, tax credit and Section 163(j) interest expense carryforwards\nare subject to limitations per Sections 382 and 383 of the Code. We\n35\nhave experienced ownership changes in the past, and we may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of\nfuture transactions in our ordinary shares, some changes of which may be outside of our control. As a result, our ability to\nuse our pre-change net operating loss, tax credit and Section 163(j) interest expense carryforwards to offset post-change\nU.S. federal and state taxable income may be subject to additional limitations.\nLegislation enacted in 2017, titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”), as modified in 2020 by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief,\nand Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”), changed the federal rules governing net operating loss carryforwards. For net\noperating loss carryforwards arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the Tax Act limits a taxpayer’s ability\nto utilize such carryforwards to 80% of taxable income in tax years beginning after December 31, 2020. In addition, net\noperating loss carryforwards arising in tax years ending after December 31, 2017 can be carried forward indefinitely, but\ncarryback is generally prohibited, with the exception of carrybacks reinstated by the CARES Act. Net operating loss\ncarryforwards generated before January 1, 2018 are not subject to the Tax Act’s taxable income limitation and will continue\nto have a 20-year carryforward period. Nevertheless, our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax assets could\nexpire before utilization and could be subject to limitations.\nWe reversed the valuation allowance for a significant portion of our deferred tax assets in the\nfourth quarter of 2023, and we may not be able to realize these assets in the future. Our\ndeferred tax assets may also be subject to additional valuation allowances, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nDetermining whether a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is appropriate requires judgment and an evaluation of\nall positive and negative evidence. At each reporting period, we assess the need for, or the sufficiency of a valuation\nallowance against, deferred tax assets. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, based on the weight of all the positive and\nnegative evidence, we concluded that it was more likely than not that we will realize certain federal and state net deferred\ntax assets based on three significant pieces of positive evidence occurring during the year ended August 25, 2023: (1)\nachieving three-year cumulative earnings, (2) recent use of deferred tax assets including available tax attribute\ncarryforwards and (3) forecasted growth and profitability. Therefore, we reversed the valuation allowance on those deferred\ntax assets in fiscal year 2023.\nOur conclusion that it is more likely than not that we will realize certain federal and state net deferred tax assets considers\nour estimate of future taxable income. Our estimate of future taxable income is based on internal projections which\nprimarily consider historical performance, but also include various internal estimates and assumptions as well as certain\nexternal data. We believe all of these inputs to be reasonable, although inherently subject to judgment. If actual results\ndiffer significantly from these estimates of future taxable income, we may need to reestablish a valuation allowance for\nsome or all of our deferred tax assets. Establishing an allowance on our net deferred tax assets could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe could incur substantial costs or liabilities as a result of violations of environmental laws.\nOur operations and properties are subject to various federal, state, local, foreign and international environmental laws and\nregulations governing, among other things, environmental licensing and registries, protection of flora and fauna, air and\nnoise emissions, use of water resources, wastewater discharges, management and disposal of hazardous and non-\nhazardous materials and wastes, reverse logistics (take-back policy) and remediation of releases of hazardous materials.\nOur failure to comply with present and future requirements, or the management of known or identification of new or\nunknown contamination, could cause us to incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, indemnification obligations,\ndamages, compensations, fines, suspension of activities and other penalties, investments to upgrade our facilities or\nchange our processes or curtailment of operations. The identification of presently unidentified environmental conditions,\nmore vigorous enforcement by regulatory agencies, enactment of more stringent laws and regulations or other\nunanticipated events may arise in the future and give rise to material environmental liabilities and related costs. The\noccurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition.\n36\nWe may be unable to complete ESG initiatives, in whole or in part, which could lead to less\nopportunity for us to have ESG investors and partners and could negatively impact our\nreputation or options for capital acquisition.\nWe are increasingly facing more stringent ESG standards, policies and expectations, and expect to continue to do so as a\nlisted company with growing operations. While we may at times engage in voluntary initiatives and disclosures to improve\nour ESG profile or to respond to stakeholder expectations, such initiatives and disclosures may be costly and may not have\nthe desired effect. Our management of ESG matters continues to evolve rapidly, in many instances due to factors that are\nout of our control. For example, we may ultimately be unable to complete certain initiatives or reach certain targets or\ngoals, either on the timelines initially announced or at all, due to technological, cost, or other constraints, which may be\nwithin or outside of our control. Moreover, our ESG actions or statements may be based on expectations, assumptions, or\nthird-party information that we currently believe to be reasonable, but which may subsequently be determined to be\nerroneous or be subject to misinterpretation. If we fail to, or are perceived to fail to, comply with certain ESG initiatives or\nreach our ESG targets or goals, we may be subject to various adverse impacts, including reputational damage and\npotential stakeholder engagement and/or litigation, even if such initiatives are currently voluntary. Certain market\nparticipants, including major institutional investors and capital providers, use third-party benchmarks and scores to assess\ncompanies’ ESG profiles in making investment or voting decisions. Unfavorable ESG ratings could lead to increased\nnegative investor sentiment towards us, which could negatively impact our share price as well as our access to and cost of\ncapital.\nWe also note that divergent views regarding ESG principles are emerging in the United States, and in particular, in U.S.\nstate-level regulation and enforcement efforts. In the future, various U.S. regulators, state actors and other stakeholders\nmay have views on ESG matters that are less favorable to our business or operations, or such stakeholders may seek to\nimpose additional regulation and restrictions on us or our business. Any such events could have material adverse effects\non our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and prospects. We also expect there will likely be\nincreasing levels of regulation, disclosure-related and otherwise, with respect to ESG matters. Increased regulation and\nincreased stakeholder expectations will likely lead to increased costs as well as scrutiny that could heighten all of the risks\nwe face associated with environmental, social and regulatory matters. Additionally, many of our customers and suppliers\nmay be subject to similar expectations, which may augment or create additional risks, including risks that may not be\nknown to us.\nOur worldwide operations, and those of our suppliers, business partners and customers, may\nbe disrupted by events outside of our control, including the effects of climate change, natural\ndisasters, man-made disasters or other events, as well as societal and governmental\nresponses to such events.\nOur operations in different parts of the world could be subject to natural disasters or severe weather conditions, including\nearthquakes in connection with climate change, or an accident that damages or otherwise adversely affects any of our\noperations, assets or infrastructure, or the operations, assets or infrastructure of one or more of our suppliers, business\npartners or customers. Earthquakes, hurricanes, monsoons, cyclones, droughts, extreme wind conditions, severe storms,\nheatwaves, wildfires and floods could damage our property and assets, require us to shut down operations or have either\nof those effects on third parties on whom we rely. For example, our U.S. headquarters in Milpitas, California, manufacturing\nand research and development facility in Newark, California and our Penguin Computing operations in Fremont, California\nare located near major earthquake fault lines. Our manufacturing facility in Penang, Malaysia is located in an area that is\nalso prone to natural disasters, such as cyclones, monsoons and floods. In the event of a major earthquake, cyclone,\nmonsoon or other natural or man-made disaster, we could experience business interruptions, destruction of facilities and/or\nloss of life, any of which could materially adversely affect our business. In addition, the outbreak of war, political unrest or\nterrorist activity, diseases, epidemics or pandemics in any of the locations in which we conduct business could severely\ndisrupt our business or the business of our customers and suppliers, which could in turn materially adversely affect our\nbusiness. Since a large percentage of our production is done in a small number of facilities, a disruption to operations\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nClimate change may also contribute to various chronic changes in the physical environment, such as sea-level rise or\nchanges in ambient temperature or precipitation patterns, which may also adversely impact our or our third-parties’\noperations. While we may take various actions to mitigate our business risks associated with climate change and other\nnatural and catastrophic events, this may require us to incur substantial costs and may not be\n37\nsuccessful, due to, among other things, the uncertainty associated with the longer-term projections associated with\nmanaging climate risk. For example, to the extent catastrophic events become more frequent, it may adversely impact the\navailability or cost of insurance.\nAdditionally, we may be subject to risks associated with societal efforts to mitigate or otherwise respond to climate change,\nincluding but not limited to increased regulations and evolving stakeholder expectations. Changing market dynamics,\nglobal and domestic policy developments, and the increasing frequency and impact of meteorological phenomena have the\npotential to disrupt our business, the business of our suppliers and/or customers, or otherwise adversely impact our\nbusiness, financial condition, or results of operations.\nArmed conflicts around the world, such as those in Ukraine and Israel, may exacerbate certain\nrisks we face.\nArmed conflicts around the world, such as those in Ukraine and Israel, as well as the global response to such conflicts,\nincluding the imposition of sanctions by the United States and other countries, could create or exacerbate risks facing our\nbusiness. We have evaluated our operations, vendor contracts and customer arrangements, and at present we do not\nexpect the hostilities to directly have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nHowever, if the hostilities persist, escalate or expand, risks we have identified in this report may be exacerbated. For\nexample, if our supply or customer arrangements are disrupted due to sanctions or expanded sanctions, involvement of\ncountries where we have operations or relationships or rising energy prices, our business could be materially disrupted.\nFurther, the use of state-sponsored cyberattacks could expand as part of the conflict, which could adversely affect our\nability to maintain or enhance our cybersecurity and data protection measures.\nPublic health crises, such as pandemics, epidemics, or widespread outbreaks of infectious\ndisease, have had, and could in the future have, an adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nThe occurrence of pandemics, epidemics, or widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases, as well as the imposition of\nrelated public health measures and travel and business restrictions or other actions that may be taken by governmental\nauthorities in an effort to contain such pandemics, epidemics or outbreaks, have had, and could in the future have, a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, customer relationships, and cash flows. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic\nadversely impacted sales volumes of certain of our product lines and also disrupted our product development, marketing\nand corporate development activities and adversely affected the economies and financial markets within many countries,\nincluding countries in which we conduct business. While we have developed, and continue to develop, strategies to help\nmitigate the negative effects of potential public health crises on our business and operations, such efforts may prove to be\ninsufficient. The duration and extent of the impact of any public health crises cannot be accurately assessed or predicted at\nthis time, and could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our International Operations\nOur business is subject to the risks generally associated with international business\noperations.\nSales outside of the United States accounted for 43%, 39% and 49% of our net sales in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nIn addition, a significant portion of our product design and manufacturing is performed at our facilities in Malaysia and\nChina, and a significant amount of our product design activities are performed in Taiwan and India. As a result, our\nbusiness is and will continue to be subject to the risks generally associated with international business operations in\nMalaysia, China, Taiwan, India and other foreign countries, including:\n• compliance with numerous changing, and sometimes conflicting legal regimes on matters as diverse as tax,\nanticorruption, import/export controls and quotas, local manufacturing requirements, trade restrictions, tariffs,\ntaxation, sanctions, immigration, internal and disclosure control obligations, securities regulation, anti-competition,\ndata privacy, employment regulations and labor relations, and labor and human rights laws and expectations;\n• changes in social, political and economic conditions, including as a result of changes of administration, political\nregimes or sentiment in countries in which we operate or with which we do business;\n38\n• transportation delays;\n• power and other utility shutdowns or shortages;\n• limitations on foreign investment;\n• disruptions in or lack of adequate infrastructure;\n• challenges protecting intellectual property and trade secrets;\n• exchange or currency controls and fluctuations, restrictions on currency convertibility and volatility of foreign\nexchange markets;\n• increased trade wars;\n• corruption or adverse political situations;\n• governmental intervention in local economies, industries, or the operations of specific companies, including us or\nour competitors;\n• changes or instability in local labor conditions, including strikes, work stoppages, protests and changes in\nemployment regulations, increases in wages and the conditions of collective bargaining agreements;\n• compliance with travel restrictions, stay-at-home or work location conditions or other government or voluntary\nrestrictions relating to epidemics or pandemics;\n• difficulties recruiting, employing and retaining qualified personnel to manage and oversee our local operations,\nsales and other activities;\n• difficulties in managing and overseeing employees and operations in locations far from senior management, which\ncould result in compliance, control or other issues;\n• difficulties in obtaining governmental approvals and extension of existing incentives;\n• difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;\n• expropriation and nationalization of our assets in a particular jurisdiction; and\n• restrictions, or increases in existing tax rates, on repatriation of cash, dividends or profits.\nSome of the foreign countries in which we do business or have operations have been subject to social and political\ninstability in the past, and interruptions in operations could occur in the future. Our net sales, results of operations and\nfinancial condition could be adversely affected by any of the foregoing factors.\nWe are subject to the taxation requirements of the jurisdictions in which we operate, and if we\nfail to qualify for certain tax incentives or to comply with local tax regulations, we may suffer\nfinancial losses.\nWe are subject to changes in tax laws, treaties and regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof in the Cayman\nIslands, United States, Malaysia, Ireland and other jurisdictions in which we or any of our subsidiaries operate or are\nresident. We have structured our operations in a manner designed to maximize our benefit from various government\nincentives and/or tax holidays extended to manufacturers in Malaysia to encourage investment and employment, and to\nminimize our tax liability in other jurisdictions such as the United States to the extent permitted by law. Our interpretations\nand conclusions regarding these tax incentives are not binding on any taxing authority. Additionally, we have been in the\npast and may in the future be subject to tax assessments by the relevant authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate\nand we have been in the past and may in the future be involved in legal disputes with regulatory or governmental\nauthorities relating to these assessments. If our assumptions about, or interpretation or implementation of, tax and other\nlaws are incorrect; if tax laws or regulations are substantially modified or rescinded; if the tax incentives from which we\nbenefit in the jurisdictions in which we operate are substantially modified or rescinded; if we fail to meet the conditions of\nany of the tax incentives; or if we do not prevail in disputes with tax authorities, we could suffer material adverse tax and\nother financial consequences including owing significant amounts of taxes and penalties that would increase our expenses,\nreduce our profitability and adversely affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business,\nresults of operations or financial condition.\nOur international sales and our operations in foreign countries expose us to certain risks associated with fluctuating\ncurrency values and exchange rates. Because some of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, increases in the value of\nthe U.S. dollar could increase the price of our products so that they become relatively more expensive to customers in a\nparticular country, possibly leading to a reduction in sales and profitability in that country. Volatility of currencies in countries\nwhere we conduct business, most notably the U.S. dollar, Chinese renminbi, Malaysian ringgit, Japanese yen, euro, British\npound, South Korean won, New Taiwan dollar, Hong\n39\nKong dollar and South African rand have had and may in the future have an effect on our liquidity and operating results.\nGains and losses on the conversion to U.S. dollars of the associated monetary assets and liabilities, as well as profits and\nlosses incurred in certain countries, may contribute to fluctuations in the value of our assets and our results of operations.\nWe also have costs and expenses that are denominated in foreign currencies, and decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar\ncould result in increases in such costs that could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations. In\naddition, fluctuating values between the U.S. dollar and other currencies can result in currency gains which are used in the\ncomputation of foreign taxes and can increase foreign taxable income.\nWe are a holding company. If enacted, exchange controls may limit our ability to receive\ndividends and other distributions from our foreign subsidiaries.\nWe conduct all of our operations through subsidiaries and are dependent on dividends or other intercompany transfers of\nfunds from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations. If enacted, restrictions on intercompany dividends or other distributions\nin certain jurisdictions could have a material adverse effect on our ability to transfer funds from certain subsidiaries. Certain\nforeign jurisdictions permit temporary restrictions on conversions of currency into foreign currencies and on remittances to\nforeign investors of proceeds from their investments under certain circumstances. Any imposition of restrictions on\nconversions and remittances could hinder or prevent us from converting foreign currencies into U.S. dollars and remitting\ndividends, distributions or the proceeds from operations. In addition, an increase in the existing tax rates applicable to the\nremittance of dividends or any other intercompany transfer of funds, as well as the enactment of any new tax related to\nsuch transfers, may either affect our ability to transfer funds from our subsidiaries or significantly reduce the amounts\nsubject to transfer.\nHigh rates of inflation in the future would materially adversely affect our business, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nIf countries where we operate experience substantial inflation or deflation in the future, our business may be materially\nadversely affected. In addition, we may not be able to adjust the prices we charge our customers to offset the impact of\ninflation on our expenses, leading to an increase in our expenses and a reduction in our net operating margin. This could\nhave a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may have limited legal recourse under the laws of China if disputes arise under our\nagreements with third parties.\nThe Chinese government has enacted certain laws and regulations dealing with matters such as corporate organization\nand governance, foreign investment, currency control, commerce, taxation and trade. However, the implementation,\ninterpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations is still evolving, and our ability to enforce commercial claims\nor to resolve commercial disputes is unpredictable. If disputes arise under our agreements with other parties doing\nbusiness in China, we face the risk that such party may breach any such agreement or otherwise engage in conduct\nrelating to their relationship with us that could otherwise give rise to liability under U.S. law. The resolution of these matters\nmay be subject to the exercise of considerable discretion by agencies of the Chinese government. Any rights we may have\nto specific performance, or to seek an injunction under Chinese law, in either of these cases, may be limited, and without a\nmeans of recourse by virtue of the Chinese legal system, we may be unable to prevent these situations from occurring. The\noccurrence of any such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nRisks Related to Our Debt\nOur indebtedness could impair our financial condition and harm our ability to operate our\nbusiness.\nWe have a significant amount of debt outstanding as of August 30, 2024, including the debt described in “PART II – Item 8.\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Debt.” Our indebtedness\nmay have important consequences, including, but not limited to, the following:\n• increasing our vulnerability to general economic downturns and adverse industry conditions;\n• limiting our ability to obtain additional financing;\n40\n• requiring us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flows from operations to the payment of interest and\nprincipal on our debt, which would reduce the funds available to us for our working capital, capital expenditures or\nother general corporate requirements;\n• increasing our exposure to rising interest rates from variable rate indebtedness;\n• diluting the interests of our existing shareholders to the extent ordinary shares are issued upon conversion of our\nConvertible Notes (as defined below);\n• limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry;\n• placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness or more liquidity;\nand\n• limiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions,\ngeneral corporate purposes or other purposes.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on, to refinance or to pay off our debt obligations when due depends on the\nfinancial condition and operating performance of our business. This, to a certain extent, is subject to prevailing economic\nand competitive conditions, including general conditions prevailing in the financial markets and global economy, and to\ncertain financial, business, regulatory and other factors beyond our control, including the risks described herein. Our\nbusiness may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations, and future borrowings may not be available to us under\nour debt arrangements, including our Amended Credit Agreement (as defined below), in an amount sufficient to enable us\nto service our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs. In addition, certain of our debt is subject to terms that may require\nthe use of significant cash in the future under certain circumstances. For example, holders of the 2.25% Convertible Senior\nNotes due 2026 (“2026 Notes”), the 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2029 (“2029 Notes”) and the 2.00% Convertible\nSenior Notes due 2030 (“2030 Notes,” collectively, the “Convertible Notes”), may, subject to a limited exception, require us\nto repurchase their Convertible Notes following a “fundamental change,” as described in more detail in “PART II – Item 8.\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Debt – Convertible Senior\nNotes.” In addition, all conversions of the Convertible Notes will be settled partially or entirely in cash. We may not have\nenough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to repurchase the Convertible Notes or\npay the cash amounts due upon conversion. Applicable law, regulatory authorities and the agreements governing our other\nindebtedness, including our Amended Credit Agreement, may restrict our ability to repurchase the Convertible Notes. Our\nfailure to repurchase the Convertible Notes or to pay the cash amounts due upon conversion when required will constitute\na default under the Indenture. A default under the Indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default\nunder agreements governing our other indebtedness, which may result in that other indebtedness becoming immediately\npayable in full. We may not have sufficient funds to satisfy all amounts due under the other indebtedness and the\nConvertible Notes.\nIf we are unable to meet our debt obligations or fund our other liquidity needs, we may need to restructure or refinance all\nor a portion of our debt or sell certain of our assets on or before the maturity of our debt. We may not be able to restructure\nor refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, which could cause us to default on our debt\nobligations and impair our liquidity, which in turn could cause the acceleration of other indebtedness under certain of our\ndebt agreements which could exacerbate our liquidity problems. Any refinancing of our indebtedness will likely be at higher\ninterest rates in the current environment and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants that could further\nrestrict our business operations. If we are not able to repay our debt obligations as they become due, or if we are not able\nto refinance or restructure our debt obligations before they become due, this could cause us to default on our debt\nobligations and impair our liquidity.\nIn addition, if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to\nreduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets or seek additional capital. These alternative\nmeasures may not be available to us, may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service\nobligations, which could result in substantial liquidity problems. Our Amended Credit Agreement restricts our ability to\ndispose of our assets and use the proceeds from the disposition. We may not be able to consummate any such disposition\nor dispositions or to obtain the proceeds which we could realize from them, and these proceeds may not be adequate to\nmeet any debt service obligations then due. Any of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur credit agreement may limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nWe and certain of our subsidiaries are party to a credit agreement, entered into as of February 7, 2022, with a syndicate of\nbanks and Citizens Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and as amended from time to time (the “Amended Credit\nAgreement”), as described in more detail in “PART II – Item 8. Financial Statements and\n41\nSupplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Debt.” This, or future credit agreements, may contain\nrestrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified transactions and prohibit us from voluntarily prepaying\ncertain of our other indebtedness. For instance, the covenants in our Amended Credit Agreement limit the ability of the\napplicable loan subsidiaries to, among other things:\n• incur additional indebtedness;\n• create liens on assets;\n• engage in mergers or consolidations;\n• sell assets;\n• pay dividends, make distributions or repurchase capital stock;\n• make investments, loans or advances;\n• repay or repurchase certain subordinated debt (except as scheduled or at maturity);\n• create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to us from our restricted subsidiaries;\n• make certain acquisitions;\n• engage in certain transactions with affiliates; and\n• amend material agreements governing our subordinated debt and fundamentally change our business.\nUnder the Amended Credit Agreement, we also are required to satisfy and maintain certain specified financial ratios. Our\nability to meet those financial ratios could be affected by events beyond our control, and there can be no assurance that we\nwill meet those ratios.\nThe failure to comply with any of these covenants would cause a default under the relevant credit agreement. A default, if\nnot waived, could result in acceleration of the outstanding indebtedness under the Amended Credit Agreement as well as\nunder the Convertible Notes, in which case such indebtedness would become immediately due and payable. If any default\noccurs, we may not be able to pay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if new financing is available, it\nmay not be available on terms that are acceptable to us. Complying with these covenants may cause us to take actions\nthat we otherwise would not take or not take actions that we otherwise would take.\nProvisions in the Convertible Notes and their respective Indentures could delay or prevent an\notherwise beneficial takeover of us.\nCertain provisions in the Convertible Notes and their respective Indentures could make a third-party attempt to acquire us\nmore difficult or expensive. For example, if a takeover constitutes a “fundamental change”, then noteholders will have the\nright to require us to repurchase their Convertible Notes for cash. In addition, if a takeover constitutes a “make-whole\nfundamental change” (as defined in the Indenture), then we may be required to temporarily increase the conversion rate. In\neither case, and in other cases, our obligations under the Convertible Notes and their respective Indentures could increase\nthe cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us, including in a transaction that noteholders\nor holders of our ordinary shares may view as favorable.\nOur capped call transactions may affect the value of our debt and ordinary shares.\nIn connection with the pricing of the Convertible Notes, we entered into privately-negotiated capped call transactions\n(“Capped Calls”) with certain financial institutions. The Capped Calls are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution\nto our ordinary shares upon any conversion of the Convertible Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to\nmake in excess of the principal amount of converted Convertible Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or\noffset subject to a cap.\nIn connection with establishing their initial hedges of the Capped Calls, the Capped Call counterparties or their respective\naffiliates likely purchased our ordinary shares concurrently with the pricing of the Convertible Notes. In addition, the\nCapped Call counterparties and/or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding\nvarious derivatives with respect to our ordinary shares and/or purchasing or selling our ordinary shares or other securities\nof ours in secondary market transactions and prior to the maturity of the Convertible Notes (and are likely to do so during\nany Observation Period (as defined in the Indenture) related to a conversion of Convertible Notes). This activity could\ncause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our ordinary shares or the Convertible Notes.\n42\nThe potential effect, if any, of these transactions and activities on the trading price of our ordinary shares or the Convertible\nNotes will depend in part on market conditions. Any of these activities could adversely affect the trading price of our\nordinary shares or the Convertible Notes.\nRisks Related to Investments in Cayman Islands Companies\nWe are a Cayman Islands company and, because the rights of shareholders under Cayman\nIslands law differ from those under U.S. law, shareholders may have difficulty protecting their\nshareholder rights.\nOur corporate affairs are governed by our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, the Cayman\nIslands Companies Act (2023 Revision) and the common law of the Cayman Islands. The rights of shareholders to take\naction against the directors, actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors to us under\nCayman Islands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the Cayman Islands. The common law of the\nCayman Islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the Cayman Islands as well as from\nEnglish common law, which has persuasive, but not binding, authority on a court in the Cayman Islands. The rights of our\nshareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under Cayman Islands law are not as clearly established as\nthey would be under statutes or judicial precedent in some jurisdictions in the United States. In particular, the Cayman\nIslands has a less exhaustive body of securities laws as compared to the United States, and some states, such as\nDelaware, have more fulsome and judicially interpreted bodies of corporate law.\nIt may be difficult to enforce a judgment of U.S. courts for civil liabilities under U.S. federal\nsecurities laws against us in the Cayman Islands.\nWe are a company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands. The Cayman Islands courts are unlikely:\n• to recognize or enforce against us judgments of courts of the United States based on certain civil liability provisions\nof U.S. securities laws; or\n• to impose liabilities against us, in original actions brought in the Cayman Islands, based on certain civil liability\nprovisions of U.S. securities laws that are penal in nature.\nAlthough there is no statutory enforcement in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in the United States, the courts of\nthe Cayman Islands will recognize and enforce a foreign money judgment of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction\nwithout retrial on the merits based on the principle that a judgment of a competent foreign court imposes upon the\njudgment debtor an obligation to pay the sum for which judgment has been given provided certain conditions are met. For\na foreign judgment to be enforced in the Cayman Islands, such judgment must be final and conclusive and for a liquidated\nsum, and must not be in respect of taxes or a fine or penalty, inconsistent with a Cayman Islands judgment in respect of the\nsame matter, impeachable on the grounds of fraud or obtained in a manner, and/or be of a kind the enforcement of which\nis, contrary to natural justice or the public policy of the Cayman Islands (awards of punitive or multiple damages may well\nbe held to be contrary to public policy). A Cayman Islands Court may stay enforcement proceedings if concurrent\nproceedings are being brought elsewhere.\nAs a result of all of the above, public shareholders may have more difficulty protecting their interests in the face of actions\ntaken by management, members of the Board of Directors or controlling shareholders than they would as public\nshareholders of a U.S. company.\nRisks Related to Our Ordinary Shares\nThe trading price of our ordinary shares has been and may continue to be volatile.\nThe market price of the securities of technology companies can be especially volatile. Broad market and industry factors\nmay adversely affect the market price of our ordinary shares regardless of our actual operating performance. The market\nprice of our ordinary shares has been in the past and could be in the future subject to\n43\nwide fluctuations in response to the risk factors listed in this section and others beyond our control, including those risks\ndescribed herein as well as:\n• the failure of financial analysts to cover our company;\n• negative or inaccurate coverage by financial analysts;\n• changes in financial estimates by financial analysts, any failure by us to meet or exceed any of these estimates or\nchanges in the recommendations of any financial analysts that elect to follow our company or our competitors;\n• changes in the market valuations of other companies operating in our industry;\n• announcement of, or expectation of, additional financing efforts or potential collaborations;\n• future sales of our ordinary shares;\n• share price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our ordinary shares; and\n• general economic and market conditions.\nIn addition, the stock market in general has experienced substantial price and volume fluctuations that have often been\nunrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies affected. These broad market and\nindustry factors may materially harm the market price of our ordinary shares, regardless of our operating performance. In\nthe past, following periods of volatility in the market price of certain companies’ securities, securities class action litigation\nhas been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could adversely affect our financial\ncondition or results of operations.\nIf our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting estimates are based on\nassumptions that change or prove to be incorrect, our results of operations could fall below\nexpectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the market price of\nour ordinary shares.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes. We base\nour estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the\ncircumstances, as described in “PART II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\nResults of Operations,” the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets,\nliabilities, equity, revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Significant assumptions and\nestimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to business acquisitions, income\ntaxes, inventory valuation, impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill and identified intangible assets and revenue\nrecognition. If our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, our results of\noperations may be adversely affected and may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in\na decline in the market price of our ordinary shares.\nFuture sales of our ordinary shares in the public market, or the perception that these sales may\noccur, could cause our share price to fall.\nSales of substantial amounts of our ordinary shares in the public market, including sales of our ordinary shares by our\ndirectors or officers, or sales by us or our affiliates pursuant to one or more effective registration statements, or otherwise,\nor the perception that these sales may occur, could cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline. This could\nalso impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of our equity securities. Under our amended and restated\nmemorandum and articles of association, we are authorized to issue up to 200 million ordinary shares, of which 53.3\nmillion ordinary shares were outstanding as of August 30, 2024.\nIn addition, certain of our existing shareholders and holders of options, restricted share unit awards or performance-based\nawards, in the event they become exercisable, have the right to demand that we file a registration statement covering the\noffer and sale of their ordinary shares and shares issuable under such options and awards under the Securities Act and to\nrequire us to include their securities on a registration statement filed by us. If we file a registration statement in the future\nfor the purpose of selling additional ordinary shares to raise capital and are required to include ordinary shares held by\nthese shareholders pursuant to the exercise of their registration rights, our ability to raise capital may be impaired. In\naddition, if we conduct an offering under a shelf registration statement, our ability to raise capital in such offering may be\nimpaired.\n44\nWe cannot predict the size of any future sales or issuances of our ordinary shares or the effect, if any, that such future\nsales and issuances would have on the market price of our ordinary shares.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents may discourage our acquisition by a\nthird party, which could limit shareholders’ opportunity to sell their ordinary shares at a\npremium.\nOur amended and restated memorandum and articles of association includes provisions that could limit the ability of others\nto acquire control of us, modify our structure or cause us to engage in change of control transactions. These provisions\ninclude, among other things:\n• a classified board of directors with staggered three-year terms;\n• restrictions on the ability of our shareholders to call meetings or make shareholder proposals;\n• our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association may only be amended by a vote of\nshareholders representing at least 75% of the votes cast at a general meeting or by a unanimous written consent;\nand\n• the ability of our Board of Directors, without action by our shareholders, to issue 30,000,000 preferred shares and\nto issue additional ordinary shares that could have the effect of impeding the success of an attempt to acquire us\nor otherwise effect a change in control.\nThese provisions could deter, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring control of us in a tender offer or similar\ntransactions, even if such transaction would benefit our shareholders. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the\nexistence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our ordinary shares if they are viewed as\ndiscouraging future takeover attempts.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our ordinary shares in the foreseeable\nfuture.\nWe currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, for the foreseeable future, to repay indebtedness and to fund the\ndevelopment and growth of our business. We do not intend to pay any dividends to holders of our ordinary shares. In\naddition, certain of our agreements, including our Amended Credit Agreement, the Securities Purchase Agreement that we\nentered into with SK on July 14, 2024 (the “SKT Purchase Agreement”) and the Certificate of Designation (as defined\nbelow) contain restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. As a result, capital appreciation in the price of our ordinary\nshares, if any, will be your only source of gain on an investment in our ordinary shares.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWorldwide economic and political conditions as well as other factors may adversely affect our\noperations and cause fluctuations in demand for our products.\nUncertainty in global economic and political conditions poses a risk to the overall economy, as consumers and businesses\nhave made it difficult for customers, suppliers and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. Declines in\nthe worldwide semiconductor market, economic conditions or consumer confidence would likely decrease the overall\ndemand for our products. Other factors that could cause demand for our products to fluctuate include:\n• a downturn in the computing, networking, communications, storage, aerospace, government, mobile or industrial\nmarkets;\n• changes in consumer confidence caused by changes in market conditions, including changes in the credit markets,\nexpectations for employment and inflation and energy prices;\n• changes in the level of customers’ components inventory;\n• competitive pressures, including pricing pressures, from companies that have competing products, architectures,\nmanufacturing technologies and marketing programs;\n• changes in technology or customer product needs;\n• strategic actions taken by our competitors;\n• market acceptance of our products;\n• changes in prevailing or available interest rates or liquidity of the domestic capital and lending markets;\n45\n• exchange rates and currency controls and restrictions on the movement of capital out of country;\n• recent and potential bank failures;\n• inflation; and\n• changes to tax, trade and regulatory policies, including as a result of changes in administration.\nIf demand for our products decreases, our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized, and we\nmay be required to record an impairment on our long-lived assets, including facilities and equipment, as well as intangible\nassets, which would increase our expenses. In addition, if product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand\naccurately, we could be required to write-off inventory or record underutilization charges, which would have a negative\nimpact on our profitability. If product demand increases more or faster than anticipated, we may not be able to add\nmanufacturing or assembly and test capacity fast enough to meet market demand. These changes in demand for our\nproducts, and changes in our customers’ product needs, could have a variety of negative effects on our competitive\nposition and our financial results, and in certain cases, may reduce our net sales, increase our costs, lower our profit\nmargins or require us to recognize impairments of our assets. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe and others are subject to a variety of laws, regulations, or industry standards that may\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur business is subject to regulation by various U.S. federal and state governmental agencies. Such regulation includes,\nwithout limitation, the radio frequency emission regulatory activities of the Federal Communications Commission, the\nantitrust regulatory activities of the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) and the Department of Justice, the consumer\nprotection laws of the FTC, the import/export regulatory activities of the Department of Commerce, the product safety\nregulatory activities of the Consumer Products Safety Commission, the regulatory activities of the Occupational Safety and\nHealth Administration, the environmental regulatory activities of the Environmental Protection Agency, the labor regulatory\nactivities of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the export control regulatory activities of the Department of\nState and tax and other regulations by a variety of regulatory authorities in each of the areas in which we conduct\nbusiness. We are also subject to similar, and in some cases additional, regulation in other countries where we conduct\nbusiness, including import and export laws and foreign currency control. In certain jurisdictions, such regulatory\nrequirements may be more stringent and complex than in the United States. We are also subject to a variety of U.S. federal\nand state employment and labor laws and regulations, including, without limitation, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the\nFederal Fair Labor Standards Act, the Worker Adjustment and Restructuring Notification Act and other regulations related\nto working conditions, wage-hour pay, overtime pay, employee benefits, anti-discrimination and termination of employment.\nLike other companies operating or selling internationally, we face risks of non-compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt\nPractices Act (the “FCPA”) and other laws which generally prohibit direct and indirect improper payments to foreign\ngovernment officials and political parties for the purpose of securing an unfair business advantage. In addition, because we\nhave operations and suppliers in China and adjacent jurisdictions, we have exposure and risks associated with the Uyghur\nForced Labor Prevention Act (“UFLPA”) and other global laws against forced labor. The UFLPA prohibits the importation of\narticles, merchandise, apparel and goods mined, produced, or manufactured wholly or in part in the Xinjiang Uyghur\nAutonomous Region (Xinjiang) of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), or by entities identified by the U.S. government on\nthe UFLPA Entity List. Forced labor concerns have rapidly become a global area of interest and is a topic that will likely be\nsubject to new regulations in the markets we operate within. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we may\nbe subject to detention, seizure and exclusion of imports, as well as penalties, costs and restrictions on export and import\nprivileges that could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. We are also subject\nto similar or even more restrictive anticorruption laws imposed by the governments of other countries where we do\nbusiness, such as laws that prohibit commercial bribery, including the UK Bribery Act and the Malaysian Anticorruption Act.\nWe make sales, are subject to government regulation and operate in countries known to present heightened risks of public\ncorruption. Although we have implemented policies and controls to mitigate risks of non-compliance, our business activities\ncreate the risk of unauthorized conduct by one or more of our employees, consultants, customs brokers, freight forwarders,\nthird party representatives or distributors that could be in violation of various laws including the FCPA or similar local\nregulations. In addition, we may be held liable for actions taken by such parties even if such parties themselves are not\nsubject to the FCPA or similar laws.\n46\nInvestigations into allegations of such misconduct can be costly, and any determination that we have violated the FCPA or\nsimilar laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities that could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur China operations are subject to national, regional and local regulation. The regulatory environment in China continues\nto evolve, and officials in the Chinese government exercise broad discretion in deciding how to interpret and apply\nregulations. It is possible that the Chinese government’s current or future interpretation and application of existing or new\nregulations will negatively impact our China operations, result in regulatory investigations or lead to fines or penalties.\nNoncompliance with applicable regulations or requirements could subject us to investigations, sanctions, mandatory\nproduct recalls, enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, disbarment from government projects, fines, damages, civil\nand criminal penalties or injunctions and reputational damage that could harm our business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition. In addition, from time to time we have received, and may receive in the future, correspondence from\nformer employees and parties with whom we have done business, threatening to bring claims against us alleging that we\nhave violated one or more regulations related to customs, labor and employment, foreign currency control or other laws or\nregulations. An adverse outcome in any litigation or proceeding related to such matters could require us to pay damages,\nattorneys’ fees and/or other costs.\nIf any governmental sanctions were to be imposed, or if we were not to prevail in any civil action or criminal proceeding,\nour business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition, responding to\nany litigation or action would likely result in a significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and a\nsignificant increase in professional fees.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled employees.\nOur future operating results depend in significant part upon the continued contributions of our key senior management and\ntechnical personnel, many of whom hold critical institutional knowledge and expertise and would be difficult to replace. Our\nfuture operating results also depend in significant part upon our ability to attract, train and retain qualified management,\nincluding for manufacturing and quality assurance, engineering, design, finance, marketing, sales and support. We are\ncontinually recruiting such personnel in various parts of the world. However, competition for such personnel across all of\nour markets can be strong. Our ability to attract, retain and motivate such personnel depends in part on our ability to offer\ncompetitive compensation packages, including salary, cash incentive compensation and share-based compensation along\nwith other benefits and workplace policies, and we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in attracting or\nretaining such personnel now or in the future. In addition, particularly in the high-technology industry, the value of stock\noptions, restricted share unit awards or other share-based compensation is an important element in the retention of\nemployees. Declines in the value of our ordinary shares could adversely affect our ability to retain employees and we may\nhave to take additional steps to make the equity component of our compensation packages more attractive to attract and\nretain employees. These steps could result in dilution to shareholders.\nThe loss of any key employee, the failure of any key employee to adequately perform in his or her current position, our\ninability to attract, train and retain skilled employees as needed or the inability of our key employees to expand, train and\nmanage our employee base as needed, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nWorldwide political conditions and threats of terrorist attacks may adversely affect our\noperations and demand for our products.\nArmed conflicts around the world, including those in Ukraine and Israel, could have an impact on our sales, our supply\nchain and our ability to deliver products to our customers. Political and economic instability in some regions of the world\ncould also have a negative impact on our business. More generally, various events could cause consumer confidence and\nspending to decrease, or could result in increased economic or financial volatility, any of which could result in a decrease in\ndemand for our products.\nAdditionally, the occurrence or threat of terrorist attacks may in the future adversely affect demand for our products. In\naddition, such attacks may negatively affect our operations directly or indirectly and such attacks or other armed conflicts\nmay directly impact our facilities or those of our suppliers or customers. Such attacks may\n47\nmake travel and the transportation of our products more difficult and more expensive, ultimately having a negative effect on\nour business.\nAny such occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nCybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\nWe have developed and implemented a cybersecurity risk management program intended to protect the confidentiality,\nintegrity and availability of our critical systems, internal networks and information.\nWe have aligned our cybersecurity risk management program with recognized security frameworks such as the National\nInstitute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (“NIST CSF”) and ISO standards. This does not imply that\nwe meet any particular technical standards, specifications or requirements, only that we use these frameworks as a guide\nto help us identify, assess and manage cybersecurity risks relevant to our business.\nKey elements of our cybersecurity risk management program include, but are not limited to, the following:\n• risk assessments designed to help identify material cybersecurity risks to our critical systems and information;\n• the use of external service providers, where appropriate, to assess, test or otherwise assist with aspects of our\nsecurity processes;\n• cybersecurity awareness training of our employees;\n• an information security incident response plan that includes procedures for responding to cybersecurity incidents;\n• an incident response team (the “Response Team”) principally responsible for managing our response to\ncybersecurity incidents; and\n• a third-party risk management process for key IT vendors based on our assessment of their criticality to our\noperations and respective risk profile.\nDuring 2024, we did not identify any risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity\nincidents, that materially affected us, including our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. However,\nwe face ongoing and increasing cybersecurity risks, including from bad actors that are becoming more sophisticated and\neffective over time, and if realized, these risks are reasonably likely to materially affect us. Additional information on the\ncybersecurity risks we face is discussed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”\nCybersecurity Governance\nOur Board of Directors considers cybersecurity risk as part of its risk oversight function and has delegated to the\nCybersecurity and Technology Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Cybersecurity Committee”)\noversight of cybersecurity and other information technology risks. The Cybersecurity Committee oversees management’s\nimplementation of our cybersecurity risk management program.\nThe Cybersecurity Committee receives regular reports from our Chief Information Officer (“CIO”) regarding any significant\ncybersecurity incidents, as well as any incidents with lesser impact potential. The CIO periodically reports to the Board of\nDirectors regarding cybersecurity risks and our cybersecurity risk management program. Board members periodically\nreceive presentations on cybersecurity topics from our CIO or external experts as part of the Board of Directors’ continuing\neducation on topics that impact public companies.\nOur management team, including our CIO, is responsible for assessing and managing our material risks from cybersecurity\nthreats. Our CIO has over two decades of IT experience, including in applications, infrastructure, development, security\nand governance, and has presented as a featured speaker at numerous IT and security\n48\nconferences. Our management team has primary responsibility for our overall cybersecurity risk management program and\nsupervises both our internal cybersecurity personnel and our retained external cybersecurity consultants. The Response\nTeam, including our CIO and other members of our management team, has primary responsibility for assessing and\nmanaging our response to cybersecurity incidents.\nOur management team takes steps to stay informed about and monitor efforts to prevent, detect, mitigate and remediate\ncybersecurity risks and incidents through various means, which may include briefings from internal security personnel;\nthreat intelligence and other information obtained from governmental, public or private sources, including external\nconsultants engaged by us; and alerts and reports produced by security tools deployed in the IT environment.\nItem 2. Properties\nOur U.S. headquarters are located in Milpitas, California. We lease or own various facilities described below for our design,\nmanufacture, research and development and sales and marketing activities. We believe that our existing facilities are\nsuitable and adequate for our present purposes. The following is a summary of our principal facilities as of August 30,\n2024:\nSquare Feet Supply Chain\nLocation (in 000s) Manufacturing Procurement R&D Sales Services\nDurham, NC 102 X X X\nFremont, CA 86 X X X X\nHuizhou, China 824 X X X\nMaynard, MA 102 X X X\nMilpitas, CA 21\nNewark, CA 79 X X X X X\nPenang, Malaysia 139 X X X X X\nTempe, AZ 50 X X X X\nIn addition to the principal facilities in the table above, we lease additional facilities in the United States, China, Hong Kong,\nIreland, Japan, Scotland, Singapore and Taiwan.\n49\nItem 3.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder\nMatters, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nMarket Information for Ordinary Shares\nOur ordinary shares are listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the trading symbol “PENG.”\nHolders of Record\nAs of October 14, 2024, there were 41 registered holders of record of our ordinary shares (not including beneficial holders\nof our ordinary shares held in street name by brokers and other institutions on behalf of shareholders).\nDividends\nOn January 3, 2022, our Board of Directors declared a share dividend of one ordinary share, $0.03 par value per share, for\neach outstanding ordinary share owned, to shareholders of record as of January 25, 2022. The dividend was paid on\nFebruary 1, 2022.\nWe have not paid any cash dividends on our ordinary shares, and we do not currently intend to pay any cash dividends on\nour ordinary shares in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain all available funds and future earnings to\nsupport operations and to finance the growth and development of our business. Any future determination to pay dividends\nwill be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors subject to applicable laws and will depend on, among other factors,\nour results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions and capital requirements.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nOrdinary Share Repurchase Authorization\nOn April 4, 2022, our Board of Directors approved a $75.0 million share repurchase authorization (the “Initial\nAuthorization”), under which we may repurchase our outstanding ordinary shares from time to time through open market\npurchases, privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise. On January 8, 2024, the Audit Committee of the Board of\nDirectors approved an additional $75.0 million share repurchase authorization (the “Additional Authorization,” and together\nwith the Initial Authorization, the “Current Authorization”). The Current Authorization has no expiration date but may be\nsuspended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. No shares were repurchased during the fourth quarter of\n2024 under the Current Authorization. As of August 30, 2024, an aggregate of $77.7 million remained available for the\nrepurchase of our ordinary shares under the Current Authorization. Certain of our agreements, including the Amended\nCredit Agreement, the SKT Purchase Agreement and the Certificate of Designation relating to the Investment (the\n“Certificate of Designation”), contain restrictions that limit our ability to repurchase our ordinary shares.\nShare Performance Graph\nThis performance graph shall not be deemed “soliciting material” or to be “filed” with the SEC for purposes of Section 18 of\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section, and shall not be deemed to\nbe incorporated by reference into any of our filings under the Securities Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by\nspecific reference in such filing.\nThe following graph illustrates a comparison of cumulative total returns for our ordinary shares, the Russell 2000 Index and\nthe Nasdaq Electronic Components Index from August 31, 2019 through August 30, 2024. We operate on a 52- or 53-week\nfiscal year, which ends on the last Friday in August. As a result, the last day of our fiscal year\n51\nvaries. For consistent presentation and comparison to the industry indices shown herein, we have calculated our share\nperformance graph as of August 31 for each year.\nNote: Management cautions that the share price performance information shown in the graph above may not be indicative\nof current share price levels or future share price performance.\nThe share performance graph assumes $100 was invested in our ordinary shares and in the other indices on August 31,\n2019. Any dividends paid during the period presented were assumed to be reinvested. The performance was plotted using\nthe following data:\nAugust 31, August 31, August 31, August 31, August 31, August 31,\n2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024\nPenguin Solutions, Inc. $ 100 $ 89 $ 171 $ 129 $ 182 $ 146\nRussell 2000 Index $ 100 $ 106 $ 156 $ 128 $ 134 $ 159\nNasdaq Electronic Components Index $ 100 $ 113 $ 162 $ 144 $ 163 $ 209\nItem 6. [Reserved]\n52\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with\nthe accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes for the year ended August 30, 2024. This discussion\ncontains forward looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and other factors. Our actual results could differ\nmaterially from those contained in these forward-looking statements due to a number of risks, uncertainties and other\nfactors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report. See also “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-\nLooking Statements” and “PART I – Item 1A. Risk Factors.”\nOur fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period ending on the last Friday in August. Fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022\ncontained 53, 52 and 52 weeks, respectively. All period references are to our fiscal periods unless otherwise indicated. All\nfinancial information for our subsidiaries in Brazil is included in our consolidated financial statements on a one-month lag\nbecause their fiscal years ended on July 31 of each year. In connection with the completion of the divestiture of an 81%\ninterest in SMART Brazil, we ceased consolidating the operations of SMART Brazil in our financial statements as of the\nNovember 29, 2023 disposal date. As a result, financial information for the first quarter of 2024 includes the four-month\nperiod for the SMART Brazil operations from August 1, 2023 to November 29, 2023. All tabular amounts are in thousands.\nOverview\nFor an overview of our business, see “PART I – Item 1. Business.”\nDivestiture of SMART Brazil\nOn November 29, 2023, we completed the divestiture of an 81% interest in SMART Brazil to Lexar Europe B.V., an affiliate\nof Shenzhen Longsys Electronics Co. Ltd.\nPresentation of SMART Brazil as Discontinued Operations: In accordance with authoritative guidance under U.S.\nGAAP, we have presented the balance sheets, results of operations and cash flows of SMART Brazil operations in this\nAnnual Report, including in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes, as discontinued operations for\nall periods presented. The SMART Brazil operations were previously reported as part of our Integrated Memory segment.\nUnless otherwise noted, discussion within this Annual Report relates solely to our continuing operations and excludes the\nSMART Brazil operations.\nSee “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Divestiture of\nSMART Brazil.”\nAcquisition of Stratus Technologies\nOn August 29, 2022, we completed the acquisition of Stratus Technologies. At the closing, we paid a cash purchase price\nof $225.0 million, subject to certain adjustments. In addition, the seller had the right to receive the Stratus Earnout based\non the gross profit performance of the Stratus Technologies business during the first full 12 fiscal months following the\nclosing. Throughout 2023, we adjusted the fair value of the Stratus Earnout by an aggregate of $29.0 million and, as of\nAugust 25, 2023, current liabilities included $50.0 million for the amount payable in connection with the Stratus Earnout. In\nthe second quarter of 2024, we paid in full $50.0 million related to the Stratus Earnout.\nSee “PART II – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements –\nBusiness Acquisitions – Stratus Technologies.”\nFactors Affecting Our Operating Performance\nMacro-Economic Demand Factors. Our business segments each have their own unique set of demand factors. Our\nAdvanced Computing business is driven by demand for high-performance compute solutions across AI and machine\nlearning initiatives, as well as traditional workload optimization and efficiency applications. Demand in our Integrated\nMemory segment is driven by end-market demand from OEMs for customer-specific solutions in vertical markets such as\nindustrial, government, networking, high-performance compute and enterprise storage,\n53\nas well as emerging demand for higher density and greater bandwidth solutions for AI deployments. Finally, demand for our\nOptimized LED products is derived from targeted end-market applications, such as general high-power and mid-power\nlighting and specialty lighting, including video display and horticulture applications. We believe our diversified business\nsegments may sometimes provide a natural hedge against downturns in any particular industry. However, broader macro-\neconomic trends can adversely affect all three segments concurrently.\nShifts in the Mix and Timing of Our Revenue. Shifts in the mix of revenue from our operating segments, and in the\ntiming of revenue, which can vary significantly from period to period, can impact our business and operating results,\nincluding gross and operating margins. For example, our Advanced Computing segment has shown solid growth, but is\nsubject to variability in its sales and margin profile from period to period for reasons such as: recognition of revenue is\nsometimes tied to customer decisions as to the completion of delivery and system go-live events, sales can be affected by\nthe timing of customer deployments or customer budget considerations and margin is driven by the extent to which higher\nmargin software and managed services comprise Advanced Computing sales. Our resource commitments and planning for\neach segment are relatively fixed in the short term, and as such, variability in expected revenue mix will have direct\nimplications for our operating income and margins.\nOur Ability to Identify, Complete and Successfully Integrate Acquisitions. A substantial portion of our growth over the\nlast several years has been driven by acquisitions, and we intend to continue to use corporate development as an engine\nfor growth. Within our existing segments, we plan to pursue acquisitions to expand features and functionality, expand into\nadjacent businesses and grow our customer base and geographic footprint. From time to time, we may seek to expand our\naddressable market by entering new business segments where, as we did with our Cree LED and Stratus Technologies\nacquisitions, we identify a business opportunity at scale with a path to being accretive to our overall operations in the near\nterm. If we are unable to identify and complete attractive acquisitions, we may not be successful in growing our revenue\nand/or expanding our margins. Any acquisitions we do complete may require us to incur debt or raise capital through equity\nfinancings or may subject us to unforeseen liabilities or costs, or operational challenges, that in turn impede our ability to\nrealize the expected returns on our investment.\nDisruptions in Our Supply Chain May Adversely Affect Our Businesses. We depend on third-party suppliers for key\ncomponents of our products, such as commodity DRAM components from offshore foundries that we use in our specialty\nmemory products, third-party wafers that we use in our memory and LED businesses and HPC and AI components for our\nAdvanced Computing business. In our memory and LED businesses, we have adopted a “Fab-Light” business model to\nreduce our capital expenditures and operating expenses, while affording greater flexibility in adapting to shifts in demand\nand other market trends. Our Fab-Light business model contributed to margin expansion in our overall business. However,\nour reliance on third-party manufacturers exposes us to risk of supply chain disruption and lost business. For example, the\nrecent global semiconductor shortage has adversely affected our operating results. In addition, in our Advanced Computing\nbusiness, where we source components from third parties, the high demand for and limited supply of AI components\nglobally, as well as any delays in the production of such components, continues to affect our sourcing of these components\nand the timing of deployments. In particular, we continue to experience extended lead times for certain components that\nare incorporated into our overall solutions, which impacts how quickly we are able to ramp existing and new customer\nprojects. If such disruptions worsen or are prolonged, or if there is meaningful disruption in our supply arrangement with\nany of our third-party suppliers, our operating results and financial condition may continue to be adversely affected.\n54\nResults of Operations\nAugust 30, % of net August 25, % of net August 26, % of net\nYear ended 2024 sales (1) 2023 sales (1) 2022 sales (1)\nNet sales:\nAdvanced Computing $ 554,552 47.4 % $ 749,708 52.0 % $ 440,986 31.6 %\nIntegrated Memory 356,426 30.4 % 443,264 30.8 % 551,705 39.5 %\nOptimized LED 259,818 22.2 % 248,278 17.2 % 403,185 28.9 %\nTotal net sales 1,170,796 100.0 % 1,441,250 100.0 % 1,395,876 100.0 %\nCost of sales 830,020 70.9 % 1,026,079 71.2 % 1,004,831 72.0 %\nGross profit 340,776 29.1 % 415,171 28.8 % 391,045 28.0 %\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development 81,537 7.0 % 90,565 6.3 % 77,472 5.6 %\nSelling, general and administrative 233,880 20.0 % 260,722 18.1 % 204,839 14.7 %\nImpairment of goodwill — — % 19,092 1.3 % — — %\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration — — % 29,000 2.0 % 41,324 3.0 %\nOther operating (income) expense 7,064 0.6 % 7,047 0.5 % 234 — %\nTotal operating expenses 322,481 27.5 % 406,426 28.2 % 323,869 23.2 %\nOperating income (loss) 18,295 1.6 % 8,745 0.6 % 67,176 4.8 %\nNon-operating (income) expense:\nInterest expense, net 28,378 2.4 % 36,421 2.5 % 24,345 1.7 %\nOther non-operating (income) expense 21,084 1.8 % 11,837 0.8 % 350 — %\nTotal non-operating (income) expense 49,462 4.2 % 48,258 3.3 % 24,695 1.8 %\nIncome (loss) before taxes (31,167) (2.7)% (39,513) (2.7)% 42,481 3.0 %\nIncome tax provision (benefit) 10,618 0.9 % (49,203) (3.4)% 18,074 1.3 %\nNet income (loss) from continuing operations (41,785) (3.6)% 9,690 0.7 % 24,407 1.7 %\nNet income (loss) from discontinued operations (8,148) (0.7)% (195,384) (13.6)% 44,185 3.2 %\nNet income (loss) (49,933) (4.3)% (185,694) (12.9)% 68,592 4.9 %\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest 2,539 0.2 % 1,832 0.1 % 2,035 0.1 %\nNet income (loss) attributable to Penguin Solutions $ (52,472) (4.5)% $ (187,526) (13.0)% $ 66,557 4.8 %\n(1) Summations of percentages may not compute precisely due to rounding.\nNet Sales, Cost of Sales and Gross Profit\nNet sales decreased by $270.5 million, or 18.8%, in 2024 compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower sales and\nweakness in our Advanced Computing and Integrated Memory segments, partially offset by moderate growth in our\nOptimized LED segment. Advanced Computing net sales decreased by $195.2 million, or 26.0%, primarily related to lower\nhardware sales year over year due to the unpredictable nature of large project engagements, which may not occur with the\nsame frequency or scale each year. Integrated Memory net sales decreased by $86.8 million, or 19.6%, primarily due to\nlower sales volumes of Flash and DRAM products to our OEM customers, driven by macroeconomic environment\nchallenges. Optimized LED net sales increased by $11.5 million, or 4.6%, primarily due to higher demand as channel\npartners addressed low inventory carrying levels.\nNet sales increased by $45.4 million, or 3.3%, in 2023 compared to the prior year, due to strong performance in our\nAdvanced Computing business, partially offset by weakness in both our Integrated Memory and Optimized LED segments.\nAdvanced Computing net sales increased by $308.7 million, or 70.0%, primarily due to $172.7 million of revenue from our\nStratus Technologies acquisition in August 2022, as well as higher volumes of sales in our Penguin Computing business.\nOptimized LED net sales decreased by $154.9 million, or 38.4%, primarily due to continued demand challenges in China.\nIntegrated Memory sales decreased by $108.4 million, or 19.7%, primarily due to lower sales volume and pricing of DRAM\nproducts.\nCost of sales decreased by $196.1 million, or 19.1%, in 2024 compared to the prior year, primarily due to our Advanced\nComputing and Integrated Memory segments, which had lower material and production costs from lower sales, as well as\nlower personnel-related expenses mainly driven by cost reduction efforts. Cost of sales increased by $21.2 million, or\n2.1%, in 2023 compared to the prior year, primarily due to the Stratus Technologies\n55\nacquisition and from higher costs of materials and production costs due to higher sales for our Advanced Computing\nsegment.\nGross margin increased to 29.1% in 2024 compared to 28.8% in 2023 primarily due to favorable mix from higher service\nrevenue in our Advanced Computing segment. Gross margin increased to 28.8% in 2023 compared to 28.0% in 2022\nprimarily due to the inclusion of higher margin Stratus products, as well as process and efficiency improvements in the\nIntegrated Memory and Advanced Computing segments compared to the prior year.\nNon-GAAP Measure of Segment Operating Income\nBelow is a table of our operating income, measured on a non-GAAP basis, which Penguin Solutions management uses to\nsupplement Penguin Solutions’ financial results under GAAP to analyze its operations and make decisions as to future\noperational plans and believes that this supplemental non-GAAP information is useful to investors in analyzing and\nassessing the company’s past and future operating performance. These non-GAAP measures exclude certain items, such\nas share-based compensation expense; amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets (consisting of amortization of\ndeveloped technology, customer relationships, trademarks/trade names and backlog acquired in connection with business\ncombinations); acquisition-related inventory adjustments; diligence, acquisition and integration expense; restructure\ncharges; impairment of goodwill; changes in the fair value of contingent consideration; and other infrequent or unusual\nitems. While amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets is excluded, the revenues from acquired companies is\nreflected in our non-GAAP measures and these intangible assets contribute to revenue generation. See “Item 8. Financial\nStatements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Segment and Other Information.”\nNon-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial\nperformance prepared in accordance with GAAP, as they exclude important information about our financial results, as\nnoted above. The presentation of these adjusted amounts varies from amounts presented in accordance with GAAP and\ntherefore may not be comparable to amounts reported by other companies.\nAugust 30, August 25, August 26,\nYear ended 2024 2023 2022\nGAAP operating income (loss) $ 18,295 $ 8,745 $ 67,176\nShare-based compensation expense 43,160 39,228 37,284\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangibles 39,272 44,601 23,729\nFlow-through of inventory step up — 2,599 —\nCost of sales-related restructure 2,136 6,813 —\nDiligence, acquisition and integration expense 8,772 20,869 7,090\nImpairment of goodwill — 19,092 —\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration — 29,000 41,324\nRestructure charge 7,064 7,047 234\nOther 1,558 1,800 624\nNon-GAAP operating income $ 120,257 $ 179,794 $ 177,461\nNon-GAAP operating income by segment:\nAdvanced Computing $ 95,291 $ 110,975 $ 49,450\nIntegrated Memory 22,413 73,639 78,869\nOptimized LED 2,553 (4,820) 49,142\nTotal non-GAAP operating income by segment $ 120,257 $ 179,794 $ 177,461\nAdvanced Computing operating income decreased by $15.7 million, or 14.1%, in 2024 compared to the prior year primarily\ndue to lower sales from our Penguin Computing business, partially offset by lower operating expenses, mainly driven by\npersonnel-related expenses due to lower headcount and lower subcontract services. Advanced Computing operating\nincome increased by $61.5 million, or 124.4%, in 2023 compared to the prior year primarily due to higher sales mainly due\nto the Stratus Technologies acquisition and gross margin expansion, partially offset by higher operating expenses due to\nthe Stratus Technologies acquisition as well as personnel-related expenses due in part to increased headcount to support\nthe revenue growth.\nIntegrated Memory operating income decreased by $51.2 million, or 69.6%, in 2024 compared to the prior year primarily\ndue to lower sales and gross profit due to lower sales volumes of Flash and DRAM products. Integrated\n56\nMemory operating income decreased by $5.2 million, or 6.6%, in 2023 compared to the prior year primarily due to lower\nsales, partially offset by a favorable product mix and lower personnel-related costs driven in part by cost containment\nactions.\nOptimized LED operating loss improved by $7.4 million, or 153.0%, in 2024 primarily due to higher revenue from increased\ndemand, better factory leverage and product mix and lower personnel-related expenses due to headcount reductions.\nOptimized LED operating income decreased by $54.0 million, or 109.8%, in 2023 compared to the prior year primarily due\nto lower sales from demand challenges in China, partially offset by lower personnel-related costs driven in part by cost\nreduction actions.\nOperating and Non-operating (Income) Expense\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expense decreased by $9.0 million, or 10.0%, in 2024 compared to the prior year, primarily\ndue to lower personnel-related expenses mainly driven by headcount reductions, as well as lower subcontract services\nmainly driven by Advanced Computing.\nResearch and development expense increased by $13.1 million, or 16.9%, in 2023 compared to the prior year, primarily\ndue to additional costs from the Stratus Technologies acquisition, offset by lower personnel-related expenses mainly driven\nby bonus and headcount reductions.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expense decreased by $26.8 million, or 10.3%, in 2024 compared to the prior year,\nprimarily due to lower diligence, acquisition and integration expense, lower personnel-related expenses, mainly driven by\nheadcount reductions, and lower amortization expense of intangible assets.\nSelling, general and administrative expense increased by $55.9 million, or 27.3%, in 2023 compared to the prior year,\nprimarily due to additional costs from the Stratus Technologies acquisition as well as higher diligence, acquisition and\nintegration expense, partially offset by lower personnel-related expenses driven by bonus and headcount reductions.\nImpairment of Goodwill\nIn the second quarter of 2023, we initiated a plan pursuant to which we intend to wind down manufacturing and discontinue\nthe sale of certain legacy products offered through our Penguin Edge business by approximately the end of 2025. We\nrecorded impairment charges of $19.1 million in 2023 to impair the carrying value of Penguin Edge goodwill. We currently\nanticipate that the remaining goodwill of the Penguin Edge reporting unit of $16.1 million as of August 30, 2024 may\nbecome further impaired in future periods. See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements – Intangible Assets and Goodwill – Impairment of Penguin Edge Goodwill.”\nChange in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration\nOur acquisitions of Stratus Technologies in the first quarter of 2023 and our Optimized LED business in the third quarter of\n2021 each included contingent consideration. We estimate the fair value of the contingent consideration as of the date of\nacquisition and subsequently recognize changes in the fair value in results of operations. During 2023 and 2022, we\nrecorded charges of $29.0 million and $41.3 million, respectively, to adjust the fair value of the contingent consideration.\nSee “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Business\nAcquisitions.”\nOther Operating (Income) Expense\nOther operating expense in 2024 and 2023 included restructure charges of $7.1 million and $7.0 million, respectively,\nprimarily for employee severance costs and other benefits resulting from workforce reductions, the elimination of certain\nprojects across our businesses and other costs associated with the wind down of our Penguin Edge business. We\nanticipate that such activities will continue into future quarters and anticipate recording additional restructure charges.\n57\nInterest Expense, Net\nNet interest expense decreased by $8.0 million, or 22.1%, in 2024 compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher\ninterest income resulting from higher cash and investment balances, partially offset by higher interest expense from the\nAmended 2027 TLA (as defined below). Net interest expense increased by $12.1 million, or 49.6%, in 2023 compared to\nthe prior year, primarily due to higher interest expense from the Amended 2027 TLA, partially offset by higher interest\nincome resulting from higher cash and investment balances.\nOther Non-operating (Income) Expense\nOther non-operating (income) expense in 2024 and 2023 included losses of $22.8 million and $15.9 million, respectively,\nfrom the extinguishment or prepayment of debt. Other non-operating (income) expense in 2023 also included net gains of\n$3.0 million from the disposition of assets. See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements – Debt.”\nIncome Tax Provision (Benefit)\nOur provision for income taxes increased by $59.8 million in 2024, or 121.6%, compared to the prior year primarily due to a\ndecrease in tax benefit for the 2023 U.S. federal and state valuation allowance release. Our provision for income taxes\ndecreased by $67.3 million in 2023, or 372.2%, compared to the prior year primarily due to the tax benefit on the release of\nthe U.S. federal and state valuation allowance in 2023, partially offset by tax add backs for nondeductible goodwill\nimpairment in 2023 and additional uncertain tax positions recorded in 2023.\nIn 2024, our tax expense of $10.6 million and effective tax rate of (34.1)%, which was different from the U.S. statutory tax\nrate primarily due to losses, generated in a jurisdiction where no tax benefit can be recognized, and foreign withholding\ntaxes, partially offset by benefits associated with decreases in reserves for uncertain tax provisions and U.S. federal and\nstate tax credits.\nIn 2023, our tax benefit of $49.2 million and effective tax rate of 124.5%, which was different from the U.S. statutory tax\nrate primarily due to a release of the U.S. federal and state valuation allowance. The effective tax rate benefit from the\nvaluation allowance release was offset with detriments associated with losses generated in jurisdictions with rates lower\nthan the U.S. statutory tax rate, increases in reserves for uncertain tax provisions, foreign withholding taxes and goodwill\nimpairment for financial reporting purposes with no tax basis.\nIn 2022, our tax expense of $18.1 million and effective tax rate of 42.5%, which was different from the U.S. statutory tax\nrate primarily due to losses generated in jurisdictions with rates lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate, nondeductible\nexpenses and additional valuation allowance recorded against U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets.\nWe have operations in Malaysia, where we have tax incentive arrangements for our pioneer status activities and our global\nsupply chain operations. The statutory tax rate for Malaysia is 24%. These arrangements are scheduled to expire in August\n2028 and are subject to certain conditions, with which we have partially complied in 2024 and fully complied in 2023 and\n2022. The impact of partial compliance is reflected within the 2024 income tax provision. Our effective income tax rate in\nthe future may be higher depending on a combination of our overall and jurisdictional profitability, the expectation that\nfuture tax holidays will have tax rates greater than our prior approved tax holidays and the impact of the OECD’s Pillar Two\nmodel rules, which aims to implement a global minimum tax rate of 15%. See “Item 8. Financial Statements and\nSupplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Income Taxes.”\nNet Income (Loss) From Discontinued Operations\nAs discussed above, we have presented the results of SMART Brazil as discontinued operations in our consolidated\nstatements of operations for all periods presented. As of August 25, 2023, SMART Brazil was classified as held for sale.\nAccordingly, in 2023 we evaluated the carrying value of the net assets of SMART Brazil (including $206.3 million\nrecognized within shareholder’s equity related to the cumulative translation adjustment from SMART Brazil), estimated\ncosts to sell and expected proceeds and concluded the net assets were impaired. As a result, we recognized an\nimpairment charge of $153.0 million in 2023 to write down the carrying value of the net assets of SMART Brazil. In addition,\nwe concluded that the outside basis of SMART Brazil inclusive of any withholding taxes should be recognized upon the\nclassification as held for sale as of August 25, 2023. Accordingly, we recognized withholding taxes on the expected capital\ngain and deferred tax liabilities of $28.6\n58\nmillion in 2023. In the first quarter of 2024, we completed the divestiture, and in connection therewith, recognized an\nadditional loss of $8.9 million. See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements – Divestiture of SMART Brazil.”\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of August 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $389.5 million, of which $299.1\nmillion was held by subsidiaries outside of the United States. Our principal uses of cash and capital resources have been\nacquisitions, debt service requirements, capital expenditures, research and development expenditures and working capital\nrequirements. We expect that future capital expenditures will focus on expanding our research and development activities,\nmanufacturing equipment upgrades, acquisitions and IT infrastructure and software upgrades. Cash and cash equivalents\ngenerally consist of funds held in demand deposit accounts, money market funds and time deposits. We do not acquire\ninvestments for trading or speculative purposes.\nWe may from time to time seek additional equity or debt financing. Any future equity or debt financing may be dilutive to our\nexisting investors and may include debt service requirements and financial and other restrictive covenants that may\nconstrain our operations and growth strategies. In the event that we seek additional financing, we may not be able to raise\nsuch financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital or generate cash flows\nnecessary to expand our operations and invest in continued product innovation, we may not be able to compete\nsuccessfully, which would harm our business, operations and financial condition.\nWe expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, borrowings available under our credit\nfacilities and cash generated by operating activities will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months.\nCredit Facility\nOn February 7, 2022, Penguin Solutions and SMART Modular Technologies, Inc. (collectively, the “Borrowers”) entered into\na credit agreement (the “Original Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of banks and Citizens Bank, N.A., as administrative\nagent that provided for (i) a term loan credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $275.0 million (the “2027 TLA”) and\n(ii) a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $250.0 million (the “2027 Revolver”), in each case,\nmaturing on February 7, 2027. The Original Credit Agreement provides that up to $35.0 million of the 2027 Revolver is\navailable for issuances of letters of credit. The Original Credit Agreement has subsequently been amended to, among other\nthings, provide for incremental term loans in an aggregate amount of $300.0 million (together with the 2027 TLA, the\n“Amended 2027 TLA”), amend the First Lien Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) and increase\nthe aggregate amount of unrestricted cash and permitted investments netted from the definitions of Consolidated First Lien\nDebt and Consolidated Net Debt. As of August 30, 2024, there was $300.0 million of aggregate principal amount\noutstanding under the Amended 2027 TLA and there were no amounts outstanding under the 2027 Revolver. See “Item 8.\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Debt – Credit Facility.”\nDivestiture of SMART Brazil\nIn November 2023, we completed the divestiture of SMART Brazil. In connection with the divestiture, we sold an 81%\ninterest and retained a 19% interest in SMART Brazil. At the closing of the transaction, we received cash of $143.0 million,\nnet of tax, from the sale. In addition, we have the right to receive a deferred payment of $28.4 million in May 2025. See\n“Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Divestiture of\nSMART Brazil.”\nPreferred Share Investment\nIn July 2024, we entered into the SKT Purchase Agreement for the Investment, pursuant to which we agreed to sell to SK\nthe CPS. The CPS will be convertible into ordinary shares at a conversion price of $32.81 per preferred share, subject to\nadjustment upon the occurrence of certain events, will have an initial liquidation preference of 1x and will only be\nredeemable at our option, subject to certain conditions. The holder of the CPS may convert such holder’s CPS into\nordinary shares at any time, provided that the CPS may, at our option, automatically be converted into ordinary shares on\nany date following the second anniversary of the closing upon certain conditions. The CPS will entitle the holder to receive\ndividends of six percent per annum, cumulative, and payable quarterly in-kind or in cash at our option.\n59\nThe SKT Purchase Agreement may be terminated by either SK or us if the closing has not occurred by April 14, 2025,\nsubject to extension to July 14, 2025 in the event certain approvals have not been obtained. The Investment is expected to\nclose by the end of calendar 2024 or early in calendar 2025. Because the transaction is subject to regulatory clearances\nand approvals, there can be no assurance that the transaction will close in calendar 2024 or 2025, or at all.\nSee “Item 8.

Operating cash flows were favorably affected by a\n$25.7 million net change in our operating assets and liabilities, primarily from the effects of an increase of $54.3 million in\naccounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities and a decrease of $23.8 million inventories, partially offset by\nan increase of accounts receivable of $32.5 million and the payment of $29.0 million of contingent consideration, which\nrelated to our 2023 acquisition of Stratus Technologies. The increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other\nliabilities was primarily due to timing of payments, as well as higher deferred revenue resulting from amounts received from\ncustomers in advance of satisfying performance obligations.\nNet cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in 2023 was $63.7 million, comprised primarily of a net\nincome of $9.7 million, adjusted for non-cash items of $119.3 million. Operating cash flows were adversely affected by a\n$65.4 million net change in our operating assets and liabilities, primarily from the effects of decreases of $256.1 million in\naccounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities and the payment of $73.7 million of contingent consideration,\nwhich related to our 2021 acquisition of the Optimized LED business, partially offset by the effect of decreases of $162.5\nmillion in accounts receivable and $95.2 million in inventories. The decreases in both accounts payable and accrued\nexpenses and inventories were primarily due to lower inventories in our Integrated Memory and Advanced Computing\nsegments. The decrease in accounts receivable was primarily due to lower gross sales in our Integrated Memory segment.\nNet cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in 2022 was $38.9 million, resulting primarily from net\nincome of $24.4 million, adjusted for non-cash items of $136.8 million. Operating cash flows were adversely affected by a\n$122.3 million net change in our operating assets and liabilities, primarily from the effects of an increase of $97.8 million in\naccounts receivable and a decrease of $44.9 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities,\npartially offset by a decrease of $30.7 million in inventories. The increase\n60\nin accounts receivable was primarily due to higher gross sales primarily in our Integrated Memory and Advanced\nComputing segments. The decreases in both accounts payable and accrued expenses and in inventories were primarily\ndue to lower inventories in our Integrated Memory and Advanced Computing segments.\nInvesting Activities: Net cash used for investing activities from continuing operations in 2024 consisted primarily of $19.4\nmillion used for capital expenditures and deposits on equipment and $11.0 million of purchases of non-marketable\ninvestment securities, partially offset by net maturities of marketable investment securities of $19.9 million.\nNet cash used for investing activities from continuing operations in 2023 was $281.2 million, consisted primarily of $213.1\nmillion net cash used for the acquisition of Stratus Technologies, $39.4 million used for capital expenditures and deposits\non equipment and $25.0 million used for the purchases of marketable investment securities.\nNet cash used for investing activities from continuing operations in 2022 consisted primarily of $20.4 million used for capital\nexpenditures and deposits on equipment.\nFinancing Activities: Net cash used for financing activities from continuing operations in 2024 was $209.5 million,\nconsisting primarily of $351.3 million in principal repayment of debt, $21.3 million of payments to acquire ordinary shares,\n$21.0 million payment of contingent consideration related to our 2023 acquisition of Stratus Technologies and $16.3 million\nof payments to acquire capped calls in connection with the issuance of our 2030 Notes, partially offset by $192.7 million in\nnet proceeds from the issuance of our 2030 Notes and $9.8 million in proceeds from the issuance of ordinary shares from\nour equity plans.\nNet cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations in 2023 was $237.2 million, consisting primarily of\n$295.3 million in net proceeds from our term loan and $43.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of ordinary shares from\nour equity plans, partially offset by a $28.1 million payment of contingent consideration related to our 2021 acquisition of\nour Optimized LED business, $24.7 million of payments to acquire ordinary shares, $21.6 million in principal repayment of\ndebt and $14.1 million payment of premium in connection with our convertible note exchange.\nNet cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations in 2022 was $60.6 million, consisting primarily of\n$270.8 million in net proceeds from issuance of a term loan and $12.1 million in proceeds from the issuance of ordinary\nshares from our equity plans, partially offset by $126.7 million in principal repayment of debt, primarily the LED Purchase\nPrice Note, $57.2 million of payments to acquire ordinary shares and $25.0 million in net repayments of borrowings under\nour line of credit.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of these financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management\nto make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related\ndisclosures. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. Estimates and judgments are based on\nhistorical experience, forecasted events and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the\ncircumstances; however, actual results could differ from those estimates. Our management believes the accounting\npolicies below are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management’s\nmost difficult, subjective or complex judgments.\nOur discussion of critical accounting estimates is intended to supplement our summary of significant accounting policies so\nthat readers will have greater insight into the uncertainties involved in applying our critical accounting policies and\nestimates. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, see “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary\nData – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Significant Accounting Policies.”\nBusiness Acquisitions: Accounting for acquisitions requires us to estimate the fair value of consideration paid and the\nindividual assets and liabilities acquired, which involves a number of judgments, assumptions and estimates that could\nmaterially affect the amount and timing of costs recognized in subsequent periods. We typically obtain independent third-\nparty valuation studies to assist in determining fair values, including assistance in determining future cash flows, discount\nrates and comparable market values. Items involving significant assumptions, estimates and judgments include the\nfollowing:\n• Fair value of consideration paid or transferred (including contingent consideration);\n61\n• Inventory, including estimated future selling prices, timing of product sales and completion costs for work in\nprocess;\n• Property, plant and equipment, including determination of values in a continued-use model;\n• Intangible assets, including valuation methodology, estimates of future revenues and costs, profit allocation rates\nattributable to the acquired technology and discount rates;\n• Debt and other liabilities, including discount rate and timing of payments; and\n• Deferred taxes, including projections of future taxable income and tax rates.\nThe valuation of contingent consideration in connection with an acquisition may be inherently challenging due to the\ndependence on the occurrence of future events and complex payment provisions. Estimating the fair value of contingent\nconsideration at an acquisition date and in subsequent periods involves significant judgments, including projecting future\naverage selling prices, future sales volumes, manufacturing costs and gross margins. To project average selling prices and\nsales volumes, we review recent sales volumes, existing customer orders, current prices and other factors such as industry\nanalyses of supply and demand, seasonal factors, general economic trends and other information. To project\nmanufacturing costs, we must estimate future production levels and costs of production, including labor, materials and\nother overhead costs. Actual selling prices and sales volumes, as well as levels and costs of production, can often vary\nsignificantly from projected amounts.\nIncome Taxes: We are required to estimate our provision for income taxes and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable\nin numerous tax jurisdictions around the world. These estimates involve significant judgment and interpretations of\nregulations and are inherently complex. Resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known\nfor many years after completion of the applicable year. We are also required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax\nassets on an ongoing basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires the assessment of our performance and other\nrelevant factors. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income. Our\nincome tax provision or benefit is dependent, in part, on our ability to forecast future taxable income in various jurisdictions.\nSuch forecasts are inherently difficult and involve significant judgments including, among others, projecting future average\nselling prices and sales volumes, manufacturing and overhead costs and other factors that significantly impact our\nanalyses of the amount of net deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized.\nInventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. In our Optimized LED segment, cost is\ndetermined on a first-in, first-out basis. For all other segments, inventory value is determined on a specific identification\nbasis for material and an allocation of labor and manufacturing overhead. At each balance sheet date, we evaluate ending\ninventories for excess quantities and obsolescence, including analyses of sales levels by product family, historical demand\nand forecasted demand in relation to inventory on hand, competitiveness of product offerings, market conditions and\nproduct life cycles. From time to time, our customers may request that we purchase and maintain significant inventory of\nraw materials for specific programs. Such inventory purchases are evaluated for excess quantities and potential\nobsolescence and could result in a provision at the time of purchase or subsequent to purchase. Inventory levels may\nfluctuate based on inventory held under service arrangements. Our provision for excess and obsolete inventory are also\nimpacted by our arrangements with our customers and/or suppliers, including our ability or inability to resell such inventory\nto them.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets: We test goodwill for impairment in our fourth quarter each year, or more frequently if\nindicators of an impairment exist, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit with\ngoodwill is less than its carrying value. For reporting units for which we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair\nvalue is more than its carrying value, goodwill is considered not impaired and we are not required to perform the goodwill\nimpairment test. Qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations, overall\nfinancial performance and other relevant events and factors affecting the fair value of the reporting unit. For reporting units\nfor which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is below the carrying value, goodwill is\ntested for impairment by determining the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing it to the carrying value of the net\nassets assigned to the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is considered\nnot impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we would record an impairment loss up to the\ndifference between the carrying value and implied fair value.\nDetermining when to test for impairment, the reporting units, the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit and the fair value\nof the reporting unit requires significant judgment and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These\nestimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates, forecasted manufacturing costs, budgets and other expenses\ndeveloped as part of our long-range planning process. We test the reasonableness\n62\nof the output of our long-range planning process by calculating an implied value per share and comparing that to current\nshare prices, analysts’ consensus pricing and management’s expectations. These estimates and assumptions are used to\ncalculate projected future cash flows for the reporting unit, which are discounted using a risk-adjusted rate to estimate a fair\nvalue. We base fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently\nuncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates.\nWe test other identified intangible assets with definite useful lives when events and circumstances indicate the carrying\nvalue may not be recoverable by comparing the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be\ngenerated by the asset. Estimating fair values involves significant assumptions, including future sales prices, sales\nvolumes, costs and discount rates.\nRevenue Recognition: We recognize revenue based on the transfer of control of goods and services and apply the\nfollowing five-step approach: (1) identification of a contract with a customer, (2) identification of the performance obligations\nin the contract, (3) determination of the transaction price, (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance\nobligations in the contract and (5) recognition of revenue as performance obligations are satisfied.\nApplying the five-step approach in determining whether to recognize revenue at a point in time or over time requires\nsignificant judgement. A portion of our revenue is from sales of customized product which, in some cases, are non-\ncancellable and/or non-refundable. Significant judgement is required to determine when control passes to the customer\nand whether and when our performance obligations have been satisfied. This determination can significantly affect the\ntiming of recognizing revenue.\nProduct Revenue: Product revenue is generally recognized when control of the promised goods is transferred to\ncustomers. Contracts with customers are generally short-term in duration at fixed, negotiated prices with payment generally\ndue shortly after delivery. We estimate a liability for returns using the expected value method based on historical rates of\nreturn. In addition, we generally offer price protection to our distributors, which is a form of variable consideration that\ndecreases the transaction price. We use the expected value method, based on historical price adjustments and current\npricing trends, to estimate the amount of revenue recognized from sales to distributors. Differences between the estimated\nand actual amounts are recognized as adjustments to revenue.\nNoncancellable, nonrefundable customized product sales are recognized over time on a cost incurred basis. In connection\nwith these arrangements, customers obtain control and benefit from products as they are completed. The terms for these\narrangements provide us with a legally enforceable right to receive payment, including a reasonable profit margin upon\ncustomer cancellation, for performance completed to date. Accordingly, we recognize revenue over time as we complete\nthe manufacture of these products.\nA portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of customized products. In certain cases, we recognize revenue when\ncontrol of the underlying assets passes to the customer when the customer is able to direct the use of, and obtain\nsubstantially all of the remaining benefit from, the assets; the customer has the significant risks and rewards associated\nwith ownership of the assets; and we have a present right to payment. Under the terms of these arrangements, we cannot\nrepurpose products without the customer’s consent and accordingly, we recognize revenue at the point in time when\nproducts are completed and made available to the customer.\nService Revenue: Our service revenue is derived from professional services and supply chain services. Professional\nservices include solution design, system installation, software automation and managed support services related to HPC\nand storage systems. Supply chain services includes procurement, logistics, inventory management, temporary\nwarehousing, kitting and packaging. While we take title to inventory under such arrangements, control of such inventory\ndoes not transfer to us as we do not, at any point, have the ability to direct the use, and thereby obtain the benefits, of the\ninventory. Service revenue also includes extended warranty, on-site services and subscriptions to our HPC environment.\nAgent Services: We provide certain services on an agent basis, whereby we procure product, materials and services on\nbehalf of our customers and then resell such product, materials or services to our customers. Gross amounts invoiced to\ncustomers in connection with these agent services include amounts related to the services performed by us in addition to\nthe cost of the product, materials and services procured. However, only the amount related to the agent component is\nrecognized as revenue in our results of operations. We generally recognize revenue for these procurement, logistics and\ninventory management services upon the completion and/or acceptance of such services, which typically occurs at the\ntime of shipment of product to the customer. Amounts\n63\nwe invoice to customers for the cost of product, materials and services performed, which remain unpaid as of the end of a\nreporting period, are included in accounts receivable. Additionally, the cost of product and materials procured for customers\nunder these agent services, which remain on hand as of the end of a reporting period, are included in inventories. Amounts\nin accounts receivable and inventories impact the determination of cash flows from operating activities.\nDetermining whether we are the principal or agent in these transactions requires significant judgement. This determination\naffects the amount of revenue we recognize; a principal recognizes revenues at the gross amount received for the goods\nand services, while an agent recognizes revenue at the net amount. The impact of this determination significantly impact\nthe amount of revenue and cost of sales we recognize.\nTransaction Price: The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange\nfor transferring goods or services to the customer. We allocate the transaction price to each distinct product and service\nbased on its relative standalone selling price. The standalone selling price for products primarily involves the cost to\nproduce the deliverable plus the anticipated margin and for services is estimated based on our approved list price.\nA portion of our service revenue is from professional services, including installation and other services and hardware and\nsoftware related support. Each contract may contain multiple performance obligations, which requires the transaction price\nto be allocated to each performance obligation. We allocate the consideration to each performance obligation based on the\nrelative selling price, determined as the best estimate of the price at which we would transact if it sold the deliverable\nregularly on a stand-alone basis.\nContract Costs: As a practical expedient, we recognize the incremental costs of obtaining a contract, specifically\ncommission expenses, that have an amortization period of less than 12 months, as an expense when incurred. Additionally,\nwe account for shipping and handling costs, if any, that occur after control transfers to the customer as a fulfillment activity.\nWe record shipping and handling costs related to revenue transactions within cost of sales as a period cost.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk\nForeign Exchange Risk\nWe are subject to inherent risks attributed to operating in a global economy. Our international sales and our operations in\nforeign countries subject us to risks associated with fluctuating currency values and exchange rates. Because a significant\nportion of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, increases in the value of the U.S. dollar could increase the price of our\nproducts so that they become relatively more expensive to customers in a particular country, possibly leading to a reduction\nin sales and profitability in that country. In addition, we have certain costs that are denominated in foreign currencies and\ndecreases in the value of the U.S. dollar could result in increases in such costs, which could have a material adverse effect\non our results of operations.\nAs a result of our international operations, we generate a portion of our net sales and incur a portion of our expenses in\ncurrencies other than the U.S. dollar, such as the Japanese yen, Malaysian ringgit and Chinese renminbi. We present our\nconsolidated financial statements in U.S. dollars and remeasure certain assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars at applicable\nexchange rates. Consequently, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar may affect the value of these items\nwith respect to our non-U.S. dollar businesses in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed\nin their local currency. Our customer pricing and material cost of sales are generally based on U.S. dollars. Accordingly, the\nimpact of currency fluctuations to our consolidated statements of operations is primarily to our other costs of sales (i.e.,\nnon-material components) and our operating expenses as those items are typically denominated in local currency. Our\nconsolidated statements of operations are also impacted by foreign currency gains and losses arising from transactions\ndenominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. These translations could significantly affect the comparability of our\nresults between financial periods or result in significant changes to the carrying value of our assets and liabilities. As a\nresult, changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact our reported results.\nBased on our monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies as of August 30, 2024 and August 25,\n2023, we estimate that a 10% adverse change in exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar would result in losses recorded in\nnon-operating expense of $2.5 million and $1.6 million, respectively, to revalue these assets and liabilities.\n64\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our variable-rate debt. As of August 30, 2024, we had $300.0 million\noutstanding under the 2027 TLA. In addition, our Amended Credit Agreement provides for borrowings of up to $250.0\nmillion under the 2027 Revolver. Assuming that we would satisfy the financial covenants required to borrow and that the\namounts available under the 2027 Revolver were fully drawn, a 1.0% increase in interest rates would result in an increase\nin annual interest expense and a decrease in our cash flows of $5.5 million per year.\nAs of August 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $389.5 million. We maintain our cash\nand cash equivalents in deposit accounts, money market funds with various financial institutions and in short-duration fixed\nincome securities. Due to the short-term nature of these instruments, we believe that we do not have any material\nexposure to changes in the fair value of these investments as a result of changes in interest rates. Increases or decreases\nin interest rates would be expected to augment or reduce future interest income by an insignificant amount.\n65\nItem 8.

Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Penguin Solutions, Inc. (“Penguin Solutions,”\n“we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” or similar terms) and its consolidated subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance\nwith accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Intercompany balances and transactions\nhave been eliminated in consolidation.\nCompany Name Change: On October 15, 2024, we changed our name from SMART Global Holdings, Inc. to Penguin\nSolutions, Inc. The change reflects our focus on key areas such as artificial intelligence infrastructure deployment,\nadvanced memory enterprise solutions and high-performance computing.\nPresentation of SMART Brazil as Discontinued Operations: On June 13, 2023, we entered into an agreement to divest\nof an 81% interest in SMART Modular Technologies do Brasil – Indústria e Comércio de Componentes Ltda. (“SMART\nBrazil”). We concluded that, as of August 25, 2023, (i) the net assets of SMART Brazil met the criteria for classification as\nheld for sale and (ii) the proposed sale represented a strategic shift that was expected to have a major effect on our\noperations and financial results. On November 29, 2023, we completed the divestiture. The balance sheets, results of\noperations and cash flows of SMART Brazil have been presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented.\nSMART Brazil was previously included within our Integrated Memory segment. See “Divestiture of SMART Brazil.”\nUnless otherwise noted, amounts and discussion within these notes to the consolidated financial statements relate to our\ncontinuing operations.\nReclassifications: Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform to current period\npresentation.\nFiscal Year: Our fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period ending on the last Friday in August. Fiscal years 2024, 2023 and\n2022 contained 53, 52 and 52 weeks, respectively. All period references are to our fiscal periods unless otherwise\nindicated.\nFinancial information for our subsidiaries in Brazil was included in our consolidated financial statements on a one-month\nlag because their fiscal years ended on July 31 of each year. In connection with the completion of the divestiture of an 81%\ninterest in SMART Brazil, we ceased consolidating the operations of SMART Brazil in our financial statements as of the\nNovember 29, 2023 disposal date. As a result, financial information for the first quarter of 2024 included the four-month\nperiod for our SMART Brazil operations from August 1, 2023 to November 29, 2023.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments\nCash equivalents include highly liquid investments, readily convertible to known amounts of cash, with original maturities of\nthree months or less. Investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less\nthan one year are classified as short-term investments.\nCash paid for interest, net of amounts capitalized, was $47.7 million, $41.8 million and $12.8 million for 2024, 2023 and\n2022, respectively. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, were $13.1 million, $35.5 million and $13.8 million for 2024, 2023\nand 2022, respectively.\n72\nDerivative Instruments\nWe use derivative instruments to manage our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates from certain monetary\nassets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Derivative instruments are measured at their fair\nvalues and recognized as either assets or liabilities. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivative instruments\nis based on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For derivative instruments that are not\ndesignated for hedge accounting, gains or losses from changes in fair values are recognized in other non-operating\n(income) expense. We do not use foreign currency contracts for speculative or trading purposes.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe measure and report certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value, which is defined as the price that would be\nreceived to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the\nmeasurement date. U.S. GAAP has established a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use\nof observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used\nwhen available. Observable inputs are those that can be obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a\nthird party, whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party might use in pricing an asset or\nliability. The fair value hierarchy is categorized into three levels, based on the reliability of inputs, as follows:\n• Level 1 – Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\n• Level 2 – Valuations based on inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the\nasset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and\n• Level 3 – Valuations based on unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.\nFunctional Currency\nThe functional currency for all of our operations is the U.S. dollar. Monetary balances recorded in currencies other than the\nU.S. dollar are remeasured into U.S. dollars at prevailing exchange rates in effect as of the end of each reporting period.\nGains or losses resulting from the remeasurement of monetary balances are recognized in other non-operating (income)\nexpense.\nGoodwill\nWe test goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators of an impairment exist, to\ndetermine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit with goodwill is less than its carrying value.\nQualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance\nand other relevant events and factors affecting the fair value of a reporting unit. In 2023, we recorded aggregate goodwill\nimpairment charges of $19.1 million. Other than this impairment charge in 2023, there has been no impairment of goodwill\nfor any of our current reporting units. See “Intangible Assets and Goodwill.”\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize current and deferred income taxes based on reported income before income taxes. Deferred income taxes\nreflect the effect of temporary differences and carryforwards recognized for financial reporting and income tax purposes.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying\namounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, utilizing tax rates that are expected to apply in the years in\nwhich temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We recognize valuation allowances to reduce\ndeferred tax assets to the amounts that we estimate, based on available evidence and management judgment, will more\nlikely than not be realized. We record a valuation allowance in the period the determination is made that all or part of the\nnet deferred tax assets will not be realized. We record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in tax\nexpense.\n73\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets are stated at cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of generally 5 to\n19 years for technology, 6 to 8 years for customer relationships and 5 to 10 years for trademarks/trade names. Intangible\nassets are retired in the period they become fully amortized.\nWe review the carrying value of identified intangible assets for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that\ntheir carrying value may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from their use and/or\ndisposition. In cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss\nis recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the identifiable intangible\nassets.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. In our Optimized LED segment, cost is determined on a\nfirst-in, first-out basis. For our other segments, inventory value is determined on a specific identification basis for material\nand an allocation of labor and manufacturing overhead. At each balance sheet date, we evaluate ending inventories for\nexcess quantities and obsolescence, including analyses of sales levels by product family, historical demand and forecasted\ndemand in relation to inventory on hand, competitiveness of product offerings, market conditions and product life cycles.\nLeases\nWe have operating leases through which we acquire or utilize facilities, offices and equipment in our manufacturing\noperations, research and development activities and selling, general and administrative functions. In determining the lease\nterm, we assess whether it is reasonably certain we will exercise options to renew or terminate a lease and when or\nwhether we would exercise an option to purchase the right-of-use asset. Measuring the present value of the initial lease\nliability requires exercising judgment to determine the discount rate, which we base on interest rates for similar borrowings\nissued by entities with credit ratings similar to ours.\nWe recognize right-of use assets and corresponding lease liabilities for leases with an initial term of more than 12 months\nand do not separate lease and non-lease components. Recognized leases are included in operating lease right-of-use\nassets and corresponding lease liabilities are included in other current liabilities or noncurrent operating lease liabilities. For\noperating leases of buildings, we account for non-lease components, such as common area maintenance, as a component\nof the lease and include the components in the initial measurement of our right-of-use assets and corresponding liabilities.\nOperating lease assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of\ngenerally 2 to 8 years for equipment, 5 to 40 years for buildings and building improvements and 2 to 5 years for furniture,\nfixtures and software. Land leases are amortized using the straight-line method over their lease terms, which expire from\n2057 to 2082.\nWe review the carrying value of property and equipment for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the\ncarrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to\nresult from its use and/or disposition. In cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying\nvalue, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value\nof the assets.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenditures are expensed in the period incurred.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue based on the transfer of control of goods and services and apply the following five-step approach:\n(1) identification of a contract with a customer, (2) identification of the performance obligations in the\n74\ncontract, (3) determination of the transaction price, (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in\nthe contract and (5) recognition of revenue as performance obligations are satisfied.\nProduct Revenue: Product revenue is generally recognized when control of the promised goods is transferred to\ncustomers. Contracts with customers are generally short-term in duration at fixed, negotiated prices with payment generally\ndue shortly after delivery. We estimate a liability for returns using the expected value method based on historical rates of\nreturn. In addition, we generally offer price protection to our distributors, which is a form of variable consideration that\ndecreases the transaction price. We use the expected value method, based on historical price adjustments and current\npricing trends, to estimate the amount of revenue recognized from sales to distributors. Differences between the estimated\nand actual amounts are recognized as adjustments to revenue.\nNoncancellable, nonrefundable customized product sales are recognized over time on a cost incurred basis. In connection\nwith these arrangements, customers obtain control and benefit from products as they are completed. The terms for these\narrangements provide us with a legally enforceable right to receive payment, including a reasonable profit margin, upon\ncustomer cancellation for performance completed to date. Accordingly, we recognize revenue over time as we complete the\nmanufacture of these products.\nA portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of customized products. In certain cases, we recognize revenue when\ncontrol of the underlying assets passes to the customer when the customer is able to direct the use of, and obtain\nsubstantially all of the remaining benefit from, the assets; the customer has the significant risks and rewards associated\nwith ownership of the assets; and we have a present right to payment. Under the terms of these arrangements, we cannot\nrepurpose products without the customer’s consent and accordingly, we recognize revenue at the point in time when\nproducts are completed and made available to the customer.\nService Revenue: Our service revenue is derived from professional services and supply chain services. Professional\nservices include solution design, system installation, software automation and managed support services related to high-\nperformance computing (“HPC”) and storage systems. Supply chain services includes procurement, logistics, inventory\nmanagement, temporary warehousing, kitting and packaging. While we take title to inventory under such arrangements,\ncontrol of such inventory does not transfer to us as we do not, at any point, have the ability to direct the use, and thereby\nobtain the benefits, of the inventory. Service revenue also includes extended warranty, on-site services and subscriptions to\nour HPC environment.\nAgent Services: We provide certain services on an agent basis, whereby we procure product, materials and services on\nbehalf of our customers and then resell such product, materials or services to our customers. Gross amounts invoiced to\ncustomers in connection with these agent services include amounts related to the services performed by us in addition to\nthe cost of the product, materials and services procured. However, only the amount related to the agent component is\nrecognized as revenue in our results of operations. We generally recognize revenue for these procurement, logistics and\ninventory management services upon the completion and/or acceptance of such services, which typically occurs at the\ntime of shipment of product to the customer. Amounts we invoice to customers for the cost of product, materials and\nservices performed, which remain unpaid as of the end of a reporting period, are included in accounts receivable.\nAdditionally, the cost of product and materials procured for customers under these agent services, which remain on hand\nas of the end of a reporting period, are included in inventories. Amounts in accounts receivable and inventories impact the\ndetermination of cash flows from operating activities.\nTransaction Price: The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange\nfor transferring goods or services to the customer. We allocate the transaction price to each distinct product and service\nbased on its relative standalone selling price. The standalone selling price for products primarily involves the cost to\nproduce the deliverable plus the anticipated margin and for services is estimated based on our approved list price.\nA portion of our service revenue is from professional services, including installation and other services and hardware and\nsoftware related support. Each contract may contain multiple performance obligations, which requires the transaction price\nto be allocated to each performance obligation. We allocate the consideration to each performance obligation based on the\nrelative selling price, determined as the best estimate of the price at which we would transact if it sold the deliverable\nregularly on a stand-alone basis.\nContract Costs: As a practical expedient, we recognize the incremental costs of obtaining a contract, specifically\ncommission expenses, that have an amortization period of less than 12 months as an expense when incurred. Additionally,\nwe account for shipping and handling costs, if any, that occur after control transfers to the customer\n75\nas a fulfillment activity. We record shipping and handling costs related to revenue transactions within cost of sales as a\nperiod cost.\nShare-Based Compensation\nShare-based compensation is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and recognized as\nexpense under the straight-line attribution method over the requisite service period. We account for forfeitures as they\noccur.\nTreasury Shares\nTreasury shares are carried at cost. When treasury shares are retired, any excess of the repurchase price paid over par\nvalue is allocated between additional capital and retained earnings.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted\nin the United States of America requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,\nliabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures. Estimates and judgments are based on historical experience,\nforecasted events and various other assumptions. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include\nbusiness acquisitions and divestitures, income taxes, inventories, goodwill and intangible assets, property and equipment,\nrevenue recognition and share-based compensation. Actual results could differ from the estimates made by management.\nPreferred Share Investment\nOn July 14, 2024, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “SKT Purchase Agreement”) with SK Telecom\nCo., Ltd. (“SK”). Pursuant to the SKT Purchase Agreement, we agreed to sell to SK 200,000 convertible preferred shares,\npar value $0.03 per share, of Penguin Solutions (the “CPS”), at a price of $1,000 per share or an aggregate price of $200\nmillion (the “Investment”). The CPS will have an initial liquidation preference of 1x and will only be redeemable at our\noption. The CPS will vote together with the ordinary shares, par value $0.03 per share, of Penguin Solutions, on an as-\nconverted basis, and entitle the holder to receive dividends of six percent per annum, cumulative, and payable quarterly in-\nkind or in cash at Penguin Solutions’ option, subject to certain conditions.\nThe holder of the CPS may convert such holder’s CPS into ordinary shares at any time, provided that the CPS may, at our\noption, automatically be converted into ordinary shares on any date following the second anniversary of the closing of the\nInvestment upon which the volume-weighted average price of the ordinary shares for any 15 consecutive trading day\nperiod equals or exceeds 150% of the then-applicable conversion price. The CPS will be convertible into ordinary shares at\na conversion price of $32.81 per preferred share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events. Holders of\nthe CPS are also entitled to certain protective provisions.\nThe SKT Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, covenants and conditions to the closing,\nincluding receipt of all approvals or the termination or expiration of all waiting periods required under applicable antitrust\nlaws. The SKT Purchase Agreement may be terminated by either Penguin Solutions or SK if the closing has not occurred\nby April 14, 2025, subject to extension to July 14, 2025 in the event certain approvals have not been obtained. The\nInvestment is expected to close by the end of calendar 2024 or early in calendar 2025.\nOn the date of closing of the Investment, we and an affiliate of SK will enter into an Investor Agreement and the Certificate\nof Designation relating to the CPS (the “Certificate of Designation”) will become effective. The Investor Agreement and the\nCertificate of Designation provide for certain rights and restrictions relating to the Investment.\nDivestiture of SMART Brazil\nOverview of Transaction\nOn November 29, 2023, we completed the divestiture of SMART Brazil pursuant to the terms of that certain Stock\nPurchase Agreement (the “Brazil Purchase Agreement”), by and among SMART Modular Technologies (LX) S.à\n76\nr.l., a société à responsabilité limitée governed by the laws of Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and a wholly owned subsidiary\nof Penguin Solutions (the “Brazil Seller”), Lexar Europe B.V., a company organized under the laws of The Netherlands (the\n“Brazil Purchaser”), Shenzhen Longsys Electronics Co., Ltd., a company limited by shares governed by the laws of the\nPeople’s Republic of China (“Longsys”), solely with respect to certain provisions therein, Shanghai Intelligent Memory\nSemiconductor Co., Ltd., a limited liability company governed by the laws of the People’s Republic of China and, solely\nwith respect to certain provisions therein, Penguin Solutions.\nPursuant to the Brazil Purchase Agreement, Brazil Seller sold to Brazil Purchaser, and Brazil Purchaser purchased from\nBrazil Seller, 81% of Brazil Seller’s right, title and interest in and to the outstanding quotas of SMART Brazil, with Brazil\nSeller retaining a 19% interest in SMART Brazil (the “Retained Interest”) (the “Brazil Divestiture”).\nAt the closing of the Brazil Divestiture, Brazil Purchaser paid to Brazil Seller (based on a total enterprise value of $204.6\nmillion for SMART Brazil) an upfront cash purchase price, subject to certain customary adjustments as set forth in the\nBrazil Purchase Agreement. In addition, pursuant to the Brazil Purchase Agreement, Brazil Seller has a right to receive,\nand Brazil Purchaser is obligated to pay, (i) a deferred payment due 18 months following the closing and (ii) subject to and\nat the time of exercise of the Put/Call Option (as defined below), an additional deferred cash adjustment equal to 19% of\nthe amount of SMART Brazil’s net cash as of the closing (as calculated pursuant to the Brazil Purchase Agreement).\nPut/Call Option: Pursuant to the Brazil Purchase Agreement, at the closing, SMART Brazil, Brazil Seller, Brazil Purchaser\nand Longsys entered into a Quotaholders Agreement, which provides Brazil Seller with a put option to sell the Retained\nInterest in SMART Brazil to Brazil Purchaser (the “Put Option”) during three exercise windows following SMART Brazil’s\nfiscal years ending December 31, 2026, December 31, 2027 or December 31, 2028 (the “Exercise Windows”), with such\nExercise Windows beginning on June 15, 2027 and ending on July 15, 2027, beginning on June 15, 2028 and ending on\nJuly 15, 2028 and beginning on June 15, 2029 and ending on July 15, 2029, respectively. A call option has also been\ngranted to Brazil Purchaser to require Brazil Seller to sell the Retained Interest to Brazil Purchaser during the Exercise\nWindows (together with the Put Option, the “Put/Call Option”). The price for the Put/Call Option is based on a 100%\nenterprise value of 7.5x net income for SMART Brazil for the preceding fiscal year at the time of exercise.\nConsideration: The following is a summary of total consideration in exchange for the sale of an 81% interest in SMART\nBrazil:\nCash received at closing (1) $ 164,487\nPost-closing adjustment for net cash and net working capital (2) 451\nDeferred payment (3) 25,433\nDeferred cash adjustment (4) 3,721\nTotal consideration $ 194,092\n(1) Included $26.8 million of cash received at closing for an estimated amount of net cash and an estimated net working capital amount\n(in excess of a minimum target amount) as of the closing.\n(2) Represented the post-closing adjustment for net cash and net working capital, which was received in the third quarter of 2024 upon\ncompletion of the review of the final net cash and final working capital amounts.\n(3) Represented the fair value of the deferred payment, comprised of a notional amount of $28.4 million, discounted at 7.5% and due\nMay 2025. The deferred payment was included in other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of\nAugust 30, 2024 and in other noncurrent assets as of August 25, 2023.\n(4) Represented the fair value of the deferred cash adjustment, comprised of a notional amount of $4.8 million, discounted at 7.5%,\nequal to 19% of the amount of SMART Brazil’s net cash as of the closing (as calculated pursuant to the Brazil Purchase\nAgreement). The deferred cash adjustment, which is accounted for as a derivative financial instrument, is due at the time of exercise\nof the Put/Call Option and was included in other noncurrent assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of\nAugust 30, 2024.\nPresentation of SMART Brazil Operations\nAs of August 25, 2023, we concluded that the net assets of SMART Brazil met the criteria for classification as held for sale.\nIn addition, the divestiture of SMART Brazil was expected to have a major effect on our operations and financial results. As\na result, we have presented the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of SMART Brazil as discontinued\noperations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes for all periods presented.\n77\nA disposal group classified as held for sale is measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.\nAccordingly, we evaluated the carrying value of the net assets of SMART Brazil (including $206.3 million recognized within\nshareholders’ equity related to the cumulative translation adjustment from SMART Brazil), estimated costs to sell and\nexpected proceeds and concluded the net assets were impaired as of August 25, 2023. As a result, we recognized an\nimpairment charge of $153.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 to write down the carrying value of the net assets of\nSMART Brazil. In addition, we concluded that the outside basis of SMART Brazil inclusive of any withholding taxes should\nbe recognized upon the classification as held for sale as of August 25, 2023. Accordingly, we recognized withholding taxes\non the expected capital gain and deferred tax liabilities of $28.6 million in 2023.\nAssets and liabilities of SMART Brazil as of the November 29, 2023 disposal date and as of August 25, 2023 were as\nfollows:\nNovember 29, August 25,\nAs of 2023 2023\nCash and cash equivalents $ 40,927 $ 44,501\nAccounts receivable, net 16,482 17,055\nInventories 26,103 25,877\nOther current assets 17,800 17,732\nTotal current assets 101,312 105,165\nProperty and equipment, net 66,870 58,321\nOperating lease right-of-use assets 6,912 5,213\nGoodwill 19,856 20,668\nOther noncurrent assets 27,490 34,243\nTotal assets 222,440 223,610\nImpairment of SMART Brazil assets (153,036) (153,036)\nTotal assets, net of impairment 69,404 70,574\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses 20,576 25,867\nCurrent debt 3,872 4,006\nOther current liabilities 1,023 1,030\nTotal current liabilities 25,471 30,903\nLong-term debt 11,938 13,689\nNoncurrent operating lease liabilities 5,686 4,614\nNoncurrent deferred tax liabilities 28,564 28,564\nOther noncurrent liabilities 93 —\nTotal liabilities 71,752 77,770\nNet assets (liabilities) of discontinued operations $ (2,348) $ (7,196)\nReported as:\nCurrent assets of discontinued operations $ 70,574\nCurrent liabilities of discontinued operations 77,770\nNet assets (liabilities) of discontinued operations $ (7,196)\n78\nThe following table presents the results of operations for SMART Brazil:\nAugust 30, August 25, August 26,\nYear ended 2024 2023 2022\nNet sales $ 55,159 $ 185,377 $ 423,476\nCost of sales 50,560 184,016 361,301\nGross profit 4,599 1,361 62,175\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development 157 5,887 (116)\nSelling, general and administrative 5,421 12,509 14,958\nOther operating (income) expense 64 657 —\nTotal operating expenses 5,642 19,053 14,842\nOperating income (loss) (1,043) (17,692) 47,333\nNon-operating (income) expense:\nLoss from divestiture of 81% interest in SMART Brazil 10,888 153,036 —\nInterest (income) expense, net (1,262) (4,174) (3,176)\nOther non-operating (income) expense 138 996 4,487\nTotal non-operating (income) expense 9,764 149,858 1,311\nIncome (loss) before taxes (10,807) (167,550) 46,022\nIncome tax provision (benefit) (2,659) 27,834 1,837\nNet income (loss) from discontinued operations $ (8,148) $ (195,384) $ 44,185\nLoss from Divestiture of SMART Brazil\nThe following table presents the calculation of the loss from the divestiture of an 81% interest in SMART Brazil:\nProceeds, less costs to sell and other expenses:\nConsideration $ 194,092\nCosts to sell and other expenses (4,150)\n189,942\nBasis in 81% interest in SMART Brazil:\nNet assets of SMART Brazil 145,194\nCumulative translation adjustment (1) 212,397\n357,591\nGain on revalue of 19% Retained Interest in SMART Brazil (2) 3,725\nPre-tax loss on divestiture of 81% interest in SMART Brazil 163,924\nIncome tax provision 26,580\nLoss on divestiture of 81% interest in SMART Brazil $ 190,504\n(1) The sale of an 81% interest in SMART Brazil resulted in the de-consolidation of SMART Brazil and, accordingly, the release of the\nrelated cumulative translation adjustment. Included in the basis calculation above is the balance of cumulative translation\nadjustment for SMART Brazil as of the closing. The release of the cumulative translation adjustment is included in net income (loss)\nfrom discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.\n(2) In connection with the transaction, we revalued our 19% Retained Interest in SMART Brazil based on the implied value for 100% of\nSMART Brazil, adjusted for lack of control premium. As of August 30, 2024, the carrying value of our remaining 19% interest in\nSMART Brazil was $37.8 million and was included in other noncurrent assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as a\nnon-marketable equity investment as of August 30, 2024.\n79\nRecognition Periods: The loss from the divestiture of an 81% interest in SMART Brazil was recognized as follows:\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 1, August 25,\n2023 2023 Total\nPre-tax loss on divestiture of 81% interest in SMART Brazil $ 10,888 $ 153,036 $ 163,924\nIncome tax provision (benefit) (1,984) 28,564 26,580\nLoss on divestiture of 81% interest in SMART Brazil $ 8,904 $ 181,600 $ 190,504\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nIn August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2020-06\n– Debt – Debt with Conversion and Other Options and Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity:\nAccounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity, which simplifies the accounting for\nconvertible debt instruments by reducing the number of accounting models and the number of embedded conversion\nfeatures that could be recognized separately from the primary contract. This ASU requires a convertible debt instrument to\nbe accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost, as long as no other features require bifurcation and\nrecognition as derivatives, and requires an entity to use the if-converted method in the diluted earnings per share\ncalculation for convertible instruments. This ASU was effective for us in the first quarter of 2023 and permitted the use of\neither the modified retrospective or fully retrospective method of transition.\nWe adopted ASU 2020-06 in the first quarter of 2023 under the modified retrospective method. Upon adoption, the\npreviously separated equity component and associated issuance costs for our 2.25% convertible senior notes due 2026\nwere reclassified from additional capital to long-term debt, thereby eliminating future amortization of the debt issuance\ncosts as interest expense. Amortization of the debt issuance costs as interest expense was $8.1 million in 2022. The\nfollowing table summarizes the effects of adopting ASU 2020-06:\nEnding Beginning\nBalance as of Balance as of\nAugust 26, Adoption of August 27,\n2022 ASU 2020-06 2022\nLong-term debt $ 575,682 $ 32,183 $ 607,865\nAdditional paid-in-capital 448,112 (50,822) 397,290\nRetained earnings 251,344 18,639 269,983\nOn August 26, 2022, we made an irrevocable election, effective August 27, 2022, under the indenture to require the\nprincipal portion of our 2026 Notes to be settled in cash and any conversion consideration in excess of the principal portion\nin cash and/or ordinary shares at our option upon conversion. As a result, only the amounts expected to be settled in\nexcess of the principal portion are considered in calculating diluted earnings per share under the if-converted method. See\n“Debt – Convertible Senior Notes – 2026 Notes.”\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.\nThe amendments in this ASU are intended to increase transparency through improvements to annual disclosures primarily\nrelated to income tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. The amendments in this ASU are effective for us in 2026\nfor annual reporting, with early adoption permitted. The ASU may be applied on a prospective basis, although retrospective\napplication is permitted. We are evaluating the timing and effects of this ASU on our income tax disclosures.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07 – Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Segment Reporting\nDisclosures, which will require an entity to provide more detailed information about its reportable segment expenses that\nare included within management’s measurement of profit and loss and will require certain annual disclosures to be\nprovided on an interim basis. The amendments in this ASU are effective for us in 2025 for annual reporting and in 2026 for\ninterim reporting and are required to be applied using the full retrospective method of transition. We are evaluating the\neffects of adoption of this ASU on our segment disclosures.\n80\nBusiness Acquisitions\nStratus Technologies\nOn August 29, 2022 (the “Stratus Acquisition Date”), we completed the acquisition of Storm Private Holdings I Ltd., a\nCayman Islands exempted company (“Stratus Holding Company” and together with its subsidiaries, “Stratus\nTechnologies”), pursuant to the terms of that certain Share Purchase Agreement (the “Stratus Purchase Agreement”),\ndated as of June 28, 2022, by and among Penguin Solutions, Stratus Holding Company and Storm Private Investments LP,\na Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership (the “Stratus Seller”). Pursuant to the Stratus Purchase Agreement, among\nother matters, the Stratus Seller sold to Penguin Solutions, and Penguin Solutions purchased from the Stratus Seller, all of\nthe Stratus Seller’s right, title and interest in and to the outstanding equity securities of Stratus Holding Company.\nStratus Technologies is a global leader in simplified, protected and autonomous computing platforms and services in the\ndata center and at the edge. For more than 40 years, Stratus Technologies has provided high-availability, fault-tolerant\ncomputing to Fortune 500 companies and small-to-medium sized businesses enabling them to securely and remotely run\ncritical applications with minimal downtime. Stratus Technologies operates as part of Penguin Solutions’ Advanced\nComputing segment. The acquisition of Stratus Technologies further enhances Penguin Solutions’ growth and\ndiversification strategy and complements and expands Penguin Solutions’ Advanced Computing business in data center\nand edge environments.\nPurchase Price: At the closing of the transaction, we paid the Stratus Seller a cash purchase price of $225.0 million,\nsubject to certain adjustments. In addition, the Stratus Seller had the right to receive, and we were obligated to pay,\ncontingent consideration of up to $50.0 million (the “Stratus Earnout”) based on the gross profit performance of Stratus\nTechnologies during the first full 12 fiscal months following the closing of the acquisition. In the second quarter of 2024, we\npaid in full $50.0 million related to the Stratus Earnout.\nCash paid was utilized, in part, to settle the outstanding debt of Stratus Technologies as of the closing of the transaction\nand was recognized as a component of consideration transferred. As a result, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed\ndo not include an assumed liability for the outstanding debt of Stratus Technologies. The purchase price for Stratus\nTechnologies was as follows:\nCash $ 225,000\nAdditional payment for net working capital adjustment (1) 17,246\nFair value of Stratus Earnout 20,800\n$ 263,046\n(1) Includes $14.4 million paid at closing and $2.8 million paid in the second quarter of 2023 upon completion of the review of the\nworking capital assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\nContingent Consideration: The Stratus Earnout was accounted for as contingent consideration. As of the Stratus\nAcquisition Date, the fair value of the Stratus Earnout was estimated to be $20.8 million and was valued using a Monte\nCarlo simulation analysis in a risk-neutral framework with assumptions for volatility, market price of risk adjustment, risk-\nfree rate and cost of debt. The fair value measurement was based on significant inputs, not observable in the market,\nincluding forecasted gross profit, comparable company volatility, discount rate and cost of debt. The fair value of the\nStratus Earnout was estimated based on the Company’s evaluation of the probability and amount of the Stratus Earnout to\nbe achieved based on the expected gross profit of Stratus Technologies, using an estimated gross profit volatility of 33.4%\nand a discount rate of 7.3% as of the Stratus Acquisition Date.\n81\nValuation: We estimated the fair value of the assets and liabilities of Stratus Technologies as of the Stratus Acquisition\nDate. The purchase price was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as follows:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 29,174\nAccounts receivable 26,685\nInventories 10,890\nOther current assets 6,536\nProperty and equipment 7,292\nOperating lease right-of-use assets 9,216\nIntangible assets 123,700\nGoodwill 125,929\nOther noncurrent assets 11,661\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses (32,656)\nOther current liabilities (36,723)\nNoncurrent operating lease liabilities (7,067)\nOther noncurrent liabilities (11,591)\nTotal net assets acquired $ 263,046\nThe goodwill arising from the acquisition of Stratus Technologies was assigned to our Advanced Computing segment. None\nof the goodwill recognized is deductible for income tax purposes.\nThe fair values and useful lives of identifiable intangible assets were as follows:\nEstimated\nuseful life\nAmount (in years)\nTechnology $ 82,000 5\nCustomer relationships 27,800 8\nTrademarks/trade names 10,000 9\nIn-process research and development 3,900 N/A\n$ 123,700\n• Technology intangible assets were valued using the multi-period excess earnings method based on the discounted\ncash flow and technology obsolescence rate. Discounted cash flow requires the use of significant unobservable\ninputs, including projected revenue, expenses, capital expenditures and other costs, and discount rates calculated\nbased on the cost of equity adjusted for various risks, including the size of the acquiree, industry risk and other risk\nfactors.\n• Customer relationship intangible assets were valued using the multi-period excess earnings method, which is the\npresent value of the projected cash flows that are expected to be generated by the existing intangible assets after\nreduction by an estimated fair rate of return on contributory assets required to generate the customer relationship\nrevenues. Key assumptions included discounted cash flow, estimated life cycle and customer attrition rates.\n• Trademark/trade name intangible assets were valued using the relief from royalty method, which is the discounted\ncash flow savings accruing to the owner by virtue of the fact that the owner is not required to license the\ntrademarks/trade names from a third party. Key assumptions included attributable revenue expected from the\ntrademarks/trade names, royalty rates and assumed asset life.\n• In-process research and development (“IPR&D”) relates to next generation fault tolerant architecture. IPR&D is\nindefinite-lived and will be reviewed for impairment at least annually. IPR&D was valued based on discounted cash\nflow, which requires the use of significant unobservable inputs, including projected revenue, expenses, capital\nexpenditures and other costs. Amortization of this technology over an estimated useful life of 10 years commenced\nin the second quarter of 2024 upon completion of research and development efforts.\n82\nLED Business\nOn March 1, 2021, we completed the acquisition of the Optimized LED business of Cree, Inc., a corporation now known as\nWolfspeed, Inc. (“Cree”). The purchase price for the Optimized LED business consisted of cash payments of $72.4 million,\nthe issuance of an unsecured promissory note issued in the amount of $125.0 million (the “LED Purchase Price Note”) and\nthe potential for Cree to receive an earn-out payment of up to $125.0 million based on the revenue and gross profit\nperformance of the Optimized LED business in the 12-month period ended in March 2022, with a minimum payout of $2.5\nmillion, payable in the form of an unsecured promissory note to be issued by us (the “LED Earnout Note”).\nThe LED Earnout Note was accounted for as contingent consideration and was revalued each quarter with changes in\nvaluation reflected in results of operations. In 2022, we recorded aggregate charges of $41.3 million to adjust the value of\nthe LED Earnout Note to its fair value. The changes in fair value reflected new information about the probability and timing\nof meeting the conditions of the revenue and gross profit targets of the LED business. Based on the revenue and gross\nprofit performance of the LED business in Cree’s first four full fiscal quarters following the closing, the final calculated value\nof the contingent consideration was $101.8 million and, in the fourth quarter of 2022, we issued the LED Earnout Note to\nCree for this amount. In the first quarter of 2023, we repaid in full the amount outstanding under the LED Earnout Note.\nCash and Investments\nAs of August 30, 2024 and August 25, 2023, all of our debt securities, the fair values of which approximated their carrying\nvalues, were classified as held to maturity. As of August 30, 2024, restricted cash, which is included in other noncurrent\nassets, was $0.3 million. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were as follows:\nAugust 30, 2024 August 25, 2023\nCash and Cash Short-term Cash and Cash Short-term\nAs of Equivalents Investments Equivalents Investments\nCash $ 354,037 $ — $ 321,937 $ —\nLevel 1:\nMoney market funds 29,110 — 43,626 —\nU.S. Treasury securities — 6,337 — 25,251\n$ 383,147 $ 6,337 $ 365,563 $ 25,251\nNon-marketable Equity Investments\nAs of August 30, 2024 and August 25, 2023, other noncurrent assets included $53.0 million and $4.2 million, respectively,\nof non-marketable equity investments, which are accounted for under the measurement alternative at cost less impairment,\nif any. In the event an observable price change occurs in an orderly transaction for an identical or a similar investment, the\ncarrying value of investments would be remeasured to fair value as of the date the observable transaction occurred, with\nany resulting gains or losses recorded in results of operations.\nAccounts Receivable\nIn the third quarter of 2023, we entered into a trade accounts receivable sale program with a third-party financial institution\nto sell certain of our trade accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis pursuant to a factoring arrangement. This program\nallows us to sell certain of our trade accounts receivables up to $60.0 million. As of August 30, 2024, there have been no\ntrade accounts receivable sold under this program.\n83\nInventories\nAugust 30, August 25,\nAs of 2024 2023\nRaw materials $ 75,514 $ 90,085\nWork in process 18,742 24,485\nFinished goods 56,957 60,407\n$ 151,213 $ 174,977\nAs of August 30, 2024 and August 25, 2023, 14% and 8%, respectively, of total inventories were owned and held under our\nlogistics services program.\nProperty and Equipment\nAugust 30, August 25,\nAs of 2024 2023\nEquipment $ 89,848 $ 86,429\nBuildings and building improvements 70,462 69,325\nFurniture, fixtures and software 48,027 44,121\nLand 16,126 16,126\n224,463 216,001\nAccumulated depreciation (117,915) (97,267)\n$ 106,548 $ 118,734\nDepreciation expense for property and equipment was $25.7 million, $26.5 million and $22.9 million in 2024, 2023 and\n2022, respectively.\nIntangible Assets and Goodwill\nAugust 30, 2024 August 25, 2023\nGross Accumulated Gross Accumulated\nAs of Amount Amortization Amount Amortization\nIntangible assets:\nTechnology $ 142,539 $ (58,948) $ 141,201 $ (34,569)\nCustomer relationships 72,500 (45,556) 72,500 (33,990)\nTrademarks/trade names 27,964 (17,045) 28,300 (13,257)\n$ 243,003 $ (121,549) $ 242,001 $ (81,816)\nGoodwill by segment:\nAdvanced Computing $ 147,238 $ 147,238\nIntegrated Memory 14,720 14,720\n$ 161,958 $ 161,958\nIn 2024 and 2023, we capitalized $1.4 million and $127.5 million, respectively, for intangible assets, with weighted-average\nuseful lives of 18.2 years and 6.1 years, respectively. Amortization expense for intangible assets was $40.0 million, $45.1\nmillion and $23.8 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Amortization expense is expected to be $35.6 million for\n2025, $30.2 million for 2026, $29.6 million for 2027, $9.9 million for 2028, $6.0 million for 2029 and $10.2 million for 2030\nand thereafter.\nIn connection with our acquisition of Stratus Technologies, we capitalized $3.9 million of in-process research and\ndevelopment related to next generation fault tolerant architecture. Amortization of this technology commenced in the\nsecond quarter of 2024.\nIn the second quarter of 2023, we initiated a plan within our Advanced Computing segment pursuant to which we intend to\nwind down manufacturing and discontinue the sale of legacy products offered through our Penguin Edge\n84\nbusiness by approximately the end of 2025. As a result, we recorded aggregate charges of $19.1 million in 2023 to impair\nthe carrying value of Penguin Edge goodwill. At each reporting date, we reassess the estimated remaining cash flows of\nthe Penguin Edge business. We currently anticipate that the remaining goodwill of the Penguin Edge reporting unit of $16.1\nmillion as of August 30, 2024 may become further impaired in future periods.\nAccounts Payable and Accrued Expenses\nAugust 30, August 25,\nAs of 2024 2023\nAccounts payable (1) $ 182,037 $ 134,980\nSalaries, wages and benefits 22,819 27,665\nIncome and other taxes 11,863 13,370\nOther 2,371 6,020\n$ 219,090 $ 182,035\n(1) Included accounts payable for property and equipment of $0.4 million and $5.2 million as of August 30, 2024 and August 25, 2023,\nrespectively.\nDebt\nAugust 30, August 25,\nAs of 2024 2023\nAmended 2027 TLA $ 297,297 $ 544,943\n2030 Notes 192,778 —\n2029 Notes 147,439 146,886\n2026 Notes 19,833 98,609\n657,347 790,438\nLess current debt — (35,618)\nLong-term debt $ 657,347 $ 754,820\nCredit Facility\nOn February 7, 2022, Penguin Solutions and SMART Modular Technologies, Inc. (collectively, the “Borrowers”) entered into\na credit agreement (the “Original Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of banks and Citizens Bank, N.A., as administrative\nagent (the “Administrative Agent”) that provided for (i) a term loan credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $275.0\nmillion (the “2027 TLA”) and (ii) a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $250.0 million (the “2027\nRevolver”), in each case, maturing on February 7, 2027. The Original Credit Agreement provides that up to $35.0 million of\nthe 2027 Revolver is available for issuances of letters of credit.\nOn August 29, 2022, the Borrowers entered into an amendment (the Original Credit Agreement, as amended by this\namendment and subsequent amendments, the “Amended Credit Agreement”) with and among the lenders party thereto\nand the Administrative Agent, which (i) provided for incremental term loans under the Amended Credit Agreement in an\naggregate amount of $300.0 million (the “Incremental Term Loans” and together with the 2027 TLA, the “Amended 2027\nTLA”), which Incremental Term Loans are on the same terms as the term loans incurred under the Original Credit\nAgreement, (ii) increased the maximum First Lien Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) financial\ncovenant from 3.00:1.00 to 3.25:1.00 and (iii) increased the aggregate amount of unrestricted cash and permitted\ninvestments netted from the definitions of Consolidated First Lien Debt and Consolidated Net Debt under the Amended\nCredit Agreement from $100.0 million to $125.0 million.\nSubstantially simultaneously with amending the Original Credit Agreement, the Borrowers applied a portion of the proceeds\nof the Incremental Term Loans to (i) finance a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of Stratus Technologies and\n(ii) prepay in full the $101.8 million outstanding under the LED Earnout Note. In connection with our prepayment of the LED\nEarnout Note, we recognized a gain of $0.8 million in the first quarter of 2023, which is included in other non-operating\n(income) expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nInterest and fees: Loans under the Amended Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to either, at our\noption, a term SOFR or a base rate, in each case plus an applicable margin.\n85\nThe applicable margin for our 2027 TLA and 2027 Revolver varies based on our Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the\nAmended Credit Agreement) and ranges from 1.25% to 3.00% per annum with respect to term SOFR borrowings and from\n0.25% to 2.00% per annum with respect to base rate borrowings. In addition, we are required to pay a quarterly unused\ncommitment fee at an initial rate of 0.25%, which may increase up to a rate of 0.35% based on certain Total Leverage Ratio\nlevels specified in the Amended Credit Agreement.\nSecurity: The Amended Credit Agreement is jointly and severally guaranteed on a senior basis by certain subsidiaries of\nPenguin Solutions organized in the United States and Cayman Islands. In addition, the Amended Credit Agreement is\nsecured by a pledge of the capital stock of, or equity interests in, certain subsidiaries of Penguin Solutions organized in the\nUnited States and the Cayman Islands and by substantially all of the assets of certain subsidiaries of Penguin Solutions\norganized in the United States and the Cayman Islands.\nCovenants: The Amended Credit Agreement contains a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to\ncertain exceptions, our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to: incur additional indebtedness; create liens on assets;\nengage in mergers or consolidations; sell assets; pay dividends; make distributions or repurchase capital stock; make\ninvestments, loans or advances; repay or repurchase certain subordinated debt (except as scheduled or at maturity);\ncreate restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to us from our restricted subsidiaries; make certain\nacquisitions; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; amend material agreements governing our subordinated debt;\nand fundamentally change our business.\nThe Amended Credit Agreement also includes the following financial maintenance covenants tested on the final day of\neach fiscal quarter:\ni. a First Lien Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) of a maximum of 3.25 to 1.00\nii. a Total Leverage Ratio of a maximum of 4.50 to 1.00; provided that in connection with any Material Acquisition (as\ndefined in the Amended Credit Agreement), at the election of the Borrowers, the maximum Total Leverage Ratio for\nthe next four testing periods after such Material Acquisition has been consummated will be automatically increased\nby 0.50 to 1.00 above the otherwise permitted Total Leverage Ratio for the applicable fiscal quarter (not to exceed\na maximum of 5.00 to 1.00 in any event); provided further, that (x) no more than two such elections may be made\nduring the term of the Amended Credit Agreement and (y) following the first such election, no subsequent election\nmay be made unless the Total Leverage Ratio has been less than or equal to a maximum of 5.00 to 1.00 as of the\nlast day of at least two consecutive Test Periods (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) following the\nexpiration of the first increase; and\niii. an Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) of at least 3.00 to 1.00.\nFor purposes of calculating the First Lien Leverage Ratio and the Total Leverage Ratio, the consolidated debt of the\nCompany and its Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) is reduced by up to $125.0 million\nof the aggregate amount of unrestricted cash and Permitted Investments (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) of\nthe Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries.\nOther: In 2024, we prepaid an aggregate of $230.0 million under the Amended 2027 TLA and, in connection therewith,\nwrote off $2.4 million of unamortized issuance costs. As of August 30, 2024, there was $300.0 million of principal amount\noutstanding under the Amended 2027 TLA, unamortized issuance costs were $2.7 million and the effective interest rate\nwas 8.62%. As of August 30, 2024, there were no amounts outstanding under the 2027 Revolver and unamortized\nissuance costs were $2.2 million.\nConvertible Senior Notes\nRepurchase of Convertible Senior Notes\nOn August 6, 2024, we repurchased $80.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 2026 Notes for $100.6 million cash\n(including payment for accrued interest) in privately-negotiated transactions. The repurchase was accounted for as debt\nextinguishment. Accordingly, we recognized a loss in the fourth quarter of 2024, included in other non-operating expense,\nof $20.4 million, consisting of $19.7 million premium paid to extinguish the 2026 Notes and $0.7 million for the write-off of\nunamortized issuance costs.\n86\nConvertible Senior Notes Exchange\nOn January 18, 2023, we entered into separate, privately-negotiated exchange agreements with a limited number of\nholders of our 2.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the “2026 Notes”) to exchange $150.0 million principal amount of\nthe 2026 Notes for (i) $150.0 million in aggregate principal amount of new 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2029 (the\n“2029 Notes”) and (ii) an aggregate of $15.6 million in cash, with such cash payment representing $14.1 million of premium\npaid for the 2026 Notes in excess of par value and $1.5 million of accrued and unpaid interest on the 2026 Notes\n(collectively, the “Exchange Transactions”). The 2029 Notes were issued pursuant to, and are governed by, an indenture\n(the “2029 Indenture”), dated as of January 23, 2023, between the Company and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National\nAssociation, as trustee.\nTransactions involving contemporaneous exchanges between the same debtor and creditor in connection with the\nissuance of a new debt obligation and satisfaction of an existing debt obligation are accounted for as debt extinguishments\nif the debt instruments have substantially different terms. An exchange is deemed to have substantially different terms if:\n• The present value of the remaining cash flows of the old instrument differs by more than 10% of the present value\nof the cash flows of the new instrument, or\n• The change in the fair value of the conversion option immediately before and after the exchange is greater than\n10% of the carrying value of the debt instrument immediately prior to the exchange.\nWe concluded that the exchanged 2026 Notes and the 2029 Notes had substantially different terms, and accordingly, we\naccounted for the Exchange Transactions as the extinguishment of the 2026 Notes and the issuance of the 2029 Notes. As\na result, we recognized an extinguishment loss in the second quarter of 2023, included in other non-operating expense, of\n$16.7 million consisting of the premium paid to extinguish the 2026 Notes and $2.5 million for the write-off of unamortized\nissuance costs.\n2030 Notes\nOn August 6, 2024 and August 14, 2024, we issued $175.0 million and $25.0 million aggregate principal amount,\nrespectively, of our 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2030 (collectively, the “2030 Notes”) pursuant to, and governed\nby, an indenture (the “2030 Indenture”), dated August 6, 2024, between us and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National\nAssociation, as trustee.\nThe 2030 Notes bear interest at a rate of 2.00% per annum on the principal amount thereof, payable semi-annually in\narrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on February 15, 2025, to the noteholders of record of the\n2030 Notes as of the close of business on the immediately preceding February 1 and August 1, respectively. The 2030\nNotes will mature on August 15, 2030 (the “2030 Maturity Date”), unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased.\nThe initial conversion rate of the 2030 Notes is 35.7034 ordinary shares per $1,000 principal amount of the 2030 Notes,\nwhich represents an initial conversion price of approximately $28.01 per ordinary share. The conversion rate is subject to\nadjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events as set forth in the 2030 Indenture. Upon conversion, we are\nrequired to pay cash in an amount at least equal to the principal portion and have the option to settle any amount in excess\nof the principal portion in cash and/or ordinary shares.\nConversion Rights: Holders of the 2030 Notes may convert them under the following circumstances:\ni. during any fiscal quarter commencing after the fiscal quarter ended on November 29, 2024 (and only during such\nfiscal quarter) if the last reported sale price per ordinary share exceeds 130% of the conversion price for at least 20\ntrading days, whether or not consecutive, in the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last\ntrading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter;\nii. during the five consecutive business days immediately after any 10 consecutive trading day period (such 10\nconsecutive trading day period, the “2030 Notes Measurement Period”) in which the trading price per $1,000\nprincipal amount of notes for each trading day of the 2030 Notes Measurement Period was less than 98% of the\nproduct of the last reported sale price per ordinary share on such trading day and the conversion rate on such\ntrading day;\niii. upon the occurrence of certain corporate events or distributions on our ordinary shares, as provided in the 2030\nIndenture;\niv. if we call the 2030 Notes for redemption; and\n87\nv. on or after February 15, 2030 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before\nthe 2030 Maturity Date.\nCash Redemption at Our Option: We have the right to redeem the 2030 Notes, in whole or in part, at our option at any\ntime, and from time to time, on or after August 20, 2027 and on or before the 31st scheduled trading day immediately\nbefore the 2030 Maturity Date, at a cash redemption price equal to the principal amount of the 2030 Notes to be redeemed,\nplus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, but only if the 2030 Notes are “freely tradable” (as defined in the 2030 Indenture)\nand all accrued and unpaid additional interest, if any, has been paid in full as of the date we send the related redemption\nnotice, and if the last reported per share sale price of our ordinary shares exceeds 130% of the conversion price on (i) each\nof at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day immediately\nbefore the redemption notice date for such redemption and (ii) the trading day immediately before the date we send such\nnotice. In addition, we have the right to redeem all, but not less than all, of the 2030 Notes if certain changes in tax law\noccur. Calling any 2030 Note for redemption will constitute a make-whole fundamental change with respect to such note, in\nwhich case the conversion rate applicable to the conversion of such note will be increased in certain circumstances if it is\nconverted after it is called for redemption.\n2029 Notes\nThe 2029 Notes bear interest at a rate of 2.00% per annum on the principal amount thereof, payable semi-annually in\narrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning on August 1, 2023, to the noteholders of record of the 2029\nNotes as of the close of business on the immediately preceding January 15 and July 15, respectively. The 2029 Notes will\nmature on February 1, 2029 (the “2029 Maturity Date”), unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased.\nThe initial conversion rate of the 2029 Notes is 47.1059 ordinary shares per $1,000 principal amount of the 2029 Notes,\nwhich represents an initial conversion price of approximately $21.23 per ordinary share. The conversion rate is subject to\nadjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events as set forth in the 2029 Indenture. Upon conversion, we are\nrequired to pay cash in an amount at least equal to the principal portion and have the option to settle any amount in excess\nof the principal portion in cash and/or ordinary shares.\nConversion Rights: Holders of the 2029 Notes may convert them under the following circumstances:\ni. during any fiscal quarter commencing after the fiscal quarter ended on May 26, 2023 (and only during such fiscal\nquarter) if the last reported sale price per ordinary share exceeds 130% of the conversion price for at least 20\ntrading days in the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal\nquarter;\nii. during the five consecutive business days immediately after any 10 consecutive trading day period (such 10\nconsecutive trading day period, the “2029 Notes Measurement Period”) in which the trading price per $1,000\nprincipal amount of notes for each trading day of the 2029 Notes Measurement Period was less than 98% of the\nproduct of the last reported sale price per ordinary share on such trading day and the conversion rate on such\ntrading day;\niii. upon the occurrence of certain corporate events or distributions on our ordinary shares, as provided in the 2029\nIndenture;\niv. if we call the 2029 Notes for redemption; and\nv. on or after August 1, 2028 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the\n2029 Maturity Date.\nCash Redemption at Our Option: We have the right to redeem the 2029 Notes, in whole or in part, at our option at any\ntime, and from time to time, on or after February 6, 2026 and on or before the 40th scheduled trading day immediately\nbefore the 2029 Maturity Date, at a cash redemption price equal to the principal amount of the 2029 Notes to be redeemed,\nplus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, but only if the last reported per share sale price of our ordinary shares exceeds\n130% of the conversion price on (i) each of at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and\nincluding, the trading day immediately before the redemption notice date for such redemption and (ii) the trading day\nimmediately before the date we send such notice. In addition, we have the right to redeem all, but not less than all, of the\n2029 Notes if certain changes in tax law occur. Calling any 2029 Note for redemption will constitute a make-whole\nfundamental change with respect to such note, in which case the conversion rate applicable to the conversion of such note\nwill be increased in certain circumstances if it is converted after it is called for redemption.\n88\n2026 Notes\nIn February 2020, we issued $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2026 Notes. The 2026 Notes are general\nunsecured obligations, bear interest at an annual rate of 2.25% per year, payable semi-annually on February 15 and\nAugust 15, and mature on February 15, 2026 (the “2026 Maturity Date”), unless earlier converted, redeemed or\nrepurchased. The 2026 Notes are governed by an indenture (the “2026 Indenture”) between us and U.S. Bank Trust\nCompany National Association, as trustee. After the effect of the share dividend paid in the second quarter of 2022, the\nconversion rate of the 2026 Notes is 49.2504 ordinary shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which represents a\nconversion price of approximately $20.30 per ordinary share. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment upon the\noccurrence of certain specified events as set forth in the 2026 Indenture. On January 18, 2023, we exchanged\n$150.0 million principal amount of 2026 Notes for $150.0 million principal amount of new 2029 Notes. As a result, as of\nAugust 25, 2023, $100.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2026 Notes were outstanding. On August 6, 2024, we\nrepurchased $80.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 2026 Notes for $100.6 million cash (including payment for\naccrued interest) in privately-negotiated transactions. As of August 30, 2024, $20.0 million in aggregate principal amount of\n2026 Notes were outstanding. See “Repurchase of Convertible Senior Notes” and “Convertible Senior Notes Exchange.”\nFirst Supplemental Indenture to Indenture Governing the 2026 Notes: On August 26, 2022, Penguin Solutions entered\ninto the First Supplemental Indenture (the “2026 First Supplemental Indenture”) to the 2026 Indenture governing the 2026\nNotes. The 2026 First Supplemental Indenture became effective on August 27, 2022. Pursuant to the 2026 First\nSupplemental Indenture, Penguin Solutions irrevocably elected (i) to eliminate Penguin Solutions’ option to elect Physical\nSettlement (as defined in the 2026 Indenture) on any conversion of the 2026 Notes that occurs on or after the date of the\n2026 First Supplemental Indenture and (ii) with respect to any Combination Settlement (as defined in the 2026 Indenture)\nfor a conversion of the 2026 Notes, the Specified Dollar Amount (as defined in the 2026 Indenture) that will be settled in\ncash per $1,000 principal amount of the 2026 Notes shall be no lower than $1,000. As a result of our election, upon\nconversion, we are required to pay cash in an amount at least equal to the principal portion and have the option to settle\nany amount in excess of the principal portion in cash and/or ordinary shares.\nConversion Rights: Holders of the 2026 Notes may convert them under the following circumstances:\ni. during any fiscal quarter commencing after the fiscal quarter ended on May 28, 2020 (and only during such fiscal\nquarter) if the last reported sale price per ordinary share exceeds 130% of the conversion price for at least 20\ntrading days in the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal\nquarter;\nii. during the five consecutive business days immediately after any 10 consecutive trading day period (such 10\nconsecutive trading day period, the “2026 Notes Measurement Period”) in which the trading price per $1,000\nprincipal amount of notes for each trading day of the 2026 Notes Measurement Period was less than 98% of the\nproduct of the last reported sale price per ordinary share on such trading day and the conversion rate on such\ntrading day;\niii. upon the occurrence of certain corporate events or distributions on our ordinary shares, as provided in the 2026\nIndenture;\niv. if we call the 2026 Notes for redemption: and\nv. on or after August 15, 2025 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the\n2026 Maturity Date.\nCash Redemption at Our Option: We have the right to redeem the 2026 Notes, in whole or in part, at our option at any\ntime, and from time to time, on or after February 21, 2023 and on or before the 40th scheduled trading day immediately\nbefore the 2026 Maturity Date, at a cash redemption price equal to the principal amount of the 2026 Notes to be redeemed,\nplus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. However, the repurchase right is only applicable if the last reported per share sale\nprice of our ordinary shares exceeds 130% of the conversion price on each of at least 20 trading days during the 30\nconsecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day immediately before the redemption notice date for such\nredemption. In addition, we have the right to redeem all, but not less than all, of the 2026 Notes if certain changes in tax\nlaw occur. Calling any 2026 Note for redemption will constitute a make-whole fundamental change with respect to such\nnote, in which case the conversion rate applicable to the conversion of such note will be increased in certain circumstances\nif it is converted after it is called for redemption.\n89\nRanking\nOur convertible notes are senior, unsecured obligations of the Company and are equal in right of payment with our existing\nand future senior, unsecured indebtedness, senior in right of payment to our existing and future indebtedness that is\nexpressly subordinated to the respective notes and effectively subordinated to our existing and future senior, secured\nindebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness. Our convertible notes are structurally\nsubordinated to all other existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables and (to the extent\nthe Company is not a holder thereof) preferred equity, if any, of our subsidiaries.\nMake-Whole Fundamental Change\nUpon the occurrence of a “make-whole fundamental change” (as defined in each of our convertible note indentures), we\nwill in certain circumstances increase the conversion rate for a specified period of time. In addition, upon the occurrence of\na “fundamental change” (as defined in each of our convertible note indentures), holders of the notes may require us to\nrepurchase their notes at a cash repurchase price equal to the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus\naccrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. The definition of\nfundamental change includes certain business combination transactions and certain de-listing events with respect to our\nordinary shares.\nConvertible Senior Note Interest\nUnamortized debt issuance costs are amortized over the terms of our 2026 Notes, 2029 Notes and 2030 Notes using the\neffective interest method. As of August 30, 2024 and August 25, 2023, the effective interest rate for our 2026 Notes was\n2.83%. As of August 30, 2024 and August 25, 2023, the effective interest rate for our 2029 Notes was 2.40%. As of\nAugust 30, 2024, the effective interest rate for our 2030 Notes was 2.65%. Aggregate interest expense for our convertible\nnotes consisted of contractual stated interest and amortization of issuance costs and included the following:\nAugust 30, August 25, August 26,\nYear ended 2024 2023 2022\nContractual stated interest $ 5,470 $ 5,397 $ 5,609\nAmortization of debt issuance costs 1,167 1,160 9,031\n$ 6,637 $ 6,557 $ 14,640\nAs of August 26, 2022, the carrying amount of the equity components of the 2026 Notes, which was included in additional\npaid-in-capital, was $50.8 million. As of the beginning of 2023, we adopted ASU 2020-06. In connection therewith, we\nreclassified $32.2 million from additional paid-in-capital to long-term debt and $18.6 million from additional paid-in-capital to\nretained earnings. See “Recently Adopted Accounting Standards.”\nLED Earnout Note\nPart of our consideration for the acquisition of the Optimized LED business was the possibility of an earnout payment of up\nto $125.0 million based on the revenue and gross profit performance of the Optimized LED business in Cree’s first four full\nfiscal quarters following the closing, with a minimum payment of $2.5 million. In the third quarter of 2022, we issued an\nunsecured promissory note to Cree for this earnout in the amount of $101.8 million. The LED Earnout Note bore interest at\nLIBOR plus 3.0%, payable quarterly, and was scheduled to mature on March 27, 2025. In the first quarter of 2023, and\nsubstantially simultaneously with entering into the First Amendment, we repaid in full the $101.8 million outstanding under\nthe LED Earnout Note. In connection with our prepayment of the LED Earnout Note, we recognized a gain of $0.8 million in\nthe first quarter of 2023, which is included in other non-operating income in the accompanying consolidated statements of\noperations.\nLED Purchase Price Note\nIn connection with the acquisition of the Optimized LED business, we issued an unsecured promissory note to Cree in the\namount of $125.0 million. The LED Purchase Price Note bore interest at LIBOR plus 3.0%, payable quarterly, and was due\non August 15, 2023. In the second quarter of 2022, we repaid in full the LED Purchase Price Note.\n90\nMaturities of Debt\nAs of August 30, 2024, maturities of debt were as follows:\n2025 $ —\n2026 20,000\n2027 300,015\n2028 —\n2029 150,000\n2030 and thereafter 200,000\nLess unamortized debt issuance costs (12,668)\n$ 657,347\nLeases\nWe have operating leases through which we utilize facilities, offices and equipment in our manufacturing operations,\nresearch and development activities and selling, general and administrative functions. Sublease income was not significant\nin any period presented. The components of operating lease expense were as follows:\nAugust 30, August 25, August 26,\nYear ended 2024 2023 2022\nFixed lease cost $ 12,894 $ 16,574 $ 12,116\nVariable lease cost 1,834 1,386 1,508\nShort-term lease cost 2,086 2,266 466\n$ 16,814 $ 20,226 $ 14,090\nCash flows used for operating activities included payments for operating leases of $9.0 million, $7.7 million and $9.0 million\nin 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Acquisitions of right-of-use assets were $2.3 million, $10.8 million and $47.6 million\nin 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAs of August 30, 2024 and August 25, 2023, the weighted-average remaining lease term for our operating leases was 10.1\nyears and 10.5 years, respectively, and the weighted-average discount rate was 6.1% and 6.0%, respectively. Certain of\nour operating leases include one or more options to extend the lease term for periods from two to five years. In determining\nthe present value of our operating lease liabilities, we have assumed we will not extend any lease terms.\nAs of August 30, 2024, minimum payments of lease liabilities were as follows:\n2025 $ 11,989\n2026 10,418\n2027 7,985\n2028 7,920\n2029 8,097\n2030 and thereafter 46,321\n92,730\nLess imputed interest (24,192)\nPresent value of total lease liabilities $ 68,538\nCommitments and Contingencies\nCommitments\nAs of August 30, 2024, we had commitments of $16.2 million for purchase obligations, a substantial majority of which will\nbe due within one year. Purchase obligations include payments for the acquisition of inventories, property and equipment\nand other goods or services of either a fixed or minimum quantity.\n91\nProduct Warranty and Indemnities\nWe generally provide a limited warranty that our products are in compliance with applicable specifications existing at the\ntime of delivery. Under our standard terms and conditions of sale, liability for certain failures of product during a stated\nwarranty period is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective items or return of amounts paid for such items. Our\nwarranty obligations are not material.\nWe are party to a number of agreements in which we have agreed to defend, indemnify and hold harmless our customers\nand suppliers from damages and costs, which may arise from product defects as well as from any alleged infringement by\nour products of third-party patents, trademarks or other proprietary rights. We believe our internal development processes\nand other policies and practices limit our exposure related to such indemnities. Maximum potential future payments cannot\nbe estimated because many of these agreements do not have a maximum stated liability. However, to date, we have not\nhad to reimburse any of our customers or suppliers for any significant losses related to these indemnities. We have not\nrecorded any liability for such indemnities.\nContingencies\nFrom time to time, we may be involved in legal matters that arise in the normal course of business. Litigation in general,\nand intellectual property, employment and shareholder litigation in particular, can be expensive and disruptive to normal\nbusiness operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict. We regularly review\ncontingencies to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the\nloss or range of loss can be made.\nEquity\nPenguin Solutions Shareholders’ Equity\nShare Dividend\nOn January 3, 2022, our Board of Directors declared a share dividend of one ordinary share, $0.03 par value per share, for\neach outstanding ordinary share owned, to shareholders of record as of January 25, 2022. The dividend was paid on\nFebruary 1, 2022.\nShare Repurchase Authorization\nOn April 4, 2022, our Board of Directors approved a $75.0 million share repurchase authorization (the “Initial\nAuthorization”), under which we may repurchase our outstanding ordinary shares from time to time through open market\nrepurchases, privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise. On January 8, 2024, the Audit Committee of the Board of\nDirectors approved an additional $75.0 million share repurchase authorization (the “Additional Authorization,” and together\nwith the Initial Authorization, the “Current Authorization”). The Current Authorization has no expiration date but may be\nsuspended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. In 2024, 2023 and 2022, we repurchased 0.9 million, 0.5\nmillion and 2.6 million shares, respectively, for $13.9 million, $8.4 million and $50.0 million, respectively, under the Current\nAuthorization. As of August 30, 2024, an aggregate of $77.7 million remained available for the repurchase of our ordinary\nshares under the Current Authorization. Certain of our agreements, including the Amended Credit Agreement and the\nCertificate of Designation, contain restrictions that limit our ability to repurchase our ordinary shares.\nOther Share Repurchases\nOrdinary shares withheld as payment of withholding taxes and exercise prices in connection with the vesting or exercise of\nequity awards are treated as ordinary share repurchases. In 2024, 2023 and 2022, we repurchased 377 thousand, 506\nthousand and 240 thousand ordinary shares as payment of withholding taxes for $7.4 million, $10.9 million and $7.2\nmillion, respectively.\nIn connection with the Exchange Transactions in the second quarter of 2023, we repurchased 326 thousand ordinary\nshares for $5.4 million. See “Debt – Convertible Senior Notes – Convertible Senior Notes Exchange.”\n92\nCapped Calls\nIn connection with our convertible notes, we have entered into privately-negotiated capped call transactions, which are\nintended to reduce the effect of potential dilution upon conversion of our convertible notes. The capped calls provide for our\nreceipt of cash or shares, at our election, from counterparties if the trading price of our ordinary shares is above the strike\nprice on the expiration date. The capped calls are subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those\napplicable to the corresponding convertible notes. The cost of capped calls, which are considered capital transactions,\nwere recognized as decreases to additional paid-in capital.\nCapped calls are separate transactions, each between the Company and the counterparties to the various capped calls,\nand are not part of the terms of any of the convertible notes and do not affect any holder’s rights under the convertible\nnotes or related indentures. Holders of any of the convertible notes do not have any rights with respect to any of the\ncapped calls.\nAs of August 30, 2024, the dollar value of cash or ordinary shares that we would receive from our outstanding capped calls\nupon their expiration dates range from $0, if the trading price of our ordinary shares is at or below the strike prices for each\nof the capped calls at expiration, to $158.4 million, if the trading price of our ordinary shares is at or above the cap prices\nfor each of the capped calls. Settlement of a capped call prior to its expiration date may be for an amount different than the\nvalue at expiration. The following table presents information related to outstanding capped calls as of August 30, 2024:\nMaximum Value\nExpiration Date Strike Price Cap Price Shares at Expiration\n2026 Capped Calls February 15, 2026 $ 20.3044 $ 27.0725 4,925 $ 33,333\n2029 Capped Calls February 1, 2029 $ 21.2288 $ 29.1375 7,066 55,882\n2030 Capped Calls August 15, 2030 $ 28.0085 $ 37.7038 7,141 69,231\n19,132 $ 158,446\nAs part of the Exchange Transactions, we settled a portion of the 2026 Capped Calls in a notional amount of $150.0\nmillion, equal to the amount of the 2026 Notes exchanged. In connection therewith, we received cash of $10.8 million,\nwhich was recognized as an increase in additional paid-in capital in the second quarter of 2023.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nChanges in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by component for 2024 were as follows:\nCumulative Gains (Losses)\nTranslation on\nAdjustment Investments Total\nAs of August 25, 2023 $ (205,969) $ 5 $ (205,964)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications (6,352) 5 (6,347)\nReclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income 212,321 — 212,321\nOther comprehensive income (loss) 205,969 5 205,974\nAs of August 30, 2024 $ — $ 10 $ 10\nIn connection with our divestiture of an 81% interest in SMART Brazil, we reclassified $212.4 million of cumulative\ntranslation adjustment related to SMART Brazil from other accumulated comprehensive income to results of operations in\nthe first quarter of 2024. See “Divestiture of SMART Brazil.”\nNoncontrolling Interest in Subsidiary\nWe have a 51% ownership interest in Cree Venture LED Company Limited (“Cree Joint Venture”), with the remaining 49%\nownership interest held by San’an Optoelectronics Co., Ltd (“San’an”). The Cree Joint Venture has a five-member board of\ndirectors, three of which are designated by us and two of which are designated by San’an.\n93\nAs a result of our majority voting interest, we consolidate the operations of the Cree Joint Venture and report its results of\noperations within our Optimized LED segment.\nThe Cree Joint Venture has a manufacturing agreement pursuant to which San’an supplies it with mid-power LED products\nand we and the Cree Joint Venture have a sales agent agreement pursuant to which we are the independent sales\nrepresentative of the Cree Joint Venture. The Cree Joint Venture produces and delivers to market high performing, mid-\npower lighting class LEDs in an exclusive arrangement serving the markets of North and South America, Europe and\nJapan, and serves China markets and the rest of the world on a non-exclusive basis. The 49% ownership interest held by\nSan’an is classified as noncontrolling interest. Cash and other assets of the Cree Joint Venture are generally not available\nfor use by us in our other operations.\nFair Value Measurements\nAugust 30, 2024 August 25, 2023\nAs of Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value\nAssets:\nDerivative financial instruments $ 3,929 $ 3,929 $ — $ —\nLiabilities:\nAmended 2027 TLA $ 300,015 $ 297,297 $ 551,648 $ 544,943\n2030 Notes 199,160 192,778 — —\n2029 Notes 178,760 147,439 195,426 146,886\n2026 Notes 23,918 19,833 131,864 98,609\nAcquisition-related contingent consideration — — 50,000 50,000\nThe deferred cash adjustment resulting from the divestiture of an 81% interest in SMART Brazil is accounted for as a\nderivative financial instrument and is revalued at the end of each reporting period. The asset’s fair value, as measured on a\nrecurring basis, was based on Level 2 measurements, including market-based observable inputs of interest rates and\ncredit-risk spreads.\nThe fair value of the Amended 2027 TLA, as measured on a non-recurring basis, was estimated based on Level 2\nmeasurements, including discounted cash flows and interest rates based on similar debt issued by parties with credit\nratings similar to ours. The fair values of our convertible notes, as measured on a non-recurring basis, were determined\nbased on Level 2 measurements, including the trading prices of the notes.\nAcquisition-related contingent consideration in the table above related to our acquisition of Stratus Technologies. The fair\nvalue as of August 25, 2023 was based on the gross profit performance of Stratus Technologies during the first full 12 fiscal\nmonths following the closing of the acquisition.\nEquity Plans\nOur Amended and Restated 2017 Share Incentive Plan (the “2017 Plan”) provides for the issuance of equity awards to our\nemployees, directors and consultants. Such awards include both incentive and non-qualified options, share appreciation\nrights, restricted share awards (“RSAs”), restricted share units (“RSUs”) and performance-based awards, such as\nperformance-based restricted share awards (“PRSAs”) and performance-based restricted share units (“PSUs”). As of\nAugust 30, 2024, 4.5 million of our ordinary shares were available for issuance under the 2017 Plan.\nOur 2021 Share Inducement Plan (the “Inducement Plan” and together with the 2017 Plan, our “Penguin Solutions Plans”)\nprovides for the issuance of equity awards to provide inducements for certain individuals to enter into employment with us\nwithin the meaning of Rule 5635(c)(4) of the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules, and to motivate such persons to contribute to,\nand to enable them to share in, any long-term growth and financial success we may experience. Such awards include\noptions, share appreciation rights, RSAs, RSUs and performance-based awards such as PRSAs and PSUs. As of\nAugust 30, 2024, 1.7 million of our ordinary shares were available for issuance under the Inducement Plan.\n94\nOur employee share purchase plan (“ESPP”) has been offered to substantially all employees since April 2018 and\ngenerally permits eligible employees to purchase our ordinary shares through payroll deductions of up to 15% of their\neligible compensation, subject to certain limitations. As of August 30, 2024, 1.9 million of our ordinary shares were\navailable for issuance under the ESPP.\nOptions and RSUs generally vest over a period of four years, and options generally have a ten-year term.\nThe disclosures related to our restricted awards, share options and employee share purchase plan include both our\ncontinuing and discontinued operations.\nRestricted Share Awards and Restricted Share Units Awards (“Restricted Awards”)\nWeighted-\nAverage\nGrant Date Aggregate\nFair Value Intrinsic\nShares Per Share Value\nOutstanding as of August 25, 2023 4,905 $ 19.53 $ 117,327\nGranted 2,085 $ 22.96\nVested (1,895) $ 19.10\nForfeited and cancelled (896) $ 20.98\nOutstanding as of August 30, 2024 4,199 $ 21.12 $ 87,006\nRestricted Award activity was as follows:\nAugust 30, August 25, August 26,\nYear ended 2024 2023 2022\nAwards granted 2,085 2,579 1,642\nWeighted-average grant date fair value per share $ 22.96 $ 17.77 $ 25.73\nAggregate vesting date fair value of shares vested $ 36,286 $ 31,686 $ 49,821\nRestricted Awards include grants with service, performance and/or market conditions with restrictions that generally lapse\nafter a three- to four-year service period. Awards with market conditions are based on either the Company’s share price or\nthe Company’s total shareholder return (“TSR”) relative to companies included in a market index. For awards with market\nconditions, the number of shares that will vest will vary between 0% and 200% of target amounts, depending upon the\nCompany’s achievement level over the specified performance period. The fair value of awards with market conditions were\nfixed at the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation analysis and were based on significant inputs not observable in the\nmarket.\nAs of August 30, 2024, total unrecognized compensation costs for unvested Restricted Awards was $72.8 million, which\nwas expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.3 years.\nShare Options\nAs of August 30, 2024, there were 0.7 million share options outstanding, which are generally exercisable in increments of\neither one-fourth or one-third per year beginning one year from the date of grant. Share options generally expire seven to\nten years from the date of grant. The total intrinsic value for options exercised was $2.6 million, $19.9 million and $6.3\nmillion in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n95\nWeighted-\nWeighted- Average\nAverage Remaining Aggregate\nExercise Price Contractual Intrinsic\nShares Per Share Term (in years) Value\nOutstanding as of August 25, 2023 974 $ 12.55 5.27 $ 11,077\nGranted — $ —\nExercised (246) $ 12.10\nForfeited and cancelled (4) $ 9.04\nOutstanding as of August 30, 2024 724 $ 12.72 4.33 $ 5,911\nExercisable as of August 30, 2024 714 $ 12.71 4.30 $ 5,836\nThe fair value of share options is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The\nexpected volatility is based on the historical volatilities of the common stock of comparable publicly traded companies. The\nexpected term of options granted represents the weighted-average period of time that options granted are expected to be\noutstanding. We apply the simplified approach in which the expected term is the mid-point between the vesting date and\nthe expiration date. The risk-free interest rate is based on the average U.S. Treasury yield curve at the end of the quarter in\nwhich the option was granted.\nAs of August 30, 2024, total aggregate unrecognized compensation costs for unvested options was $0.1 million, which was\nexpected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 0.1 years.\nEmployee Share Purchase Plan\nThe purchase price of shares under our ESPP is equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market value of our ordinary shares\non either the first or last day of each offering period, which is generally six months. Compensation expense is calculated as\nof the beginning of the offering period as the fair value of the employees’ purchase rights utilizing the Black-Scholes option\nvaluation model and is recognized over the offering period. Under the ESPP, employees purchased 584 thousand ordinary\nshares for $6.8 million in 2024, 602 thousand shares for $6.6 million in 2023 and 307 thousand shares for $6.5 million in\n2022.\nShare-Based Compensation Expense\nShare-based compensation expense for our continuing operations was as follows:\nAugust 30, August 25, August 26,\nYear ended 2024 2023 2022\nShare-based compensation expense by caption:\nCost of sales $ 7,113 $ 6,334 $ 6,296\nResearch and development 7,120 6,016 5,868\nSelling, general and administrative 28,927 26,878 25,120\n$ 43,160 $ 39,228 $ 37,284\nIncome tax benefits for share-based awards were $6.6 million, $6.7 million and de minimis in 2024, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively.\nEmployee Savings and Retirement Plan\nWe have a 401(k) retirement plan under which U.S. employees may make contributions, subject to Internal Revenue\nService annual contribution limits, to various savings alternatives, none of which include direct investment in the\nCompany’s ordinary shares. We may make matching contributions, which vest immediately, at our discretion. Contribution\nexpense for our 401(k) plan was $3.9 million, $4.6 million and $4.4 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n96\nRevenue and Customer Contract Balances\nWe disaggregate revenue by segment and geography and by product and service revenue. See “Segment and Other\nInformation.”\nNet Sales and Gross Billings\nWe provide certain services on an agent basis, whereby we procure product, materials and services on behalf of our\ncustomers and then resell such product, materials or services to our customers. As a result, we recognize only the amount\nrelated to the agent component as revenue in our results of operations. The cost of products, materials and services\ninvoiced to our customers under these arrangements, but not recognized as revenue or cost of sales in our results of\noperations, were as follows:\nAugust 30, August 25, August 26,\nYear ended 2024 2023 2022\nCost of materials and services invoiced in connection with logistics services $ 518,685 $ 765,796 $ 1,601,289\nCustomer Contract Balances\nAugust 30, August 25,\nAs of 2024 2023\nContract assets (1) $ 1,801 $ —\nContract liabilities: (2)\nDeferred revenue $ 76,178 $ 69,326\nCustomer advances 6,036 5,565\n$ 82,214 $ 74,891\n(1) Contract assets are included in other current and noncurrent assets.\n(2) Contract liabilities are included in other current and noncurrent liabilities based on the timing of when our customers are expected to\ntake control of the asset or receive the benefit of the service.\nContract assets represent amounts recognized as revenue for which we do not have the unconditional right to\nconsideration.\nDeferred revenue represents amounts received from customers in advance of satisfying performance obligations. As of\nAugust 30, 2024, we expect to recognize revenue of $64.0 million of the balance of $76.2 million in the next 12 months and\nthe remaining amount thereafter. In 2024, we recognized revenue of $51.7 million from satisfying performance obligations\nrelated to amounts included in deferred revenue as of August 25, 2023. In addition, as of August 30, 2024, other current\nliabilities included $15.9 million that is not included in the above remaining performance obligations. While this liability\nrelates to amounts received from customers in connection with arrangements that are cancellable at the customer’s\ndiscretion, we have not had to refund any such amounts to our customers in the periods presented.\nCustomer advances represent amounts received from customers for advance payments to secure product. In 2024, we\nrecognized revenue of $1.5 million from satisfying performance obligations related to amounts included in customer\nadvances as of August 25, 2023.\nAs of August 30, 2024 and August 25, 2023, other current liabilities included $12.2 million and $12.5 million, respectively,\nfor estimates of consideration payable to customers, including estimates for pricing adjustments and returns.\nOther Operating (Income) Expense\nIn 2024 and 2023, we initiated plans that included workforce reductions and the elimination of certain projects across our\nbusinesses. In connection therewith, we recorded restructure charges of $7.1 million and $7.0 million in 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively, primarily for employee severance costs and other benefits. We anticipate that\n97\nthese activities will continue into future quarters and anticipate recording additional restructure charges. As of August 30,\n2024, $0.8 million remained unpaid, which is expected to be paid in 2025.\nOther Non-operating (Income) Expense\nAugust 30, August 25, August 26,\nYear ended 2024 2023 2022\nLoss on extinguishment or prepayment of debt $ 22,763 $ 15,924 $ 653\nLoss (gain) on disposition of assets 179 (2,986) 213\nOther (1,858) (1,101) (516)\n$ 21,084 $ 11,837 $ 350\nIncome Taxes\nIncome (loss) before provision for income taxes consisted of the following:\nAugust 30, August 25, August 26,\nYear ended 2024 2023 2022\nIncome (loss) before income taxes:\nU.S. $ 38,246 $ 20,118 $ 12,405\nNon-U.S. (69,413) (59,631) 30,076\n$ (31,167) $ (39,513) $ 42,481\nIncome tax provision (benefit) consisted of the following:\nAugust 30, August 25, August 26,\nYear ended 2024 2023 2022\nIncome tax provision (benefit):\nCurrent:\nFederal $ 10,930 $ 3,253 $ 1,100\nState 1,821 2,417 1,772\nForeign 9,253 8,418 15,213\n22,004 14,088 18,085\nDeferred:\nFederal (6,815) (51,540) 259\nState 540 (6,998) 43\nForeign (5,111) (4,753) (313)\n(11,386) (63,291) (11)\nIncome tax provision (benefit) $ 10,618 $ (49,203) $ 18,074\n98\nIn applying the statutory tax rate in the effective income tax rate reconciliation below, we used the U.S. statutory tax rate\nrather than the Cayman Islands zero percent tax rate. The table below reconciles our tax provision (benefit) based on the\nU.S. federal statutory rate to our effective tax rate:\nYear ended August 30, 2024 August 25, 2023 August 26, 2022\nStatutory tax rate $ (6,545) 21.0 % $ (8,298) 21.0 % $ 8,921 21.0 %\nForeign income taxes at different rates 15,870 (50.9)% 16,992 (43.0)% 3,887 9.1 %\nState income tax, net of federal benefit 2,278 (7.3)% 2,793 (7.1)% 1,693 4.0 %\nGoodwill impairment — — % 2,876 (7.3)% — — %\nTax on uncertain tax positions (3,825) 12.3 % 5,679 (14.4)% 95 0.2 %\nShare-based compensation (100) 0.3 % (538) 1.4 % (2,681) (6.3)%\nChange in valuation allowance 1,111 (3.6)% (69,789) 176.6 % 3,113 7.3 %\nNon-deductible expenses (non-taxable\nincome) 1,053 (3.4)% 2,151 (5.4)% 3,422 8.1 %\nForeign withholding tax 4,548 (14.6)% 3,371 (8.5)% 2,368 5.6 %\nTax credits (3,337) 10.7 % (4,339) 11.0 % (2,908) (6.8)%\nOther (435) 1.4 % (101) 0.2 % 164 0.3 %\nEffective tax rate $ 10,618 (34.1)% $ (49,203) 124.5 % $ 18,074 42.5 %\nFor 2024, the primary difference between the U.S. federal statutory tax rate and the effective tax rate was due to losses in\njurisdictions where no tax benefit can be recognized, non-deductible expenses and foreign withholding taxes, partially\noffset by benefits from decreases in reserves for uncertain tax provisions and U.S. federal and state tax credits.\n99\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for\nfinancial reporting and income tax purposes as well as carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities consisted of the\nfollowing:\nAugust 30, August 25,\nAs of 2024 2023\nDeferred tax assets:\nAccruals and allowances $ 13,868 $ 15,063\nDeferred revenue 1,838 1,913\nShare-based compensation 3,027 3,159\nResearch and other tax credit carryforwards 4,762 5,759\nCapitalized research and development 22,059 12,588\nOperating lease liabilities 15,199 17,671\nTax amortizable goodwill 14,097 16,040\nInterest carryforward 21,873 22,355\nIntangible assets 5,039 —\nLoss carryforwards 11,908 10,474\nGross deferred tax assets 113,670 105,022\nValuation allowance (3,774) (2,663)\nNet deferred tax assets 109,896 102,359\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nOperating right-of-use assets 13,306 15,650\nProperty and equipment 10,717 11,846\nBrazil capital gains tax 4,138 —\nIntangible assets — 417\nOther liabilities 1,143 1,152\nGross deferred tax liabilities 29,304 29,065\nNet deferred tax assets $ 80,592 $ 73,294\nReported as:\nDeferred tax assets $ 85,078 $ 74,085\nDeferred tax liabilities (included in other noncurrent liabilities) (4,486) (791)\nNet deferred tax assets $ 80,592 $ 73,294\nWe assess positive and negative evidence for each jurisdiction to determine whether it is more likely than not existing\ndeferred tax assets will be realized. In 2024, we recorded $1.2 million of valuation allowance on certain U.S. federal tax\ncredits due to uncertainty regarding the realizability of these deferred tax assets. We have a valuation allowance against\ncertain acquired state tax attributes due to expected annual limitations on utilization. We will continue to monitor the need\nfor a valuation allowance against our remaining deferred tax assets.\nAs of August 30, 2024, we had U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $27.9 million and $41.0 million,\nrespectively. If not utilized, the federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2025. State net operating loss\ncarryforwards of $40.8 million will begin to expire in 2029, while the remaining state net operating loss carryforwards do not\nexpire. In addition, we had U.S. federal and state research and development credit carryforwards of $8.5 million and $6.1\nmillion, respectively, and $1.2 million of foreign tax credit carryforwards. If not utilized, the federal research and foreign tax\ncredits will begin to expire in 2031 and 2032, respectively. If not utilized, $2.1 million of state credits will begin to expire in\n2029, while $4.0 million of state credits do not expire. In addition, we had Section 163(j) interest expense carryforwards of\n$100.0 million from the acquisition of Stratus Technologies which do not expire. Net operating loss carryforwards in Hong\nKong of $33.9 million do not expire.\nFederal and state tax attributes can be subject to an annual limitation under the provisions of Section 382 of the Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and state tax laws. Further, under Section 382 of the Code, if a\ncorporation undergoes an “ownership change,” the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss\ncarryforwards to offset its post-change taxable income may be limited. In general, an “ownership change” will occur if there\nis a cumulative change in our ownership by certain “5-percent shareholders” (including\n100\ngroups of shareholders) that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under\nstate tax laws. Our net operating loss, tax credit and section 163(j) interest expense carryforwards are subject to limitations\nper Sections 382 and 383 of the Code. We have experienced ownership changes in the past, and we may experience\nownership changes in the future, as a result of future transactions in our ordinary shares, some changes of which may be\noutside of our control. As a result, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss, tax credit and section 163(j) interest\nexpense carryforwards to offset post-change U.S. federal and state taxable income may be subject to additional limitations.\nLegislation enacted in 2017, titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”), as modified in 2020 by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief,\nand the Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”), changed the federal rules governing net operating loss carryforwards. For\nnet operating loss carryforwards arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the Tax Act limits a taxpayer’s\nability to utilize such carryforwards to 80% of taxable income beginning after December 31, 2020. In addition, net operating\nloss carryforwards arising in tax years ending after December 31, 2017 can be carried forward indefinitely, but carryback is\ngenerally prohibited, with the exception of carrybacks reinstated by the CARES Act. Net operating loss carryforwards\ngenerated before January 1, 2018 are not subject to the Tax Act’s taxable income limitation and will continue to have a 20-\nyear carryforward period. Nevertheless, our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax assets could expire before\nutilization and could be subject to limitations.\nActivity related to our deferred tax valuation allowance was as follows:\nAugust 30, August 25, August 26,\nYear ended 2024 2023 2022\nBalance at beginning of period $ 2,663 $ 52,267 $ 49,154\nCharged (credited) to operations 1,111 (69,789) 3,113\nCharged to other accounts (1) — (4,073) —\nBusiness acquisitions — 24,258 —\nBalance at end of period $ 3,774 $ 2,663 $ 52,267\n(1) In the period ended August 25, 2023, SMART Embedded Computing B.V. entered liquidation, resulting in the existing Netherlands\nNOL carryforwards being considered to have a remote likelihood of being utilized. Accordingly, a deferred tax asset of $4.1 million\nwas written off and the related valuation allowance released.\nWe choose to maintain flexibility to pull excess cash from all jurisdictions where needed, except the U.S. group, to manage\ndebt balances. Provisions have been made for deferred income taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries to\nthe extent that dividend payments by such foreign subsidiaries are expected to result in additional tax liability, which is\nprimarily related to foreign withholding taxes which are not individually or cumulatively significant.\nWe have operations in Malaysia, where we have tax incentive arrangements for our pioneer status activities and our global\nsupply chain operations. The statutory rate for Malaysia is 24%. These arrangements are scheduled to expire in August\n2028 and are subject to certain conditions, with which we have partially complied with in 2024 and fully complied with in\n2023 and 2022. The effect of the tax incentive arrangements noted above reduced our income tax provision by $1.2 million\n($0.02 per diluted share) in 2024, $10.4 million ($0.20 per diluted share) in 2023 and $10.0 million ($0.18 per diluted share)\nin 2022.\nBelow is a reconciliation of our unrecognized tax benefits:\nAugust 30, August 25, August 26,\nYear ended 2024 2023 2022\nBeginning unrecognized tax benefits $ 25,603 $ 18,920 $ 17,454\nAcquired balances — 871 —\nIncreases related to prior year tax provisions 129 6,271 —\nIncreases related to current year tax provisions 1,099 4,248 1,678\nDecreases related to prior year tax provisions (5,348) (3,468) (212)\nLapse of statute of limitation (55) (1,239) —\nEnding unrecognized tax benefits $ 21,428 $ 25,603 $ 18,920\n101\nAs of August 30, 2024 and August 25, 2023, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect our effective\ntax rate, if recognized, was $18.7 million and $23.0 million, respectively. Amounts accrued for interest and penalties related\nto uncertain tax positions were not material for any period presented. The resolution of tax audits or expiration of statute of\nlimitations could also reduce our unrecognized tax benefits. Although the timing of final resolution is uncertain, the\nestimated potential reduction in our unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months would not be material.\nWe and our subsidiaries file income tax returns with the U.S. federal government, various U.S. states and various foreign\njurisdictions throughout the world. We regularly engage in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax\nmatters, including transfer pricing, and we continue to defend any and all such claims presented.

(formerly SMART Global\nHoldings, Inc.) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of August 30, 2024 and August 25, 2023, the related consolidated\nstatements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in\nthe period ended August 30, 2024, and the related notes, (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our\nopinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of\nAugust 30, 2024 and August 25, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the\nperiod ended August 30, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of August 30, 2024, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of\nthe Treadway Commission and our report dated October 24, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s\ninternal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the\nPCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities\nlaws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement,\nwhether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of\nthe financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such\nprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial\nstatements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by\nmanagement, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide\na reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements\nthat was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or\ndisclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex\njudgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements,\ntaken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the\ncritical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRevenue Recognition — Refer to the Significant Accounting Policies and Revenue and Customer Contract\nBalances notes to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company had $1.17 billion of revenue for the year ended August 30, 2024 of which $555 million related to the\nAdvanced Computing segment.\nA portion of the Company’s revenue is derived from the sale of customized products. The Company recognizes revenue\nwhen control of the underlying assets passes to the customer, which is when the customer is able to direct the use of and\nobtain substantially all of the remaining benefit from the assets, the customer has the significant risks and rewards\nassociated with ownership of the assets, and the Company has a present right to\n106\npayment. Under the terms of these arrangements, the Company cannot repurpose products without the customer’s\nconsent and accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue at the point in time when products are completed and made\navailable to the customer.\nA portion of the Company’s service revenue is from professional services, including installation and other services as well\nas hardware and software related support. Each contract may contain multiple performance obligations, which requires the\ntransaction price to be allocated to each performance obligation. The Company allocates the consideration to each\nperformance obligation based on the relative selling price, determined as the best estimate of the price at which the\nCompany would transact if it sold the deliverable regularly on a stand-alone basis.\nWe identified both the evaluation of performance obligations and the determination of the timing of recognition as\nperformance obligations are satisfied in certain contracts within the Advanced Computing segment to be a critical audit\nmatter. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of audit effort.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the Company’s identification of performance obligations and the recognition of revenue as\nperformance obligations are satisfied for the Advanced Computing segment included the following, among others:\n– We tested the effectiveness of internal controls related to revenue for the Advanced Computing segment including\nthose related to the identification of the performance obligations and the recognition of revenue as performance\nobligations were satisfied.\n– We evaluated management’s significant accounting policies related to revenue recognition for compliance with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles.\n– We selected a sample of contract documents for customers in the Advanced Computing segment and performed\nthe following procedures:\n• Obtained and read the arrangement with the customer for each selection, including the contract,\namendments, purchase order, and other documents (together the “contractual documents”) that were part\nof the arrangement, each as applicable.\n• Held inquiries with management outside of accounting, as needed, to identify the performance obligations\nin the contract and assist in evaluating when performance obligations are satisfied.\n• Assessed the terms and conditions in the contractual documents and evaluated the appropriateness of\nmanagement’s application of their accounting policies in the evaluation of performance obligations and the\nrecognition of revenue as performance obligations are satisfied.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nSan Jose, California\nOctober 24, 2024\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2014.\n107\nItem 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting\nand Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAn evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal\nexecutive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in\nRules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of the\nend of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our management, including our principal executive\nofficer and principal financial officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of August 30,\n2024 to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or\nsubmit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in\nthe SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive\nofficer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such\nterm is defined in the Exchange Act.\nManagement conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the\nframework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting\nwas effective as of August 30, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The effectiveness of our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as of August 30, 2024 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent\nregistered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as\ndefined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n108\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Penguin Solutions, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Penguin Solutions, Inc. (formerly SMART Global Holdings,\nInc.) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of August 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control —\nIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission\n(COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting\nas of August 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended August 30, 2024, of the Company and\nour report dated October 24, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its\nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s\nAnnual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s\ninternal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and\nare required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the\napplicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was\nmaintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial\nreporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness\nof internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the\ncircumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and\nprocedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are\nrecorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of\nmanagement and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection\nof unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial\nstatements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nSan Jose, California\nOctober 24, 2024\n109\nItem 9B.
