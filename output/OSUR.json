Our sustained focus on operational efficiency is delivering consistent productivity gains, and we generated positive cash flow from operations for the core business in Q3,” said OraSure President and CEO Carrie Eglinton Manner.\n\nShe added, “We are winding down our Risk Assessment testing business to focus on opportunities that align with our strengths in Diagnostics and Sample Management and elevate profitable growth in our core. As we position OraSure for a return to growth, our strong balance sheet provides flexibility as we invest in our innovation roadmap, including internal development, partnerships, and potential acquisition opportunities that leverage our existing capabilities.”\n\n**Financial Highlights**\n\n**For the Three Months Ended September 30,**| **For the Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **% Change** | **2024**| **2023**| **% Change**  \nCore Business (1)| $|  37,751| $|  38,154|  (1| )| %| $|  102,468| $|  109,909|  (7| )| %  \nMolecular Services|  9|  834|  (99| )|  1,692|  3,567|  (53| )  \nCOVID-19|  2,155|  50,199|  (96| )|  44,222|  216,115|  (80| )  \n**Total Net Revenues**|  $|  39,915| $|  89,187|  (55| )| %| $|  148,382| $|  329,591|  (55| )| %  \n(1) Includes Diagnostics, Molecular Sample Management Solutions, other products and services revenues, and non-product and services revenues.  \n  \n**For the Three Months Ended September 30,** | **For the Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **% Change**| **2024**| **2023**| **% Change**  \nNet revenues| $|  39,915| $|  89,187|  (55| )| %| $|  148,382| $|  329,591|  (55| )| %  \nGross profit|  17,070|  44,340|  (62| )|  65,824|  136,526|  (52| )  \nGross margin|  42.8| %|  49.7| %|  44.4| %|  41.4| %  \nNon-GAAP gross profit|  17,272|  44,609|  (61| )|  67,490|  137,998|  (51| )  \nNon-GAAP gross margin|  43.3| %|  50.0| %|  45.5| %|  41.9| %  \nOperating income (loss)|  (5,999| )|  10,894| NM|  (15,832| )|  28,786| NM  \nOperating margin|  (15.0| )| %|  12.2| %|  (10.7| )| %|  8.7| %  \nNon-GAAP operating income (loss)|  (2,698| )|  20,568| NM|  323|  51,198|  (99| )  \nNon-GAAP operating margin|  (6.8| )| %|  23.1| %|  0.2| %|  15.5| %  \nNet income (loss)|  (4,507| )|  11,159| NM|  (8,706| )|  33,582| NM  \nNon-GAAP net income (loss)|  (688| )|  20,034| NM|  8,173|  52,790|  (85| )  \nDiluted GAAP EPS| $|  (0.06| )| $|  0.15| NM| $|  (0.12| )| $|  0.45| NM  \nDiluted Non-GAAP EPS| $|  (0.01| )| $|  0.27| NM| $|  0.11| $|  0.71|  (85| )  \nNM – not meaningful  \n  \n  * Total net revenues for the third quarter of 2024 decreased 55% to $39.9 million from $89.2 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n  * Core revenues (all revenues excluding COVID-19 and Molecular Services revenues) of $37.8 million in the third quarter decreased 1% year-over-year. Diagnostics revenues in the third quarter increased 13% year-over-year to $22.0 million and Molecular Sample Management revenues decreased 16% to $12.8 million. The year-over-year decline in Core revenues was impacted by a decrease in revenues from the Risk Assessment testing business that we are exiting.\n\n  * COVID-19 revenues of $2.2 million in the third quarter decreased 96% year-over-year primarily due to the completion of our largest government contract earlier in 2024.\n\n  * GAAP gross margin percentage was 42.8% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 49.7% in the third quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP gross margin percentage in the third quarter of 2024 was 43.3% compared to 50.0% in the third quarter of 20231. On a year-over-year basis, gross margin was impacted by the decline in COVID-19 revenues and the higher mix of International revenues.\n\n  * GAAP operating loss in the third quarter of 2024 was $6.0 million compared to operating income of $10.9 million in the third quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP operating loss was $2.7 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to non-GAAP operating income of $20.6 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n  * Cash and cash equivalents were $279 million as of September 30, 2024. Cash flow from operations in the third quarter of 2024 was $12.7 million.\n\n\n\n\n______________________________________1 For additional information on non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of the GAAP financial results to non-GAAP financial results, see the schedules below. A description of the adjustments made to the GAAP financial measures is included at the end of the schedules. \n\n**Recent Business Developments**\n\n  * Received initial international orders for our OraQuick® HCV Self-test following receipt of WHO pre-qualification status in July. The OraQuick® HCV Self-test is the first Hepatitis C self-test to earn this designation, and we are actively working with the global health community to bring this test to populations in need.\n\n  * Expanding our sample management portfolio with the planned launch of a new solution targeting the blood proteomics market in the second half of 2025. Blood proteomics is a large and rapidly growing market, and there is a need for collection devices that effectively stabilize blood proteins in an easy-to-use format.\n\n  * Initiated steps to exit our Risk Assessment testing business by the end of 2024 to focus on markets that offer attractive growth opportunities. Risk Assessment testing products generated revenues of $1.9 million during the third quarter and $6.3 million during the first nine months of 2024, which was a decline from $2.6 million during the third quarter of 2023 and $7.5 million during the first nine months of 2023.\n\n  * Generated $12.7 million of operating cash flow in the third quarter, driven by positive cash flow generation in our Core business and collections of accounts receivable related to InteliSwab®. \n\n\n\n\n**Financial Guidance**\n\nThe Company is guiding to Q4 2024 revenues of $36 to $38 million. The Company anticipates Core revenues in Q4 2024 of $35 to $37 million, which includes $1 to $2 million of Risk Assessment testing revenues. The Company anticipates COVID-19 revenues in Q4 2024 of approximately $1 million.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nThe Company will host a conference call and audio webcast to discuss the Company’s third quarter 2024 results and certain business developments, beginning today at 5 p.m. Eastern Time.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has authorized the InteliSwab® COVID-19 Rapid Test for Over-the-Counter (OTC) use without a prescription. The FDA has also authorized the InteliSwab® COVID-19 Rapid Test Pro for professional use in point of care (POC) CLIA-waived settings, and the InteliSwab® COVID-19 Rapid Test Rx for Prescription Home Use. These remarkably simple COVID-19 lateral flow tests use samples self-collected from the lower nostrils. The InteliSwab® test’s unique design incorporates a built-in swab fully integrated into the test stick. After users swab their lower nostrils, the test stick is swirled in a pre-measured buffer solution, and the result appears right on the test stick within 30 minutes, with no instruments, batteries, smartphone or laboratory analysis needed to see the result. With less than one minute of “hands-on time,” it is as simple as “Swab, Swirl, and See.”\n\nThis product has not been FDA cleared or approved, but it has been authorized by the FDA under an EUA. The emergency use of this product has been authorized only for the detection of proteins from SARS-CoV-2, not for any other viruses or pathogens. This product is only authorized for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of in vitro diagnostics for detection and/or diagnosis of COVID-19 under Section 564(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb- 3(b)(1), unless the declaration is terminated or authorization is revoked sooner.\n\nDevelopment of the InteliSwab® COVID-19 Rapid Test has been funded in whole or in part with federal funds from the Department of Health and Human Services; Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response; Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, under contract numbers 75A50120C00061 and 75A50121C00078, utilizing Health Care Enhancement Act (HCEA) funding. The DoD's Defense Assisted Acquisition (DA2) Cell led the manufacturing expansion effort for the InteliSwab® COVID-19 rapid test in coordination with the Department of the Air Force’s Acquisition COVID-19 Task Force (DAF ACT). The manufacturing effort was funded through the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) to enable and support domestic industrial base expansion for critical medical resources.\n\n**Forward Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements, including with respect to products, product development and manufacturing activities, regulatory submissions and authorizations, revenue growth and guidance, expected revenue from government orders, cost savings, cash flow, increasing margins and other matters.

Management believes that presentation of operating results using these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplemental information to investors and facilitates the analysis of the Company’s core operating results and comparison of operating results across reporting periods, while excluding certain expenses that may not be indicative of the Company’s recurring core business operating results. In addition, management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because they (1) allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) are used by OraSure’s institutional investors and the analysis community to help them analyze the health of OraSure’s business. Management also uses non-GAAP financial measures to establish budgets and to manage the Company’s business. A reconciliation of the GAAP financial results to non-GAAP financial results is included in the schedules below and a description of the adjustments made to the GAAP financial measures is included at the end of the schedules.\n\nThe Company encourages investors to carefully consider its results under GAAP, as well as its supplemental non-GAAP information and the reconciliation between these presentations, to more fully understand its business. Non-GAAP financial results are reported in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Further, non-GAAP financial measures, even if similarly titled, may not be calculated in the same manner by all companies, and therefore should not be compared.\n\n**OraSure Technologies GAAP to
