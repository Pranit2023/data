(Nasdaq: BOOM) today reported financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2024. As the Company recently announced, weakness in the U.S. construction and energy services industries negatively affected the performance of DMC’s two largest businesses.\n\nAt Arcadia, DMC’s architectural building products business, persistent high interest rates have impacted sales to the high-end luxury home market and have resulted in continued soft commercial construction activity. Under the direction of a new interim business president, Arcadia is executing a series of internal initiatives designed to strengthen sourcing and supply chain functions; improve sales, inventory and operations planning processes; and more effectively leverage Arcadia’s enterprise resource planning system. The business is also reviewing certain product lines that have not consistently met profitability targets.\n\nArcadia’s improvement initiatives are being led by interim president Chris Scocos, who joined the business in September 2024 with a 25-year track record of implementing lean manufacturing, process improvement and operational excellence programs for industrial manufacturing businesses across a broad range of industries, including building materials and industrial manufactured products.\n\nResults at DynaEnergetics, DMC’s energy products business, reflect a further market-driven decline in U.S. well completions, which were down 6% sequentially and 13% versus last year’s third quarter. DynaEnergetics’ results also were impacted by a lower-margin customer mix. New automated assembly systems at DynaEnergetics’ U.S. manufacturing center in Blum, Texas, as well as a streamlined, next-generation model of its DynaStage perforating system, are expected to help strengthen DynaEnergetics’ profit margins beginning next year.\n\nNobelClad, DMC’s composite metals business, delivered another solid quarter and achieved adjusted EBITDA margins of more than 23%. Management believes additional large order opportunities and continued strong demand for NobelClad’s Cylindra™ cryogenic transition joints will offset a recent slowdown in repair and maintenance work in North America’s downstream energy industry.\n\n**Guidance** Management has decided to limit quarterly financial guidance to consolidated sales and adjusted EBITDA during the current period of volatility and uncertainty in its energy and construction markets. For the fourth quarter, consolidated sales are expected to be in a range of $138 million to $148 million, while adjusted EBITDA attributable to DMC is expected in a range of $5 million to $8 million. The expected sequential decline in consolidated sales principally reflects challenging market conditions, including an anticipated extended frac holiday in DynaEnergetics’ North American market. The continued impact of stubbornly high interest rates on luxury home sales and the related impact of lower fixed-cost absorption in certain factories, particularly those supporting certain high-end residential products, are expected to negatively impact Arcadia’s fourth quarter performance.\n\n**Summary****Third Quarter****Results**\n\nThree months ended | Change  \n---|---  \nSep 30, 2024 | Jun 30, 2024 | Sep 30, 2023 | Sequential | Year-on-year  \nNet sales | $ | 152,429 | $ | 171,179 | $ | 172,147 | (11 | )% | (11 | )%  \nGross profit percentage | 19.8 | % | 27.1 | % | 30.6 | %  \nSG&A* | $ | 28,205 | $ | 27,122 | $ | 28,713 | 4 | % | (2 | )%  \nNet (loss) income | $ | (159,416 | ) | $ | 6,293 | $ | 11,525 | (2,633 | )% | (1,483 | )%  \nNet (loss) income attributable to DMC | $ | (101,323 | ) | $ | 4,012 | $ | 8,883 | (2,625 | )% | (1,241 | )%  \nDiluted net (loss) income per share attributable to DMC | $ | (8.27 | ) | $ | 0.24 | $ | 0.38 | (3,546 | )% | (2,276 | )%  \nAdjusted net (loss) income attributable to DMC | $ | (9,615 | ) | $ | 5,675 | $ | 9,861 | (269 | )% | (198 | )%  \nAdjusted diluted net (loss) income per share | $ | (0.49 | ) | $ | 0.29 | $ | 0.50 | (269 | )% | (198 | )%  \nAdjusted EBITDA attributable to DMC | $ | 5,671 | $ | 19,420 | $ | 24,607 | (71 | )% | (77 | )%  \nAdjusted EBITDA before NCI allocation | $ | 7,015 | $ | 24,398 | $ | 29,981 | (71 | )% | (77 | )%  \nAdjusted EBITDA before NCI allocation margin | 4.6 | % | 14.3 | % | 17.4 | %  \n  \n*SG&A in the three months ended September 30, 2023 included $805 of CEO transition expenses\n\n**_Arcadia_**\n\nThree months ended | Change  \n---|---  \nSep 30, 2024 | Jun 30, 2024 | Sep 30, 2023 | Sequential | Year-on-year  \nNet sales | $ | 57,818 | $ | 69,748 | $ | 71,455 | (17 | )% | (19 | )%  \nAdjusted EBITDA attributable to DMC | $ | 2,014 | $ | 7,467 | $ | 8,060 | (73 | )% | (75 | )%  \nAdjusted EBITDA before NCI allocation | $ | 3,358 | $ | 12,445 | $ | 13,434 | (73 | )% | (75 | )%  \nAdjusted EBITDA before NCI allocation margin | 5.8 | % | 17.8 | % | 18.8 | %  \n  \n**_DynaEnergetics_**\n\nThree months ended | Change   \n---|---  \nSep 30, 2024 | Jun 30, 2024 | Sep 30, 2023 | Sequential | Year-on-year  \nNet sales | $ | 69,679 | $ | 76,210 | $ | 72,998 | (9 | )% | (5 | )%  \nAdjusted EBITDA | $ | 414 | $ | 8,752 | $ | 12,568 | (95 | )% | (97 | )%  \nAdjusted EBITDA margin | 0.6 | % | 11.5 | % | 17.2 | %  \n  \n  * _Sales and margin declines reflect softer well-completion activity and continued pricing pressure in North America_\n  * _Third quarter 2024 adjusted EBITDA includes approximately $5 million in inventory and bad debt charges_\n\n\n\n**_NobelClad_**\n\nThree months ended | Change  \n---|---  \nSep 30, 2024 | Jun 30, 2024 | Sep 30, 2023 | Sequential | Year-on-year  \nNet sales | $ | 24,932 | $ | 25,221 | $ | 27,694 | (1 | )% | (10 | )%  \nAdjusted EBITDA | $ | 5,776 | $ | 5,722 | $ | 6,384 | 1 | % | (10 | )%  \nAdjusted EBITDA margin | 23.2 | % | 22.7 | % | 23.1 | %  \n  \n  * _Backlog at the end of the third quarter was $59.0 million versus $60.8 million at the end of the 2023 third quarter_\n  * _Rolling 12-month bookings were $103.9 million versus $108.4 million at the end of the prior-year third quarter; and the book-to-bill ratio was 0.96._\n\n\n\n**Conference call information** The conference call will begin today at 5 p.m. Eastern (3 p.m. Mountain) and will be accessible by dialing 877-407-5783 (or +1 201-689-8782 for international callers).\n\nInvestors are invited to listen to the webcast live via the Internet at: https://event.choruscall.com/mediaframe/webcast.html?webcastid=kSCFTQNY\n\nWebcast participants should access the website at least 15 minutes early to register and download any necessary audio software.

A replay of the webcast will be available for six months.\n\n***Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures** In addition to disclosing financial results that are determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), the Company also discloses certain non-GAAP financial measures that we use in operational and financial decision making. Non-GAAP financial measures include the following:\n\n  * **EBITDA:** defined as net income (loss) plus net interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.\n  * **Adjusted EBITDA:** excludes from EBITDA stock-based compensation, restructuring expenses and asset impairment charges (if applicable) and, when appropriate, nonrecurring items that management does not utilize in assessing DMC’s operating performance (as further described in the tables below).\n  * **Adjusted EBITDA attributable to DMC Global Inc.:** excludes the Adjusted EBITDA attributable to the 40% redeemable noncontrolling interest in Arcadia Products.\n  * **Adjusted EBITDA for DMC business segments:** defined as operating income (loss) plus depreciation, amortization, allocated stock-based compensation (if applicable), restructuring expenses and asset impairment charges (if applicable) and, when appropriate, nonrecurring items that management does not utilize in assessing operating performance.\n  * **Adjusted net income (loss):** defined as net income (loss) attributable to DMC Global Inc. stockholders prior to the adjustment of redeemable noncontrolling interest plus restructuring expenses and asset impairment charges (if applicable) and, when appropriate, nonrecurring items that management does not utilize in assessing DMC’s operating performance.\n  * **Adjusted diluted earnings per share:** defined as diluted earnings per share attributable to DMC Global Inc. stockholders (exclusive of adjustment of redeemable noncontrolling interest) plus restructuring expenses and asset impairment charges (if applicable) and, when appropriate, nonrecurring items that management does not utilize in assessing DMC’s operating performance.\n  * **Net debt:** defined as total debt less total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.\n  * **Free-cash flow:** defined as cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities less net acquisitions of property, plant and equipment.\n\n\n\nManagement believes providing these additional financial measures is useful to investors in understanding the Company’s operating performance, including the effects of restructuring, impairment, and other nonrecurring charges, as well as its liquidity. Management typically monitors the business utilizing the above non-GAAP measures, in addition to GAAP results, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, and certain management incentive awards are based, in part, on these measures. The presence of non-GAAP financial measures in this report is not intended to suggest that such measures be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or as superior to, DMC’s GAAP information, and investors are cautioned that the non-GAAP financial measures are limited in their usefulness.\n\nBecause not all companies use identical calculations, DMC’s presentation of non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. However, these measures can still be useful in evaluating the company’s performance against its peer companies because management believes the measures provide users with valuable insight into key components of GAAP financial disclosures. For example, a company with greater GAAP net income may not be as appealing to investors if its net income is more heavily comprised of gains on asset sales. Likewise, eliminating the effects of interest income and expense moderates the impact of a company’s capital structure on its performance.\n\nDMC is unable to reconcile its expected fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA attributable to DMC to the most directly comparable projected GAAP financial measure because certain information necessary to calculate such measure on a GAAP basis is unavailable or dependent on the timing of future events outside of DMC’s control. Therefore, because of the uncertainty and variability of the nature of and the amount of any potential applicable future adjustments, which could be significant, DMC is unable to provide a reconciliation for expected adjusted EBITDA attributable to DMC without unreasonable efforts.\n\n**About DMC Global Inc.** DMC Global is an owner and operator of innovative, asset-light manufacturing businesses that provide unique, highly engineered products and differentiated solutions.

(Nasdaq: BOOM) today reported financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2024. As the Company recently announced, weakness in the U.S. construction and energy services industries negatively affected the performance of DMC’s two largest businesses.\n\nAt Arcadia, DMC’s architectural building products business, persistent high interest rates have impacted sales to the high-end luxury home market and have resulted in continued soft commercial construction activity. Under the direction of a new interim business president, Arcadia is executing a series of internal initiatives designed to strengthen sourcing and supply chain functions; improve sales, inventory and operations planning processes; and more effectively leverage Arcadia’s enterprise resource planning system. The business is also reviewing certain product lines that have not consistently met profitability targets.\n\nArcadia’s improvement initiatives are being led by interim president Chris Scocos, who joined the business in September 2024 with a 25-year track record of implementing lean manufacturing, process improvement and operational excellence programs for industrial manufacturing businesses across a broad range of industries, including building materials and industrial manufactured products.\n\nResults at DynaEnergetics, DMC’s energy products business, reflect a further market-driven decline in U.S. well completions, which were down 6% sequentially and 13% versus last year’s third quarter. DynaEnergetics’ results also were impacted by a lower-margin customer mix. New automated assembly systems at DynaEnergetics’ U.S. manufacturing center in Blum, Texas, as well as a streamlined, next-generation model of its DynaStage perforating system, are expected to help strengthen DynaEnergetics’ profit margins beginning next year.\n\nNobelClad, DMC’s composite metals business, delivered another solid quarter and achieved adjusted EBITDA margins of more than 23%. Management believes additional large order opportunities and continued strong demand for NobelClad’s Cylindra™ cryogenic transition joints will offset a recent slowdown in repair and maintenance work in North America’s downstream energy industry.\n\n**Guidance** Management has decided to limit quarterly financial guidance to consolidated sales and adjusted EBITDA during the current period of volatility and uncertainty in its energy and construction markets. For the fourth quarter, consolidated sales are expected to be in a range of $138 million to $148 million, while adjusted EBITDA attributable to DMC is expected in a range of $5 million to $8 million. The expected sequential decline in consolidated sales principally reflects challenging market conditions, including an anticipated extended frac holiday in DynaEnergetics’ North American market. The continued impact of stubbornly high interest rates on luxury home sales and the related impact of lower fixed-cost absorption in certain factories, particularly those supporting certain high-end residential products, are expected to negatively impact Arcadia’s fourth quarter performance.\n\n**Summary****Third Quarter****Results**\n\nThree months ended | Change  \n---|---  \nSep 30, 2024 | Jun 30, 2024 | Sep 30, 2023 | Sequential | Year-on-year  \nNet sales | $ | 152,429 | $ | 171,179 | $ | 172,147 | (11 | )% | (11 | )%  \nGross profit percentage | 19.8 | % | 27.1 | % | 30.6 | %  \nSG&A* | $ | 28,205 | $ | 27,122 | $ | 28,713 | 4 | % | (2 | )%  \nNet (loss) income | $ | (159,416 | ) | $ | 6,293 | $ | 11,525 | (2,633 | )% | (1,483 | )%  \nNet (loss) income attributable to DMC | $ | (101,323 | ) | $ | 4,012 | $ | 8,883 | (2,625 | )% | (1,241 | )%  \nDiluted net (loss) income per share attributable to DMC | $ | (8.27 | ) | $ | 0.24 | $ | 0.38 | (3,546 | )% | (2,276 | )%  \nAdjusted net (loss) income attributable to DMC | $ | (9,615 | ) | $ | 5,675 | $ | 9,861 | (269 | )% | (198 | )%  \nAdjusted diluted net (loss) income per share | $ | (0.49 | ) | $ | 0.29 | $ | 0.50 | (269 | )% | (198 | )%  \nAdjusted EBITDA attributable to DMC | $ | 5,671 | $ | 19,420 | $ | 24,607 | (71 | )% | (77 | )%  \nAdjusted EBITDA before NCI allocation | $ | 7,015 | $ | 24,398 | $ | 29,981 | (71 | )% | (77 | )%  \nAdjusted EBITDA before NCI allocation margin | 4.6 | % | 14.3 | % | 17.4 | %  \n  \n*SG&A in the three months ended September 30, 2023 included $805 of CEO transition expenses\n\n**_Arcadia_**\n\nThree months ended | Change  \n---|---  \nSep 30, 2024 | Jun 30, 2024 | Sep 30, 2023 | Sequential | Year-on-year  \nNet sales | $ | 57,818 | $ | 69,748 | $ | 71,455 | (17 | )% | (19 | )%  \nAdjusted EBITDA attributable to DMC | $ | 2,014 | $ | 7,467 | $ | 8,060 | (73 | )% | (75 | )%  \nAdjusted EBITDA before NCI allocation | $ | 3,358 | $ | 12,445 | $ | 13,434 | (73 | )% | (75 | )%  \nAdjusted EBITDA before NCI allocation margin | 5.8 | % | 17.8 | % | 18.8 | %  \n  \n**_DynaEnergetics_**\n\nThree months ended | Change   \n---|---  \nSep 30, 2024 | Jun 30, 2024 | Sep 30, 2023 | Sequential | Year-on-year  \nNet sales | $ | 69,679 | $ | 76,210 | $ | 72,998 | (9 | )% | (5 | )%  \nAdjusted EBITDA | $ | 414 | $ | 8,752 | $ | 12,568 | (95 | )% | (97 | )%  \nAdjusted EBITDA margin | 0.6 | % | 11.5 | % | 17.2 | %  \n  \n  * _Sales and margin declines reflect softer well-completion activity and continued pricing pressure in North America_\n  * _Third quarter 2024 adjusted EBITDA includes approximately $5 million in inventory and bad debt charges_\n\n\n\n**_NobelClad_**\n\nThree months ended | Change  \n---|---  \nSep 30, 2024 | Jun 30, 2024 | Sep 30, 2023 | Sequential | Year-on-year  \nNet sales | $ | 24,932 | $ | 25,221 | $ | 27,694 | (1 | )% | (10 | )%  \nAdjusted EBITDA | $ | 5,776 | $ | 5,722 | $ | 6,384 | 1 | % | (10 | )%  \nAdjusted EBITDA margin | 23.2 | % | 22.7 | % | 23.1 | %  \n  \n  * _Backlog at the end of the third quarter was $59.0 million versus $60.8 million at the end of the 2023 third quarter_\n  * _Rolling 12-month bookings were $103.9 million versus $108.4 million at the end of the prior-year third quarter; and the book-to-bill ratio was 0.96._\n\n\n\n**Conference call information** The conference call will begin today at 5 p.m. Eastern (3 p.m. Mountain) and will be accessible by dialing 877-407-5783 (or +1 201-689-8782 for international callers).\n\nInvestors are invited to listen to the webcast live via the Internet at: https://event.choruscall.com/mediaframe/webcast.html?webcastid=kSCFTQNY\n\nWebcast participants should access the website at least 15 minutes early to register and download any necessary audio software.

Non-GAAP financial measures include the following:\n\n  * **EBITDA:** defined as net income (loss) plus net interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.\n  * **Adjusted EBITDA:** excludes from EBITDA stock-based compensation, restructuring expenses and asset impairment charges (if applicable) and, when appropriate, nonrecurring items that management does not utilize in assessing DMC’s operating performance (as further described in the tables below).\n  * **Adjusted EBITDA attributable to DMC Global Inc.:** excludes the Adjusted EBITDA attributable to the 40% redeemable noncontrolling interest in Arcadia Products.\n  * **Adjusted EBITDA for DMC business segments:** defined as operating income (loss) plus depreciation, amortization, allocated stock-based compensation (if applicable), restructuring expenses and asset impairment charges (if applicable) and, when appropriate, nonrecurring items that management does not utilize in assessing operating performance.\n  * **Adjusted net income (loss):** defined as net income (loss) attributable to DMC Global Inc. stockholders prior to the adjustment of redeemable noncontrolling interest plus restructuring expenses and asset impairment charges (if applicable) and, when appropriate, nonrecurring items that management does not utilize in assessing DMC’s operating performance.\n  * **Adjusted diluted earnings per share:** defined as diluted earnings per share attributable to DMC Global Inc. stockholders (exclusive of adjustment of redeemable noncontrolling interest) plus restructuring expenses and asset impairment charges (if applicable) and, when appropriate, nonrecurring items that management does not utilize in assessing DMC’s operating performance.\n  * **Net debt:** defined as total debt less total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.\n  * **Free-cash flow:** defined as cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities less net acquisitions of property, plant and equipment.\n\n\n\nManagement believes providing these additional financial measures is useful to investors in understanding the Company’s operating performance, including the effects of restructuring, impairment, and other nonrecurring charges, as well as its liquidity. Management typically monitors the business utilizing the above non-GAAP measures, in addition to GAAP results, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, and certain management incentive awards are based, in part, on these measures. The presence of non-GAAP financial measures in this report is not intended to suggest that such measures be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or as superior to, DMC’s GAAP information, and investors are cautioned that the non-GAAP financial measures are limited in their usefulness.\n\nBecause not all companies use identical calculations, DMC’s presentation of non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. However, these measures can still be useful in evaluating the company’s performance against its peer companies because management believes the measures provide users with valuable insight into key components of GAAP financial disclosures. For example, a company with greater GAAP net income may not be as appealing to investors if its net income is more heavily comprised of gains on asset sales. Likewise, eliminating the effects of interest income and expense moderates the impact of a company’s capital structure on its performance.\n\nDMC is unable to reconcile its expected fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA attributable to DMC to the most directly comparable projected GAAP financial measure because certain information necessary to calculate such measure on a GAAP basis is unavailable or dependent on the timing of future events outside of DMC’s control. Therefore, because of the uncertainty and variability of the nature of and the amount of any potential applicable future adjustments, which could be significant, DMC is unable to provide a reconciliation for expected adjusted EBITDA attributable to DMC without unreasonable efforts.\n\n**About DMC Global Inc.** DMC Global is an owner and operator of innovative, asset-light manufacturing businesses that provide unique, highly engineered products and differentiated solutions.

(Nasdaq:\nBOOM) today reported financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2024. As\nthe Company recently announced, weakness in the U.S. construction and energy services\nindustries negatively affected the performance of DMC’s two largest businesses.\nAt Arcadia, DMC’s architectural building products business, persistent high interest rates\nhave impacted sales to the high-end luxury home market and have resulted in continued soft\ncommercial construction activity. Under the direction of a new interim business president,\nArcadia is executing a series of internal initiatives designed to strengthen sourcing and\nsupply chain functions; improve sales, inventory and operations planning processes; and\nmore effectively leverage Arcadia’s enterprise resource planning system. The business is\nalso reviewing certain product lines that have not consistently met profitability targets.\nArcadia’s improvement initiatives are being led by interim president Chris Scocos, who\njoined the business in September 2024 with a 25-year track record of implementing lean\nmanufacturing, process improvement and operational excellence programs for industrial\nmanufacturing businesses across a broad range of industries, including building materials\nand industrial manufactured products.\nResults at DynaEnergetics, DMC’s energy products business, reflect a further market-driven\ndecline in U.S. well completions, which were down 6% sequentially and 13% versus last\nyear’s third quarter. DynaEnergetics’ results also were impacted by a lower-margin customer\nmix. New automated assembly systems at DynaEnergetics’ U.S. manufacturing center in\nBlum, Texas, as well as a streamlined, next-generation model of its DynaStage perforating\nsystem, are expected to help strengthen DynaEnergetics’ profit margins beginning next year.\nNobelClad, DMC’s composite metals business, delivered another solid quarter and achieved\nadjusted EBITDA margins of more than 23%. Management believes additional large order\nopportunities and continued strong demand for NobelClad’s Cylindra™ cryogenic transition\njoints will offset a recent slowdown in repair and maintenance work in North America’s\ndownstream energy industry.\nGuidance\nManagement has decided to limit quarterly financial guidance to consolidated sales and\nadjusted EBITDA during the current period of volatility and uncertainty in its energy and\nconstruction markets. For the fourth quarter, consolidated sales are expected to be in a\nrange of $138 million to $148 million, while adjusted EBITDA attributable to DMC is\nexpected in a range of $5 million to $8 million. The expected sequential decline in\nconsolidated sales principally reflects challenging market conditions, including an anticipated\nextended frac holiday in DynaEnergetics’ North American market. The continued impact of\nstubbornly high interest rates on luxury home sales and the related impact of lower fixed-\ncost absorption in certain factories, particularly those supporting certain high-end residential\nproducts, are expected to negatively impact Arcadia’s fourth quarter performance.\nSummary Third Quarter Results\nThree months ended Change\nSep 30, 2024 Jun 30, 2024 Sep 30, 2023 Sequential Year-on-year\nNet sales $ 152,429 $ 171,179 $ 172,147 (11)% (11)%\nGross profit percentage 19.8% 27.1% 30.6%\nSG&A* $ 28,205 $ 27,122 $ 28,713 4% (2)%\nNet (loss) income $ (159,416) $ 6,293 $ 11,525 (2,633)% (1,483)%\nNet (loss) income attributable to DMC$ (101,323) $ 4,012 $ 8,883 (2,625)% (1,241)%\nDiluted net (loss) income per share\nattributable to DMC $ (8.27) $ 0.24 $ 0.38 (3,546)% (2,276)%\nAdjusted net (loss) income\nattributable to DMC $ (9,615) $ 5,675 $ 9,861 (269)% (198)%\nAdjusted diluted net (loss) income per\nshare $ (0.49) $ 0.29 $ 0.50 (269)% (198)%\nAdjusted EBITDA attributable to DMC$ 5,671 $ 19,420 $ 24,607 (71)% (77)%\nAdjusted EBITDA before NCI\nallocation $ 7,015 $ 24,398 $ 29,981 (71)% (77)%\nAdjusted EBITDA before NCI\nallocation margin 4.6% 14.3% 17.4%\n*SG&A in the three months ended September 30, 2023 included $805 of CEO transition\nexpenses\nArcadia\nThree months ended Change\nSep 30, 2024 Jun 30, 2024 Sep 30, 2023 Sequential Year-on-year\nNet sales $ 57,818 $ 69,748 $ 71,455 (17)% (19)%\nAdjusted EBITDA attributable to DMC$ 2,014 $ 7,467 $ 8,060 (73)% (75)%\nAdjusted EBITDA before NCI\nallocation $ 3,358 $ 12,445 $ 13,434 (73)% (75)%\nAdjusted EBITDA before NCI\nallocation margin 5.8% 17.8% 18.8%\nDynaEnergetics\nThree months ended Change\nSep 30, 2024 Jun 30, 2024 Sep 30, 2023 Sequential Year-on-year\nNet sales $ 69,679 $ 76,210 $ 72,998 (9)% (5)%\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 414 $ 8,752 $ 12,568 (95)% (97)%\nAdjusted EBITDA margin 0.6% 11.5% 17.2%\nSales and margin declines reflect softer well-completion activity and continued pricing\npressure in North America\nThird quarter 2024 adjusted EBITDA includes approximately $5 million in inventory and\nbad debt charges\nNobelClad\nThree months ended Change\nSep 30, 2024 Jun 30, 2024 Sep 30, 2023 Sequential Year-on-year\nNet sales $ 24,932 $ 25,221 $ 27,694 (1)% (10)%\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 5,776 $ 5,722 $ 6,384 1% (10)%\nAdjusted EBITDA margin 23.2% 22.7% 23.1%\nBacklog at the end of the third quarter was $59.0 million versus $60.8 million at the\nend of the 2023 third quarter\nRolling 12-month bookings were $103.9 million versus $108.4 million at the end of the\nprior-year third quarter; and the book-to-bill ratio was 0.96.\nConference call information\nThe conference call will begin today at 5 p.m. Eastern (3 p.m. Mountain) and will be\naccessible by dialing 877-407-5783 (or +1 201-689-8782 for international callers).\nInvestors are invited to listen to the webcast live via the Internet at:\nhttps://event.choruscall.com/mediaframe/webcast.html?webcastid=kSCFTQNY\nWebcast participants should access the website at least 15 minutes early to register and\ndownload any necessary audio software.

A replay of the webcast will be\navailable for six months.\n*Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to disclosing financial results that are determined in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), the Company also discloses\ncertain non-GAAP financial measures that we use in operational and financial decision\nmaking. Non-GAAP financial measures include the following:\nEBITDA: defined as net income (loss) plus net interest, taxes, depreciation and\namortization.\nAdjusted EBITDA: excludes from EBITDA stock-based compensation, restructuring\nexpenses and asset impairment charges (if applicable) and, when appropriate,\nnonrecurring items that management does not utilize in assessing DMC’s operating\nperformance (as further described in the tables below).\nAdjusted EBITDA attributable to DMC Global Inc.: excludes the Adjusted EBITDA\nattributable to the 40% redeemable noncontrolling interest in Arcadia Products.\nAdjusted EBITDA for DMC business segments: defined as operating income (loss)\nplus depreciation, amortization, allocated stock-based compensation (if applicable),\nrestructuring expenses and asset impairment charges (if applicable) and, when\nappropriate, nonrecurring items that management does not utilize in assessing\noperating performance.\nAdjusted net income (loss): defined as net income (loss) attributable to DMC Global\nInc. stockholders prior to the adjustment of redeemable noncontrolling interest plus\nrestructuring expenses and asset impairment charges (if applicable) and, when\nappropriate, nonrecurring items that management does not utilize in assessing DMC’s\noperating performance.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share: defined as diluted earnings per share\nattributable to DMC Global Inc. stockholders (exclusive of adjustment of redeemable\nnoncontrolling interest) plus restructuring expenses and asset impairment charges (if\napplicable) and, when appropriate, nonrecurring items that management does not\nutilize in assessing DMC’s operating performance.\nNet debt: defined as total debt less total cash, cash equivalents and marketable\nsecurities.\nFree-cash flow: defined as cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities less\nnet acquisitions of property, plant and equipment.\nManagement believes providing these additional financial measures is useful to investors in\nunderstanding the Company’s operating performance, including the effects of restructuring,\nimpairment, and other nonrecurring charges, as well as its liquidity. Management typically\nmonitors the business utilizing the above non-GAAP measures, in addition to GAAP results,\nto understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, and certain\nmanagement incentive awards are based, in part, on these measures. The presence of non-\nGAAP financial measures in this report is not intended to suggest that such measures be\nconsidered in isolation or as a substitute for, or as superior to, DMC’s GAAP information, and\ninvestors are cautioned that the non-GAAP financial measures are limited in their\nusefulness.\nBecause not all companies use identical calculations, DMC’s presentation of non-GAAP\nfinancial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other\ncompanies. However, these measures can still be useful in evaluating the company’s\nperformance against its peer companies because management believes the measures\nprovide users with valuable insight into key components of GAAP financial disclosures. For\nexample, a company with greater GAAP net income may not be as appealing to investors if\nits net income is more heavily comprised of gains on asset sales. Likewise, eliminating the\neffects of interest income and expense moderates the impact of a company’s capital\nstructure on its performance.\nDMC is unable to reconcile its expected fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA attributable to DMC\nto the most directly comparable projected GAAP financial measure because certain\ninformation necessary to calculate such measure on a GAAP basis is unavailable or\ndependent on the timing of future events outside of DMC’s control. Therefore, because of\nthe uncertainty and variability of the nature of and the amount of any potential applicable\nfuture adjustments, which could be significant, DMC is unable to provide a reconciliation for\nexpected adjusted EBITDA attributable to DMC without unreasonable efforts.\nAbout DMC Global Inc.\nDMC Global is an owner and operator of innovative, asset-light manufacturing businesses\nthat provide unique, highly engineered products and differentiated solutions. DMC’s\nbusinesses have established leadership positions in their respective markets and consist of:\nArcadia, a leading supplier of architectural building products; DynaEnergetics, which serves\nthe global energy industry; and NobelClad, which addresses the global industrial\ninfrastructure and transportation sectors.
