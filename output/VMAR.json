(Nasdaq: VMAR), a pioneer in electric marine propulsion, is excited to announce its participation in the grand opening of Aileron. The grand opening marks a launch sale event for the prestigious residential project on Thursday, November 21, 2024, at 5 PM, at the Aileron Sales Centre, 50 South Bryan Road, Dania Beach Florida. Vision Marine will be on-site showcasing two Fantail 217 electric boats and Groupe Beneteau’s Four Winns H2e Bowrider which was recently acclaimed as “Bowrider of the Year” by Boating Magazine. These boats are available for purchase on Vision Electric Boat’s website at visionelectricboats.com.\n\nIn October 2021, Vision Marine secured its role in the Aileron project under an agreement which includes exclusive use of 400 lineal feet of commercial docks at this prime waterfront location. This agreement highlights Vision Marine’s integral role in the project and establishes Aileron as a premier product sales location of Vision Marine’s “[E-Motion](https://visionmarinetechnologies.com/e-motion-electric-marine-powertrain/)” Powertrain System, supported by a rental center, distribution hub, and an electric boat club to serve residents and visitors alike.\n\n![](https://investors.visionmarinetechnologies.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Aileron_condo_units_Renderings-1024x598.jpg)\n\nThe grand opening of Aileron celebrates the official launch of condo sales for this iconic waterfront development and underscores Vision Marine’s involvement as the future operator of both, its exclusive electric boat rental center and club, and a key distribution hub for its innovative electric boats. \n\nAileron Residential Project: A Landmark Waterfront Community \n\nLocated adjacent to the vibrant Dania Pointe shopping and entertainment district, the estimated $300 million Aileron project is a 17-story high-end residential complex featuring 380 luxury residences. Developed by LYND Living, a Texas-based leader in real estate innovation, Aileron offers a unique combination of small-town charm and big-city sophistication, with waterfront access and modern amenities that redefine coastal living. \n\nThe Power of Foresight \n\n“Our foresight in identifying opportunities has been a key factor in securing prime locations like this one,” said Alexandre Mongeon, CEO of Vision Marine. “This location, formerly home to Nautical Ventures’ dealership, is especially personal to me, as I’ve been docking boats here with my family since 2017 using our Bruce 22. Even then, I could envision this site as a premier sales point with its ideal canal network for electric boating. This ability to see potential is at the core of our success, driving us to create exceptional opportunities for boaters and customers alike.” \n\nA Developer’s Perspective \n\n“We’re thrilled to collaborate with Vision Marine Technologies to bring a new level of innovation and sustainability to Aileron,” said A. David Lynd, CEO of LYND Living. “Vision Marine’s products and services align perfectly with our vision for creating a modern, community-focused residential project that embraces waterfront living and provides exceptional amenities for our residents and visitors.” \n\nPositioning for Long-Term Viability in Florida \n\nWe believe Florida is recognized as the Boating Capital of the United States and represents a vital market for Vision Marine’s growth. Establishing a strategic hub at the Aileron project provides Vision Marine with a solid foundation for long-term commercial viability. The facility will act as Vision Marine’s primary sales location, supported by its rental operations, an exclusive electric boat club, and a distribution hub to facilitate adoption of sustainable boating solutions in the region. \n\nA Collaborative Step with LYND Living \n\nVision Marine’s involvement in the Aileron project marks the first step in what could become a broader collaboration with LYND Living. As Vision Marine establishes its presence in the electric boating market, the company sees tremendous potential in partnering on future LYND projects. “Our success at Aileron could lead to further integration of sustainable boating amenities in LYND’s upcoming developments.” \n\n## About LYND Living \n\nLYND Living is a Texas-based real estate firm focused on delivering exceptional residential experiences through innovative design, community-focused amenities, and strategic partnerships.

The selection process starts with our team assessing each of the 100-plus boats we sea trial and publish a test about each year to see how any might stand out in their respective categories. Not every category of boat has a true standout every year, even though it may be populated by great boats. A BOTY category winner, besides possessing top construction, component installation and performance characteristics, must somehow advance its category, providing boat buyers with a better experience. From these, Boat of the Year will be selected. This year, we are proud to present the following category winners. Congratulations to each one!\n\nRunabout: Four Winns H2e\n\nFirst, this is an exceptionally well-done bowrider. The interior is luxurious, its construction is excellent and its appearance is at once fresh and classic.\n\n[> READ NOW: Boat Test: 2023 Four Winns H2e](https://investors.visionmarinetechnologies.com/2023/08/28/boat-test-2023-four-winns-h2e/)\n\n[ Read the full article ](https://www.boatingmag.com/boats/boat-of-the-year-category-winners-2023/)\n\n## VMAR | NASDAQ LISTED\n\n[ Corporate Presentation ](https://investors.visionmarinetechnologies.com/download-investors-presentation/)\n\nLatest Press Releases\n\n  * [Vision Marine Technologies Inc.
