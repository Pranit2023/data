Naudon, Ponce Financial Group’s President and CEO, stated, “We continue to make progress quarter over quarter both in terms of our economic performance as well as serving our communities. Book value per share continues to grow and is now $11.74 (up $0.75 vs last year) and total equity per common share stands at $21.18. Our levels of liquidity and capital remain strong. Our net interest income grew quarter over quarter, and we’re well positioned for a decline in interest rates. We reduced our borrowings during the quarter, paying off the entirety of our Bank Term Funding Program Loan, while lowering the overall cost and extending our maturities. We remain committed to the communities we serve and our status as a Minority Depository Institution (“MDI”)/Community Development Financial Institution (\"CDFI\"), and we continue to invest in our people and in technology to improve our efficiency.”\n\n**Executive Chairman’s Comment**\n\nSteven A. Tsavaris, Ponce Financial Group’s Executive Chairman added, “During the quarter, the US Treasury Department issued proposed guidelines under which it may sell their ECIP investment back to the issuers or related non-profit affiliates. We believe the adoption of the proposed regulations would be greatly beneficial to Ponce Financial Group, although there can be no assurance that the proposed regulations will be adopted, or that that will be adopted in their current form. Most of our loan growth of $157.6 million this quarter is explained by our desire to ensure qualification under the proposed regulations, if adopted. Deposits also grew significantly during the quarter including $35.0 million from the Banking Development District program of New York.” \n\nSelected performance metrics are as follows (refer to “Key

ended June 30, 2024 and net income of $2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nThe decrease of net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three

non-interest expense, partially offset by an increase of $1.1 million in net interest income and a decrease of $0.6 million in provision for income taxes .\n\nThe decrease of net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was largely due to a decrease of $4.5 million in non-interest income as a result of a $3.7 million grant reported in the third quarter of 2023 and an increase of $0.3 million in provision for credit losses, partially offset by an increase of $2.5 million in net interest income and decreases of $1.1 million in provision for income taxes and $ 1.0 million in non-interest expense.\n\nNet income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $8.0 million compared to a net income of $2.8 million for the nine

Aptly located upon their namesake 1600 Ponce de Leon Drive in the Miami suburb of Coral Gables, this new office is home to Customer Relationship Officer Juan (“Jay”) Sanchez who will split time between the new location and his former Bergen County, New Jersey territory.\n\nPresident and CEO of Ponce Bank Carlos Naudon said, “A presence in South Florida makes perfect sense. Many of our customers have businesses in Florida or spend their winter months here, and the large Hispanic community perfectly fits one of our primary demographics. Our recently implemented digital platform, PonceBank+Direct℠, combined with the talent of Mr. Sanchez who has a deep network among small business owners, makes it possible for us to offer a wide range of services in support of our dual-state clientele.”\n\nJay Sanchez has built a reputation in New Jersey servicing small business customers, especially in the retail grocery field, and he’s excited about this opportunity to expand the footprint of his highly sought after customer service. According to Mr. Sanchez, “My customers, many of whom have businesses in both New Jersey and Florida, kept asking me why we don’t open an office down here. After serious internal discussion, we confirmed the tremendous synergy and opportunity there was for Ponce Bank throughout the state. When we found this location, on Ponce de Leon Blvd no less, we knew that the time was ripe for us to begin exploring the many opportunities that Miami and the surrounding area provides.”\n\nThe Ponce Bank Representative Office in Coral Gables will initially provide access to commercial lending, mortgages, and small-business banking, by taking advantage of PonceBank+Direct℠ which provides online banking, SBA Lending, and online account opening, via a convenient online and mobile app interface. “Combining our new digital platform with the hands-on service for which Mr. Sanchez is known, it’s just a matter of time before we see Ponce Bank firmly established in the Miami area and beyond,” said COO Luis Gonzalez.\n\nJay Sanchez can be reached at [juan.sanchez@poncebank.net](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=fEaUCCl2QOfJfb8WPqnYY0R9S5s1JG7LfLDPAOj40kYjf-ArDzRhy1TvA5EanOwi8h6Ojc4cTWdNGii9ZRQ6HUiHd7lNYe0MUJIn6qdJ1e2By5uwEKOOeqaW2mqZebKg) and 917-698-5378.\n\n**About Ponce Financial Group, Inc. **\n\nPonce Financial Group, Inc. is the holding company for Ponce Bank.

The designation covers Bronx Community District 9 and includes the neighborhoods of Soundview, Parkchester, and Castle Hill. \n\nNew York State’s BDD Program, administered by the Department of Financial Services (\"DFS\"), supports the establishment of bank and credit union branches in areas across New York State where there is a demonstrated need for banking services. The program is a public-private collaboration among DFS, local communities, and financial institutions. Strong community support from local organizations, residents, small businesses, and elected officials is a critical piece of establishing a BDD. \n\nParticipating financial institutions open or maintain a branch and offer affordable and accessible products and services in an underserved community. To encourage participation, approved BDD branches receive access to subsidized and market rate deposits from New York State. On July 30, 2024, Ponce Bank received total program deposits of $35 million. As an approved New York State BDD, Ponce Bank Westchester Avenue branch also applied to the New York City Banking Commission for designation under the New York City BDD program. If approved, the Bank may receive an additional $20 million in subsidized deposits from New York City.\n\nPonce Bank will use the BDD designation to continue its efforts to expand access to affordable financial services to serve local residents and small businesses in the neighborhood by offering access to competitive, affordable financial products. Ponce Bank will also provide financial education to consumers and businesses to help foster financial empowerment and inclusion in the community. \n\n**About Ponce Financial Group, Inc. **\n\nPonce Financial Group, Inc. is the holding company for Ponce Bank.
