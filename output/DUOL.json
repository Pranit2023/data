(NASDAQ: DUOL), the world’s leading mobile learning platform, announced results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 in a shareholder letter that is posted at investors.duolingo.com.\n\n\"We performed superbly across all of our key operating metrics this quarter, with DAU and bookings growth exceeding our expectations,” said Luis von Ahn, Co-Founder and CEO of Duolingo. “This momentum came from continued execution against our plan to grow users and daily engagement, increase family plan adoption, and roll-out Duolingo Max more broadly.\n\nThis quarter we saw strong new and returning user growth, our highest ever family plan penetration, and a meaningful bookings contribution from Duolingo Max. Our AI-powered Video Call feature helped to drive adoption of Max and increase conversational speaking practice, which we believe can unlock new opportunities in the global language learning market.\"\n\n**Third****Quarter****2024****Highlights**\n\n  * Total bookings were $211.5 million, an increase of 38% from the prior year quarter;\n  * Subscription bookings were $176.3 million, an increase of 45% from the prior year quarter;\n  * Paid subscribers totaled 8.6 million at quarter end, an increase of 47% from the prior year quarter;\n  * Daily active users (DAUs) were 37.2 million, an increase of 54% from the prior year quarter and monthly active users (MAUs) were 113.1 million, an increase of 36% from the prior year quarter;\n  * Total revenues were $192.6 million, an increase of 40% from the prior year quarter;\n  * Net income was $23.4 million, compared to $2.8 million in the prior year quarter;\n  * Adjusted EBITDA was $47.5 million, compared to $22.5 million in the prior year quarter, a 24.7% versus 16.3% Adjusted EBITDA margin, respectively;\n  * Net cash provided by operating activities was $56.3 million compared to $37.7 million in the prior year quarter, and free cash flow was $52.7 million compared to $33.5 million in the prior year quarter.\n\n\n\n**Financial and Key Operating Metrics**\n\nThe following table summarizes our financial and operating highlights for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n---  \n**_(In millions)_**| **2024**| **2023**| **% Change**  \n**Operating Metrics**  \nMonthly active users (MAUs)| 113.1| 83.1| 36%  \nDaily active users (DAUs)| 37.2| 24.2| 54%  \nPaid subscribers (at period end)| 8.6| 5.8| 47%  \n  \n**Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n---  \n**_(In thousands)_**| **2024**| **2023**| **% Change**  \n**Operating Metrics**  \nSubscription bookings| $| 176,309| $| 121,342| 45%  \nTotal bookings| $| 211,456| $| 153,556| 38%  \n**Financial Measures**  \nTotal revenues (GAAP)| $| 192,594| $| 137,624| 40%  \nNet income (GAAP)| $| 23,360| $| 2,807| >100%  \nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP)| $| 47,508| $| 22,501| >100%  \nNet cash provided by operating activities (GAAP)| $| 56,267| $| 37,650| 49%  \nFree cash flow (Non-GAAP)| $| 52,674| $| 33,472| 57%  \n  \nThe following table provides revenues by product type:\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n---  \n**_(in thousands)_**| **2024**| **2023**| **Change**| **% Change**  \nSubscription| $| 157,617| $| 105,887| $| 51,730| 49| %  \nOther| 34,977| 31,737| 3,240| 10  \nTotal revenues| $| 192,594| $| 137,624| $| 54,970| 40| %  \n  \n________________(1) Other revenue is comprised mainly of Advertising, Duolingo English Test, and In-App Purchases.\n\n**Financial Outlook**\n\nDuolingo is providing the following guidance for the fourth quarter ending December 31, 2024 and updating its guidance for the full year ending December 31, 2024:\n\n**Fourth Quarter 2024**| **Full Year 2024**  \n---|---  \n** _(in millions)_**| **Low**| **High**| **Low**| **High**  \nTotal Bookings| $| 244.5| $| 247.5| $| 843.5| $| 846.5  \nRevenues| $| 202.5| $| 205.5| $| 741.0| $| 744.0  \nAdjusted EBITDA| $| 48.6| $| 50.8| $| 188.3| $| 190.4  \nAdjusted EBITDA Margin| 24.0| %| 24.7| %| 25.4| %| 25.6| %  \n  \nWith regards to the non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin outlook provided above, a reconciliation to GAAP net income, the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP, has not been provided as the quantification of certain items included in the calculation of GAAP net income cannot be calculated or predicted at this time without unreasonable efforts. For example, the non-GAAP adjustment for stock-based compensation expenses related to equity awards requires additional inputs such as number of shares granted and market price that are not currently ascertainable, and the non-GAAP adjustment for certain legal, tax and regulatory reserves and expenses depends on the timing and magnitude of these expenses and cannot be accurately forecasted. For the same reasons, we are unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could have a potentially unpredictable, and potentially significant, impact on our future GAAP financial results.\n\n**Dilutive Securities**\n\nDuolingo has various dilutive securities. The table below details these securities (shares in millions; rounding differences may occur):\n\n**_(Amounts in millions, except share price)_**| **Price as of S****eptember 30,2024**| **Weighted-****average****exercise****price**| **Shares**  \n---|---|---|---  \nShare price| $282.02  \nCommon stock outstanding as of September 30, 2024| 43.9  \nFounder awards (1)| 1.6  \nDilutive effect of stock options outstanding (2)| $16.62| 2.1  \nRSUs outstanding| 1.9  \nTotal estimated diluted shares outstanding| 49.6  \n  \n________________(1) Includes 1.4 million underlying performance-based Restricted Stock Units (\"RSUs\") where performance criteria has not been satisfied.\n\n(2) The Company has 2.2 million options outstanding as of September 30, 2024. The estimated dilutive effect is calculated as the number of shares expected to be issued upon vesting or exercise, adjusted for the strike price proceeds that are received by the Company and assumed to be used to repurchase shares of Duolingo common stock.\n\n**Video Webcast** Duolingo will host a video webcast to discuss its quarterly results today, November 6, 2024 at 5:30 p.m. ET. This live webcast and related materials will be publicly available and can be accessed at investors.duolingo.com. A replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website two hours following completion of the webcast and will remain available for a period of one year.\n\n**About Duolingo**\n\nDuolingo is the leading mobile learning platform globally. Its flagship app has organically become the world's most popular way to learn languages and the top-grossing app in the Education category on both Google Play and the Apple App Store. With technology at the core of everything it does, Duolingo has consistently invested to provide learners a fun, engaging, and effective learning experience while remaining committed to its mission to develop the best education in the world and make it universally available.\n\n**Definitions**\n\n**Monthly Active Users (MAUs).** MAUs are defined as unique users who engage with our Duolingo App or the learning section of our website each month. MAUs are reported for a measurement period by taking the average of the MAUs for each calendar month in that measurement period. The measurement period for MAUs is the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the same period in the prior year where applicable, and the analysis of results is based on those periods. MAUs are a measure of the size of our global active user community on Duolingo.\n\n**Daily Active Users (DAUs).** DAUs are defined as unique users who engage with our Duolingo App or the learning section of our website each calendar day. DAUs are reported for a measurement period by taking the average of the DAUs for each day in that measurement period. The measurement period for DAUs is the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the same period in the prior year where applicable, and the analysis of results is based on those periods. DAUs are a measure of the consistent engagement of our global user community on Duolingo.\n\n**Paid Subscribers.** Paid subscribers are defined as users who pay for access to any Duolingo subscription offering and had an active subscription as of the end of the measurement period. Each unique user account is treated as a single paid subscriber regardless of whether such user purchases multiple subscriptions, and the count of paid subscribers does not include users who are currently on a free trial or who are non-paying members of a family plan.\n\n**Subscription Bookings and Total Bookings.** Subscription bookings represent the amounts we receive from a purchase of any Duolingo subscription offering. Total bookings include subscription bookings, income from advertising networks for advertisements served to our users, purchases of the Duolingo English Test, and in-app purchases of virtual goods. We believe bookings provide an indication of trends in our operating results, including cash flows, that are not necessarily reflected in our revenues because we recognize subscription revenues ratably over the lifetime of a subscription, which is generally from one to twelve months.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this press release, including without limitation, statements regarding our business model and strategic priorities, plans to expand our market base and user adoption, expectations for product rollouts, and our financial outlook are forward-looking statements. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “shall,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “could,” “intends,” “target,” “projects,” “contemplates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential,” “goal,” “objective,” “seeks,” or “continue” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans, or intentions. Such forward-looking statements are neither promises nor guarantees, but involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to various factors, including, but not limited to: our ability to retain and grow our users and sustain their engagement with our products; competition in the online language learning industry; our limited operating history; our ability to maintain profitability; our ability to manage our growth and operate at such scale; the success of our investments; our reliance on third-party platforms to store and distribute our products and collect revenue; our reliance on third-party hosting and cloud computing providers; our ability to compete for advertisements; acceptance by educational organizations of technology-based education; changes in our business and macroeconomic conditions; our ability to access, collect, and use personal data about our users and payers, and to comply with applicable data privacy laws; regulatory and legislative developments on the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning; potential intellectual property-related litigation and proceedings; our ability adequately obtain, protect and maintain our intellectual property rights; and the other important factors more fully detailed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as any such factors may be updated from time to time, including without limitation in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024 and in our other filings with the SEC, accessible on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at investors.duolingo.com. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release. While we may elect to update such forward-looking statements at some point in the future, unless required by applicable law, we disclaim any obligation to do so, even if subsequent events cause our views to change.\n\n**Limitation of Key Operating Metrics and Other Data** We manage our business by tracking several operating metrics, including MAUs, DAUs, paid subscribers, and subscription and total bookings. While these metrics are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring how our platform is used. These metrics are determined by using internal data gathered on an analytics platform that we developed and operate and have not been validated by an independent third party. This platform tracks user account and session activity. If we fail to maintain an effective analytics platform, our metrics calculations may be inaccurate. We believe that these metrics are reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement, and that the methodologies we employ and update from time-to-time to create these metrics are reasonable bases to identify trends in user behavior. Because we update the methodologies we employ to create metrics, our operating metrics may not be comparable to those in prior periods. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate these metrics differently.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures** We use certain non-GAAP financial measures to supplement our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which are presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures include Adjusted EBITDA; Adjusted EBITDA margin; Free cash flow, and Free cash flow margin. Please refer to the definitions and reconciliation at the end of this press release. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. By excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core operating results, we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance. Accordingly, we believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and others because they allow for additional information with respect to financial measures used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and they may be used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business. However, there are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures, and these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently or not at all, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures.\n\n**Website Information** We routinely post important information for investors on the Investor Relations section of our website, investors.duolingo.com, and also from time to time may use social media channels, including our X (formerly Twitter) account (x.com/duolingo) and our LinkedIn account (linkedin.com/company/duolingo/), as an additional means of disclosing public information to investors, the media and others interested in us. It is possible that certain information we post on our website and on social media could be deemed to be material information, and we encourage investors, the media and others interested in us to review the business and financial information we post on our website and on the social media channels identified above, in addition to following our press releases, SEC filings, public conference calls, presentations and webcasts. The information contained on, or that may be accessed through, our website and our social media channels is not incorporated by reference into, and is not a part of, this document.\n\n**DUOLINGO, INC.

Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by management to evaluate the financial performance of our business and we present these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that they are helpful in highlighting trends in our operating results and that they are frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry.

Free cash flow margin is defined as Free cash flow as a percentage of revenues. We believe that free cash flow is a measure of liquidity that provides useful information to our management, investors and others in understanding and evaluating the strength of our liquidity and future ability to generate cash that can be used for strategic opportunities or investing in our business. Free cash flow has certain limitations in that it does not represent our residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures and our non-discretionary commitments.

These new features—Video Call and Adventures—demonstrate Duolingo's commitment to leveraging cutting-edge AI to enhance the learning experience for millions of users worldwide. The company also emphasizes its investment in music education by announcing its partnership with Loog, leading musical instruments brand for beginners, and hosts a wide-ranging conversation with Grammy winner Jon Batiste.\n\n“Our mission is to develop the best education in the world and make it universally available. We believe the best way to do that is by continuously pushing the boundaries of technology,” says Luis von Ahn, co-founder and CEO of Duolingo. “With new AI-powered features like Video Call and Adventures, we're creating new, immersive ways to practice languages and build confidence. These innovations are just the beginning of how we're leveraging technology to serve our global community of learners better.”\n\n**AI-Powered Conversations: Video Call with Lily**\n\nDuolingo's new Video Call feature represents a leap forward in language practice for learners. This AI-powered tool allows Duolingo Max subscribers to engage in spontaneous, realistic conversations with Lily, one of Duolingo’s most popular characters. The technology behind Video Call is designed to simulate natural dialogue and provides a personalized, interactive practice environment. Even beginner learners can converse in a low-pressure environment because Video Call is designed to adapt to their skill level. By offering learners the opportunity to converse in real-time, Video Call builds the confidence needed to communicate effectively in real-world situations. Video Call is available for Duolingo Max subscribers learning English, Spanish, and French.\n\n**Adventures: Explore and learn in the Duolingo World**\n\nDuolingo will also unveil Adventures, an innovative exploration game-like experience that immerses learners in the vibrant world of Duolingo. For the first time, users can explore dynamic settings and storylines, interacting with beloved characters like Oscar and Lily in a fully realized Duolingo universe. Adventures allows learners to apply their language skills to realistic scenarios, from getting their passport checked to ordering coffee, blending fun with functional learning. Adventures will be available across Android and iOS devices.\n\n**Expanding Music: Popular songs, compact piano partnership, and an A-list interview**\n\nTo expand its Music course capabilities, Duolingo is announcing a partnership with Loog, a leading portable instrument manufacturer, to create a compact and portable digital piano designed for the Duolingo Music course. This partnership allows learners to practice Duolingo Music lessons on a three-octave digital piano. The Duolingo x Loog Piano will be available for pre-order at [_store.duolingo.com_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=jdbLJ-s0lgE8a7THTFyAFbMN5BtkTgQSpRbARv24VP7FQWZQ_0YxufEq2TPLqsYNiIa3xtl563VInrkFXMYJBuSvvjudfOhoYojSty3oscA=) for $249.
