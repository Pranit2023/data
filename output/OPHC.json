(NASDAQ: OPHC) (“OptimumBank” or the “Company”) today reported robust financial performance for the third quarter of 2024. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company achieved net income of $3.3 million, or $0.34 per basic share and $0.32 per diluted share, compared to net income of $1.2 million, or $0.18 per basic and diluted share, for the same period in 2023. This reflects significant growth in both earnings and profitability year-over-year.\n\n**Key Financial Highlights:**\n\n●| Net interest income for the third quarter of 2024 reached $8.962 million, a significant increase of 51.5% from $5.914 million in the third quarter of 2023, primarily driven by a 44.9% rise in average interest-earning assets.  \n---|---  \n●| Net interest margin increased to 3.96%, up from 3.79% in the third quarter of 2023, reflecting growth in average interest-earning assets and the impact of higher costs on interest-bearing deposits.  \n●| Noninterest income increased to $1.115 million for the third quarter of 2024, a 22.4% increase from $911,000 for the same period in 2023, driven mainly by higher service charges and an increase in other noninterest income.  \n  \n**Asset and Deposit Growth:**\n\n●| Gross loans expanded to $778million as of September 30, 2024, from as of December 31, 2023, reflecting solid business growth.  \n---|---  \n●| Total deposits grew by 26.1% to $806.5 million, from $639.5 million for December 31, 2023. The increase is driven by both noninterest-bearing demand deposits and time deposits, which rose by 134.5% to $285.7 million.  \n  \n**Capital Position:**\n\n●| The Tier 1 capital to total assets ratio improved to 10.38% as of September 30, 2024, compared to 10.00% at the end of 2023, reflecting a strong capital base supporting continued growth.  \n---|---  \n  \n**Chairman of the Board Commentary**\n\nMoishe Gubin, Chairman of OptimumBank Holdings, Inc., stated, “We are pleased to report robust financial performance for the third quarter of 2024, highlighting the effectiveness of our strategy. Our net income reached $3.3 million, or $0.34 per basic share and $0.32 per diluted share, compared to $1.6 million for the same period last year. This significant improvement reflects our ongoing commitment to delivering value to our shareholders while enhancing operational efficiency.”\n\n“Our net interest income grew to $8.962 million, representing a strong increase of 51.5% from $5.914 million in the third quarter of 2023, driven primarily by a 44.9% increase in average interest-earning assets. Additionally, we experienced an improvement in our net interest margin, which increased to 3.96% from 3.79% in the third quarter of 2023, showcasing our effective asset utilization despite rising costs associated with interest-bearing deposits.”\n\n“We also achieved noteworthy growth in noninterest income, which rose to $1.115 million—up 22.4% from $911,000 in the same period last year. This increase was primarily attributed to higher service charges and an increase in other noninterest income, underscoring the strength of our diversified revenue streams. Concurrently, our noninterest expenses increased by 45.0% to $5.285 million, largely due to investments in salaries, employee benefits, and data processing costs, which are critical to supporting our growth initiatives. In short order, many of the added expenses are expected to generate additional income, as much of these expenses went toward expanding our SBA department and enhanced software to provide additional treasury management tools to our customers.”\n\n“On the asset side, our gross loans expanded to $778 million, reflecting strong demand for our lending products. Total deposits grew by 26.1% to $806.5 million, driven by a substantial 134.5% increase in time deposits.”\n\n“As we look ahead, we remain optimistic about our ability to build on these achievements and sustain our growth momentum. We have also commenced our active ATM offering, which is regularly providing us with additional capital to support our balance sheet. We are grateful for the continued support of our stakeholders and remain dedicated to enhancing our market position through strategic lending, disciplined expense management, and operational innovation.”\n\n**Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin**\n\nThree Months Ended _(Dollars in thousands)_\n\n**September 30, 2024**| **September 30, 2023**| **% Change**  \n---|---|---  \n**Average interest-earning assets**|  $| 904,772| $| 624,412| 44.9| %  \n**Net interest income**|  $| 8,962| $| 5,914| 51.6| %  \n**Net interest margin**|  3.96| %| 3.79| %| 17 bps  \n  \nNet interest income for the third quarter of 2024 was $8.962 million, reflecting a 51.5% increase from $5.914 million in the third quarter of 2023.

The increase was primarily driven by higher service charges and fees, which rose to $990,000 from $881,000 in the third quarter of 2023. Additionally, there was a significant increase in other noninterest income, which grew to $125,000 from $30,000 in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, noninterest income totaled $3.555 million, a substantial increase of 47.4% compared to $2.412 million for the same period in 2023. This growth was again primarily due to higher service charges and fees, which increased to $2.822 million from $2.359 million year-over-year, coupled with a notable rise in other noninterest income, which jumped to $733,000 from $53,000 in the previous year.\n\n**Noninterest Expense**\n\nThree Months and Nine Months Ended September 30 _(Dollars in thousands)_\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30, 2024**| **Three Months Ended September 30, 2023**| **Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024**| **Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023**  \n---|---|---|---  \n**Salaries and employee benefits**|  $| 3,078| $| 2,141| $| 8,958| $| 6,148  \n**Professional fees**|  $| 266| $| 161| $| 699| $| 529  \n**Occupancy and equipment**|  $| 234| $| 204| $| 642| $| 581  \n**Data processing**|  $| 574| $| 455| $| 1,702| $| 1,206  \n**Regulatory assessment**|  $| 241| $| 89| $| 593| $| 522  \n**Litigation Settlement**|  —| —| —| $| 375  \n**Other**|  $| 892| $| 601| $| 2,484| $| 1,614  \n**Total noninterest expenses**|  $| 5,285| $| 3,651| $| 15,078| $| 10,975  \n  \nNoninterest expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, reached $15.1 million, up 37.4% from $11.0 million in the same period in 2023. This increase reflects strategic investments to support the bank’s expansion and prepare for continued growth.\n\nA large portion of this increase was driven by higher salaries and employee benefits, which rose to $9.0 million from $6.1 million, reflecting the bank’s commitment to building a workforce capable of managing our expanding service offerings. Data processing expenses also grew from $1.2 million to $1.7 million, due to investments in advanced treasury management software. This new software enables us to better support our current clients’ needs and attract new clients, generating additional fee income as we expand our treasury management capabilities.\n\nFurther contributing to the rise in expenses were increases in regulatory assessments, up from $522,000 to $593,000, and professional fees, which rose to $699,000 from $529,000. These costs reflect both heightened compliance efforts in line with the bank’s growing operations and the specialized expertise needed to scale our services. Together, these investments in talent, technology, and compliance are part of our strategy to position the bank for sustainable growth, allowing us to serve a broader client base while moving closer to our goal of becoming a $1 billion institution.\n\n**Loans and Credit Quality** _(Dollars in thousands)_\n\n**September 30, 2024**| **December 31, 2023**| **% Change**  \n---|---|---  \n**Gross Loans**|  $| 778,058| $| 680,071| 14.4| %  \n**Less: Net Deferred Loan Fees and Costs**|  $| (807| )| $| (1,294| )| (38| )%  \n**Less: Allowance for Credit Losses**|  $| (8,337| )| $| (7,683| )| 8.5| %  \n**Loans, Net**|  $| 768,914| $| 671,094| 14.6| %  \n  \n**Change in Allowance for Credit Losses** _(Dollars in thousands)_\n\n**Loan Type**| **Beginning Balance**| **Credit Loss Expense (Income)**| **Charge-offs**| **Recoveries**| **Ending Balance**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n**Three Months Ended September 30, 2024**|  $| 8,337  \nResidential Real Estate| $| 970| $| 265| $| —| $| —| $| 1,235  \nMulti-Family Real Estate| $| 712| $| 114| $| —| $| —| $| 826  \nCommercial Real Estate| $| 4,303| $| (803| )| $| —| $| —| $| 3,500  \nLand and Construction| $| 1,677| $| 605| $| —| $| —| $| 2,282  \nCommercial| $| 134| $| 47| $| —| $| —| $| 181  \nConsumer| $| 412| $| 181| $| (366| )| $| 86| $| 313  \n  \n**Loan Type**| **Beginning Balance**| **Credit Loss Expense (Income)**| **Charge-offs**| **Recoveries**| **Ending Balance**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n**Three Months Ended September 30, 2023**|  $| 7,200  \nResidential Real Estate| $| 883| $| (113| )| $| —| $| —| $| 770  \nMulti-Family Real Estate| $| 1,037| $| 184| $| —| $| —| $| 1,221  \nCommercial Real Estate| $| 2,802| $| 620| $| —| $| —| $| 3,422  \nLand and Construction| $| 680| $| 194| $| —| $| —| $| 874  \nCommercial| $| 135| $| 102| $| (10| )| $| —| $| 227  \nConsumer| $| 1,108| $| 337| $| (872| )| $| 113| $| 686  \n  \n**Nine Months Ended September 30** _(Dollars in thousands)_\n\n**September 30, 2024**| **December 31,****2023**| **September 30, 2023**| **% Change December 31, 2023**| **% Change September 30, 2023**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n**Allowance for Credit Losses**|  $|  8,337| $|  7,683| $|  7,200|  8.5| %|  15.8| %  \n  \nAs of September 30, 2024, gross loans reached $778.1 million, a significant increase of 14.4% from $680.1 million at the end of December 2023.

Financial Performance for the Second Quarter of 2024\n\nCompany Release - 8/6/2024\n\nDownload the PDF version PDF Format (opens in new window)\n\n**Fort Lauderdale, FL, Aug. 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- OptimumBank Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: OPHC) (“OptimumBank” or the “Company”) today reported strong financial performance for the second quarter of 2024. For the three months ended June 30, 2024, the Company achieved net income of $3.5 million, or $.36 per basic share and $0.34 per diluted share, compared to net income of $1.3 million, or $0.18 per basic and diluted share, for the same period in 2023. This reflects significant growth in both earnings and profitability year-over-year.**\n\n**Key Financial Highlights:**\n\n**Comparison of the Three-Month Periods Ended June 30, 2024, and 2023:**\n\n  * **Net interest income** for the second quarter of 2024 reached $8.7 million, a remarkable increase of 56% from $5.6 million in the second quarter of 2023, driven by a 54% rise in average interest-earning assets.\n  * **Net interest margin** improved to 3.79%, up from 3.73% in the same quarter last year, illustrating enhanced yield on assets despite rising deposit costs.\n  * **Noninterest income** surged to $1.2 million for the second quarter of 2024, up 56% from $772,000 for the second quarter of 2023. This growth was primarily attributed to increased service charges and a notable rise in other noninterest income.\n  * **Noninterest expenses** increased by 30% to $5 million for the first quarter of 2024, driven by employee compensation and benefits, data processing, and other operating costs.\n\n\n\n**Asset and Deposit Growth:**\n\n  * **Gross loans** expanded to $761.1 million as of June 30, 2024, an 12% increase from December 31, 2023, reflecting robust business growth. The allowance for credit losses increased to $8.2 million or 1.08% of loans outstanding at June 30, 2024, compared to $7.7 million or 1.13% of loans outstanding at December 31, 2023.\n  * **Total deposits** grew by 19% to $762.6 million. This increase was driven by a combination of higher noninterest-bearing demand deposits and an increase in time deposits.\n\n\n\n**Capital Position:**\n\n  * **Tier 1 capital** to total assets ratio was 9.68% as of June 30, 2024, compared to 10.00% at the end of 2023, reflecting a solid capital base supporting continued growth.\n\n\n\n**Chairman of the Board Commentary**\n\nMoishe Gubin, Chairman of OptimumBank Holdings, Inc., stated, “Our strong financial performance in the second quarter of 2024 underscores the noteworthy progress we have made. Achieving net income of $3.5 million, or $.34 per diluted share, is a testament to our strategic focus and operational excellence. Our net interest income surged by 56% year-over-year, driven by an increase in average interest-earning assets. This growth reflects our strategic lending activity and careful management of interest rates and asset yields.”\n\n“Despite the rising deposit costs, our net interest margin improved to 3.79%, up from 3.73% in the same period last year, illustrating our ability to enhance yield on assets. Noninterest income also saw a significant increase of 56% from the previous second quarter of 2023, bolstered by higher service charges and other noninterest income. These gains highlight our diversified revenue streams and strong operational performance.”\n\n“We have made appropriate strides in expanding our loan portfolio, which grew by 11.9% to $761.1 million as of June 30, 2024. Our deposit growth of 19.2% to $762.6 million, particularly the notable 90.1% rise in time deposits, underscores our solid market position and trust among our customers.”\n\n“Our capital position remains strong, with a Tier 1 capital to total assets ratio of 9.68%, providing a solid foundation for continued growth. As we move forward, we are confident in our ability to sustain this momentum and deliver long-term value to our shareholders. Our strategic initiatives, coupled with the ongoing support from stakeholders position us well for future success. Our ATM offering (“at-the market offering”) will become effective in the next couple of weeks through our designated agent and will allow the Company to continuously sell shares in the open market to fund our growth.”\n\nChairman Gubin’s comments align with the company’s reported financial performance and strategic achievements, emphasizing growth, operational efficiency, and a strong market position.\n\n**Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin**\n\n**Comparison of the Three-Month Periods Ended June 30, 2024, and 2023**\n\n**(Dollars in thousands)**| **June 30, 2024**| **June 30, 2023**| **% Change**  \n---|---|---|---  \nAverage interestEarning assets| $| 923,822| $| 599,550| 54.1| %  \nNet interest income| $| 8,742| $| 5,592| 56.3| %  \nNet interest margin| 3.79| %| 3.73| %| 6 bps  \n  \nNet interest income for the second quarter of 2024 was $8.7 million, a 56.3% increase from $5.6 million in the second quarter of 2023. This growth was primarily driven by a rise in average interest-earning assets, which increased by 54.1% from the previous year, contributing to higher net interest income. The increase in net interest income was more than sufficient to offset the impact of higher interest-bearing deposit costs.\n\nCompared to the first quarter of 2024, net interest income was 12.8% higher, reflecting changes in asset yields and deposit costs. The net interest margin for the second quarter of 2024 was 3.79%, up from 3.73% in the second quarter of 2023. This improvement was due to the growth in average interest-earning assets and more favorable yields, despite the rising costs of interest-bearing deposits.\n\n**Noninterest Income**\n\n**Three Months and Six Months Ended June 30 2024, and 2023**\n\n**(Dollars in thousands)**| **Three Months Ended June 30, 2024**| **Three Months Ended June 30, 2023**| **Six Months Ended June 30, 2024**| **Six Months Ended June 30, 2023**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nService charges and fees| $| 864| $| 759| $| 1,832| $| 1,478  \nOther| $|  337| $|  13| $|  608| $|  23  \n**Total noninterest income**|  $| 1,201| $| 772| $| 2,440| $| 1,501  \n  \nNoninterest income for the second quarter of 2024 was $1.2 million, a 55.6% increase from $772,000 in the first quarter of 2024. The increase was primarily driven by higher service charges and fees, which rose to $864,000 from $759,000 in the previous quarter. Additionally, there was a significant increase in other noninterest income, which rose to $337,000 from $13,000 in the first quarter of 2024 from the sale of the guaranteed portion of U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”) SBA 7A loans.\n\n**Noninterest Expense**\n\n**Three Months and Six Months Ended June 30 2024, and 2023**\n\n**(Dollars in thousands)**| **Three Months Ended June 30, 2024**| **Three Months Ended June 30, 2023**| **Six Months Ended June 30, 2024**| **Six Months Ended June 30, 2023**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nSalaries and employee benefits| $| 3,031| $| 2,041| $| 5,879| $| 4,007  \nProfessional fees| $| 238| $| 171| $| 433| $| 368  \nOccupancy and equipment| $| 202| $| 188| $| 408| $| 377  \nData processing| $| 575| $| 385| $| 1,129| $| 751  \nRegulatory assessment| $| 231| $| 224| $| 352| $| 433  \nLitigation Settlement| —| $| 375| —| $| 375  \nOther| $| 807| $| 518| $| 1,591| $| 1,013  \n**Total noninterest expenses**|  $| 5,084| $| 3,902| $| 9,792| $| 7,324  \n  \nNoninterest expense for the second quarter of 2024 was $5.1 million, an increase of 30.1% from $3.9 million in the first quarter of 2024. This change was mainly driven by an increase in employee compensation and benefits, data processing costs, and professional fees. There was no litigation settlement expense during 2024.\n\nCompared to the second quarter of 2023, noninterest expenses increased by 30% to $5.1 million from $3.9 million.
