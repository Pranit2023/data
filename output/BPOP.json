(the “Corporation,” “Popular,” “we,” “us,” “our”) (NASDAQ:BPOP) reported net income of $155.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of $177.8 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. \n\nIgnacio Alvarez, Chief Executive Officer, said: “Our results for the third quarter reflected an increase in net interest income, which was offset by a higher provision for credit losses. The increase in the provision was related in part to loan growth of nearly 2% during the quarter. Credit quality trends remained stable. While consumer portfolios reflected increased delinquencies, they remain slightly below pre-pandemic levels. \n\nCapital continues to be a source of strength, evidenced by the increase in our dividend and stock repurchases. We also experienced healthy increases in our tangible book value per share and TCE ratio. \n\nWe continued to advance our business transformation, making meaningful progress in modernizing our customer channels and improving the customer experience. We are optimistic about the future, as we continue to leverage the opportunities stemming from our robust balance sheet, our dedicated team and extensive customer base.” \n\n**Earnings Highlights**  \n---  \n(Unaudited)  |  Quarters ended  |  Nine months ended   \n(Dollars in thousands, except per share information)  |  30-Sep-24  |  30-Jun-24  |  30-Sep-23  |  30-Sep-24  |  30-Sep-23   \nNet interest income  |  $572,473  |  $568,312  |  $534,020  |  $1,691,529  |  $1,597,344   \nProvision for credit losses  |  71,448  |  46,794  |  45,117  |  190,840  |  129,946   \nNet interest income after provision for credit losses  |  501,025  |  521,518  |  488,903  |  1,500,689  |  1,467,398   \nOther non-interest income  |  164,082  |  166,306  |  159,549  |  494,206  |  481,981   \nOperating expenses  |  467,321  |  469,576  |  465,984  |  1,420,010  |  1,366,955   \nIncome before income tax  |  197,786  |  218,248  |  182,468  |  574,885  |  582,424   \nIncome tax expense  |  42,463  |  40,459  |  45,859  |  138,490  |  135,676   \nNet income  |  $155,323  |  $177,789  |  $136,609  |  $436,395  |  $446,748   \nNet income applicable to common stock  |  $154,970  |  $177,436  |  $136,256  |  $435,336  |  $445,689   \nNet income per common share-basic  |  $2.16  |  $2.47  |  $1.90  |  $6.06  |  $6.22   \nNet income per common share-diluted  |  $2.16  |  $2.46  |  $1.90  |  $6.05  |  $6.21   \n  \n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThis press release contains financial information prepared under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) and non-GAAP financial measures. Management uses non-GAAP financial measures when it has determined that these measures provide more meaningful information about the underlying performance of the Corporation’s ongoing operations. Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Corporation may not be comparable to similarly named non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. \n\n**_Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis_**\n\nNet interest income, on a taxable equivalent basis, is presented with its different components in Tables D, E and F. Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes that this presentation provides meaningful information since it facilitates the comparison of revenues arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. \n\n**_Tangible Common Equity_**\n\nThe tangible common equity, tangible common equity ratio, tangible assets and tangible book value per common share are non-GAAP financial measures. Tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per common share in conjunction with more traditional bank capital ratios are commonly used by banks and analysts to compare the capital adequacy of banking organizations with significant amounts of goodwill or other intangible assets, typically stemming from the use of the purchase accounting method for mergers and acquisitions. Neither tangible common equity nor tangible assets or related measures should be used in isolation or as a substitute for stockholders' equity, total assets or any other measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. \n\nRefer to Table R for a reconciliation of total stockholders’ equity to tangible common equity and total assets to tangible assets. \n\n**_Net interest income_ _and net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis_ _(non-GAAP_ _)_**\n\nNet interest income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, was $572.5 million, an increase of $4.2 million when compared to $568.3 million for the previous quarter. Net interest margin for the third quarter of 2024 was 3.24% compared to 3.22% in the prior quarter. \n\n_Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin Taxable Equivalent_\n\nNet interest income on a taxable equivalent basis for the third quarter of 2024 was $612.9 million, compared to $614.8 million in the previous quarter, a decrease of $1.8 million. Net interest margin on a taxable equivalent basis for the third quarter of 2024 was 3.47%, compared to 3.48% in the second quarter of 2024 driven by lower exempt income from U.S. Treasury Securities. \n\nThe main variances in net interest income and net interest margin on a taxable equivalent basis were: \n\n  * lower interest income from investment securities by $14.6 million due to lower volume of U.S. Treasury Bills by $1.2 billion due to the slow down in the reinvestment activity of matured investments, in part due to a reduction in average deposit balances during the quarter of $519.9 million, mainly P.R. low cost deposits, and funding loan growth; and \n  * higher interest expense from deposits by $11.0 million, due to higher cost of interest-bearing deposits by eight basis points. In Puerto Rico, government interest-bearing deposits increased by two basis points, and their average balances increased by $176.1 million quarter-over-quarter. This cost of deposits during the quarter was further impacted by a 21 basis points increase in the overall cost of time deposits, including the full quarter effect of the repricing of certain P.R. government deposits managed by the Corporation’s fiduciary services division, which were repriced late in the second quarter; \n\n\n\npartially offset by: \n\n  * higher income from money market investments by $7.7 million due to higher volumes by $562.7 million compared to the previous quarter; and \n  * higher interest income from loans by $16.3 million due to a higher average loan balance and higher yields, mainly in the commercial, mortgage and auto loans portfolio. \n\n\n\n_Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin (Banco Popular de Puerto Rico Segment)_\n\nNet interest income for the Banco Popular de Puerto Rico (“BPPR”) segment amounted to $488.0 million for the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of $0.7 million when compared to $488.7 million in the previous quarter. Net interest margin in the BPPR segment increased from the second quarter of 2024 by one basis points to 3.41%. The most significant variances quarter-over-quarter were: \n\n  * interest income from investment securities decreased by $9.9 million, primarily due to a $1.3 billion reduction in the volume of U.S. Treasury bills. This decline was mainly caused by maturities and a slowdown in reinvestment, partly due to support loan growth and a lower deposit balance; and \n  * interest expense on deposits increased by $6.9 million, mainly driven by P.R. government deposits that increased two basis points or $4.7 million quarter-over-quarter. Time deposit costs went up by $2.1 million or a 24-basis point increase, driven by the full quarter effect of the repricing of certain P.R. government deposits managed by the Corporation’s fiduciary services division. The total deposit cost for the quarter was 1.89%, a six-basis point increase from the prior quarter; \n\n\n\npartially offset by: \n\n  * an increase of $12.8 million in interest income from loans, primarily driven by a higher average loan balance across all portfolios. The most significant contributions to the quarter-over-quarter variance came from commercial loans, auto loans, and mortgage loans, which increased by $4.1 million, $2.9 million, and $2.2 million, respectively; and \n  * higher income from money market investments by $3.6 million due to higher volumes by $239.9 million. \n\n\n\n_Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin (Popular Bank Segment)_\n\nNet interest income and net interest margin for the Popular Bank (“PB”, or “Popular U.S.”) segment increased compared to the previous quarter by $7.3 million and 13 basis points and totaled $93.1 million and 2.73%, respectively. The most significant variances quarter-over-quarter contributing to net interest income and net interest margin for PB were: \n\n  * interest income from money markets and investment securities increased by $5.3 million, mainly due to higher volume of money market investments by $284.0 million resulting from higher average deposit balances; and \n  * interest income from loans increased by $3.2 million mainly due to a higher yield in the commercial loan portfolio by 12 basis points; \n\n\n\npartially offset by: \n\n  * total interest expense on deposits in PB increased by $1.4 million primarily due to an increase in the average balance of time deposits of $307.0 million partially offset by a decrease in time deposit costs of 23 basis points, driven by changes in the cost of intercompany deposits. When compared to the previous period, the overall cost of deposits fell by eight basis points. \n\n\n\n**_Non-interest income_**\n\nNon-interest income amounted to $164.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of $2.2 million when compared to $166.3 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. The variance in non-interest income was primarily due to lower income from mortgage banking activities by $3.1 million, mainly due to a decrease in the fair value of Mortgage Servicing Rights (“MSRs”) driven by portfolio runoff, a slight increase in prepayment speeds and lower estimated escrow float earnings. \n\n_Refer to Table B for further details._\n\n**_Operating expenses_**\n\nOperating expenses for the third quarter of 2024 totaled $467.3 million, a decrease of $2.3 million when compared to the second quarter of 2024. The variance in operating expenses was driven primarily by: \n\n  * lower professional fees by $11.0 million mainly due to a decrease of $6.1 million in consulting fees related to corporate initiatives. The remaining decrease in professional fees is mainly attributed to lower legal service fees and equity compensation granted to directors during the second quarter of 2024; \n  * lower operational losses by $6.1 million due to a buildup of reserves for operational losses during the second quarter of 2024; and \n  * lower processing and transactional services expenses by $4.8 million mainly due to lower debit card issuance costs and point of service (POS) processing fees; \n\n\n\npartially offset by: \n\n  * higher technology and software expenses by $8.7 million mainly driven by an increase of $3.0 million in IT project consulting fees, higher consulting fees for cybersecurity and fraud prevention initiatives, and higher software amortization expenses; \n  * higher personnel costs by $4.4 million mainly due to higher salary expense and contributions to employee savings plans resulting from annual salary revisions and merit increases effective in July 2024; partially offset by a decrease in restricted shares and incentive compensation expenses; \n  * higher other taxes expense by $2.4 million mainly due to an increase in municipal license tax and expenses related to regulatory examination fees in BPPR; and \n  * lower other real estate owned (OREO) benefit by $3.1 million mainly due to lower gains on sale of mortgage and commercial properties. \n\n\n\nFull-time equivalent employees were 9,246 as of September 30, 2024, compared to 9,241 as of June 30, 2024. \n\n_For a breakdown of operating expenses by category refer to Table B._\n\n**_Income taxes_**\n\nFor the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Corporation recorded an income tax expense of $42.5 million, compared to an income tax expense of $40.5 million for the previous quarter. \n\nThe effective tax rate (“ETR”) for the third quarter of 2024 was 21.5%, compared to 18.5% for the previous quarter. \n\nThe ETR of the Corporation is impacted by the composition and source of its taxable income. The Corporation expects its ETR for the year 2024 to be within a range from 21% to 23%. \n\n**_Credit Quality_**\n\nThe Corporation continued to reflect favorable credit quality metrics in the third quarter of 2024 when compared to the previous quarter. While non-performing loans (“NPLs”), net charge offs (“NCOs”) and inflows to NPLs remained below historical averages, consumer portfolios reflected increased delinquencies and NCOs for the quarter primarily driven by auto loans. The mortgage and commercial portfolios continue to operate with low level of delinquencies and NCOs. The Corporation continues to closely monitor changes in the macroeconomic environment and borrower performance given higher interest rates and inflationary pressures. Management believes that the improvements over recent years in risk management practices and the overall risk profile of the Corporation’s loan portfolios position Popular to continue to operate successfully under the current environment. \n\nThe following presents credit quality results for the third quarter of 2024: \n\n_Non-Performing Loans and Net Charge Offs_\n\nTotal NPLs increased by $19.6 million compared to the previous quarter. Excluding consumer loans, inflows of NPLs held-in-the-portfolio saw a decrease of $7.7 million in the third quarter of 2024. The ratio of NPLs to total loans held in the portfolio remained steady at 1.0%, consistent with the prior quarter’s ratio. The drivers of these changes are mainly related to the following: \n\n  * In the BPPR segment, NPLs increased by $1.9 million, mainly driven by auto loans NPLs with a $8.5 million increase, offset in part by lower mortgage loans NPLs by $5.9 million. Excluding consumer loans, inflows to NPLs in the BPPR segment decreased by $4.5 million compared to the previous quarter. \n  * In the PB segment, NPLs increased by $17.6 million driven by a single $17.1 million mortgage loan. Inflows to NPLs, excluding consumer loans, decreased by $3.2 million, driven by lower inflows in the commercial portfolio by $19.6 million, offset in part by a single mortgage relationship. \n\n\n\nTotal NCOs of $58.5 million, increased by $4.9 million when compared to the second quarter of 2024. The Corporation’s ratio of annualized NCOs to average loans held-in-portfolio was 0.65%, compared to 0.61% in the second quarter of 2024. The drivers of these changes are mainly related to the following: \n\n  * In the BPPR segment, NCOs increased by $5.3 million quarter-over-quarter, mainly driven by higher consumer NCOs by $8.6 million. NCOs increase in the consumer portfolio was mostly related to auto loans by $6.6 million. \n  * In the PB segment, NCOs remained flat quarter-over-quarter. \n\n\n\nRefer to Table N for further information on NCOs and related ratios. \n\n_Other Real Estate Owned Properties (“OREO”)_\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Corporation’s OREO portfolio amounted to $63.0 million, a decrease of $7.2 million when compared to the second quarter of 2024. The decrease in OREO assets was driven by sales of residential properties in the BPPR segment. \n\nRefer to Table L for additional information and related ratios. \n\n_Allowance for Credit Losses (“ACL”) and Provision for Credit Losses (“PCL”)_\n\nThe ACL as of September 30, 2024 amounted to $744.3 million, an increase of $14.2 million when compared to the second quarter of 2024. \n\nIn the BPPR segment, the ACL increased by $22.6 million driven by an increase of $13.9 million in reserves for commercial loans and an $8.4 million increase in reserves for consumer portfolios. These increases were mainly due to a combination of growth in the commercial portfolio and changes in credit quality trends for the auto and credit cards portfolio. In the PB segment, the ACL decreased by $8.3 million from the previous quarter, mainly driven by lower reserves for the commercial and construction portfolios due to improvements in credit quality and lower balances. \n\nThe Corporation’s ratio of the ACL to loans held-in-portfolio was 2.06% in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 2.05% in the previous quarter. The ratio of the ACL to NPLs held-in-portfolio was 206.0%, down from 213.6% in the previous quarter. \n\nThe provision for loan losses for the loan and lease portfolios for the third quarter of 2024 was $72.8 million, compared to $44.2 million in the previous quarter. The provision loan losses for the BPPR segment amounted to $77.2 million, compared to $48.6 million in the previous quarter, an increase of $28.6 million largely driven by the commercial loan growth and changes in credit quality trends for the auto loans portfolios. The PB segment had a release of $4.4 million, consistent with the previous quarter and driven by improvements in credit quality. \n\nThe provision for loan losses for the loan and lease portfolios, along with the $0.5 million reserve release related to unfunded loan commitments and the $0.9 million reserve release in the Corporation’s investment portfolio for the third quarter of 2024, are consolidated and shown together under the provision for credit losses in our Consolidated Statement of Operations.

\n  * a decrease in other assets of $404.6 million, driven by unsettled trade receivables related to proceeds from maturities of U.S. Treasury Notes and interest payments from the second quarter of 2024 which were received in the third quarter; and \n  * a decrease in money market investments of $320.6 million, mainly driven by lower deposits and deployment of funds to support loan growth; \n\n\n\npartially offset by: \n\n  * an increase in loans held-in-portfolio by $603.3 million, primarily in BPPR with an increase of $582.1 million across most portfolios, particularly commercial loans, while PB’s increased by $21.2 million. \n\n\n\nTotal liabilities decreased by $1.9 billion from the second quarter of 2024, driven by: \n\n  * a decrease of $1.9 billion in deposits, mainly driven by interest bearing deposit accounts in BPPR, including the P.R. government demand accounts, offset by an increase in time deposits at PB. \n\n\n\nStockholders' equity increased by $417.8 million from the second quarter of 2024 mainly due to the change in the accumulated other comprehensive loss driven by the decrease in net unrealized losses in the portfolio of AFS securities of $326.1 million and the amortization of unrealized losses from securities previously reclassified to HTM of $36.3 million, net of tax effect, coupled with retained earnings resulting from the quarter’s net income of $155.3 million, partially offset by common and preferred dividends declared during the quarter of $45.0 million and by an increase in Treasury Stock due to the repurchases of 599,096 shares of common stock for $58.8 million during the quarter as part of the previously announced authorization. \n\nThe Corporation is in the process of completing its annual goodwill impairment test, using July 31, 2024 as the evaluation date. The Corporation expects to finalize its evaluation prior to the filing of its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Any impairment of goodwill would result in a non-cash expense, net of tax impact. A charge to earnings related to goodwill impairment would not materially impact regulatory capital and tangible capital calculations. \n\nCommon Equity Tier 1 ratio (“CET1”), common equity per share and tangible book value per share were 16.42%, $80.35 and $69.04, respectively, at September 30, 2024, compared to 16.48%, $73.94 and $62.71, respectively, at June 30, 2024.

For accounting purposes, these loans subject to the repurchase option are required to be reflected (rebooked) on the financial statements of BPPR with an offsetting liability. These balances include $70 million of residential mortgage loans insured by FHA or guaranteed by the VA that are no longer accruing interest as of September 30, 2024 (June 30, 2024 - $81 million; September 30, 2023 - $115 million). Furthermore, the Corporation has approximately $32 million in reverse mortgage loans which are guaranteed by FHA, but which are currently not accruing interest. Due to the guaranteed nature of the loans, it is the Corporation's policy to exclude these balances from non-performing assets (June 30, 2024- $34 million; September 30, 2023 - $39 million).   \n  \n**Popular, Inc.**  \n---  \n**Financial Supplement to Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Release**  \n**Table M -
