Michael Burns is promoted to Senior Vice President and Chief Legal Officer effective January 2, 2025.\n\nNathan Goldman retires from CSX after a distinguished 21-year tenure with the company. Goldman's leadership was pivotal in steering the transformation of the business and the transition of three CEOs in eight years, serving all three leaders and the Board of Directors with confidence.\n\n“Nathan’s contributions to CSX have been highly valued, and his expertise and dedication have been instrumental to our organization. His leadership will leave a lasting legacy, having developed the best group of legal, regulatory and compliance professionals in the industry. We are grateful to Nathan for his outstanding service and wish him all the best in his well-deserved retirement,” said CSX president and CEO Joe Hinrichs. “With 18 years of dedicated service and extensive experience with the company, Michael’s promotion to chief legal officer will bring invaluable insight and stability as we advance our strategy to deliver profitable growth.”\n\nIn his new role, Michael Burns will oversee all of CSX's legal and regulatory affairs, the corporate secretary’s office, risk management, police and infrastructure protection, environmental and hazmat, and audit functions. He previously served as CSX vice president and general counsel. Since joining CSX in 2006, Burns has advanced through roles of increasing responsibility, initially focusing on employment and benefits law before assuming responsibility for the full law department and additional functions such as corporate secretary, risk management, and environmental and hazmat responsibilities. Prior to CSX, Burns practiced labor and employment law at a leading Indiana firm. He holds a bachelor's degree from Wabash College and a Juris Doctor from Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law.\n\n“This leadership transition underscores CSX’s commitment to growth and highlights our confidence in the exceptional depth of talent within our organization. We are fortunate to have an outstanding team of railroaders poised to harness our current momentum and propel us toward even greater success,” said Hinrichs. “I am grateful for the dedication of our team and excited about the opportunities ahead.”\n\n**About CSX**\n\nCSX, based in Jacksonville, Florida, is a premier transportation company.

The company achieved overall volume growth in its Merchandise and Coal market segments, outpacing the industrial economy. Despite challenges in certain commodity markets leading to year-over-year declines in revenue and earnings, CSX finished the year in a strong financial position.\n\n“Our 2023 successes were a tribute to the dedication of our employees, who embraced our ONE CSX cultural transformation that is building trust and teamwork across the company,” expressed Joe Hinrichs, CSX president and chief executive officer. “We made tremendous progress on our many initiatives to improve the work experience for all employees by responding to their feedback and implementing policies and practices that demonstrate our respect for the value they create for our company.”\n\nIn the report, Hinrichs also outlined CSX's commitment to growing its business through dependable service performance and solutions, underpinned by an increasingly engaged workforce. The company continues to implement new technologies to enhance safety and improve the customer experience, while pursuing environmental initiatives to increase fuel efficiency and reduce emissions.\n\nThe CSX Annual Report highlighted key strategies that drove business performance in 2023, including the introduction of innovative service solutions and the expansion of customer facilities along CSX lines. Service excellence was a cornerstone of growth initiatives, resulting in significant performance metric improvements and safety enhancements.\n\nAs CSX looks to the future, the company is optimistic about delivering continued growth, safety enhancements, and ongoing service improvements driven by its dedicated workforce that is relentlessly focused on working together as ONE CSX to successfully deliver great results.\n\nFor more information and to access the full 2023 Annual Report, please [click here](https://s2.q4cdn.com/859568992/files/doc_financials/2023/ar/2023-csx-annual-report.pdf) or visit [csx.com/investors](https://investors.csx.com/financials/annual-reports/default.aspx).\n\n[![Facebook](/share/wwwcsx15/assets/Image/Global/social_icon_facebook_white.png)](http://www.facebook.com/OfficialCSX) [![Twitter](/share/wwwcsx15/assets/Image/Global/social_icon_twitter_white.png)](http://twitter.com/CSX) [![](/share/wwwcsx15/assets/Image/Global/social_icon_linkedin_white.png)](http://linkedin.com/company/csx-transportation) [![Instagram](/share/wwwcsx15/assets/Image/Global/social_icon_instagram_white.png)](http://instagram.com/OfficialCSX) [![YouTube](/share/wwwcsx15/assets/Image/Global/social_icon_youtube_white.png)](http://youtube.com/HowTomorrowMoves)\n\n  * [Employees](/index.cfm/working-at-csx/employees/)\n  * [Retirees](/index.cfm/working-at-csx/retiree-gateway/)\n  * [ShipCSX Log In](https://shipcsx.com/public/ec.shipcsxpublic/Main)\n\n\n\n  * [Company Store](http://www.csxstore.com/)\n  * [Contact Us](/index.cfm/about-us/contact-us/)\n  * [Mobile Site](?mobileFormat=true)\n\n\n\n  * [Privacy](/index.cfm/about-the-site/privacy)\n  * [Terms of Use](/index.cfm/about-the-site/terms-of-use)\n  * [Corporate Structure](/index.cfm/about-the-site/corporate-structure)\n  * [CSX Responsible Disclosure Policy](/index.cfm/about-us/contact-us/csx-responsible-disclosure-policy/)\n\n\n\nEMAIL SIGN-UP\n\n[Subscribe to receive CSX Press Releases](https://investors.csx.com/resources/investor-email-alerts/default.aspx)\n\nEMAIL SIGN-UP\n\n[Subscribe to receive CSX Press Releases](/index.cfm/about-us/media/subscribe-to-csx-express/)\n\n[Subscribe to receive Customer Service Advisories](/index.cfm/customers/news/subscribe-to-customer-service-advisories/)\n\n© 2024 CSX Corporation [![](/share/wwwcsx15/assets/Image/Working_at_CSX/Employees/Employee_Gateway.gif)](https://csxgateway.csx.com/Pages/default.aspx)\n\nWe use cookies to personalize and enhance your experience on our site.
