          "url": "https://artelobio.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Letter-to-Shareholders-12AUG2019.pdf",
          "content": "August 12, 2019\nTo our Valued Stockholders,\nWe would like to take this opportunity to provide you with an update and thank you for your continued\nsupport. We are more excited than ever about the outlook for Artelo Biosciences and our stockholders.\nAs you may be aware, we have assembled a pipeline of proprietary therapeutic candidates targeting the\nendocannabinoid system, each with the potential to treat significant unmet needs in multiple diseases\nand conditions. We have achieved a number of major developmental, operational, and financial\nmilestones that we believe will allow us to rapidly advance these programs. Most recently, we listed on\nthe Nasdaq Capital Market with a concurrent public offering of $8.0 million, which we expect to fund\nArtelo through a number of upcoming catalysts. These milestones include the initial clinical trial readout\nof our Phase 1b/2a study of ART27.13 in cancer-related anorexia and weight loss, as well as initiating\nnon-clinical studies for our proprietary cannabidiol (“CBD”) cocrystal program, and our fatty acid binding\nprotein 5 (FABP5) inhibitor platform for the treatment of cancer, inflammation, and pain.\nWe observed promising results with our lead product candidate, ART27.13, a highly potent synthetic\ndual cannabinoid agonist that we are developing for treatment of cancer-related anorexia and weight\nloss. Cancer-related anorexia affects about 60% of advanced stage cancer patients, and yet there are no\nFDA approved drugs specifically labeled for this condition. As a result, we believe ART27.13 has the\npotential to address this multi-billion-dollar, underserved market. A prior Phase 1 study in healthy\nsubjects of ART27.13 showed significant correlation of drug exposure to weight gain compared to\nplacebo (p=0.0001). We are planning to enroll approximately 50 patients in Phase 1b/2a clinical study in\ncancer-related anorexia and will initiate the trial after we complete manufacturing of new study drug.\nWe expect this trial to accrue quickly and initial results are anticipated next year.\nWe are also excited about the potential of our proprietary CBD cocrystal program, ART12.11. We believe\nthis patent-pending next generation CBD cocrystal, with its enhanced pharmaceutical properties, will\noffer multiple benefits including greater consistency of exposure. This is desired especially in situations\nwhere CBD can affect metabolism of coadministered drugs. ART12.11 is expected to improve safety and\nefficacy over inconsistently absorbed CBD, which we anticipate will be demonstrated in the clinical\ndevelopment process. We are planning development for multiple large indications including post-\ntraumatic stress disorder and inflammatory bowel diseases, as well as application in rare diseases.\nFinally, through an exclusive agreement and in collaboration with The Research Foundation of the State\nUniversity of New York at Stony Brook, we are developing a FABP5 inhibitor platform, including\nART26.12, for the treatment of cancer, inflammation, and pain. FABP5 is an intra-cellular protein that\nserves as a carrier for certain lipids, including endocannabinoids and fatty acids. Inhibition of FABP5 has\nbeen shown to suppress the growth and migration of breast and prostate cancers. As a result, we\nbelieve our FABP5 inhibitor program holds potential as a new paradigm in the field of cancer therapy by\nmodulating lipid signaling. Additionally, fatty acid binding proteins have been identified as intracellular\ntransporters for the endocannabinoid anandamide and may have a significant opportunity in treating\npain.\nWe look forward to initiating our clinical study with ART27.13 in cancer-related anorexia and advancing\nboth ART12.11 and ART26.12 with our initiatives in formulation, manufacturing, and non-clinical studies\nto prepare for human trials. With four issued and four pending patents, across our three programs, we\nbelieve we will have a strong market exclusivity position, which includes composition of matter patents,\nprior to commercialization. Now that we have completed our public offering and are traded on Nasdaq,\nwe believe we have the resources to achieve meaningful milestones. The listing on Nasdaq should also\nbenefit us greatly due to increased visibility, liquidity, and a much broader potential investor base.\nOnce again, we’d like to thank all of our stockholders as we embark together on the next phase of this\nexciting endeavor. We remain fully committed to driving stockholder value and look forward to\nproviding further updates on our development programs in the months ahead. In the meantime, you\ncan email our IR team (artl@crescendo-ir.com) to add you to our email distribution list for breaking\nnews.
