If you wish to supplement our tool with a manual process, here's how to find a distinctive name for your company that fits your brand and industry.\n\n![Arrow](/public/images/bsg/foundation.svg)\n\n##### Set The Foundation\n\nWhen looking for a remarkable name for your brand, start by understanding what values, ideas, and key concepts you'd like your brand to capture. Writing down these baseline concepts will allow you to build off of them and generate exceptional business name ideas, whether you're using a brand name creator or not. Also, ensure the name is easy to remember, pronounce, and spell to make it more accessible and recognizable to potential customers.\n\n![Arrow](/public/images/bsg/audience.svg)\n\n##### Know Your Audience\n\nA brand name must appeal to your core audience and what they value. Remember that the brand name idea you land on should resonate deeply with your target audience since they will be the deciding factor between success and failure. Naming a business with your audience in mind is not difficult. Our enterprise-grade name generation tool that filters by industry is a great solution for finding cool company name ideas that align with your audience.\n\n![Arrow](/public/images/bsg/think.svg)\n\n##### Think Big Picture\n\nNow you are wondering, how to name a business with the big picture in mind? Whether you're rebranding or starting a business, one important factor when naming a brand is considering your long-term business goals. Avoid focusing on brand name ideas that narrow your ability to grow and transform your brand over the years. That is why our free business name creator provides some naming ideas that are abstract and not tied to a specific industry.\n\n![Arrow](/public/images/bsg/danger.svg)\n\n##### Know The Danger Zones\n\nWhen coming up with a business name, avoid ideas that are difficult to say, hard to spell, or lose engagement with your audience. Captivating, memorable, and unique name ideas are a great way to push your business forward. The last thing you want is a name for your brand that just doesn't create an amazing first impression (no matter how thoughtful the explanation for the name is).\n\n![Arrow](/public/images/bsg/brain.svg)\n\n##### Start Brainstorming\n\nWhen naming your company, brainstorming with a group of individuals is one of the best ways to get cool name ideas flowing. You and your team must become business name creators! Try to brainstorm as many catchy business name ideas as you can before landing on a final name. Consider exploring [available premium names for sale](/premium-domains-for-sale) to find the perfect option.\n\n![Arrow](/public/images/bsg/chat.svg)\n\n##### Test Your Name Ideas\n\nName validation is often overlooked when coming up with business names - Use audience testing and trademark support. Validation provides feedback from real people on your name ideas and helps you avoid any potential legal issues that can become tedious and expensive down the line. One of the best ways to create a unique business name is to validate your favorite names before making your final choice.\n\n## Over 200,000+ Business Name Ideas\n\nThese examples of short, catchy, one-word, color, cute, and cool business names are real business names created by our content community for our 50,000+ clients.

Discover what it means to care about your brand, and what might happen if you don't. Only select a name for your business after completing this checklist.\n\nCare\n\n####  ![Arrow](/public/images/bsg/check.svg) Contextual \n\nYour brand name should provide context to your brand. Some names begin a brand story (Burt's Bees), other names set tone and positioning (Urban Decay). What is most important is that your name fits your specific brand. Don't be generic!\n\n####  ![Arrow](/public/images/bsg/check.svg) Appealing \n\nWhen selecting a brand name, companies may care more about sounding unique or edgy. However, at times, this can mean choosing a name that's difficult to pronounce or awkward to spell and write. This may cause you to lose appeal with the target market.\n\n####  ![Arrow](/public/images/bsg/check.svg) Remarkable \n\nA unique business name can be the difference between a successful and average brand. It doesn't need to be something crazy but a one-of-a-kind name that sets you apart from any other business in the same space.\n\n####  ![Arrow](/public/images/bsg/check.svg) Evocative \n\nYou can choose a brand name that is emotional, experiential, descriptive, elegant, or witty. Whatever you choose, a name should inspire a potent response from your target audience - an emotional reaction or a unique idea relevant to your brand that helps the name stick in the consumers’ minds.\n\nDon't\n\n####  ![Arrow](/public/images/bsg/close.svg) Difficult \n\nBefore finalizing your brand name, ensure that it's not hard to pronounce or spell. Such a name will confuse consumers and be difficult to remember.\n\n####  ![Arrow](/public/images/bsg/close.svg) Obscure \n\nYou may opt for an exotic or abstract brand name understood by only a few.

If you wish to supplement our tool with a manual process, here’s how to find a name for your website that fits your brand and industry.\n\n![Arrow](/public/images/bsg/foundation.svg)\n\n##### Set The Foundation\n\nWhen looking for a domain that fits your brand, you should focus not only on what your business does on a practical level but also the values, ideas, and key concepts your brand captures. Noting down these concepts is an important brainstorming step, and allows you to build off them to find an original domain name. It also gives you plenty of terms to use in our domain name generator.\n\n![Arrow](/public/images/bsg/audience.svg)\n\n##### Know Your Audience\n\nA website name must appeal to your core audience and what they value. It should be based on your brand name but doesn’t have to be an exact fit. Whether your domain name is the same as your company name or not, it should resonate deeply with your target audience since they will be the deciding factor between success and failure. Choosing a domain name with your target audience in mind is not difficult. Our domain name generator that filters by industry is a great tool for finding website name ideas that align with your audience – just use keywords, emotions, or phrases you know your target audience relates to.\n\n![Arrow](/public/images/bsg/think.svg)\n\n##### Think Big Picture\n\nWhen you’re choosing a domain name, keep the big picture in mind. Remember, it’s the website your brand will be connected to for many years and possibly forever. So, avoid focusing on short-term aims, fleeting trends, or narrow ideas. Your domain name should be chosen with growth and transformation in mind – after all, you want it to work for your business in ten years as well as tomorrow. This longevity mindset is the reason our domain name generator provides some name ideas that are abstract and creative.\n\n![Arrow](/public/images/bsg/danger.svg)\n\n##### Know The Domain Name Danger Zones\n\nWhen coming up with a domain name, avoid words and phrases that are difficult to say, hard to spell, or too long. Unique, memorable, captivating domain ideas are a great way to get noticed, be remembered, and create buzz through word of mouth. The last thing you want is a domain name that doesn’t create an amazing first impression or needs a long explanation.\n\n![Arrow](/public/images/bsg/brain.svg)\n\n##### Start Brainstorming Domains\n\nChoosing a domain name is a team sport. Brainstorming with a group is a great way to get ideas flowing. You and your team should work together, test out even your worst domain name ideas, and try to brainstorm as many catchy concepts as you can before landing on a final domain. This trick also works for choosing the phrases, emotions, keywords, and industries close to your own to enter into our domain name generator. You should also consider [exploring premium domains](/premium-domains-for-sale) to find the perfect option.\n\n![Arrow](/public/images/bsg/chat.svg)\n\n##### Test Your Name Ideas\n\nDomain validation is often overlooked when coming up with business names and URLs or domains - Use audience testing and trademark support to avoid this common issue. Feedback from real people on your domain ideas, as well as trademark support, helps you find catchy, memorable, one-of-a-kind domains that appeal to your target audience. Plus you’ll avoid the cease and desist letter that could stop your business dead in its tracks.\n\n## Over 166,533 Unique Domain Name Suggestions\n\nThese examples of short, catchy, one-word, color, cute business names, and more, are real business names created by our content community for our 50,000+ clients.

Discover what it means to care about your brand and domain name, and what might happen if you don’t.\n\nCare\n\n####  ![Arrow](/public/images/bsg/check.svg) Contextual \n\nYour domain name should be closely related to your brand but doesn’t necessarily need to be an exact match. Changing a great brand name just so you can get an exact match domain could weaken a brand, and domains that aren’t an exact match can even add context to your brand. Just make sure anything added in your website name isn’t a distraction. Good examples of contextually helpful domain names include Sandalsholidays.com and Sandalsresorts.com, Teslamotors.com, and Dropbox’s original URL, getdropbox.com. The most important rules? Be original and keep things relevant.\n\n####  ![Arrow](/public/images/bsg/check.svg) Appealing \n\nWhen selecting a domain name there’s a lot of pressure to seem edgy and new. But being memorable and appealing is more important. Think about how a domain, particularly a multi-word one, could be read (therapistdirectory.com, for example, could be a directory of therapists… or it could be misconstrued entirely). Domain names with positive connotations are particularly effective for boosting a brand – that’s why generating domain ideas by emotion can work really well.\n\n####  ![Arrow](/public/images/bsg/check.svg) Remarkable \n\nA unique domain name that fits well with an equally unique brand name can mean the difference between a successful brand and an average brand. Your domain doesn’t need to be something crazy, in fact, it probably shouldn’t be if you want it to be remembered, but a one-of-a-kind domain name that sets you apart from any other business in the same space is important. Running basic URL and trademark checks on domains similar to those on your shortlist as well as exact matches is a good idea for this reason.\n\n####  ![Arrow](/public/images/bsg/check.svg) Evocative \n\nAs a rule, you should choose a domain name that is emotional, experiential, descriptive, elegant, or witty. Attaching to the emotions of your desired customer base is a great way to be remembered. Whatever you choose, your brand and its domain name should inspire a potent response from your target audience - an emotional reaction or a unique idea relevant to your brand that helps the name stick in the consumers’ minds.\n\nDon't\n\n####  ![Arrow](/public/images/bsg/close.svg) Difficult \n\nBefore finalizing your domain name, make sure it’s easy to pronounce and spell. It should be easy to pronounce in most common accents in the places you intend to launch, and even a misspelling should be clear and easy.\n\n####  ![Arrow](/public/images/bsg/close.svg) Obscure \n\nEveryone wants to be different. But if your domain name is too different, it slips towards obscurity. Sure, you might have used a thesaurus for brainstorming, but if you had no idea at all what the words meant before you stuck them together to create an original website name your audience probably won’t either! This will alienate your audience and they’ll soon lose interest, if they can remember the domain name at all that is.\n\n####  ![Arrow](/public/images/bsg/close.svg) Neutral \n\nYour domain name shouldn’t be too safe or boring, either. Yes, it’s a balancing act! That’s why using tools like the Atom Domain name generator is so necessary. While you don’t want to choose a website name that’s too abstract, you also want your name to stir up excitement among consumers.\n\n####  ![Arrow](/public/images/bsg/close.svg) Taken \n\nShould you take your site name’s trademark and URL seriously? Checking for Trademark issues and URL availability before signing anything or beginning a marketing push can save you significant legal trouble in the future and avoid PR snafus.\n\n## Business Name

If you wish to supplement our tool with a manual process, here’s how to find a name for your company that fits your brand and industry.\n\n![Arrow](/public/images/bsg/foundation.svg)\n\n##### Set The Foundation\n\nWhen looking for that perfect YouTube channel name, you should begin by exploring the values, ideas, and key concepts you'd like your channel to capture. Writing down these general concepts lets you build off of them to create exceptional channel name ideas unique to what you do, whether you're using a name generator or not.\n\n![Arrow](/public/images/bsg/audience.svg)\n\n##### Know Your Audience\n\nA YouTube channel name should be designed to appeal to your target audience and their interests. Your final channel name should resonate deeply with your viewers, as they’ll decide whether to subscribe and engage with your content. Our YouTube channel name generator is a great tool for finding fresh name ideas that align with your audience.\n\n![Arrow](/public/images/bsg/think.svg)\n\n##### Think Big Picture\n\nIf you want your YouTube channel to thrive for years to come, you need to consider the big picture. Long-term goals are an important factor when naming a channel. Don’t go for names that work for now, think about names that will work forever. A good channel name is built for growth. What could yours be in ten years' time? Our [catchy name generator](https://www.atom.com/business-name-generator) provides a selection of name ideas that are abstract, emotive, and not tied to a specific niche, making them perfect for evolving content as your business and channel grows.\n\n![Arrow](/public/images/bsg/danger.svg)\n\n##### Know The Danger Zones\n\nWhen coming up with a YouTube channel name, avoid ideas that are difficult to say, hard to spell, or so long they lose your audience's attention. Unique, memorable, but simple name ideas are a great way to build your channel's brand right from the start. Avoid channel names that aren't immediately captivating and clear – there might be a good story behind a name idea, but if you have to explain it, it won't work.\n\n![Arrow](/public/images/bsg/brain.svg)\n\n##### Start Brainstorming Domains\n\nWhen naming your YouTube channel, begin by brainstorming with your team or friends. You can also involve people who are familiar with your content niche to get more ideas flowing. This is your chance to become YouTube channel name innovators! Brainstorm as many catchy channel name ideas as you can before narrowing them down. For inspiration or to save time, consider exploring [domain ideas](https://www.atom.com/domain-name-generator) to find the perfect option.\n\n![Arrow](/public/images/bsg/chat.svg)\n\n##### Test Your Name Ideas\n\nTesting and validating a new YouTube channel name is a key part of the process, but it's often overlooked. Use audience feedback and research to avoid issues down the line. Validation provides feedback from real people within your target audience about your channel name ideas. It's also important to check for any potential trademark conflicts and ensure the availability of the associated URL, so you can establish your channel with confidence.\n\n## Over 166,533 Unique Name Suggestions\n\nThese examples of short, catchy, one-word, color, cute business names, and more, are real business names created by our content community for our 50,000+ clients.

Care or Don't checklist. Discover what it means to care about your brand and channel name, and what might happen if you don't.\n\nCare\n\n####  ![Arrow](/public/images/bsg/check.svg) Contextual \n\nYour YouTube channel name should give your brand context. Some channel names are part of a brand story (e.g., \"Epic Meal Time\"), while others set the tone and niche of the channel (e.g., \"TechGuru\"). Whatever route you choose, don't be generic!\n\n####  ![Arrow](/public/images/bsg/check.svg) Appealing \n\nWhen selecting a YouTube channel name, it's easy to get distracted by trying to sound edgy, unique, and attention-grabbing. But being edgy without substance makes a name forgettable, or worse, difficult to say or spell. Avoid leaning too hard into trends or gimmicks.\n\n####  ![Arrow](/public/images/bsg/check.svg) Remarkable \n\nA unique YouTube channel name can be the difference between a successful channel and one that goes unnoticed. Your name doesn't have to be a radical departure from existing channel names, but it should set you apart from other channels in your niche.\n\n####  ![Arrow](/public/images/bsg/check.svg) Evocative \n\nEmotional, experiential, descriptive, elegant, and fun channel names are all evocative options. A YouTube channel name should inspire a strong connection with your target audience, creating an emotional reaction or leaving a unique image in their minds that they won't easily forget.\n\nDon't\n\n####  ![Arrow](/public/images/bsg/close.svg) Difficult \n\nBefore settling on your YouTube channel name, make sure that it's not tough to pronounce or spell. A name that sounds weird or is often misspelled will confuse your audience, and they'll forget it in minutes.\n\n####  ![Arrow](/public/images/bsg/close.svg) Obscure \n\nExotic or abstract YouTube channel names can be tempting. They imply exclusivity and creativity. But if your name isn't understood by your audience, they won't connect with it or remember it.\n\n####  ![Arrow](/public/images/bsg/close.svg) Neutral \n\nYour YouTube channel name shouldn't be too safe or boring, either. While you don't want to choose a name that's wildly offbeat and confusing, you also want your name to create excitement and positive feelings about your channel for viewers.\n\n####  ![Arrow](/public/images/bsg/close.svg) Taken \n\nShould you take your YouTube channel name's trademark and associated URL seriously? No question, yes. Checking for trademark issues and URL availability before you decide on and announce your channel name may well save you from legal trouble in the future and help your channel's reputation grow quickly.\n\n## Business Name Ideas By Industry\n\n![Arrow](/public/images/bsg/planet.svg)\n\n### Technology & Internet\n\n[Bots & AI](/business-name-generator/ai) [Cryptocurrency,

Discover potential trademark issues before they can cause problems!\n\n## What is Included in Atom's Free Trademark Search?\n\nAtom's Free Trademark Search does much more than just searching the USPTO or repackaging their Trademark Electronic Search System (TESS). We go further than anyone else – almost literally – to help you choose a business or product name that's less likely to get you in hot water later. Specifically, we (virtually) visit the UK, Canada, Europe, and Australia to check for both exact and close match names. \n\nThese intelligent close-match trademark checks mean you can make an informed decision about whether a name is unique enough to build your brand around, as well as get some idea of whether or not that name is available. Carrying out as much trademark research as possible and filing your own trademarks is always advisable when launching something new, so why not start with the most complete free search on the web?\n\n## How to Conduct a Free Trademark Search with Atom\n\nStep 1 - Find a Name \n\nCome up with a great name or a shortlist of names you're excited about. Search Atom's hand-picked selection of names today, use our [agency naming services](https://www.atom.com/), or our free business name generator.\n\nStep 2 - Use Our Free Trademark Search Tool \n\nEnter the name you've got your eye on and get instant results. You'll receive a list of businesses in the US, UK, EU, or Canada have the same or similar names trademarked, as well as who owns them and whether or not the trademarks are live or pending.\n\nStep 3 - Review results for conflict\n\nCheck the results from our Free Trademark Search carefully. You may find exact or close match names with a trademark attached that are used in a totally different field from your business. In some cases, this won't be a problem, but you should still conduct further research. You might also find names that are similar to yours within your own industry. Whenever possible, you should file a trademark for your new business name and any other brand assets to make sure someone else doesn't use them in the future. You can do this through Atom, as well as researching your top names or brand assets to find out which is safest from a legal point of view.\n\nStep 4 - Get a Trademark Report & File Your Trademark \n\nOrdering a Trademark Report on your favorite name or names is a great way to help avoid legal issues in the future. Our trademark reports are carried out by Trademark Attorneys and include a detailed analysis of Trademark availability and potential as well as a safety score. If you choose a filing package, your personal Trademark Attorney will walk you through Trademark Research, understanding your reports, and filing and being awarded your Trademark. It's a soup-to-nuts solution for protecting your brand assets as much as possible when launching a new business or product.\n\n## Atom Trademark Services\n\nOver 40,000 happy Atom clients have used our services, including large enterprises.

Choose a brand identity bundle, or run a competition for a logo or tagline after you've secured your name.\n\n[Build Your Brand Identity ](/brand-identity-design)\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat is a trademark? \n\nA trademark is a distinctive sign, symbol, word, phrase, design, or combination of these elements that identifies and distinguishes the goods or services of one party from those of others. It serves as a source identifier, allowing consumers to associate specific products or services with a particular company or brand. Trademarks are essential for brand protection and play a crucial role in establishing brand recognition and goodwill in the marketplace. Trademarks are usually industry-specific, so if someone in the same industry as you or a related industry has trademarked a name, phrase, or logo, and you use the same or a similar name, phrase, or logo, you're likely to face legal issues.\n\nWhat is a free trademark search? \n\nA free trademark search allows you to check if a particular trademark is already registered or pending registration. This search helps determine whether a name you love is available for use without conflicting with existing registered trademarks or pending applications. While most free trademark checks are very limited, using only the USPTO's TESS search, Atom's searches several international databases.\n\nWhat other trademark services does Atom offer? \n\nAtom offers: \n\n  * Trademark Research\n  * Trademark Consultations\n  * Trademark Filing\n\n\n\nResearching trademarks means receiving a full report on the names you're interested in, including a safety score. Trademark consultations are a phone call with an expert to discuss the legality of filing a trademark for a certain name, tagline, or logo, as well as other options you might have, and filing means a Atom-associated lawyer will apply for a trademark for you and even send cease and desist letters for the first year after you've received your trademark. Finally, you can choose a Trademark bundle from Atom. This includes a steep discount for research followed by filing.\n\nWhy is it important to conduct a trademark search? \n\nA trademark search helps ensure that the proposed trademark does not infringe on the rights of an existing trademark holder. Using an already registered or similar mark can lead to legal disputes and financial penalties. Once you've carried out a free trademark search, you can either file for a new trademark yourself or use our Trademark Filing Package to make as sure as possible the brand asset you want to protect is available and then file for it.\n\nWhat are the benefits of conducting a trademark search? \n\nConducting a trademark search offers several benefits, such as: \n\n  * Identify Conflicting Marks: It helps you identify existing trademarks that might be similar or identical to your proposed mark. This allows you to avoid potential infringement issues.\n  * Legal Protection: By conducting a search and ensuring your trademark is available for use, you can proceed with the registration process, gaining legal protection and exclusive rights to your mark.\n  * Brand Reputation: A strong, unique trademark enhances your brand's reputation and makes it easier for consumers to identify and remember your products or services.\n\n\n\nWhat are the consequences of not conducting a trademark search? \n\nFailing to conduct a trademark search can have several negative consequences: \n\n  * Infringement Lawsuits: If your proposed trademark conflicts with an existing registered mark, you may face legal action from the trademark owner, leading to costly legal battles and potential damages.\n  * Rebranding Costs: Discovering a conflict after investing in branding and marketing efforts can force you to rebrand, incurring additional expenses.\n  * Loss of Customers: A trademark conflict could lead to confusion among consumers, causing them to choose a competitor's product over yours.\n\n\n\nAre there any limitations to a free trademark search? \n\nAlthough there are some limitations to free trademark searches, Atom's is one of the most complete available. By searching both US and international databases and including intelligent close-match names, we offer you the best chance possible of finding any competitors using a similar name to your own. For more complete information and protection, consider a Trademark Consultation, Trademark Research Package, or Trademark Filing Package.\n\nWhat is trademark infringement? \n\nTrademark infringement occurs when someone uses a trademark that is identical or confusingly similar to a registered trademark in connection with similar goods or services. This unauthorized use can mislead consumers into believing that the infringing products or services are associated with or endorsed by the rightful trademark owner. Trademark infringement violates the exclusive rights of the registered trademark owner and can lead to legal action.\n\nHow can I avoid trademark infringement? \n\nAvoid Trademark infringement by carrying out a free trademark search, consulting a Trademark Attorney about potential trademark infringement, and filing for Trademark registration when you launch a new business, brand, or product. You should also consider potential Trademark issues when rebranding.\n\nWhat is trademark registration? \n\nTrademark registration is the process of formally filing a trademark application with the appropriate government agency (such as the United States Patent and Trademark Office in the US or the European Union Intellectual Property Office in the EU). The purpose of registration is to obtain legal protection and exclusive rights to use the trademark for the specific goods or services listed in the application. Trademark registration provides valuable benefits, including the ability to enforce the trademark against infringers, use the ® symbol, and establish a stronger legal position in case of disputes.\n\nPopular searches [Tech](https://www.atom.com/premium-domains-for-sale/for/technology) [Clothing](https://www.atom.com/premium-domains-for-sale/for/fashion-clothing) [Finance](https://www.atom.com/premium-domains-for-sale/for/finance) [Real Estate](https://www.atom.com/premium-domains-for-sale/for/real-estate) [Crypto](https://www.atom.com/premium-domains-for-sale/for/cryptocurrency-blockchain) [Short](https://www.atom.com/premium-domains-for-sale/all/length/Short) [One Word](https://www.atom.com/premium-domains-for-sale/all/type_of_name/One%20Word)\n\nCopyright © 2024 Atom.com [Consent Preferences](#)\n\n[ **Excellent** Trustpilot **4.6/ 5 ** based on  486 ratings ](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/atom.com)\n\n[](https://www.facebook.com/atomdotcom) [](https://twitter.com/squadhelp) [](https://www.instagram.com/workwithatom/) [](https://www.linkedin.com/company/atomdotcom/) [](https://www.youtube.com/@atomdotcom)\n"

Our powerful AI allows you to search by industry, keywords, brand ideas, and more. Select from hand-curated name suggestions to find the perfect brand name quickly. Atom offers the only name generator created by real branding experts -- a team that has worked with Nestle, Dell, Pepsi, Nuskin, and 50,000 other amazing entrepreneurs and innovators. \n\nHow is this brand name generator different from others? \n\nSeveral business name generators are fast, free, and simple to use. Atom'sname generator uses our powerful AI-technology that provides you access to thousands of relevant name ideas that relate to your specific industry. Whether you want a name based on a specific idea, concept, or emotion, our name generator can provide thousands of suitable name suggestions instantly. Atom is the World’s #1 Naming Platform, and our name suggestions are hand-curated by branding experts. \n\nHow do I create unique and catchy business names? \n\nUnique names come from doing something different from other brands, especially in your industry. But when it comes time to select the perfect name, choose something outside the box. If everyone else in your industry uses a classic name (such as in the real estate or consulting industry), then consider something modern. When the industry standard is a modern name (tech startups), perhaps consider something playful or classic. A name that would feel standard in one industry will often come across as very unique in another. \n\nWhat are the best famous brand names? \n\nSome favorite enterprise names picked by Squadhelps internal team of branding express for your inspiration: \n\n  * Urban Decay\n  * Slack\n  * SnapChat\n  * PayPal\n  * Dollar Shave Club\n  * Warby Parker\n  * Accenture\n  * Apple\n  * eBay\n  * Google\n  * MailChimp\n  * Etsy\n  * Shopify\n  * Redfin\n  * Skull Candy\n  * Hulu\n  * Xerox\n  * Netflix\n  * The Honest Company\n  * Burt’s Bees\n\n\n\nHow do I come up with a catchy business name? \n\nYou might want to work off some concepts that are important to your business, or even specific keywords that are important to your company’s vision. From there, there are plenty of techniques you can use to brainstorm names - do you know the difference between a compound and a this and that name? Check out our Ultimate Guide to Naming Your Business to learn more! \n\nHow do I name my small business? \n\nAt Atom, we believe that finding the perfect business name is all about defining your brand, and choosing a tone. If you need help, you can check out our business name generator or search our names database by industry. \n\nHow do I find a unique business name? \n\nComing up with a unique business name can be tough. You can use some of our naming strategies to help generate business name ideas, and once you have a shortlist we offer comprehensive tools to check Trademark conflicts. \n\nHow do I choose a good business name? \n\nWhen it comes to choosing a good name, the golden rule is Context, Functionality, and Memorability: For context, it’s important to decide whether or not a specific name fits the style of your brand and truly captures your brand’s essence. If your brand is more modest and contemporary, a fun and playful name may not be the route to go. When we speak about functionality, this relates to the idea that a name should be easy to say, spell, and remember. Lastly, memorability is vital. Having a sticky brand can be the deciding factor between success and failure. \n\n### Got Questions?\n\nSpeak with an Atom platform expert to learn more and get your questions answered.\n\nSchedule Consultation\n\n  * [ (877) 355-3585 ](tel:1-877-355-3585)\n  * [ Live Chat ](javascript:Intercom\\('show'\\);)\n  * Contact Us \n\n\n\n### Find The Perfect Brand Name Today!\n\n[ Explore Names for Sale ](/premium-domains-for-sale/all) or [ I want a Custom Name ](/start-contest)\n\n### Why Atom.com?\n\n#### Disrupting The Traditional Agency Model\n\nAtom.com is reimagining how naming is done, providing fast, affordable, high-quality, soup-to-nuts solutions unlike anyone else.\n\n#### Satisfaction Guarantee\n\nWe have policies in place to ensure that you are satisfied with your experience.\n\n[Contest Policies](https://helpdesk.atom.com/en/articles/115621-refund-policy) [Marketplace Policies](https://helpdesk.atom.com/en/articles/2131996-domain-marketplace-terms-conditions-for-buyers)\n\nPopular searches [Tech](https://www.atom.com/premium-domains-for-sale/for/technology) [Clothing](https://www.atom.com/premium-domains-for-sale/for/fashion-clothing) [Finance](https://www.atom.com/premium-domains-for-sale/for/finance) [Real Estate](https://www.atom.com/premium-domains-for-sale/for/real-estate) [Crypto](https://www.atom.com/premium-domains-for-sale/for/cryptocurrency-blockchain) [Short](https://www.atom.com/premium-domains-for-sale/all/length/Short) [One Word](https://www.atom.com/premium-domains-for-sale/all/type_of_name/One%20Word)\n\nPopular searches [Tech](https://www.atom.com/premium-domains-for-sale/for/technology) [Clothing](https://www.atom.com/premium-domains-for-sale/for/fashion-clothing) [Finance](https://www.atom.com/premium-domains-for-sale/for/finance) [Real Estate](https://www.atom.com/premium-domains-for-sale/for/real-estate) [Crypto](https://www.atom.com/premium-domains-for-sale/for/cryptocurrency-blockchain) [Short](https://www.atom.com/premium-domains-for-sale/all/length/Short) [One Word](https://www.atom.com/premium-domains-for-sale/all/type_of_name/One%20Word)\n\nCopyright © 2024 Atom.com [Consent Preferences](#)\n\n[ **Excellent** Trustpilot **4.6/ 5 ** based on  486 ratings ](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/atom.com)\n\n[](https://www.facebook.com/atomdotcom) [](https://twitter.com/squadhelp) [](https://www.instagram.com/workwithatom/) [](https://www.linkedin.com/company/atomdotcom/) [](https://www.youtube.com/@atomdotcom)\n"

As a seller in the Domain Auctions Community, you can bid (and win!) in both as well as submitting domains for listing. The buying public can also bid in Public Auction Events, opening them up to a wide audience so domains sell fast!\n\n![Logo](/modules/static/assets/images/connect/logo.svg)\n\n### Public Auction Events\n\n  * Our regular Public Auction Events feature high-quality, unique domains. \n  * They’re built around a theme such as short domains, one-word domains, or .ai extensions, but there’s always room for great brandable domains of all kinds! \n  * Open to the public, these auctions showcase community submissions, with added visibility through paid advertising \n  * Some of the domains included in this type of auction will have a reserve price. \n\n\n\n![Two men are sitting at a table looking at a laptop .](/public/images/domain_auctions/Themed_auctions.png)\n\n![Two men are sitting at a table looking at a laptop .](/public/images/domain_auctions/Expiring_Domain_Auctions.png)\n\n![Logo](/modules/static/assets/images/connect/logo.svg)\n\n### Wholesale Liquidation Auctions\n\n  * These auctions will feature both Atom.com domains and domains submitted by the Domain Auctions community. \n  * They're built on an innovative forward and reverse-auction system, with prices rising just like a standard auction when there's interest, but dropping daily when there are no bids. \n  * We designed this model to maximize value and help every domain sell for the right price. \n  * Wholesale Liquidation Auctions offer a chance to submit any domain you no longer want in your portfolio and make back some of your investment. They’re a particularly good choice for domains that are expiring soon. \n  * Our unique forward and reverse auction style to get the most out of domains you want to liquidate and get great domains at the right price \n  * Wholesale Liquidation Auctions start at $50 and have no reserve price. \n  * The person with the highest bid will win the auction. \n  * **Or** , if no bids are received, the price drops by $10 every day until it hits $10. \n\n\n\n![](/modules/static/assets/images/connect/WLM_2.jpg)\n\n![logo](/modules/static/assets/images/connect/logo.svg)\n\n### How Do I Get Started?\n\nApply now to become a member of the Atom Auctions community. \n\n  * **1** If you’re already an Atom seller, simply sign in and apply.\n  * **2** If you do not yet have an Atom.com account, you will need to signup and provide information about your domain portfolio alongside your application.

They will also include great, brandable domains of all kinds! Atom Auction members can submit and bid on domains, and the general public can also bid. You will see bidding increments for each auction. Bidding increments are based on the current highest bid (for example, a domain with a high bid of $75 might have an increment of $5, where a domain with a high bid of $10,000 would have increments of $100.) You can bid any amount, but you will only pay one increment above the second-highest bid. These auctions may have a reserve price. \n\nHow do Wholesale Liquidation Auctions Work? \n\nWholesale Liquidation Auctions will start at $50, they will have no reserve price, and the person with the highest bid will win the auction. You will see bidding increments for each auction. Bidding increments are based on the current highest bid (for example, a domain with a high bid of $75 might have increments of $5, where a domain with a high bid of $10,000 would have increments of $100.) You can bid any amount, but you will only pay one increment above the second-highest bid. If no bids are received, the price will drop daily. Wholesale Liquidation Auctions are only open to investors who are part of the Atom Auction Community. \n\nHow do I view actions? \n\nOnce approved you will have access to the Auctions Marketplace (coming soon) where you can search by for domains by keyword, industry, and more. \n\nWhat domains can I submit? \n\nYou can submit any domain domain you want to liquidate to Wholesale Liquidation Auctions. For Public Auction Events, submitted domains must be high quality and brandable, with submissions that match upcoming themes particularly welcome. \n\nWhat happens to marketplace listings for domains included in auctions? \n\nDuring auctions any domains listed that are also listed on the Premium Marketplace will remain there. If you win a domain currently listed on the Atom.com marketplace it moves to your ownership but will remain on the marketplace unless you take it down. \n\nWhat happens when I win an auction? \n\nIf you are the winner of an Atom.com auction, you will immediately recieve an email notifying you of your win. You can then go to the domain auctions page and submit payment. You have 72 hours from the time of winning to submit your payment. If you do not submit payment within this timeframe, you will not longer be able to purchase the domain, and the next highest bidder will become the winner. Once payment is submitted, our team will work with you to complete the transfer of the domain to your ownership. \n\nWhat happens if a winning bidder fails to pay? \n\nPlacing a winning bid and not completing the payment is a direct violation of our policies. If a winning bidder doesn't pay for their domain within 48 hours, the auction is void and the domain remains with its current owner.
