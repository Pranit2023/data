Reports Third Quarter 2024 Net Income of $23.0 Million, or $0.50 per Diluted Share\n\nOctober 16, 2024\n\n[ Download (opens in new window) ](//s201.q4cdn.com/147450493/files/doc_news/2024/10/OSBC-Earnings-Release-Q3-2024-EX-99-1-and-EX-99-2.pdf)\n\n**AURORA, IL / ACCESSWIRE / October 16, 2024 /** Old Second Bancorp, Inc. (the \"Company,\" \"Old Second,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" and \"our\") (NASDAQ:OSBC), the parent company of Old Second National Bank (the \"Bank\"), today announced financial results for the third quarter of 2024. Our net income was $23.0 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to net income of $21.9 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2024, and net income of $24.3 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted net income, a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes certain nonrecurring items, as applicable, was $23.3 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $21.0 million, or $0.46 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2024, and $24.8 million, or $0.55 per share, for the third quarter of 2023. Adjusting items impacting the third quarter of 2024 included $471,000 of transaction-related expenses due to the pending purchase of five branches from First Merchants Bank (\"FRME\"), which is expected to close near year-end 2024. The adjusting item impacting the second quarter of 2024 was an $893,000 death benefit related to BOLI; the adjusting item impacting the third quarter of 2023 results included $629,000 of deconversion and liquidation costs from the 2022 sale of our Visa credit card portfolio. See the discussion entitled \"Non-GAAP Presentations\" below and in the tables in the full earnings release found at [www.oldsecond.com](https://pr.report/3l48), under the investor relations tab, that provide a reconciliation of each non-GAAP measure to the most comparable GAAP equivalent.\n\nNet income increased $1.1 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024. The increase was primarily due to a $1.8 million decrease in provision for credit losses. Credit quality stabilized this quarter and we recorded net recoveries of $155,000, compared to net charge-offs of $5.8 million in the second quarter of 2024, and $6.6 million in the prior year like quarter. In addition, net interest and dividend income increased $888,000 in the third quarter of 2024, compared to the prior linked quarter, and a $399,000 decrease in provision for income taxes was recorded, partially offset by a $546,000 decrease in noninterest income and a $1.4 million increase in noninterest expense. Net income decreased $1.4 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to a decrease in net interest income of $2.5 million year over year driven by a $4.3 million increase to interest expense as a result of higher interest rates offered on deposits, partially offset by a $1.8 million increase in interest and dividend income.\n\n**Operating Results**\n\n  * Third quarter 2024 net income was $23.0 million, reflecting a $1.1 million increase from the second quarter of 2024, and a decrease of $1.4 million from the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted net income, as defined above, was $23.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $2.3 million from adjusted net income for the second quarter of 2024, and a decrease of $1.5 million from adjusted net income for the third quarter of 2023.\n\n  * Net interest and dividend income was $60.6 million for the third quarter of 2024, reflecting an increase of $888,000, or 1.5%, from the second quarter of 2024, and a decrease of $2.5 million, or 3.9%, from the third quarter of 2023.\n\n  * We recorded a net provision for credit losses of $2.0 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to a net provision for credit losses of $3.8 million in the second quarter of 2024, and a net provision for credit losses of $3.0 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n  * Noninterest income was $10.6 million for the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of $546,000, or 4.9%, compared to $11.1 million for the second quarter of 2024, and an increase of $704,000, or 7.1%, compared to $9.9 million for the third quarter of 2023. A $12,000 adjustment to the death benefit on a BOLI contract was recorded in the third quarter of 2024; the majority of these proceeds were received in the second quarter of 2024. Also, a $1,000 loss on the call of a security was recorded in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $924,000 of securities losses, net, recorded in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n  * Noninterest expense was $39.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $1.4 million, or 3.8%, compared to $37.9 million for the second quarter of 2024, and an increase of $1.9 million, or 5.0%, compared to $37.4 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n\n  * We had a provision for income tax of $6.9 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to a provision for income tax of $7.3 million for the second quarter of 2024 and a provision of $8.1 million for the third quarter of 2023. The effective tax rate for each of the periods presented was 23.1%, 25.0%, and 25.1%, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2024 reflects the new state ruling regarding tax rate apportionment factors related to income generated from securities or loans originated in other states.\n\n  * On October 15, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.06 per share of common stock, payable on November 4, 2024, to stockholders of record as of October 25, 2024.\n\n\n\n\n**_Financial Highlights_**\n\n**Quarters Ended**  \n---  \n**(Dollars in thousands)**| **September 30,**| **June 30,**| **September 30,**  \n**2024**| **2024**| **2023**  \n**Balance sheet summary**  \nTotal assets| $| 5,671,760| $| 5,662,700| $| 5,758,156  \nTotal securities available-for-sale| 1,190,854| 1,173,661| 1,229,618  \nTotal loans| 3,991,078| 3,976,595| 4,029,543  \nTotal deposits| 4,465,424| 4,521,728| 4,614,320  \nTotal liabilities| 5,010,370| 5,043,365| 5,225,598  \nTotal equity| 661,390| 619,335| 532,558  \nTotal tangible assets| $| 5,575,789| $| 5,566,159| $| 5,659,858  \nTotal tangible equity| 565,419| 522,794| 434,260  \n**Income statement summary**  \nNet interest income| $| 60,578| $| 59,690| $| 63,030  \nProvision for credit losses| 2,000| 3,750| 3,000  \nNoninterest income| 10,581| 11,127| 9,877  \nNoninterest expense| 39,308| 37,877| 37,423  \nNet income| 22,951| 21,891| 24,335  \nEffective tax rate| 23.11| %| 25.01| %| 25.09| %  \n**Profitability ratios**  \nReturn on average assets (ROAA)| 1.63| %| 1.57| %| 1.67| %  \nReturn on average equity (ROAE)| 14.29| 14.55| 18.21  \nNet interest margin (tax-equivalent)| 4.64| 4.63| 4.66  \nEfficiency ratio| 53.38| 53.29| 50.08  \nReturn on average tangible common equity (ROATCE) 1| 17.14| 17.66| 22.80  \nTangible common equity to tangible assets (TCE/TA)| 10.14| 9.39| 7.67  \n**Per share data**  \nDiluted earnings per share| $| 0.50| $| 0.48| $| 0.54  \nTangible book value per share| 12.61| 11.66| 9.72  \n**Company capital ratios 2**  \nCommon equity tier 1 capital ratio| 12.86| %| 12.41| %| 11.00| %  \nTier 1 risk-based capital ratio| 13.39| 12.94| 11.52  \nTotal risk-based capital ratio| 15.62| 15.12| 13.84  \nTier 1 leverage ratio| 11.38| 10.96| 9.62  \n**Bank capital ratios 2, 3**  \nCommon equity tier 1 capital ratio| 13.49| %| 13.50| %| 12.49| %  \nTier 1 risk-based capital ratio| 13.49| 13.50| 12.49  \nTotal risk-based capital ratio| 14.45| 14.42| 13.57  \nTier 1 leverage ratio| 11.46| 11.43| 10.43  \n  \n _1 See the discussion entitled \"Non-GAAP Presentations\" below and the table on page 18 that provides a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP equivalent._\n\n_2 Both the Company and the Bank ratios are inclusive of a capital conservation buffer of 2.50%, and both are subject to the minimum capital adequacy guidelines of 7.00%, 8.50%, 10.50%, and 4.00% for the Common equity tier 1, Tier 1 risk-based, Total risk-based and Tier 1 leverage ratios, respectively_.\n\n_3 The prompt corrective action provisions are applicable only at the Bank level, and are 6.50%, 8.00%, 10.00%, and 5.00% for the Common equity tier 1, Tier 1 risk-based, Total risk-based and Tier 1 leverage ratios, respectively_.\n\nChairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Jim Eccher said \"Old Second reported strong results in the third quarter of 2024 with exceptional profitability and positive trends in a number of verticals. Tangible book value per share increased by more than thirty percent on both a year over year and linked quarter annualized basis. Problem loan levels are continuing to trend in the right direction and we remain pleased with the progress thus far in resolving a number of loans identified in prior periods despite ongoing stress in a number of real estate focused lending verticals. On an overall basis, Old Second continues to perform exceptionally well with peer-leading performance in our net interest margin and profitability. Third quarter return on average assets and return on average tangible common equity were 1.63% and 17.14%, respectively, the net interest margin was stable at 4.64% and the efficiency ratio is a very healthy 53.38%. This strong bottom-line performance and a well-positioned balance sheet drove an increase in the tangible common equity capital ratio to 10.14% from 9.39% last quarter. In light of the strength of the balance sheet and resilient income statement trends, Old Second elected in the fourth quarter of 2024 to increase the common dividend by 20%, and we will strive to continue to regularly deliver dividend growth commensurate with the strength and growth of the bank. In summary, we are proud of the sustainability of our performance this year and believe we are well positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities that may come our way in the near future.\"\n\n**_Asset Quality & Earning Assets_**\n\n  * Nonperforming loans, comprised of nonaccrual loans plus loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing, totaled $52.3 million at September 30, 2024, $46.9 million at June 30, 2024, and $63.3 million at September 30, 2023. Nonperforming loans, as a percent of total loans, were 1.3% at September 30, 2024, 1.2% at June 30, 2024, and 1.6% at September 30, 2023. The increase in the third quarter of 2024 is driven by inflows of $18.7 million, $13.8 million of which was from one commercial relationship. These inflows were partially offset by $13.3 million of outflows. Nonaccrual loans had $8.5 million of outflows, which consists of $6.2 million paid off, $1.3 million transferred to OREO, $912,000 of partial principal reductions from payments, and $99,000 was charged-off. Outflows for loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing were $4.8 million, due to a loan which paid off.\n\n  * Total loans were $3.99 billion at September 30, 2024, reflecting an increase of $14.5 million compared to June 30, 2024, and a decrease of $38.5 million compared to September 30, 2023. The decrease year over year was largely driven by the declines in commercial, commercial real estate-investor and residential real estate-owner occupied portfolios. Average loans (including loans held-for-sale) for the third quarter of 2024 totaled $3.97 billion, reflecting an increase of $8.2 million from the second quarter of 2024 and a decrease of $44.1 million from the third quarter of 2023.\n\n  * Available-for-sale securities totaled $1.19 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to $1.17 billion at June 30, 2024 and $1.23 billion at September 30, 2023. The unrealized mark to market loss on securities totaled $56.2 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $82.6 million as of June 30, 2024, and $120.5 million as of September 30, 2023, due to market interest rate fluctuations as well as changes year over year in the composition of the securities portfolio. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we had security purchases of $22.7 million, and security calls and paydowns of $31.3 million, compared to security purchases of $142.2 million, security maturities of $95.0 million, and paydowns of $44.0 million during the quarter ended June 30, 2024. During the quarter ended September 30, 2023, we had no security purchases, $30.5 million of security paydowns, calls and maturities, and security sales of $65.6 million, which resulted in net realized losses of $924,000. We may continue to buy and sell strategically identified securities as opportunities arise.\n\n\n\n\n**_Non-GAAP Presentations_**\n\nManagement has disclosed in this earnings release certain non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate and measure our performance, including the presentation of adjusted net income, net interest income and net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis, and our efficiency ratio calculations on a taxable equivalent basis. The net interest margin fully taxable equivalent is calculated by dividing net interest income on a tax equivalent basis by average earning assets for the period. Consistent with industry practice, management has disclosed the efficiency ratio including and excluding certain items, which is discussed in the noninterest expense presentation on page 7 of the full earnings release found at [www.oldsecond.com](https://pr.report/3l49), under the investor relations tab.\n\nWe consider the use of select non-GAAP financial measures and ratios to be useful for financial and operational decision making and useful in evaluating period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain expenditures or assets that we believe are not indicative of our primary business operating results or by presenting certain metrics on a fully taxable equivalent basis. We believe these measures provide investors with information regarding balance sheet profitability, and we believe that management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, analyzing, and comparing past, present and future periods.\n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for GAAP financial measures, and we strongly encourage investors to review the GAAP financial measures included in this earnings release and not to place undue reliance upon any single financial measure. In addition, because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this earnings release with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. The tables beginning on page 17 in the full earnings release, as found at [www.oldsecond.com](https://pr.report/3l4a), under the investor relations tab, provide a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP equivalent.\n\n_**_Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statement_ s**_\n\nThis earnings release and statements by our management may contain forward-looking statements within the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

(“Old Second Bancorp”) (NASDAQ: OSBC), the parent company of Old Second National Bank (“Old Second”), and First Merchants Corporation (“First Merchants Corp.”) (NASDAQ: FRME), the parent company of First Merchants Bank (“First Merchants”), jointly announced today that Old Second and First Merchants have entered into a Purchase and Assumption Agreement where Old Second will purchase 5 Illinois branch locations in the Southeast Chicago MSA as well as certain branch related loans and deposits from First Merchants.\n\nThe acquisition enhances Old Second’s position as one of the largest banks headquartered in the Chicagoland area, and adds meaningfully to its existing branch network and in the Southeast Chicago market, allowing for improved scale and penetration. The sale by First Merchants completes its branch exit from suburban Chicago markets.\n\nOld Second anticipates assuming approximately $304 million in deposits and purchasing approximately $12 million in branch-related loans from this acquisition. Old Second will pay a deposit premium of 7.5%, or approximately $23 million, in estimated cash consideration to First Merchants.

Reports Second Quarter 2024 Net Income of $21.9 Million, or $0.48 per Diluted Share\n\nJuly 17, 2024\n\n[ Download (opens in new window) ](//s201.q4cdn.com/147450493/files/doc_news/2024/07/OSBC-Earnings-Release-Q2-2024-EX-99-1-and-EX-99-2.pdf)\n\n**AURORA, IL / ACCESSWIRE / July 17, 2024 /** Old Second Bancorp, Inc. (the \"Company,\" \"Old Second,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" and \"our\") (NASDAQ:OSBC), the parent company of Old Second National Bank (the \"Bank\"), today announced financial results for the second quarter of 2024. Our net income was $21.9 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2024, compared to net income of $21.3 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2024, and net income of $25.6 million, or $0.56 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2023. Adjusted net income, a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes certain nonrecurring items, as applicable, was $21.0 million, or $0.46 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2024, compared to $21.3 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2024, and $25.6 million, or $0.56 per share, for the second quarter of 2023. The adjusting item impacting the second quarter of 2024 was an $893,000 death benefit related to BOLI; the adjusting item impacting the second quarter of 2023 results included $29,000 of pre-tax losses from branch sales. See the discussion entitled \"Non-GAAP Presentations\" below and the tables beginning on page 17 of the full earnings release that provide a reconciliation of each non-GAAP measure to the most comparable GAAP equivalent. The full earnings release can be found at [www.oldsecond.com](https://pr.report/v5v), under the investor relations tab.\n\nNet income increased $579,000 in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2024. The increase was primarily due to a $626,000 increase in noninterest income and a $364,000 decrease in noninterest expense, partially offset by a $93,000 decrease in net interest and dividend income, a $250,000 increase in provision for credit losses, and a $68,000 increase in provision for income taxes. Net income decreased $3.7 million in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2023, primarily due to a decrease in net interest income of $3.9 million year over year driven by a $3.2 million increase to interest expense as a result of higher interest rates offered on deposits, as well as a reduction in interest and dividend income as the securities portfolio decreased $162.0 million during the last twelve months. Also contributing to the decrease in net income compared to the prior year like quarter was an increase in provision for credit losses of $1.8 million.\n\n**Operating Results**\n\n  * Second quarter 2024 net income was $21.9 million, reflecting a $579,000 increase from the first quarter of 2024, and a decrease of $3.7 million from the second quarter of 2023. Adjusted net income, as defined above, was $21.0 million for the second quarter of 2024, a decrease of $314,000 from adjusted net income for the first quarter of 2024, and a decrease of $4.6 million from adjusted net income for the second quarter of 2023.\n\n  * Net interest and dividend income was $59.7 million for the second quarter of 2024, reflecting a decrease of $93,000, or 0.2%, from the first quarter of 2024, and a decrease of $3.9 million, or 6.1%, from the second quarter of 2023.\n\n  * We recorded a net provision for credit losses of $3.8 million in the second quarter of 2024 compared to a net provision for credit losses of $3.5 million in the first quarter of 2024, and a net provision for credit losses of $2.0 million in the second quarter of 2023.\n\n  * Noninterest income was $11.1 million for the second quarter of 2024, an increase of $626,000, or 6.0%, compared to $10.5 million for the first quarter of 2024, and an increase of $2.9 million, or 35.3%, compared to $8.2 million for the second quarter of 2023. An $893,000 death benefit on a BOLI contract was recorded in the second quarter of 2024, which did not occur in either comparative period, and $1.5 million of securities losses, net, was recorded in the second quarter of 2023; no security sales occurred in the second quarter of 2024.\n\n  * Noninterest expense was $37.9 million for the second quarter of 2024, a decrease of $364,000, or 1.0% compared to $38.2 million for the first quarter of 2024, and an increase of $3.0 million, or 8.7%, compared to $34.8 million for the second quarter of 2023.\n\n  * We had a provision for income tax of $7.3 million for the second quarter of 2024, compared to a provision for income tax of $7.2 million for the first quarter of 2024 and a provision of $9.4 million for the second quarter of 2023. The effective tax rate for each of the periods presented was 25.0%, 25.3%, and 26.9%, respectively.\n\n  * On July 16, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.05 per share of common stock, payable on August 5, 2024, to stockholders of record as of July 26, 2024.\n\n\n\n\n**_Financial Highlights_**\n\n**Quarters Ended**  \n---  \n**(Dollars in thousands)**| **June 30,**| **March 31,**| **June 30,**  \n**2024**| **2024**| **2023**  \n**Balance sheet summary**  \nTotal assets| $| 5,662,700| $| 5,616,072| $| 5,883,942  \nTotal securities available-for-sale| 1,173,661| 1,168,797| 1,335,622  \nTotal loans| 3,976,595| 3,969,411| 4,015,525  \nTotal deposits| 4,521,728| 4,608,275| 4,717,582  \nTotal liabilities| 5,043,365| 5,019,913| 5,369,987  \nTotal equity| 619,335| 596,159| 513,955  \nTotal tangible assets| $| 5,566,159| $| 5,518,957| $| 5,785,028  \nTotal tangible equity| 522,794| 499,044| 415,041  \n**Income statement summary**  \nNet interest income| $| 59,690| $| 59,783| $| 63,580  \nProvision for credit losses| 3,750| 3,500| 2,000  \nNoninterest income| 11,127| 10,501| 8,223  \nNoninterest expense| 37,877| 38,241| 34,830  \nNet income| 21,891| 21,312| 25,562  \nEffective tax rate| 25.01| %| 25.33| %| 26.91| %  \n**Profitability ratios**  \nReturn on average assets (ROAA)| 1.57| %| 1.51| %| 1.73| %  \nReturn on average equity (ROAE)| 14.55| 14.56| 20.04  \nNet interest margin (tax-equivalent)| 4.63| 4.58| 4.64  \nEfficiency ratio| 53.29| 53.59| 46.84  \nReturn on average tangible common equity (ROATCE)| 17.66| 17.80| 25.30  \nTangible common equity to tangible assets (TCE/TA)| 9.39| 9.04| 7.17  \n**Per share data**  \nDiluted earnings per share| $| 0.48| $| 0.47| $| 0.56  \nTangible book value per share| 11.66| 11.13| 9.29  \n**Company capital ratios 1**  \nCommon equity tier 1 capital ratio| 12.41| %| 12.02| %| 10.29| %  \nTier 1 risk-based capital ratio| 12.94| 12.55| 10.80  \nTotal risk-based capital ratio| 15.12| 14.79| 13.16  \nTier 1 leverage ratio| 10.96| 10.47| 8.96  \n**Bank capital ratios 1, 2**  \nCommon equity tier 1 capital ratio| 13.50| %| 13.06| %| 11.70| %  \nTier 1 risk-based capital ratio| 13.50| 13.06| 11.70  \nTotal risk-based capital ratio| 14.42| 14.03| 12.83  \nTier 1 leverage ratio| 11.43| 10.89| 9.70  \n  \n _1 Both the Company and the Bank ratios are inclusive of a capital conservation buffer of 2.50%, and both are subject to the minimum capital adequacy guidelines of 7.00%, 8.50%, 10.50%, and 4.00% for the Common equity tier 1, Tier 1 risk-based, Total risk-based and Tier 1 leverage ratios, respectively_.\n\n_2 The prompt corrective action provisions are applicable only at the Bank level, and are 6.50%, 8.00%, 10.00%, and 5.00% for the Common equity tier 1, Tier 1 risk-based, Total risk-based and Tier 1 leverage ratios, respectively_.\n\nChairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Jim Eccher said \"Old Second reported strong results in the second quarter with exceptional profitability and significant improvement in asset quality metrics. We are reaching resolution on a number of problem loans identified in prior periods and continue to monitor trends very closely. Nonperforming and classified assets at Old Second are at their lowest levels since year end 2022 and we expect further improvement this year. Our industry continues to experience significant stress in a number of real estate lending verticals, but I believe Old Second has been proactive in identifying and addressing potential problems. The rest of the bank continues to perform well with return on average assets and return on average tangible common equity at 1.57% and 17.66%, respectively, and the efficiency ratio is at 53.29%. The net interest margin increased by five basis points this quarter to a very strong 4.63% and our tangible book value per share increased by 19% linked quarter annualized and 26% year over year. Loan growth has been tepid through the second quarter, but we are optimistic trends are improving based on recent activity and the current strength of our pipelines. Our focus remains on compounding tangible book value and maintaining strong returns on equity. We believe this level of performance is sustainable in this environment and the balance sheet remains exceptionally well positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities that may come our way in the near future.\"\n\n**_Asset Quality & Earning Assets_**\n\n  * Nonperforming loans, comprised of nonaccrual loans plus loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing, totaled $46.9 million at June 30, 2024, $65.1 million at March 31, 2024, and $61.2 million at June 30, 2023. Nonperforming loans, as a percent of total loans, were 1.2% at June 30, 2024, 1.6% at March 31, 2024, and 1.5% at June 30, 2023. The decrease in the second quarter of 2024 is driven by note sales and payoffs during the quarter, as well as charge-offs of $5.9 million on six loans, a $3.4 million transfer of two related loans to other real estate owned, and two non-performing loan upgrades with an aggregate balance of $2.2 million.\n\n  * Total loans were $3.98 billion at June 30, 2024, reflecting an increase of $7.2 million compared to March 31, 2024, and a decrease of $38.9 million compared to June 30, 2023. The decrease year over year was largely driven by the declines in commercial, commercial real estate-investor and commercial real estate-owner occupied portfolios. Average loans (including loans held-for-sale) for the second quarter of 2024 totaled $3.96 billion, reflecting a decrease of $60.9 million from the first quarter of 2024 and a decrease of $81.7 million from the second quarter of 2023.\n\n  * Available-for-sale securities totaled $1.17 billion at June 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, compared to $1.34 billion at June 30, 2023. The unrealized mark to market loss on securities totaled $82.6 million as of June 30, 2024, compared to $85.0 million as of March 31, 2024, and $112.4 million as of June 30, 2023, due to market interest rate fluctuations as well as changes year over year in the composition of the securities portfolio. During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, we had security purchases of $142.2 million, security maturities of $95.0 million, and paydowns of $44.0 million, compared to security purchases of $15.7 million, security maturities of $2.0 million, paydowns of $30.7 million, and sales of $5.3 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2024, which resulted in net realized gains of $1,000. During the quarter ended June 30, 2023, we had no security purchases, $36.3 million of security paydowns, calls and maturities, and security sales of $74.0 million, which resulted in net realized losses of $1.5 million. We may continue to buy and sell strategically identified securities as opportunities arise.\n\n\n\n\n**_Non-GAAP Presentations_**\n\nManagement has disclosed in this earnings release certain non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate and measure our performance, including the presentation of adjusted net income, net interest income and net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis, and our efficiency ratio calculations on a taxable equivalent basis. The net interest margin fully taxable equivalent is calculated by dividing net interest income on a tax equivalent basis by average earning assets for the period. Consistent with industry practice, management has disclosed the efficiency ratio including and excluding certain items, which is discussed in the noninterest expense presentation on page 7 of the full filing of this release; see the investor relations tab at [oldsecond.com](http://oldsecond.com) for this full release.\n\nWe consider the use of select non-GAAP financial measures and ratios to be useful for financial and operational decision making and useful in evaluating period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain expenditures or assets that we believe are not indicative of our primary business operating results or by presenting certain metrics on a fully taxable equivalent basis. We believe these measures provide investors with information regarding balance sheet profitability, and we believe that management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, analyzing, and comparing past, present and future periods.\n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for GAAP financial measures, and we strongly encourage investors to review the GAAP financial measures included in this earnings release and not to place undue reliance upon any single financial measure. In addition, because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this earnings release with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. The tables beginning on page 17 of the full filing of this release provide a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP equivalent; see the investor relations tab at [oldsecond.com](http://oldsecond.com) for this full release.\n\n_**_Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statement_ s**_\n\nThis earnings release and statements by our management may contain forward-looking statements within the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
