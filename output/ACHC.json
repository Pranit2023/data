(NASDAQ: ACHC) today announced financial results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024. \n\n**Third Quarter Highlights**\n\n  * Revenue totaled $815.6 million, an increase of 8.7% over the third quarter of 2023 \n  * Same facility revenue increased 8.6% compared with the third quarter of 2023, including an increase in revenue per patient day of 3.6% and an increase in patient days of 4.7% \n  * Net income attributable to Acadia totaled $68.1 million, or $0.74 per diluted share \n  * Adjusted income attributable to Acadia totaled $84.1 million, or $0.91 per diluted share \n  * Adjusted EBITDA totaled $194.3 million, an increase of 10.5% over the third quarter of 2023, excluding provider relief funds \n  * Same facility adjusted EBITDA margin increased 100 bps to 29.7% over the third quarter of 2023 \n\n\n\n_Adjusted income attributable to Acadia and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of all non-GAAP financial measures in this press release begins on page 8._\n\n**Third Quarter Results** Chris Hunter, Chief Executive Officer of Acadia Healthcare Company, remarked, “Our financial results for the third quarter of 2024 reflect continued execution of our growth strategy. We have the scale and expertise to support patients across the continuum of care. We are proud of the important work we are doing and are committed to providing safe, quality care for the patients, families and communities we serve while creating long-term value for our stockholders.” \n\n**Strategic Investments for Long-Term Growth** During the third quarter of 2024, the Company continued to make progress in meeting its strategic growth objectives. This includes the addition of 15 beds to existing facilities and the addition of five new CTCs during the quarter. With these additions, Acadia now operates 164 CTCs across 32 states treating over 72,000 patients daily and remains on track to open up to 14 new CTCs for the full year. \n\nIn the first nine months of the year, the Company opened 79 new beds at existing facilities. For the full year, the Company expects to open over 400 new beds at existing facilities, including over 300 beds expected in the fourth quarter. \n\nIn the first nine months of the year, the Company also opened two new facilities, totaling 120 beds. The Company remains on pace to complete construction on several additional new wholly owned and joint venture facilities, totaling nearly 700 new beds in the fourth quarter, including joint venture hospitals in partnership with Henry Ford Health in Detroit, Michigan, and Intermountain Health in Denver, Colorado, as well as a new de novo facility in Madison, Wisconsin, which was completed in October. The number of new beds available to serve patients by the end of the fourth quarter is subject to the timing of anticipated state-issued licenses. \n\nAcadia has 21 joint venture partnerships for 22 hospitals, with 11 hospitals already in operation and 11 additional hospitals expected to open in the coming years. \n\n**Cash and Liquidity** Maintaining a strong financial position to support growth investments and disciplined capital allocation are top priorities for Acadia. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had $82.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and $321.5 million available under its $600 million revolving credit facility with a net leverage ratio of approximately 2.5x. \n\n_Net leverage ratio is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation of all non-GAAP financial measures in this press release begins on page 8._\n\n**2024 Financial Guidance** Acadia today revised its previously announced financial guidance for 2024. Revised guidance reflects the closure of two facilities during the third quarter(2). \n\n2024 Guidance Range  \n---  \nRevenue(1) |  $3.150 to $3.165 billion  \nAdjusted EBITDA(1) |  $725 to $735 million  \nAdjusted earnings per diluted share(1) |  $3.35 to $3.45  \nInterest expense  |  $110 to $120 million  \nTax rate  |  24.5% to 25.5%   \nDepreciation and amortization expense  |  $145 to $155 million  \nStock compensation expense  |  $40 to $45 million  \nOperating cash flows  |  $525 to $550 million  \nExpansion capital expenditures  |  $550 to $595 million  \nMaintenance and IT capital expenditures  |  $95 to $105 million   \nTotal bed additions, excluding acquisitions(3) |  Approx. 1,200 beds   \n(1) |  Includes one-time state payments of approximately $10 million (or $0.09 per diluted share) for the year, of which approximately $7 million was received in the first quarter of 2024 and the remainder in the third quarter of 2024.   \n---|---  \n(2) |  Prior full-year guidance assumed approximately $17 million of revenue and approximately $1 million of EBITDA contribution in the second half of the year from facilities that were closed during the third quarter.   \n(3) |  Company anticipates completing construction on approximately 1,200 beds, of which approximately 1,000 are expected to be licensed and available to serve patients by year end, with the remaining beds expected to receive licensure in the first quarter. The exact number of beds available to serve patients at year end will depend on timing of anticipated required licenses.   \n  \nThe Company’s guidance does not include the impact of any future acquisitions, divestitures, transaction, legal and other costs or non-recurring legal settlements expense. \n\n**Conference Call** Acadia will hold a conference call to discuss its third quarter financial results at 8:00 a.m. Central Time/9:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, October 31, 2024.

Company, Inc.**  \n---  \n**Footnotes**  \nWe have included certain financial measures in this press release, including those listed below, which are “non-GAAP financial measures” as defined under the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC. These non-GAAP financial measures include, and are defined, as follows:  \n• EBITDA: net income (loss) attributable to Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. adjusted for net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, provision for (benefit from) income taxes, net interest expense and depreciation and amortization.  \n• Adjusted EBITDA: EBITDA adjusted for equity-based compensation expense, transaction, legal and other costs, legal settlements expense and loss on impairment.  \n• Adjusted EBITDA excluding income from provider relief fund: Adjusted EBITDA adjusted for income from provider relief fund.  \n• Adjusted EBITDA margin: Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue.  \n• Adjusted EBITDA margin excluding income from provider relief fund: Adjusted EBITDA excluding income from provider relief fund divided by revenue.  \n• Adjusted income before income taxes attributable to Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc.: net income (loss) attributable to Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. adjusted for transaction, legal and other costs, legal settlements expense, loss on impairment and provision for (benefit from) income taxes.  \n• Adjusted income attributable to Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc.: Adjusted income before income taxes attributable to Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. adjusted for the income tax effect of adjustments to income.  \n• Adjusted income attributable to Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. excluding income from provider relief fund: Adjusted income attributable to Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. adjusted for income from provider relief fund.  \n• Net leverage ratio: Long-term debt (excluding $9.7 million of unamortized debt issuance costs, discount and premium) less cash and cash equivalents divided by Adjusted EBITDA for the trailing twelve months.  \nThe non-GAAP financial measures presented herein are supplemental measures of our performance and are not required by, or presented in accordance with, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). The non-GAAP financial measures presented herein are not measures of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as measures of our liquidity. Our measurements of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. We have included information concerning the non-GAAP financial measures in this press release because we believe that such information is used by certain investors as measures of a company’s historical performance. We believe these measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of issuers of equity securities, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures when reporting their results. Because the non-GAAP financial measures are not measurements determined in accordance with GAAP and are thus susceptible to varying calculations, the non-GAAP financial measures, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Our presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items.  \nThe Company is not able to provide a reconciliation of projected Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per diluted share, where provided, to expected results due to the unknown effect, timing and potential significance of transaction-related expenses and the tax effect of such expenses.   \n(a) Represents the equity-based compensation expense of Acadia.  \n(b) Represents transaction, legal and other costs incurred by Acadia primarily related to legal, government investigations, management transition, termination, restructuring, acquisition and other similar costs.  \n(c) Represents legal settlements expense related to the Desert Hills litigation.  \n(d) Represents non-cash impairment charges related to the closure of certain facilities.  \n(e) Represents the income tax effect of adjustments to income based on tax rates of 26.3% and 24.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 24.5% and 25.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  \n(f) For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, approximately 0.5 million and 0.8 million outstanding shares of restricted stock and shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock option awards, respectively, have been included in the calculation of weighted-average shares outstanding-diluted. These shares are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share in the condensed consolidated statement of operations because the net loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 causes such securities to be anti-dilutive.  \n  \n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20241030593005r1&sid=acqr8&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\nView source version on [businesswire.com](http://businesswire.com): <https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241030593005/en/>\n\nInvestor Contact: Patrick Feeley Senior Vice President, Investor Relations (615) 861-6000 \n\nSource: Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc.\n"
