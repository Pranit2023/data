(“**Red Cloud** ”). Red Cloud’s services commenced on November 14, 2024, not October 14, 2024, as stated in the prior news release. All other stated terms are correct.\n\nFurthermore, the Company wishes to remind all Foremost shareholders (\"**Shareholders\"**) about the upcoming spin-out of the Winston Gold and Silver Properties (the \"**Properties or Project** \") from Foremost to Rio Grande Ltd. Pursuant to the statutory plan of arrangement under British Columbia's Business Corporations Act (**\"the Arrangement** \"), each Shareholder will exchange each outstanding common share of Foremost for one (1) new common share of Foremost and two (2) Rio Grande Shares (the \"**Rio Grande Shares** \"). \n\nIt is important to note that **_all_ **Shareholders will participate in the share exchange on the effective date of the completion of the Arrangement but only Shareholders of record as of October 24, 2024, will be eligible to vote at the AGSM. The Company anticipates completing the Arrangement, in accordance with the terms of the Plan of Arrangement, in January 2025, subject to, among other things, receipt of all required shareholders, court and CSE approvals.\n\nJason Barnard, President and CEO of Foremost, states: _“With all Foremost shareholders on the effective listing date of Rio Grande receiving 2 Rio shares_ , _we are confident that the spin-out of Rio Grande into a standalone entity will create significant value. This move will ensure that these properties receive the necessary attention and development focus they deserve, especially during a robust bull market for precious metals. We are excited to finalize this transaction and begin exploration activities._ ”\n\nForemost believes that this opportunity presents an exciting prospect for all Shareholders and encourages all to carefully consider this opportunity, and to cast a vote in favour of the Arrangement at the upcoming AGSM.\n\nThe Company is also pleased to announce that it has filed an updated Technical Report (**the “Report** ”) for the Properties located northwest of the town of Truth or Consequences in New Mexico, USA. The updated Report entitled “ _NI 43-101 Technical Report for the Winston Gold-Silver Project: Sierra County, New Mexico, USA,_ ” with an effective date of November 4, 2024, was prepared in accordance with National Instrument 43-101: Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects. The purpose of the Report is to provide an update on the Project and present new technical and scientific findings related to exploration activities. The Report can be found under the Company’s profile on SEDAR+ at [www.sedarplus.ca](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=5GvQ85zHLHKWtkfyNXpQN_IOHoPQ4K6BWwiIs6dFu39y84gYlHiUd7uQrpCuh5a0hCirOrFAR_yjpsb0HaCoDQ== \"www.sedarplus.ca\").\n\n**Qualified Persons**\n\nThe independent Qualified Person responsible for the Report is Jocelyn Pelletier (Msc, F-SEG) who is a Qualified Person as identified by Canadian National Instrument 43-101-Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects and as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Regulation S-K 1300 rules for resource deposit disclosure, with contributions from Michael N. Feinstein (CPG), a non-independent Qualified Person.\n\n**About** **Foremost**\n\nForemost Clean Energy Ltd. (NASDAQ: FMST) (CSE: FAT) (WKN: A3DCC8) is an emerging North American uranium and lithium exploration company with an option to earn up to a 70% interest in 10 prospective uranium properties (with the exception of the Hatchet Lake, where Foremost is able to earn up to 51%) spanning over 330,000 acres in the prolific, uranium-rich Athabasca Basin region of northern Saskatchewan. As the demand for carbon-free energy continues to accelerate, domestically mined uranium and lithium are poised for dynamic growth, playing an important role in the clean energy mix of the future. Foremost’s uranium projects are at different stages of exploration, from grassroots to those with significant historical exploration and drill-ready targets. The Company’s mission is to make significant discoveries, alongside and in collaboration with Denison Mines Corp. (TSX:DML, NYSE American: DNN), through systematic and disciplined exploration programs.\n\nForemost also has a portfolio of lithium projects at varying stages of development, which are located across 55,000+ acres in Manitoba and Quebec.

Foremost also maintains a secondary portfolio of significant lithium projects at different stages of development spanning 50,000+ acres across Manitoba and Quebec.\n\n[LEARN MORE](/about/about-foremost.html)\n\n## URANIUM MARKET\n\n![](/images/noun-green-electricity-2225205.png)\n\n### ELECTRIFICATIONREVOLUTION\n\n  * Advancements in renewable energy technologies and growing environmental concerns have shifted demand dynamics for traditional energy sources, most notably fossil fuels.\n  * The IEA and the IRENA forecast that the world will require three times more renewable energy capacity by 2030, or at least 11,000 GW.\n\n\n\n![group 355](/images/group-355.png)\n\n### ENERGYSECURITY\n\n  * Concerns about the stability of energy supplies have increased the attractiveness of uranium as a fuel source.\n  * Uranium is energy-dense and is regarded as a reliable, economically favorable source of power that can directly displace fossil fuels.\n\n\n\n![group 355](/images/group-356.png)\n\n### PRICE\n\n  * Prices have been increasing over the past decade and briefly exceeded US$100 per pound of U3O8 in January 2024.\n  * The outlook remains bullish, with BofA's metals and mining team predicting that tightness in uranium markets could persist well into 2025, adding upward pressure on pricing.\n\n\n\n![group 355](/images/group-357.png)\n\n### GEOPOLITICALENVIRONMENT\n\n  * Global catalysts are driving nuclear energy and uranium exploration.\n  * In May 2024, U.S. President Biden signed into law the “Prohibiting Russian Uranium Imports Act,” which bans the import of enriched uranium produced in Russia or by Russian entities.\n\n\n\n![group 355](/images/group-358.png)\n\n### SUPPLYGAP\n\n  * The world’s top uranium producer cut its 2025 target, bringing the entire production curve downward.\n  * The World Nuclear Association’s Nuclear Fuel Report (2023) predicts a 28% increase in uranium demand from 2023 through 2030, with a further increase to over 51% by 2040.\n\n\n\n![group 360](/images/group-360.png)\n\n### ECONOMICENVIRONMENT\n\n  * Extreme underinvestment over the past 10 years has led to a structural uranium production deficit of approximately 26%, which is expected to further widen in the future.\n  * A nuclear renaissance is underway, with 20+ nations pledging to triple nuclear energy capacity by 2050.\n\n\n\n![Foremost clean energy about us](/images/homepage/Mask_Group_85.jpg)\n\n## WHAT IS URANIUM?\n\nUranium is a heavy metal which has been used as an abundant source of concentrated energy for over 60 years. It can be mined by underground or open-cut methods, depending on its depth, or mined by in situ leaching (ISL), where it is dissolved from a porous underground ore body in situ and pumped to the surface. The end product of the mining and milling stages, or of ISL, is uranium oxide concentrate (U3O8). This is the form in which uranium is sold.\n\nUranium is the fuel most widely used by nuclear plants providing approximately 10% of the world's electricity from about 440 reactors. The World Nuclear Association’s Nuclear Fuel Report from 2023 estimates total uranium requirements to be more than 500 million pounds through 2030, an increase of 28%,and further increasing to 755 million pounds through to 2040.\n\n[LEARN MORE](/about/market-outlook/uranium/uranium-market.html)\n\n## Uranium Properties*\n\n**Foremost’s 10 uranium exploration projects** span over 45 claims
