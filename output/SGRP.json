Amidst\nnavigating a challenging trading environment and addressing consumer pressures across various territories, together with the ongoing impacts\nof the SAP system implementation in South Africa, SPAR’s continuing operations have demonstrated a resilient performance.\nTurnover for the Group’s continuing operations in Southern Africa, Ireland and South-West England (“BWG Group”), and Switzerland, increased\nby 4.0% to R152.3 billion. Turnover growth slowed in the second half of the financial year across all geographies, influenced by the ZAR\ntranslation impacts of the foreign subsidiaries as the currency strengthened, together with slowing levels of food inflation, increased competition\nacross all markets and consumers that continue to experience cost-of-living constraints.\nGross profit margins remained stable at 11.9% compared to the previous financial year. Whilst interventions to resolve the SAP impacts in\nthe KZN region are well underway, it will take some time for the full effects to be felt and for the overhang on gross margins to be eliminated;\ngross profit margin for SPAR South Africa, including SPAR, Tops and Build it, decreased from 8.7% to 8.5%. BWG Group saw a slight increase\nin its overall gross profit margin from 15.1% to 15.2%, driven by a more favourable category mix. Improved margin management within the\nwholesale and TopCC cash and carry business saw SPAR Switzerland’s gross margin improve from 17.8% to 18.3%.\n2\nTHE SPAR GROUP LTD ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nOperating expenses were well managed, increasing by 3.5% to R18.7 billion, underpinned by an increased focus on cost management and\nefficiency initiatives across the Group. The translation effect of foreign currency also impacted this performance. The Group delivered an\noperating profit of R2.9 billion, reflecting a 15.1% year-on-year increase, with an improvement in operating profit margin to 1.9% (2023: 1.7%).\nNotwithstanding gross finance costs increasing by 11.1%, profit before tax rose by 15.8% to R2.1 billion (2023: R1.8 billion). Profit after tax grew\nby 20.9% to R1.6 billion (2023: R1.4 billion) and diluted headline earnings per share for continuing operations grew by 11.1% to 917.5 cents.\nGroup net borrowings reduced by R2.0 billion, from R11.1 billion as at 31 March 2024, to R9.1 billion at 30 September 2024, resulting in the net\nborrowings/EBITDA (determined on a pre-IFRS 16 basis) ratio improving to 2.41 times from 3.02 times in the previous financial year.\nSPAR Southern Africa, including SPAR, Tops, Build it and Pharma, reported a 3.7% increase in turnover in a trading environment characterised\nby high inflation, high interest rates and low GDP growth. Core grocery and liquor turnover rose by 3.6%, with SPAR private label growing by\n7.0%. Wholesale price inflation was internally measured at 5.5%. Build it achieved a 2.3% rise in turnover, improving from a 4.3% decline in the\nprevious financial year. Pharmacy at SPAR saw a 14.5% growth in turnover due to a strong performance from Scriptwise. The SPAR2U on-\ndemand shopping app expanded to 525 sites by the end of September, with order volumes increasing 380% year-on-year. Operating profit in\nour Southern African segment, excluding non-recurring items, increased by 26.1%\nSPAR South Africa has arrested recent market share declines and stabilised its share amongst its key customer base over the past year\nwith monthly market share, according to NielsenIQ, staying flat since February 2024. In the case of the liquor segment, which continues to be\na crucial contributor to SPAR’s overall market position, monthly market share has grown year-on-year.\nTurnover in Ireland and South-West England, represented by BWG Group, grew by 2.8% in EUR terms and 6.7% in ZAR terms. Both markets\nfaced challenges from persistent higher living and operating costs. In Ireland, the successful integration of recent acquisitions made over the\nlast 18 months into the Value Centre network provided synergies and contributed to turnover growth. Management’s continued focus on cost\ncontainment in this region led to improved operating profit margins. The hospitality sector continued to grow in Ireland, even amidst cautious\nconsumer spending. The UK business, Appleby Westward group, reported a steep decline in turnover as UK retailers struggled throughout the\nyear. The summer trading months were particularly weak, affected by very poor weather. This business has also dealt with the challenge of\nthe change to the national minimum wage which came into effect from April 2024 and resulted in an increase of 9.8% in the minimum wage.\nThe Swiss macro-economy showed little signs of recovery for consumers, leaving them opting for cheaper alternatives locally and abroad.\nSPAR Switzerland’s turnover declined by 6.2% in CHF terms (down 0.3% in ZAR terms) compared to the previous financial year. The sustained\ncontraction in the gastronomy sector continued to negatively impact the cash and carry business, TopCC, which reported a marked decline in\nturnover. To address and defend against intensifying competition, the Group is focused on cost-saving initiatives and on its convenience and\nfresh food offering to counteract cross-border shopping effects.\nUpdate on key strategic priorities\nSPAR Poland Disposal\nAs stated in the Group’s trading statement published on SENS on 21 November 2024, the sale of the Group’s interest in SPAR Poland was\napproved by the Polish anti-monopoly authorities (UOKiK) on 19 November 2024 (“Approval”). The purchaser is conducting a final confirmatory\ndue diligence to be completed within 30 business days of the Approval. The disposal of the Polish business will be completed once this process\nis finalised. Management is expecting to finalise the exit from Poland by early January 2025.\nSAP Implementation Update\nSignificant progress has been made in resolving SAP integration issues, including improving visibility of pricing and subsidies for buyers, as well\nas addressing warehouse management inefficiencies that increased labour and transport costs through the selection of a new warehouse\nmanagement system. Service levels achieved are currently in excess of 90% with KZN loyalty rates rising from 68.6% in the second quarter of\n2024 to 70.9% in fourth quarter of 2024.\nBanking facilities\nDuring September 2024, the Group secured a R2.0 billion bridge facility from local lenders. R1.2 billion of the facility was used to partially settle\nthe Polish funding as required per the terms of the sale. This facility will be converted into a medium-term loan by the end of March 2025.\nThe remaining funds will settle the Polish business’s working capital facilities at disposal closure. The Polish bridge facility is included in the\ndisclosed closing net debt balance of R9.1 billion.\nThe Group was in compliance with all financing covenants as at year-end and remains committed to its debt restructuring plans, with no plans\nto seek additional funding from shareholders.\nShareholder distribution\nThe Group has been focused on addressing various challenges over the past 18 months to ensure financial stability, balance sheet resilience\nand maximise its ability to position itself to take advantage of growth opportunities. Whilst significant progress has been made, work remains\nongoing in these areas. Consequently, the Board believes it is prudent to not declare a dividend for the year ended 30 September 2024 (2023:\n0.0 cents per share). This decision will be reconsidered based on future macro-economic and operating conditions. Prioritising improved capital\nallocation, including shareholder returns, remains important to the Board.\n3\nTHE SPAR GROUP LTD ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nOutlook\nThe operating environment across our territories continues to be challenging with ongoing inflationary pressures in food, fuel and energy,\nthough these are showing signs of easing in some areas.\nIn South Africa, we saw strong growth in our value focused formats compared to subdued growth in our higher end stores, illustrating the\nprevailing tough macro-economic conditions and the impact on the middle and higher segment consumers. We believe that every customer\nshould be treated as a segment of one, and we are focused on clarifying our market positioning through clearer format and brand architecture.\nTo that end, SPAR’s tiered private label approach is well placed to offer better value for all shopping budgets with the launch of a bespoke high-\nend offering seeking to capture the higher income consumer segment. The revitalised SaveMor store format will include high quality products\nat competitive prices and the model will be focused on operational efficiency to establish SaveMor as a leading discount retailer. We will\ncontinue to scale our on-demand grocery delivery offering, SPAR2U, in line with evolving consumer needs.\nOur European strategic review is well underway, but ongoing and we are evaluating the return on capital for each international business unit.\nThis review will guide our investment decisions, identifying where to allocate more capital, reassess existing models, or consider exits as part\nof our growth strategy.\nAs committed to shareholders, we have made significant progress on our 2024 priorities, including finalising the sale of SPAR Poland, reducing\ndebt and stabilising our balance sheet position, resolving SAP issues at the KZN distribution centre, and working towards a 3% operating\nmargin in Southern Africa, a target which remains intact. In 2025, we will focus on supporting SPAR’s independent retailers, defining our target\noperating model, improving Group profitability, and finalising the ERP system modernisation plan.\nMJ Bosman AP Swartz\nChairman Group Chief Executive Officer\n27 November 2024\n4\nTHE SPAR GROUP LTD ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDirectors’ approval of the\nfinancial statements\nThe Board of Directors (the Board) is responsible for the maintenance of adequate accounting records and the integrity and fair presentation of\nthe financial statements of the Company and Group and related information. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with\nIFRS® Accounting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the requirements of the Companies Act of\nSouth Africa, 71 of 2008 (as amended). The Group’s independent external auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers Inc., have audited the financial\nstatements and their unmodified report appears on pages 18 to 85.\nThe Board is also responsible for the system of internal controls which are designed to provide reasonable but not absolute assurance as to the\nreliability of the financial statements, adequately safeguard, verify and maintain accountability of the assets, record all liabilities, and prevent and\ndetect material misstatement and loss. The system is implemented and monitored by suitably trained personnel with appropriate segregation\nof authority and duties.

Nothing has come to the attention of the Board to indicate that the\nCompany or the Group will not remain a going concern for the foreseeable future.\nThe annual financial statements were approved by the board of directors on 27 November 2024 and are signed on its behalf by:\nMJ Bosman AP Swartz\nChairman Group Chief Executive Officer\n27 November 2024\n5\nTHE SPAR GROUP LTD ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nResponsibility statement\nEach of the directors, whose names are stated below, hereby confirms that:\n(a) t he annual financial statements set out on pages 18 to 85, fairly present in all material respects the financial position, financial performance\nand cash flows of the Group in terms of IFRS;\n(b) to the best of our knowledge and belief, no facts have been omitted or untrue statements made that would make the annual financial\nstatements false or misleading;\n(c) internal financial controls have been put in place to ensure that material information relating to the issuer and its consolidated subsidiaries\nhas been provided to effectively prepare the annual financial statements of the Group;\n(d) t he internal financial controls are adequate and effective and can be relied upon in compiling the annual financial statements, having fulfilled\nour role and function as executive directors with primary responsibility for implementation and execution of controls;\n(e) where we are not satisfied, we have disclosed to the Audit Committee and the auditors any deficiencies in design and operational\neffectiveness of the internal financial controls and have taken steps to remedy the deficiencies; and\n(f) w e are not aware of any fraud involving directors.\nAP Swartz MW Godfrey\nGroup Chief Executive Officer Group Chief Financial Officer\n27 November 2024\n6\nTHE SPAR GROUP LTD ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCertificate by the\nCompany Secretary\nI, Neill O’Brien, in my capacity as the interim Group Company Secretary, certify that for the year ended 30 September 2024 the Company has,\nto the best of my knowledge and belief, lodged with the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission (CIPC) all returns and notices required\nof a public company in terms of the Companies Act (71 of 2008, as amended) of South Africa and that all such returns appear to be true, correct\nand up to date.\nNP O’Brien\nInterim Group Company Secretary\n27 November 2024\n7\nTHE SPAR GROUP LTD ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIndependent Auditor’s report\nTo the Shareholders of The SPAR Group Limited\nReport on the audit of the consolidated and separate financial statements\nOur opinion\nIn our opinion, the consolidated and separate financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated and separate financial\nposition of The SPAR Group Limited (the Company) and its subsidiaries (together the Group) as at 30 September 2024, and its consolidated\nand separate financial performance and its consolidated and separate cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with IFRS Accounting\nStandards and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa.\nWhat we have audited\nThe SPAR Group Limited’s consolidated and separate financial statements set out on pages 18 to 85 comprise:\n• the consolidated and separate statements of financial position as at 30 September 2024;\n• the consolidated and separate statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income for the year then ended;\n• the consolidated and separate statements of changes in equity for the year then ended;\n• the consolidated and separate statements of cash flows for the year then ended; and\n• the notes to the financial statements, including material accounting policy information.\nBasis for opinion\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further\ndescribed in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated and separate financial statements section of our report.\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\nIndependence\nWe are independent of the Group in accordance with the Independent Regulatory Board for Auditors’ Code of Professional Conduct for\nRegistered Auditors (IRBA Code) and other independence requirements applicable to performing audits of financial statements in South Africa.\nWe have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the IRBA Code and in accordance with other ethical requirements\napplicable to performing audits in South Africa. The IRBA Code is consistent with the corresponding sections of the International Ethics\nStandards Board for Accountants’ International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards).\nOur audit approach\nOverview\nOverall group materiality\n• Overall group materiality: R129.5 million, which represents 4.5% of the consolidated\nweighted average profit before tax.\nMateriality\nGroup audit scope\n• The Group audit scope was determined based on indicators such as the contribution\nfrom each component to consolidated assets, consolidated revenue, and consolidated\nprofit before taxation. Full scope audits were performed over all 9 financially significant\nGroup scoping components. A full scope audit was performed over 1 component given specific risks\nidentified. Analytical procedures were performed over the remaining components.\nKey audit matters\n• Impairment assessment of goodwill, indefinite life assets and the Company’s investment\nKey audit matters in its Polish subsidiary\n• Classification of the Polish business as a disposal group held for sale and discontinued\noperation\nAs part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the consolidated and separate\nfinancial statements. In particular, we considered where the directors made subjective judgements; for example, in respect of significant\naccounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, we\nalso addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including among other matters, consideration of whether there was\nevidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.\n8\nTHE SPAR GROUP LTD ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nMateriality\nThe scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. An audit is designed to obtain reasonable assurance whether the\nfinancial statements are free from material misstatement. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if\nindividually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the\nconsolidated financial statements.\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, including the overall group materiality for\nthe consolidated financial statements as a whole as set out in the table below. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to\ndetermine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both\nindividually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.\nOverall group materiality R129.5 million\nHow we determined it 4.5% weighted average consolidated profit before tax\nRationale for the materiality We chose consolidated weighted average profit before taxation as the benchmark because, in our\nbenchmark applied view, it is the benchmark which most appropriately reflects underlying operations and is a generally\naccepted benchmark. We chose 4.5% which is an appropriate quantitative materiality thresholds\nused for profit-orientated companies in this sector.\nHow we tailored our group audit scope\nWe tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform sufficient work to enable us to provide an opinion on the consolidated financial statements\nas a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates.\nThe Group is arranged around four geographies in Southern Africa, Ireland, Switzerland and Poland. Each component within these segments is\nan aggregation of a number of business units.\nBased on our Group scoping assessment, Southern Africa, Ireland and Switzerland were considered to be financially significant and further\nscoping assessments were performed over the components within each geographical segment. Full scope audits were performed over components\nin Switzerland and Ireland. Although not financially significant, a full scope audit was also performed over the components in Poland given specific\nrisks identified within this segment. The Southern African segment comprises seven distribution centres, a central office function, several statutory\nentities and equity-accounted associates. Full scope audits were performed on the central office function, five distribution centres and one\nstatutory entity. Analytical procedures were performed over all financially inconsequential remaining components.\nIn establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be performed by the Group engagement\nteam, component auditors from the PwC network firms and non-PwC firms operating under our instruction. The Group engagement team was\ndirectly responsible for the audit of the Group consolidation, the full scope audit of the central office function, one distribution centre which was\nalso subject to a full scope audit and the analytical procedures over the remaining components. Where the work was performed by component\nauditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in the audit work at those components to be able to conclude whether\nsufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained. We had various interactions with our component teams in which we discussed and\nevaluated recent developments, audit risks, materiality, the scope and findings of the work performed, and the reports issued by the component\nteams. The Group engagement leader engaged directly with the component teams through a combination of meetings and cross-file reviews, and\nattended the audit committee meetings for each of the foreign segments.\nKey audit matters\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated and separate\nfinancial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated and separate financial\nstatements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\nKey audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter\nImpairment assessment of goodwill, indefinite life assets and Value-in-use calculation\ninvestment in Polish subsidiary (consolidated and separate)\nWe performed the following audit procedures:\nAs required by IAS 36, Impairment of Assets, management performs\n• Assessed the reasonableness of the valuation methodology\nan annual impairment test, or more frequently, if there is an indicator\napplied by management by comparing the valuation methodology\nof impairment, to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of\nto generally accepted valuation methodology, and found this to be\ngoodwill and indefinite life assets as reflected in the consolidated\nconsistent;\nfinancial statements, and if there is an indicator of impairment, to\n• Tested the mathematical accuracy of the value-in-use calculation\nassess the recoverability of the investment in subsidiaries as\nand the discounted cash flow model prepared by management,\nreflected in the separate financial statements.\nnoting no material exceptions;\nRefer to the accounting policies for Goodwill and Intangible Assets • Performed stress testing on the value-in-use model which involved\nand Impairment of non-financial assets and to note 13, Goodwill and assessment of management’s cash flow forecast and assumptions\nIntangible Asset. by comparison to prior years’ actual results, our understanding of\nthe industry, the entity-specific circumstances and the economic\nAs at 30 September 2024 the Group’s consolidated statement of\nenvironment, in order to determine the degree to which the key\nfinancial position included goodwill with a closing net book value of\nassumptions needed to change in order to trigger an impairment.\nR4.6 billion and indefinite life intangible assets of R2.1 billion.\nWe recalculated a range of values and compared this to the value\nManagement performed their annual impairment assessment of calculated by management.

The difference in rates\nwas included in our stress testing to assess the impact on the\nvaluation results. The use of our independently calculated discount\nrates in the management assessments would not have resulted in\nany additional impairment charge.\nInvestment in Polish subsidiary\nWe compared the carrying value of the investment in the Polish\nsubsidiary to the recoverable amount (less debt) of the underlying\nsubsidiary with reference to the disposal value included in the signed\nsale and purchase agreement.

The other information comprises the information included in the document titled “Annual\nfinancial statements 2024”, which includes the Directors’ Report, the Audit Committee’s Report and the Company Secretary’s Certificate as\nrequired by the Companies Act of South Africa, which we obtained prior to the date of this auditor’s report, and the other sections of the\ndocument titled “The SPAR Group Ltd Integrated Annual Report”, which is expected to be made available to us after that date. The other\ninformation does not include the consolidated or the separate financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.\nOur opinion on the consolidated and separate financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not and will not express an\naudit opinion or any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\nIn connection with our audit of the consolidated and separate financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified\nabove and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated and separate financial statements\nor our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\nIf, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditor’s report, we conclude that\nthere is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\nResponsibilities of the directors for the consolidated and separate financial\nstatements\nThe directors are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated and separate financial statements in accordance with\nIFRS Accounting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa, and for such internal control as the directors determine\nis necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated and separate financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due\nto fraud or error.\nIn preparing the consolidated and separate financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group and the Company’s\nability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of\naccounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group and/or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative\nbut to do so.\nAuditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated and separate financial\nstatements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated and separate financial statements as a whole are free from\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high\nlevel of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it\nexists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be\nexpected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated and separate financial statements.\n11\nTHE SPAR GROUP LTD ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit.\nWe also:\n• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated and separate financial statements, whether due to fraud or error,\ndesign and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a\nbasis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as\nfraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances,\nbut not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s and the Company’s internal control.\n• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made\nby the directors.\n• Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained,\nwhether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s and the Company’s\nability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s\nreport to the related disclosures in the consolidated and separate financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our\nopinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or\nconditions may cause the Group and/or Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated and separate financial statements, including the disclosures,\nand whether the consolidated and separate financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves\nfair presentation.\n• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to\nexpress an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the\nGroup audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\nWe communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings,\nincluding any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\nWe also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to\ncommunicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable,\nactions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\nFrom the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated\nand separate financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s\nreport unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a\nmatter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh\nthe public interest benefits of such communication.\nReport on other legal and regulatory requirements\nIn terms of the IRBA Rule published in Government Gazette Number 39475 dated 4 December 2015, we report that PricewaterhouseCoopers\nInc. has been the auditor of The SPAR Group Limited for 7 years.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Inc.\nDirector: TJ Howatt\nRegistered Auditor\nWaterfall City, South Africa\n27 November 2024\n12\nTHE SPAR GROUP LTD ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDirectors’ report\nThe directors of the Company have the pleasure in submitting their report on the audited annual financial statements of the Company for the\nyear ended 30 September 2024.\nNature of business\nSPAR is a warehousing and distribution business listed on the JSE Limited (JSE) in the food and drug retailer’s sector.

(PwC) has served as SPAR’s external auditor for seven years, with Thomas Howatt as the designated audit\npartner since 19 May 2020. The committee evaluated PwC and Thomas Howatt and found no concerns regarding their performance or\nindependence based on audit quality indicators and regulatory criteria.\nThomas Howatt will rotate out as the designated audit partner in 2025. The committee recommended re-electing PwC for the 2025 financial year.\nAfter conducting interviews with suitable candidates, the committee recommended Pieter Pelcher as the designated audit partner to replace\nThomas Howatt. These recommendations are included as a resolution for approval at the 2025 AGM, under section 61(8)(c)(i) of the Companies\nAct and paragraph 3.84 (g)(iv) of the JSE Listing Requirements. The committee satisfied itself that the external auditor, PwC, and its audit\npartner, complied with the suitability criteria for appointment as required in terms of paragraph 3.84(g)(iii) read with paragraphs 3.86 and 3.87\nof the JSE Listings Requirements.\nFor external audit, the committee assessed independence and performance at each meeting, and reviewed documentation related to audit and\nnon-audit services to ensure compliance with policies.\nThe committee reviewed the policy and controls related to non-audit services and found them satisfactory. The committee agreed the terms of\nengagement and fees for audit services provided by PwC, and reviewed the non-audit services provided, as detailed in note 3 of the annual\nfinancial statements.\nThe Chair met with the external auditor independently of management to discuss any concerns, and no issues were raised. We are satisfied\nthat the external auditor is independent of the Group.\nKey audit matters\nKey audit matters identified by the external auditors are detailed in the annual financial statements. The matters which were most significant in\nthe audit of the consolidated and separate financial statements, were discussed and agreed upon with management and presented to\nthe committee.\nWhile the auditors considered these issues in their overall audit and in forming their opinion, they did not issue a separate opinion on these\nspecific matters. The committee considered the appropriateness of the key audit matters reported in the external audit opinion.\nInternal audit\nFrom the start of the 2024 financial year, the internal audit function was fully outsourced to EY, which had already been overseeing the Group’s\nSAP programme as part of the IT audit. The committee approved the internal audit plan for 2024 and 2025 and evaluated the audit findings and\naudit plans and agreed timelines by management to address identified gaps.\nThe committee approved and recommended the internal audit charter to the Board. It confirmed that the function fulfilled its objectives,\nensuring compliance with legal, regulatory and other obligations.\nInternal controls\nThe directors are responsible for the Company’s system of internal financial controls, which are designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial statements, safeguard assets and prevent and detect misstatements and loss.\nCommittee statement\nThe committee is of the opinion that the Company’s system of internal controls and risk\nmanagement is effective and that the internal financial controls form a sound basis for the\npreparation of reliable financial statements. This is based on the results of the formal\ndocumented review of the company’s system of internal controls and risk management,\nincluding the design, implementation and effectiveness of internal financial controls conducted\nby the internal audit function during the financial year. It also considers information and\nexplanations given by management and discussions with the external auditor on the results of\nthe external audit assessed by the Audit Committee.\nThe Audit Committee’s opinion is supported by the Board.\nDuring the year under review, the committee considered control weaknesses identified from various reports received by the committee in the\ncontext of the overall effectiveness of internal controls. Where deficient controls or matters were raised, the committee reviewed the progress\non remedial plans.\nThe committee confirmed that appropriate financial reporting procedures were in place and that those procedures are operating for all entities\nincluded in the consolidated Group IFRS financial statements and that financial information was available for accurate preparation and reporting.\n16\nTHE SPAR GROUP LTD ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nGroup CFO and finance function\nThe committee is satisfied that Mark Godfrey has the necessary expertise and experience for his role as Group CFO. It reviewed the expertise\nand resources of the Group’s finance function and found them adequate, with the senior management members responsible for the Group\nfunction meeting the required experience standards.\nCommittee priorities\nThe committee will focus on enhancing oversight and effectiveness. We will improve scrutiny across the Group by enhancing transparency and\nadherence to standards, as well as addressing past reputational issues through clear guidelines and robust oversight mechanisms. Ensuring\nappropriate procurement practices are entrenched in the Group and reviewing how internal controls are improved, will also be on the radar.\nThe focus on oversight and effectiveness will be supported by aligning SPAR’s combined assurance process, internal audit plan, and external\naudit plan through a risk-based approach.\nThe committee will also ensure conflicts of interest are identified and mitigated effectively by fostering a culture of accountability and rigorous\ninternal controls. Additionally, the committee will maintain strong oversight of the SAP system, including monitoring its implementation and\naddressing related performance and integration issues.\nManaging significant transactions, such as asset sales and debt-raising activities, will be another priority. The committee will ensure these\nprocesses are handled with due diligence, particularly in assessing management assumptions and evaluating their impact on the Group.\nAcquisitions will be closely scrutinised to ensure that associated risks are thoroughly evaluated and managed, including their impact on the\nGroup’s overall risk profile.\nFinally, the committee will assist the Board in evaluating strategic decisions, including the SPAR’s geographical presence and long-term\nstrengths, and reviewing methods to enhance loyalty while continuing to support retailer profitability.\nThanks go to the members of the committee for their dedicated and contructive contributions to the committee’s functioning.\nFunke Ighodaro\nAudit Committee Chair\n27 November 2024\n17\nTHE SPAR GROUP LTD ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nStatement of profit or loss and\nother comprehensive income\nfor the year ended 30 September 2024\nGROUP COMPANY\n2023 2023\nRmillion Notes 2024 Represented** 2024 Restated*\nContinuing operations\nRevenue – sale of merchandise 2 152 337.5 146 461.0 91 089.3 88 016.1\nCost of sales (134 158.4) (129 083.1) (83 264.9) (80 253.1)\nGross profit 18 179.1 17 377.9 7 824.4 7 763.0\nRevenue – other 2 3 145.5 2 984.9 1 122.8 1 026.7\nOther income 4 299.6 256.0 470.8 310.6\nNet operating expenses 3 (18 728.7) (18 102.1) (9 405.2) (9 178.2)\nWarehousing and distribution expenses (5 876.1) (5 520.1) (2 820.8) (2 701.6)\nMarketing and selling expenses (8 425.5) (7 697.9) (2 824.4) (2 767.6)\nAdministration and information technology expenses (4 210.0) (4 463.5) (1 935.8) (2 230.8)\nImpairment of assets (69.7) (190.1) (1 695.6) (1 304.7)\nNet ECL movement on financial assets (147.4) (230.5) (128.6) (173.5)\nOperating profit/(loss) 2 895.5 2 516.7 12.8 (77.9)\nOther non-operating items 5 (1.9) (13.0)\nFinance income 6.1 600.5 577.2 542.4 533.4\nFinance costs 6.2 (1 383.5) (1 245.5) (908.9) (816.9)\nShare of equity-accounted associate profits/(losses) 15 6.3 (7.0)\nProfit/(loss) before taxation 2 116.9 1 828.4 (353.7) (361.4)\nTaxation 7 (468.6) (465.2) (230.9) (217.4)\nProfit/(loss) after taxation from continuing operations 1 648.3 1 363.2 (584.6) (578.8)\nDiscontinued operation 42 (1 296.4) (920.7)\nProfit after taxation for the year 351.9 442.5\nAttributable to:\nEquity holders of the Company 351.9 401.3\nNon-controlling interests 41.2\nProfit after taxation attributable to owners: 351.9 401.3\nContinuing operations 1 648.3 1 322.0\nDiscontinued operation (1 296.4) (920.7)\nOther comprehensive income\nItems that will not be reclassified subsequently\nto profit or loss:\nRemeasurement of employee benefits (6.8) 6.0 (6.8) 6.0\nDeferred tax relating to remeasurement of employee\nbenefits 1.8 (1.6) 1.8 (1.6)\nRemeasurement of retirement funds 27.1 81.9 56.8\nDeferred tax relating to remeasurement of retirement funds (9.9) (6.9)\nItems that may be reclassified subsequently to profit\nor loss:\nExchange rate differences from translation of foreign\noperations (260.9) 530.8\nTotal comprehensive income/(loss) 158.0 1 027.6 (589.6) (574.4)\nAttributable to:\nEquity holders of the Company 158.0 986.4\nNon-controlling interests 41.2\n* Comparative information has been restated – refer to note 43 for further detail.\n** The Polish operation has been classified as discontinued and comparative numbers represented.

Accounting policies continued\n1.1 Basis of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements incorporate the results and financial position of the Company and all its subsidiaries, which are\ndefined as entities over which the Group has the ability to exercise control so as to obtain benefits from their activities. The results of\nsubsidiaries are included from the effective dates of acquisition and up to the effective dates of disposal. All inter-company transactions\nand balances between Group companies are eliminated. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of\nsubsidiaries to bring the accounting policies in line with those used by the Group.\nInvestments acquired with the intention of disposal within 12 months are not consolidated.\n1.2 Foreign currency transactions\nTransactions in currencies other than the rand are initially recorded at the exchange rate on the date of the transaction. All assets and\nliabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising on\nthe settlement of monetary items or on reporting the Group’s monetary items at rates different from those at which they were initially\nrecorded, are recognised to profit or loss in the period which they arise.\nThe individual financial statements of each Group entity are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which\nthe entity operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position\nof each entity is expressed in rand, which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated\nfinancial statements. For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign\noperations (including comparatives) are expressed in rand using exchange rates prevailing at year end. Profit or loss items (including\ncomparatives) are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuated significantly during that\nperiod, in which case the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions are used. All resulting translational differences are recognised\nin other comprehensive income and presented as a separate component of equity in the currency translation reserve.\nGoodwill and fair value adjustments to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed through acquisition of a foreign operation are\ntreated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the rate of exchange prevailing at the end of each reporting\nperiod. Exchange differences arising are recognised in other comprehensive income.\n1.3 Business combinations\nThe Company’s investments in ordinary shares of its subsidiaries are carried at cost less accumulated impairment and if denominated\nin foreign currencies, are translated at historical rates. With the Group policy as follows:\n1.3.1 Investment in subsidiaries\nSubsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group also considers the following facts and circumstances in assessing whether\nit has power over an entity:\na) Rights arising from contractual arrangements\nb) The Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights\nThe acquisition of businesses are accounted for under the acquisition method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate\nof the fair values, at the date of the exchange of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group\nin exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are generally recognised in profit or loss as incurred.\nSubsidiaries are consolidated from the date of acquisition, which is the date on which the Group obtains control of the subsidiary and\ncontinue to be consolidated until the date that control ceases.\n1.3.2 Goodwill\nThe acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 Business\nCombinations, are recognised at their fair values at acquisition date, with the difference between the consideration transferred\nrecognised as goodwill.\nGoodwill arising on acquisition is initially recognised at cost with an annual impairment test.\nFor the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (CGUs). CGUs to which\ngoodwill has been allocated are tested annually for impairment or more frequently when there is an indication that the CGU may be\nimpaired. Any impairment loss is recognised directly to profit and loss. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in\na subsequent period. On disposal of an entity, attributable goodwill is included in the determination of the profit and loss on disposal.\nIf the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs,\nthe Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted\nduring the measurement period, or additional assets or liabilities that are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts\nand circumstances that existed at the acquisition date, that if known, would have affected the amounts recognised at that date.\nFor assets acquired, to be considered a business, the acquisition would have to include an input and a substantive process that\ntogether significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs.\n27\nTHE SPAR GROUP LTD ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. Accounting policies continued\n1.3 Business combinations continued\n1.3.2 Goodwill continued\nWhen the consideration transferred by the Group in a business combination includes assets or liabilities resulting from a contingent\nconsideration arrangement, the contingent consideration is measured at its acquisition date fair value and included as part of the\npurchase consideration in a business combination. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration that qualify as measurement\nperiod adjustments are adjusted retrospectively, with corresponding adjustments against goodwill. Measurement period adjustments\nare adjustments that arise from additional information obtained during the “measurement period” (which cannot exceed one year from\nthe acquisition date) about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date.\nThe subsequent accounting for changes in fair value of the contingent consideration that do not qualify as measurement period\nadjustments depends on how the contingent consideration is classified. A contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not\nremeasured at subsequent reporting dates and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Contingent consideration that\nis classified as an asset or a liability is remeasured at subsequent reporting dates in accordance with IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, or\nIAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, as appropriate, with the corresponding gain or loss being recognised\nin profit or loss.\n1.3.3 Non-controlling interests (NCI)\nRepresents their present share of ownership interests and are measured at their proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net\nassets at the date of acquisition.\nArrangements to acquire non-controlling interests at future dates are recognised as financial liabilities at the present value of the\nexpected payment. Changes in the measurement of the financial liability due to unwinding of the discount, changes in the expected\nfuture payment or foreign exchange translation are recognised in profit or loss as a fair value adjustment. The effect of translating\nthe closing balance of financial liabilities to the reporting currency is reported in other comprehensive income. In such cases,\nThe SPAR Group Ltd consolidates 100% of the subsidiary’s results.\n1.3.4 Consolidated entities\nEntities where SPAR has effective control through control over the Board are consolidated using the principles described above.\n1.3.5 Change in ownership interests\nEntities where SPAR has acquired a further share capital arising in control of the investee, shall be treated as a business combination\nthrough a step acquisition.\nSPAR shall remeasure its previously held equity interest in the acquiree at its acquisition date fair value and recognise the resulting gain\nor loss, if any, in profit or loss or other comprehensive income, as appropriate.\n1.3.6 Inter-company transactions\nAll inter-group balances, transactions, income and expenses are eliminated in full in the consolidated annual financial statements.\n1.4 Investment in associates and joint ventures\nAssociates include investees for which SPAR has a significant influence but not control. Significant influence is currently assessed as\na shareholding greater than 20% and the IFRS 10 control assessment is not met.\nJoint ventures include investments for which SPAR holds shared control with other investors in equal proportion.\nThe Company’s investments in ordinary shares of its associates and joint ventures are carried at cost less accumulated impairment and\nif denominated in foreign currencies, are translated at historical rates.\nThe results and assets and liabilities of associates and joint ventures are incorporated in these consolidated financial statements using\nthe equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, an investment in an associate or joint venture is initially recognised in the\nconsolidated statement of financial position at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group’s share of the profit or loss and other\ncomprehensive income of the associate or joint venture.\nWhen the Group’s share of losses of an associate and joint venture exceeds the Group’s interest in that associate or joint venture the\nGroup discontinues recognising its share of further losses. Additional losses are recognised only to the extent that the Group has\nincurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture.\n28\nTHE SPAR GROUP LTD ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. Accounting policies continued\n1.5 Property, plant and equipment (PPE)\nProperty, plant and equipment are initially recognised at cost, plus any initial direct costs incurred directly attributable to bringing the\nasset to a point capable of operating in the manner intended by management and subsequently measured at cost less accumulated\ndepreciation and accumulated impairment losses.\nLand and buildings are held for use in the supply of goods.\nImprovements to leasehold properties are shown at cost and written off over the remaining period of the lease and the asset’s useful life.\nThe cost less residual values of property, plant and equipment is depreciated over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis.\nThe useful lives and residual values of all assets are reviewed annually and are adjusted should any changes arise. Depreciation is\nrecognised in profit or loss. No depreciation is provided for land and assets under construction. The following depreciation rates apply\nto the categories below:\nCategory Depreciation method Useful life\nBuildings Straight line 0% – 2% per annum\nMotor vehicles Straight line 10% – 25% per annum\nInternal transport, plant and equipment Straight line 6.7% – 33.3% per annum\nOffice equipment, fixtures and fittings Straight line 4% – 33.3% per annum\nComputer equipment Straight line 10% – 33.3% per annum\nAssets are tested for impairment, when there is an indication that it may be impaired, by determining the recoverable amount of the\nassets at a CGU level. With any resulting impairment recognised in profit or loss should the recoverable amount have declined below\nthe carrying value of the asset.\n1.6 Right-of-use (ROU) assets and leases\nROU assets include all categories of assets as described in the PPE note above. These ROU assets are measured at cost comprising\nof the initial measurement of the lease liability, initial direct cost, any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less\nany incentives received.\nROU assets are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses and are depreciated\nover the shorter period between the lease term and the useful life of the asset on a straight line basis.\nWhere the Group head leases a property and enters into a back-to-back sublease arrangement with a lessee, the Group recognises\na lease receivable rather than a ROU asset. Depreciation is recognised on the shorter of the lease term or useful life of the leased asset.\nLease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are due at the commencement date, discounted using\nthe interest rate implicit in the lease, where this cannot be determined the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is used. Financing income\nis recognised and measured on the lease liability as described in 1.10 below.\nLease liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost and remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising\nfrom a change in term or if the Group changes its assessment on whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option at\nthe end of the contract.\nThe Group has applied the use of a single discount rate to each portfolio of leases that have reasonably similar terms, underlying assets\nand economic circumstances. The majority of property leases within each segment are on similar underlying assets (stores) within\nsimilar economic environments, and with the same lease terms. However, the Irish portfolio of leases is further split into leases based\nin Ireland and in the UK.\nThe Group accounts for leases with lease terms of less than 12 months as short-term leases. No ROU asset recognised with lease\npayments recognised as an expense, on a straight line basis, in profit or loss.\nVariable payment terms are mainly used on the lease of a store where a portion of the rental is based on the turnover made by the store.\nVariable payment terms also occur when the utility costs related to a property are on-charged as part of the rental. These variable lease\npayments are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which the condition that triggers those payments occurs.\nSPAR considers smaller items of leased equipment as “low value” with corresponding lease payments recognised on a straight line\nbasis in profit or loss.\n29\nTHE SPAR GROUP LTD ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. Accounting policies continued\n1.7 Intangible assets\nIntangible assets comprise those identifiable non-monetary assets without physical substance. Intangible assets acquired through\nbusiness combinations are recognised separately from goodwill are initially recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date (which is\nregarded as their cost).\nSubsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets acquired in a business combination are measured at cost less accumulated\namortisation and any recognised impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets that are acquired separately and are\namortised on a straight line basis over its useful life.\nComputer software and licences are recognised at cost, plus any initial direct costs incurred directly attributable to bringing the asset\nto a point capable of operating in the manner intended by management and are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated\namortisation and any recognised impairment losses.\nIntangible assets acquired separately and through business combinations are amortised on a straight line basis over its useful life with\ncomputer software and licences amortised on a straight line basis at a range between 8.3% and 20%.\nAcquired brands and licences are considered to have indefinite useful lives and are not amortised but are tested at least annually for\nimpairment and carried at cost less any recognised impairment.\nAs required by the applicable accounting standards, management conducts annual impairment tests to assess the recoverability of the\ncarrying value of goodwill and indefinite useful life intangible assets. Determining whether goodwill and indefinite useful life intangible\nassets are impaired requires an estimation of the value-in-use of the CGU to which the goodwill and intangible assets relate. The value-\nin-use calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the CGU and a suitable discount rate\nto calculate the present value. Details of the assumptions used in the impairment tests are in note 13.\nAn intangible asset is derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from use or disposal. Gains or\nlosses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset, measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the\ncarrying amount of the asset, are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised.\nGeneral and specific borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are\ncapitalised during the period of time that is required to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use or sale. Qualifying assets\nare assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use.\n1.8 Revenue from contract with customers\nOur revenue mainly comprise the revenue from the sale of merchandise, marketing and promotional activities as well as franchise fees.\nRevenue is recognised on a transfer of control basis.\nRevenue from sale of merchandise include warehouse and dropshipment sales which are recognised only once all performance\nobligations of SPAR to the retailer have been satisfied and to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur.\nTransfer of control occurs at a point in time on the day our merchandise is delivered to the retailer together with a signed goods received\nnote.\nOther revenue includes marketing services rendered, promotional activities provided and franchise fees received. Marketing and\npromotional activities are recognised in terms of the relevant contractual arrangements. The Group is satisfied that these services are\ndistinct within the context of the relevant contracts. Transfer of control occurs over time in which the services are rendered and in the\ncase of franchise fees over the duration of the contract.\nRevenue from sales is measured based on the price specified in the contract net of value added tax (VAT), rebates, discounts and\nother allowances.\nThe Group does not expect to have any contracts where the period between the transfer of goods or services, and the receipt of\npayment exceeds a year as the payment for sales is either due immediately or made with a credit term of between 15 and 48 days,\nwhich is consistent with market practice. Therefore, the transaction prices are not adjusted for the time value of money.\n30\nTHE SPAR GROUP LTD ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. Accounting policies continued\n1.9 Other income\nComprises dividends, rental, commission income insurance proceeds, guarantee fees and income from marketing or sundry services\nall-inclusive of both amounts received and accrued for.\nDividend received is recognised as and when the Company is entitled to receive such dividend unless the dividend is due from an entity\nwhich operates under severe long-term restrictions. Dividends from these companies are recognised on a cash basis.\nRental income in respect of short-term leases is recognised on a straight line basis over the lease term.\nIncome from marketing and other services is recognised when the related promotional activity or service has occurred. Other income\nis measured at fair value being the consideration received.\n1.10 Finance income and costs\nFinance income include interest received or accrued on surplus cash balances, loans receivable, lease receivables, overdue debtors\nand the financial asset described in 1.16. This income is recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest rate method.\nFinance costs include interest paid or accrued on bank overdrafts, loans payable, lease liabilities and the financial liabilities described\nin 1.16. This expense is recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest rate method.\n1.11 Cost of sales\nCost of sales represents the net cost of purchases from suppliers after discounts, rebates and incentive allowances received from\nsuppliers, adjusted for opening and closing inventory.\nRebates and allowances include volume-related rebates, promotional and marketing allowances, other fees and discounts, and are\nreceived in connection with the purchase of goods or for the provision of services.\n1.12 Inventories\nThe carrying value of inventory comprise the stock on hand at the reporting date net of any obsolescence provision raised.\nStock is initially measured at cost, which comprise the cost to purchase, cost of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the\ninventories to their present location and condition and is subsequently measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.\nCost is determined on a weighted average basis. Obsolete, redundant and slow-moving inventory is identified and written down\nto estimated economic or realisable values. Net realisable value represents the selling price less all estimated costs to be incurred in the\nmarketing, selling and distribution thereof.\nWhen inventory is sold, the carrying amount is recognised to cost of sales. Any write-down of inventory to net realisable value and all\nlosses of inventory or reversals of previous write-downs are recognised in cost of sales.\nThe provision for obsolescence represents management’s estimate of the extent to which inventory on hand at the reporting date will\nbe sold below cost. This estimate takes into consideration past trends, evidence of impairment at year end and an assessment of future\nsaleability.\n1.13 Provisions\nProvisions are recognised when the Company has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, where it is probable that\nan outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount\nof the obligation can be made.\nProvisions are raised for supplier claims when distribution centres expect a cash outflow to occur for claims made by suppliers.\nSupplier provisions are subsequently measured using managements best estimate on the outflow expected to occur resulting in\nincreases or decreases to the said provision.\nThe provisions for supplier claims, termination of leases and onerous leases represent management’s best estimate of the Group’s\nliability. The supplier claims provision represents the value of disputed deliveries and other issues. Termination of leases relates to\nspecific leases which have been identified for surrender. The provision is based on historic experience of three years’ rental to surrender.\nOnerous lease provisions represent the value by which the unavoidable costs of meeting lease obligations exceed the economic\nbenefits expected to be received under certain lease agreements.\n31\nTHE SPAR GROUP LTD ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1.

Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible\nto known amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value, are initially carried at cost and subsequently\nmeasured at cost and where these balances are denominated in foreign currencies, are translated at the relevant closing exchange rates.\nBank overdrafts are disclosed separately on the face of the statement of financial position.\n1.15 Capital and reserves\nCapital and reserves of the Group include the following:\n• Share capital\n• Reserves\n• Treasury shares\nShare capital includes the ordinary shares issued by the Company and is recorded at the net of proceeds received and issue costs.\nReserves include the foreign currency translation (FCTR), share-based payment (SBP). The FCTR comprises the effect of translating\nGroup companies from their functional currency to rands at the respective reporting date. While the SBP reserve arises as a result\nof IFRS 2 transactions the relevant share scheme and is measured net of options/shares granted to and taken up by participants.\nTreasury shares are purchases made by the Group of its own equity instruments and those held in a trust. The consideration paid\nis deducted from equity. Where shares repurchased are subsequently sold, the consideration received is included in equity attributable\nto owners of The SPAR Group Ltd, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction cost and the related tax effects. No profit\nor loss is recorded.\n1.16 Financial instruments\nFinancial assets and liabilities are recognised in the statement of financial position when the Company or Group becomes a party\nto the contractual provisions of the instrument. The below is an illustration of our major categories of financial instruments including how\nthese are recognised and measured:\nCategory Includes Recognition and measurement\nFinancial assets Loans and other receivables Initially recognised at fair value plus initial direct\nBlock discounting loan receivable costs and subsequently measured at amortised\nTrade and other receivables cost using the effective interest rate method less\nLease receivables expected credit losses.\nCash and cash equivalents\nFinancial liabilities Long-term borrowings Initially recognised at fair value plus initial direct\nBlock discounting loan payables costs and subsequently measured at amortised\nOther financial liabilities cost using the effective interest rate method less\nBank overdrafts expected credit losses.\nLease liability\nFinancial guarantee contracts The guarantees provided by the Group These financial guarantees are accounted for\nto subsidiaries and affiliates. under IFRS 9 recognised as financial liabilities and\nmust be measured at their fair value upon initial\nrecognition. Subsequently, they are measured\nat the higher of the expected credit losses (ECL)\ncalculated in accordance with IFRS 9’s impairment\nmodel, or the amount initially recognised less\nthe cumulative amount of income recognised in\naccordance with the principles of IFRS 15.\n32\nTHE SPAR GROUP LTD ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. Accounting policies continued\n1.16 Financial instruments continued\nThe Group makes use of an allowance account to recognise any loss allowances as prescribed by IFRS 9 Financial Instruments.\nThe Group estimates its ECL provision as follows:\nTrade and other receivables:\nThe simplified method is used, whereby lifetime expected losses are estimated using a matrix approach. Historical loss rates are\nadjusted for forward looking factors to calculate an adjusted rate which is applied to the trade receivable balances in various ageing\nbuckets (after removing specifically provided for debtors).\nLoans and other financial assets:\nA probability of default (PD) method is used and involves applying these PDs to the various loans in its relevant stages, taking into\naccount relevant forward looking factors.\nIn measuring the financial guarantee contracts, management applied judgement in assessing the best estimate of the expenditure\nto settle the present obligation. The risks and uncertainties that inevitably surround many events and circumstances shall be taken into\naccount in reaching the best estimate of the provision. Management has assessed that the amount that it would rationally pay to settle\nthe obligation is nil. Refer to note 34 for further details.\n1.17 Employee benefits\nEmployee benefits comprise the following:\n• Short-term benefits\n• Post-employment medical aid benefits\n• Post-employment retirement benefits\n• Long-term employee benefits\nShort-term benefits include the employee’s basic salary, performance-related bonuses, travel allowances and other benefits. Short-\nterm employee benefits are recognised as incurred, usually the earlier of payment or accrual date. The expected cost of bonus\npayments are recognised as an expense when there is a legal or constructive obligation to make such payments as a result of\npast performances.\nThe Company provides post-retirement healthcare benefits to certain of its retirees. The entitlement to these benefits is based on\nqualifying employees remaining in service until retirement age. These are measured using the projected unit credit method of valuation\nis used to calculate the post-retirement medical aid obligations, which costs are accrued over the period of employment. Actuarial gains\nand losses are recognised immediately in equity as other comprehensive income. These benefits are actuarially valued annually.\nThe liability is unfunded.\nPost-retirement benefits include the payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans which are recognised as an expense\nwhen employees have rendered services entitling them to the contributions.\nFor defined benefit plans, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations\nbeing carried out at the end of each reporting period. The Group presents the service costs and net interest income or expense in profit\nor loss in the line item “defined benefit plan expenses”. Curtailment gains and losses are accounted for as past service costs.\nRemeasurements, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the changes to the asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return on\nplan assets (excluding interest) are reflected immediately in the consolidated statement of financial position with a charge or credit\nrecognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.\nRemeasurements recognised in other comprehensive income are reflected immediately in retained earnings and shall not be reclassified\nto profit or loss.\nPast service costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period of a plan amendment.\nNet interest is calculated by applying the discount rate at the beginning of the period to the net defined benefit liability or asset.\nThe retirement benefit obligation recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position represents the actual deficit or surplus\nin the Group’s defined benefit plans. Any surplus resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of any economic benefits\navailable in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plans.\nFor defined benefit plans, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations\nbeing carried out at the end of each reporting period.\n33\nTHE SPAR GROUP LTD ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. Accounting policies continued\n1.17 Employee benefits continued\nLong-term employee benefits include long service awards payable to employees per human resources policy and share-based\npayments.\nThe Group provides long service awards to employees based on their length of service. These awards are classified as long-term\nemployee benefits under IAS 19 and are measured at the present value of the obligation. Current service costs are recognised in profit\nor loss, while actuarial gains and losses arising from changes in assumptions are recognised in other comprehensive income in the\nperiod in which they occur.\nShare option scheme\nThe Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. These share-based payments are measured at fair value\nat the date of the grant and are recognised to profit or loss on a straight line basis over the vesting period, with a corresponding\nadjustment to the share-based payment reserve. Fair value is measured at grant date by use of a binomial model. The expected life\nused in the model is adjusted, based on management’s best estimate of the effect of non-market vesting conditions.\nThe scheme has been closed and all options have either been expired or forfeited.\nConditional share plan (CSP)\nThe Group operates a CSP under which it receives services from employees as consideration for equity instruments of the Company.\nIn terms of the CSP, the Group has granted shares to executives, senior management and key talent specifically identified in the form\nof performance share awards.\nEquity-settled share-based payments are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date. The fair value of the\nemployee service received in exchange for the grant of shares is recognised as an expense on a straight line basis over the vesting\nperiod, with a corresponding adjustment to the share-based payment reserve. The total amount to be expensed is determined by\nreference to the fair value of shares granted, including any market performance conditions and excluding the impact of any non-market\nperformance vesting conditions. Non-market performance vesting conditions are included in the assumptions regarding the number of\nshares granted that are expected to vest. At the end of each reporting period, the Group revises its estimates of the number of shares\ngranted that are expected to vest. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss such that the\ncumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to the share-based payments reserve.\n1.18 Taxation\nThe taxation expense is determined as the sum of the current and deferred taxation amounts recognised in profit or loss. Current tax\nassets or liabilities arise from the balance receivable or payable to relevant tax authorities.\nCurrent taxation is payable based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit will differ from reported profit because it will exclude items\nof profit or loss that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s\nliability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date.\nDeferred tax assets or liabilities arise from timing differences between IFRS and relevant tax laws creating future charges or deductions\nfor taxation purposes.\nDeferred taxation is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and the corresponding tax bases\nused in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the statement of financial position method. Deferred tax liabilities\nand assets are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and effectively represents the “accrual” adjustment to current\ntaxation payable excluding the effect of permanent differences.\nDeferred taxation is calculated using taxation rates at the statement of financial position date and is charged or credited to the statement\nof comprehensive income, except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred taxation\nis dealt with in equity.\nDeferred taxation assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill.\nDeferred taxation assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which future\ndeductible temporary differences can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred taxation assets are reviewed at each reporting date\nand reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available.\n34\nTHE SPAR GROUP LTD ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. Accounting policies continued\n1.19 Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations\nAssets Held for Sale\nNon-current assets, or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities, are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be\nrecovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.\nThis classification is made only when the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition, subject only\nto terms that are usual and customary for sales of such asset and the sale is highly probable, with management committed to a plan\nto sell, and the sale is expected to be completed within one year from the date of classification.\nNon-current assets and disposal groups held for sale are measured at the lower of its carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.\nDepreciation ceases on non-current assets once classified as held for sale.\nAny impairment losses arising from the initial classification as held for sale and subsequent gains or losses on remeasurement are\nrecognised in profit or loss. Gains are not recognised in excess of cumulative impairment losses.\nDiscontinued Operations\nA discontinued operation is a component of the Group that has either been disposed of or is classified as held for sale and:\n• Represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations;\n• Is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or\n• Is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.\nThe results of discontinued operations, net of tax, are presented separately in the statement of comprehensive income as a single line\nitem. Comparative figures are represented to reflect discontinued operations separately from continuing operations.\nWhere a discontinued operation is disposed of, any resulting gain or loss on disposal is calculated as the difference between the net\nproceeds from the sale and the carrying amount of the asset or disposal group, including any associated goodwill.\n1.20 Key management judgements and estimates\nThere are a number of areas where judgement is applied in the application of the accounting policies in the consolidated financial\nstatements. Significant areas of judgements and estimates have been identified as:\nConsolidation of Guilds\nManagement have consolidated the Guilds on the basis that The SPAR Group Ltd has effective control over these entities in accordance\nwith a control assessment performed by management with reference to the requirements of IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements.\nManagement concluded that in relation to the marketing and advertising activities of the Guilds, the Guilds act as an agent on behalf of\nthe independent retailers who form part of the voluntary trading groups. As a result, the Guilds account for the marketing and advertising\nincome and expenditure as an agent, i.e. on a net agency basis. This net amount is then included in the consolidated statement of profit\nor loss and other comprehensive income.\nControl over retail stores acquired\nNote 33 details the acquisition of retail stores. In these acquisitions 100% of the assets of the business were acquired. The directors of\nthe Company assessed whether or not the Group has control over these retail stores based on whether the Group has the practical\nability to direct the relevant activities of the stores unilaterally. As no other party has the ability to direct the activities of the business,\nthe directors concluded that the Group has control over the retail stores acquired.\nAcquisition of assets vs business\nAn acquisition is considered a business combination if the assets acquired and liabilities assumed constitute a business. Management\napplies judgement in order to assess whether assets purchased constitute a business by assessing the facts and circumstances of the\ntransaction. Management considers whether the purchase includes an integrated set of activities (inputs and processes) that is capable\nof being managed and conducted in order to provide a return. In instances where only an asset such as a property, is purchased, with\nno related processes and inputs, this is treated as an acquisition of an asset rather than a business. In instances such as the purchase\nof a store, which includes the employment of staff, and processes relating to the running of the store that can be managed in order\nto provide a return, the assets acquired are treated as a business in terms of IFRS 3.\n35\nTHE SPAR GROUP LTD ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. Accounting policies continued\n1.20 Key management judgements and estimates continued\nMacro-economic forward looking factors in expected loss model\nThe Group has identified the inflation rate, fuel costs, the prime interest rate and the unemployment rate as the most relevant factors in\ncalculating a forward looking adjustment to the historical loss rates. These have been applied to the loss rates used in the expected\ncredit loss model for loans and trade and other receivables.\nProbability of vesting of rights to equity instruments granted in terms of the CSP\nThe cumulative expense recognised in terms of the Group’s CSP reflects, in the opinion of the directors, the number of rights to equity\ninstruments granted that will ultimately vest. At each reporting date, the unvested rights are adjusted by the number forfeited during the\nyear to reflect the actual number of instruments outstanding. Management is of the opinion that this number, adjusted for future attrition\nrates and performance conditions, represents the most accurate estimate of the number of instruments that will ultimately vest.\nSupplier rebates\nManagement applied judgement in assessing whether rebates and other income should be presented as a reduction of cost of sales,\nincluded in revenue – other or offset in expenses. In this regard, management assessed whether the services provided to the suppliers\nare considered part of the overall supplier relationship in accordance with IAS 2 Inventories, or are distinct and specific services, or\nwhether the income received represents a genuine refund of selling expenses.\nDropshipment agent vs principal\nRevenue from the sale of merchandise is recognised as and when the control over goods and services are transferred to customers.\nThe Group has assessed its dropshipment sales which is recorded on a gross principal basis and has concluded that this will continue\nto be recognised on a gross basis.\nTaxation\nThe Group is subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgement is required in determining the worldwide accrual for\nincome taxes. There are many transactions and calculations during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax\ndetermination is uncertain. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated income tax positions based on best informed estimates of\nwhether additional income taxes will be due. Where the final income tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that\nwere initially recorded, such differences will impact the current income tax and deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the period\nin which such determination is made.\nEstimation is also required of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their tax base. Deferred\ntax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences but, where there are deductible temporary differences, management’s\njudgement is required as to whether a deferred tax asset should be recognised based on the availability of future taxable profits.\nLease renewals\nIn determining the number of years of rental payments which should be present valued for the purpose of IFRS 16, renewal options\nshould be considered when the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise.\nIn South Africa, the majority of property leases are entered into for an initial period of 10 years, with renewal options of five years. It has\nbeen concluded that these renewal options will only be recognised when it is reasonably certain that they will be entered into which is\ngenerally within six months of the renewal coming into effect.\nIn Ireland, management identify leases for which they are reasonably certain not to exercise break clauses. No renewal assumptions/\nrights have been incorporated into the lease terms.\nIn Switzerland, renewal clauses have been taken into account on a lease by lease basis where it is applicable and it is considered to be\nreasonably certain that the Group will exercise the renewal options in order to retain control of the sites.\nIn determining the number of years of rental payments which should be present valued for the purpose of IFRS 16, renewal options\nshould be considered when the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise.\n36\nTHE SPAR GROUP LTD ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. Accounting policies continued\n1.20 Key management judgements and estimates continued\nSegmental reporting\nThe principal segments of the Group have been identified on a primary basis by geographical segment which is representative of the\ninternal reporting used for management purposes as well as the source and nature of business risks and returns. These geographical\nsegments also represent operating segments as they meet the quantitative threshold.\nOther non-operating items\nOther non-operating items comprise business acquisition costs.\nIntangible asset cost allocation\nThe Group has embarked on a programme to design, build and deploy a SAP template for the South African business. The development\nof the SAP template constitutes the development of an internally generated intangible asset, which will ultimately be split within the\nSouth African business between local divisional distribution centres (DCs). The unit of account for the purpose of the capitalisation of\ndevelopment costs is a matter of judgement. Each instance of the implementation within the respective DC is considered to be a\nseparate unit of account. The quantification for costs allocation to each DC is driven by the licences linked to the SAP project on the\ndate of the DC going live. The capital work in progress amounts are recognised and tested for impairment in South Africa using the\ndiscounted cash flows for the SPAR Group Limited separate Company.\nGROUP COMPANY\nRmillion 2024 2023 2024 2023\n2.

Taxation continued\nIn December 2021, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) released a draft legislative framework for\na global minimum tax that is expected to be used by individual jurisdictions. The goal of the framework is to reduce the shifting of profit\nfrom one jurisdiction to another in order to reduce global tax obligations in corporate structures. In March 2022, the OECD released\ndetailed technical guidance on Pillar Two of the rules.\nThe OECD Pillar Two model rules apply to multinational enterprises that have consolidated revenues (which, as defined by the OECD,\ninclude any form of income and are therefore not limited to revenue recognised in accordance with IFRS 15) of €750 million in at least\ntwo out of the last four years.\nThe Group is within the scope of the OECD Pillar Two model rules which have been substantively enacted in Ireland, UK and Switzerland\nand will come into effect in the 2025 financial period. Since the Pillar Two legislation was not effective at the reporting date, the Group\nhas no related current tax exposure.\nThe Group applies the IAS 12 exception to recognising and disclosing information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to\nPillar Two income taxes. Under the legislation, the Group is liable to pay a top-up tax for the difference between the GloBE effective tax\nrate for each jurisdiction and the 15% minimum rate. If the effective tax rate based on accounting profit of a jurisdiction is below 15%,\nthe Group’s exposure to paying Pillar Two income taxes might not be for the full difference in tax rates in relation to that jurisdiction. This\nis due to the impact of specific adjustments envisaged in the Pillar Two legislation which give rise to different effective tax rates\ncompared to those calculated in accordance with IAS 12.\nThe Group is in the process of assessing its exposure to the Pillar Two legislation for when it comes into effect. The approach followed\nhas been to determine whether the jurisdictions that the Group operates in qualify for any of the Transitional CBCR Safe Harbours.\nWhere this is not the case, a high level GLoBE Income calculation has been performed to determine the potential top-up tax payable.\nBased on management’s assessment, most of the jurisdictions that the Group operates in will meet at least one of the Transitional Safe\nHarbour tests, resulting in no top-up tax being due for that jurisdiction. Ireland is however expected to pay a top-up tax, the quantum\nis not expected to be significant at this stage.\n8. Earnings per share\nEarnings per share is calculated using the weighted average number of ordinary shares (net of treasury shares) in issue during the year.\nIn the case of basic earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares (net of treasury shares) in issue during the year\nwas 192 584 666 (2023: 192 379 568). In respect of diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares (net of\ntreasury shares) was 192 654 607 (2023: 192 450 389).\nThe calculation of the basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to ordinary shareholders is based on the following data:\nGROUP COMPANY\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nEarnings\nEarnings for the purpose of basic and diluted\nearnings per share (profit for the year attributable\nto equity holders of the Company) Rmillion 351.9 401.3 (584.6) (654.4)\nEarnings per share:\nBasic cents 182.7 208.6\nDiluted cents 182.7 208.5\nNumber of shares\nWeighted average number of ordinary shares (net of\ntreasury shares) for the purposes of basic earnings\nper share ‘000 192 585 192 380 192 585 192 380\nEffect of diluted potential ordinary shares:\nShare options and contingently issuable ordinary\nshares ‘000 70 71 70 71\nWeighted average number of ordinary shares (net of\ntreasury shares) for the purposes of diluted earnings\nper share ‘000 192 655 192 451 192 655 192 451\n40\nTHE SPAR GROUP LTD ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nGROUP\nRmillion 2024 2023\n9.

Segment reporting\nSegment accounting policies are consistent with those adopted for the preparation of the condensed consolidated financial results.\nThe principal segments of the Group have been identified on a primary basis by geographical segment, which is representative of the\ninternal reporting used for management purposes as well as the source and nature of business risks and returns. These geographical\nsegments also represent operating segments as they meet the quantitative thresholds.\nThe chief executive officer is the chief operating decision maker (CODM) and assesses the performance of the operating segments\nbased on profit before tax and for joint ventures and associates based on earnings after tax, and is of the opinion that the operations\nof the individual distribution centres within Southern Africa are substantially similar to one another and that the risks and returns of these\ndistribution centres are likewise similar. The risks and returns of the Ireland, Switzerland and Poland operations are not considered to\nbe similar to those within Southern Africa or each other and are therefore disclosed as separate reportable segments.\n41\nTHE SPAR GROUP LTD ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n11. Segment reporting continued\nAs a result, the geographical segments of the Group have been identified as Southern Africa, Ireland, Switzerland and Poland.\nAll segment revenue and expenses are directly attributable to the segments. Segment assets and liabilities include all operating assets\nand liabilities used by a segment, with the exception of inter-segment assets and liabilities, and IFRS adjustments made by segments\nto their management report for the purposes of IFRS compliance. These assets and liabilities are all directly attributable to the segments.\nThe principal activity of the reporting segments is the wholesale and distribution of goods and services to SPAR grocery stores and\nmultiple other branded Group retail outlets.\nThe Group deals with a broad spread of customers, with no single customer exceeding 10% of the Group’s revenue.\nAnalysis per reportable segment:\nSouthern Consolidated\nRmillion Africa Ireland Switzerland Poland* Total\n2024\nStatement of profit or loss\nRevenue from contracts with customers 97 110.6 41 323.6 17 048.8 155 483.0\nCost of sales 86 868.6 34 486.8 12 803.0 134 158.4\nDepreciation and amortisation 496.0 789.0 969.3 2 254.3\nTotal employment costs 3 520.4 2 808.3 1 975.2 8 303.9\nImpairment of goodwill 19.7 19.7\nDelivery costs – Fuel 950.1 633.0 132.3 1 715.4\nAdvertising 1 102.2 270.3 298.6 1 671.1\nOperating profit 1 461.0 1 216.8 217.7 2 895.5\nProfit before tax 1 108.0 925.1 83.8 2 116.9\nFinance income 572.0 15.8 12.7 600.5\nFinance costs 931.3 305.6 146.6 1 383.5\nShare of equity-accounted associate profits 6.3 6.3\nTaxation 368.5 82.8 17.3 468.6\nStatement of financial position\nTotal assets 27 750.6 18 177.5 12 281.8 1 046.8 59 256.7\nTotal liabilities 24 395.4 13 120.1 9 227.4 2 140.1 48 883.0\n2023\nStatement of profit or loss\nRevenue from contracts with customers 93 630.6 38 742.2 17 073.1 149 445.9\nCost of sales 83 783.4 32 381.0 12 918.7 129 083.1\nImpairment of PPE and intangible assets 53.7 53.7\nDepreciation and amortisation 472.2 722.1 964.2 2 158.5\nTotal employment costs 3 232.5 2 501.2 1 855.6 7 589.3\nImpairment of goodwill 66.7 67.0 133.7\nDelivery costs – Fuel 948.3 620.9 175.6 1 744.8\nAdvertising 1 176.2 247.5 319.7 1 743.4\nOperating profit/(loss) 1 217.6 1 062.3 236.8 2 516.7\nProfit/(loss) before tax 942.0 773.3 113.1 1 828.4\nFinance income 557.0 9.2 11.0 577.2\nFinance costs 835.4 275.4 134.7 1 245.5\nShare of equity-accounted associate\nprofits/(losses) 3.0 (10.0) (7.0)\nTaxation 313.6 125.2 26.4 465.2\nStatement of financial position\nTotal assets 27 953.4 18 678.1 13 192.6 2 000.6 61 824.7\nTotal liabilities 23 680.8 14 409.5 10 174.3 3 338.5 51 603.1\n* The Polish operation has been classified as discontinued and comparative numbers re-presented.

These CGUs are determined as the Group of assets acquired as part of a business\ncombination to which the goodwill can be allocated, and which generates largely independent cash flows and will benefit from synergies\nof the combination.\nManagement view a grouping of CGUs as appropriate for impairment testing where the strategic direction is provided by a central\nmanagement function, funded by a central financing facility and there is a large degree of inter-connection between divisions. However,\na separate impairment review is conducted for assets other than goodwill where there is an indicator of performance and operational\nchallenges faced by a business unit within a grouping of CGUs.\nIn the prior years, Heaney Meats Catering Co Ltd (Heaney Meats) was considered a separate CGU and not aggregated into the Irish\nand UK business as there was not a large degree of inter-connectedness between Heaney Meats and other businesses in the segment.\nIn the 2023 financial year, the business made the strategic decision to close the meat processing unit of Heaney Meats resulting in an\nimpairment of their assets and goodwill. On 1 October 2023, the remaining trade and assets of Heaney Meats was transferred into BWG\nFoods and the business fully integrated into BWG Foods. As a result, Heaney Meats is no longer viewed as a separate CGU and is\ngrouped within the BWG and Gilletts CGU.\nGoodwill relating to retail stores acquired in South Africa are included within the associated distribution centre (DC) as the applicable\ngoodwill is monitored and tested for impairment in a way that is consistent with management’s internal management systems. Therefore\neach distribution centre is a standalone CGU.\nThe recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on the value-in-use calculations.\n48\nTHE SPAR GROUP LTD ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nGROUP COMPANY\nRmillion 2024 2023 2024 2023\n13.

The financial institution fulfils all administrative activities relating to the\nrepayment of these loans, and will only revert to SPAR in the unusual instance of default on the part of the retailer.\nThese loans have been discounted to the financial institution with full recourse, resulting in SPAR still being exposed to the credit risk\non this transaction. It has been concluded that these loan receivables do not meet the derecognition criteria for financial assets in terms\nof IFRS 9. This has resulted in the recognition of a financial asset held at amortised cost which represents the amount owing by the\nretailer, and a financial liability held at amortised cost which represents the amount owing to the financial institution. The block\ndiscounting loans are considered to have low credit risk and the loss allowance recognised was therefore limited to 12-months\nexpected losses.\nRetailer loans are secured by notarial bonds over assets, deeds of suretyship, cession and pledge of shares and in some instances,\nlease options. The recoverability of amounts owed by retailers is regularly reviewed and assessed on an individual basis. This is\nestimated considering past experience and additional risk factors such as significant actual or expected changes in the operating\nresults or business conditions of the retailer. To the extent that a loan is considered irrecoverable, the debt is written off.

Cash and cash equivalents/overdrafts\nFor the purpose of the statement of cash flow, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and in banks, net of outstanding bank\noverdrafts. The Group separately discloses the bank balances of SPAR, Guild and trust bank balances. Guild balances comprise\nretailer funds and other cash deposits attributable to The SPAR Guild of Southern Africa, and the Build it Guild of Southern Africa.\nDeposits received by the SPAR Guild of Southern Africa from the SPAR retail members are included in other payables. Trust balances\ncomprise cash on hand at year end held by the BBBEE trusts pending payment to beneficiaries. The liability to the beneficiaries is\nincluded in trade and other payables.\nCash and cash equivalents at the end of the financial year as shown in the statement of cash flow can be reconciled to the related\nitems in the statement of financial position as follows:\nGROUP COMPANY\nRmillion 2024 2023 2024 2023\nBank balances – Guilds and Share trusts 308.9 251.3\nBank balances – BBBEE trusts 37.1 35.0\nBank balances – Guilds and trusts 346.0 286.3\nBank balances – SPAR 1 276.2 1 421.7 62.6 52.1\nBank overdrafts – SPAR (3 696.9) (3 157.9) (2 703.0) (2 438.7)\nNet cash and cash equivalents (2 074.7) (1 449.9) (2 640.4) (2 386.6)\n24. Right-of-use assets and leases\nLease arrangements by segment\nSPAR Southern Africa leases mostly relate to head lease arrangements on key strategic retail sites that are viewed as fundamental to\nthe Group’s growth strategy. These include a back-to-back sublease agreement with our independent retailers. IFRS 16 requires the\nrecognition of the obligation to pay rent under the head lease as a lease liability, with a corresponding asset representing the lease\nreceivable. For these back-to-back sublease agreements, the accounting for the head lease and the sublease under IFRS 16 has an\nequal and opposite impact on the statement of comprehensive income. To the extent of leased property that is not sublet, the Group\nrecognises a right-of-use asset and a finance lease liability. SPAR Ireland leases mostly relate to property leases which are franchised\nto retailers or operated by the Group. There are also motor vehicles leases. For both the property leases and motor vehicle leases,\na right-of-use asset and finance lease liability are recognised. For the property leases where the Group is a lessor, a finance lease asset\nis recognised instead of the right-of-use asset. SPAR Switzerland has property, trucks and information technology (IT) hardware leases.\nThe property leases do not include back-to-back sublease agreements resulting in a right-of-use asset and finance lease liability\nbeing recognised.\nRight-of-use assets\nThe following amounts are relating to leases where the Group is a lessee:\nInternal Office\ntransport, equipment,\nLand and Motor plant and fixtures Computers\nRmillion buildings vehicles equipment and fittings equipment Total\nGROUP\nCarrying value at 1 October 2022 8 123.2 128.8 49.6 3.8 15.1 8 320.5\nCost 17 222.1 248.8 76.4 11.0 23.7 17 582.0\nAccumulated depreciation and impairment (9 098.9) (120.0) (26.8) (7.2) (8.6) (9 261.5)\nAdditions 915.5 37.4 18.4 8.2 979.5\n– Additions* 697.8 36.6 18.7 7.6 760.7\n– Modifications 217.7 0.8 (0.3) 0.6 218.8\nAdditions through business combinations 61.4 61.4\nDisposals (35.3) (0.4) (7.5) (0.5) (43.7)\nImpairment (56.4) (56.4)\nTransfer to lease receivable 9.7 (9.7) –\nDepreciation (1 107.0) (58.7) (11.9) (4.0) (5.2) (1 186.8)\nExchange rate translation 924.5 15.5 6.3 0.7 1.6 948.6\nCarrying value at 30 September 2023 8 825.9 132.3 45.2 8.2 11.5 9 023.1\nCost 19 900.5 285.4 71.9 13.9 25.5 20 297.2\nAccumulated depreciation and impairment (11 074.6) (153.1) (26.7) (5.7) (14.0) (11 274.1)\n* Comparative information has been restated – refer to note 43 for further detail.\n56\nTHE SPAR GROUP LTD ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n24.

Employment benefit obligations continued\n27.1 Retirement benefit funds continued\nThe defined benefit plans typically expose the Group to actuarial assumptions such as investment risk, interest rate risk, longevity risk\nand salary risk. Changes in these variables will result in a change to the defined benefit plan liability.\nIn the current year, the actuarial gain is primarily attributable to an increase in discount and inflation rate assumptions.\nThe SPAR Group Ltd retirement funds (Southern Africa)\nThe Company contributes towards retirement benefits for substantially all permanent employees who, depending on preference,\nare members of either the Group’s defined contribution pension fund, defined contribution staff provident fund, defined contribution\nmanagement provident fund or defined benefit fund. Contributions to fund obligations for the payment of retirement benefits are\nrecognised in profit or loss when due.\nAll funds are governed by the Pension Funds Act, No 24 of 1956. The funds are managed by appointed administrators and investment\nmanagers, and their assets remain independent of the Company.\nThe SPAR Group Ltd contribution funds\nIn terms of their rules, the defined contribution funds have annual financial reviews, which are performed by the funds’ consulting\nactuaries. At the date of their last reviews the funds were judged to be financially sound. Contributions of R200.8 million (2023:\nR197.1 million) and R198.9 million (2023: R195.4 million) were expensed for the Group and Company respectively during the year.\nThe BWG Group retirement funds (Ireland)\nThe BWG Group contributes towards retirement benefits for approximately 878 (2023: 892) current and former employees who are\nmembers of either the Group’s defined benefit staff pension scheme (BWG Foods Ltd Staff Pension Scheme), defined benefit executive\npension scheme (BWG Ltd Executive Pension Scheme) or one of the defined contribution schemes. All schemes are governed by the\nIrish Pensions Act, No 25 of 1990 (as amended per Irish statute). The bulk of the funds is invested with Irish Life Investment Managers,\nwith small holdings managed by SSgA and F&C and directly by the scheme. The schemes’ assets remain independent of the Group.\nThe BWG Group defined benefit funds\nIn terms of their rules, the defined benefit funds have annual financial reviews, which are performed by the funds’ consulting actuaries.\nAt the date of their last reviews the funds were judged to be on track to meet their obligations. Current service costs, past service cost\nor credit and net expense or income are recognised to profit or loss. The defined benefit pension scheme’s obligations were valued at\nR1 216.9 million (2023: R1 177.3 million) using the projected unit credit method and the funds were found to be in a sound financial\nposition. At that date the actuarial fair value of the plan assets represented 109.0% (2023: 100.1%) of the plan liabilities. Total employer\ncontributions of EUR1.0 million are estimated in the 2025 financial year.\nThe next actuarial valuation of the defined benefit schemes will take place on 1 January 2027. These schemes are closed to\nfurther membership.\nThe BWG Group contribution funds\nThe BWG Group operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes. Contributions of R52.1 million (2023: R44.7 million) were\nexpensed during the year.\nThe SPAR Holding AG retirement funds (Switzerland)\nThe pension plan of SPAR Holding AG and the undertakings economically linked to it is a contribution based plan which guarantees\na minimum interest credit and fixed conversion rates at retirement. Disability and death benefits are defined as a percentage of the\ninsured salary. The plan for additional risk benefits provides disability and death benefits defined as a percentage of the additional risk\nsalary. IAS 19.139(a)(ii) provides benefits over the LPP/BVG law, which stipulates the minimum requirement of the mandatory employer’s\nsponsored pension plan in Switzerland. The pension plan is set up as a separate legal entity. The foundation is responsible for\nthe governance of the plan and the Board is composed of an equal number of representatives from the employer and the employees.\nThe plan must be fully funded under LPP/BVG law on a static basis at all times. In case of underfunding, recovery measures must be\ntaken, such as additional financing from the employer or from the employer and employees, or reduction of benefits or a combination\nof both. The foundation has set up investment guidelines, defining in particular the strategic allocation with margins.\nSPAR Switzerland retirement funds contribute towards retirement benefits for approximately 1 382 (2023: 1 384) current and former\nemployees.

These\nacquisitions were funded from available cash resources.\nIreland wholesale business\nOn 2 April 2024, the BWG group purchased the trade and assets of Faherty Wholesale for R9.3 million. The contingent consideration\nfor this acquisition is based on the performance of this company during the measurement period. The measurement period for this\nacquisition is 12 months, commencing 2 April 2024.

Financial guarantees\nFinancial guarantees may be provided by the Group to subsidiaries and affiliates. These financial guarantees are accounted for in\nterms of IFRS 9 and measured at the higher of fair value or expected credit loss. Management has formally assessed the IFRS 9 fair\nvalues of the guarantees and confirms that no legal obligation exists at the reporting date to settle these guarantees issued.\nManagement’s assessment is based on the principles of IFRS 13 Fair value measurement and on the ability of subsidiaries and affiliates\nhaving sufficient cash resources, in country, to service the underlying debt instrument’s obligations as and when these become due.\nThe risk relating to financial guarantees is managed per geographical region through review of cash flow forecasts, budgets and\nmonitoring of covenants.\nThe Company has also provided a financial guarantee on the TIL JV Ltd bank facilities to the value of EUR249.8 million\n(2023: EUR289.2 million), and the SPAR Holding AG borrowing facilities to the value of CHF32.0 million (2023: CHF40.0 million).\nThe SPAR Group had a facility with WesBank where SPAR undertook to stand guarantee for loans issued to retailers up to a limit of\nR1.0 billion. This facility arrangement was concluded under a direct deal basis which meant that the retailer signed the loan agreement\ndirectly with the bank and SPAR signed a separate guarantee for this loan. Exposure on the direct deals facility is disclosed as a financial\nguarantee and is not recognised on our balance sheet. The balance disclosed in the statement of financial position as at September 2024\nrelate to the full recourse deals.\nThe Company has also provided a financial guarantee on the NPI Sp. z o.o. bank facilities to the value of EUR40.0 million\n(2023: EUR105.0 million).\nThe Group has provided a limited guarantee relating to a loan facility held by Numlite (Pty) Ltd exposing the Group to credit risk in the\nevent that Numlite (Pty) Ltd defaults on its loan facility payments. In 2009 the Company sold its investment in retail computer equipment\nand ceded its right to receive payment of the existing and future rental streams to Numlite (Pty) Ltd, who in turn raises finance via a loan\nfacility with an independent financial institution. At year end, 1 067 SPAR stores (2023: 1 079), 788 TOPS at SPAR stores (2023: 764),\n22 Pharmacy at SPAR stores (2023: 57) and 133 Build it stores (2023: 120) were participants in the IT retail scheme, with an average\ndebt of R107 065 per store (2023: R115 680).\n70\nTHE SPAR GROUP LTD ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n34.

Share-based payments\n38.1 Share option scheme\nThe Company has an equity settled share option scheme in place which is operated through The SPAR Group Ltd Share Employee\nTrust (2004) (the trust). On election by option holders, one-third of the options granted vest after three years, with a further third vesting\non the expiry of years four and five respectively. Options issued by the trust expire 10 years from grant date. Options are forfeited if the\nemployee leaves the Group before vesting date.\nShare options outstanding at year end are as follows:\nNumber of options\n2024 2023\nBalance at beginning of year 307 500 466 700\nOptions exercised and paid in full (139 500)\nOptions expired (306 200)\nOptions forfeited (1 300) (19 700)\nBalance at end of year – 307 500\nWeighted average grant price of options exercised during the year 122.61\nWeighted average selling price of options exercised during the year 144.12\nNo further issues of options have been granted under the share option scheme. Refer to the conditional share plan in note 38.2.\n38.2 Conditional share plan\nThe Group operates a CSP under which it receives services from employees as consideration for equity instruments of the Company.\nShares granted in terms of the CSP meet the definition of an equity-settled, share-based payment.\nIn terms of the CSP, the Group has granted shares to executives, senior management and key talent specifically identified in the form\nof performance share awards. Awards can comprise shares (restricted shares) that are subject to the condition that the participants\nremain employed with the Group (employment condition) and/or shares (performance shares) that are subject to an employment\ncondition and Company-related performance conditions (performance condition) over a predetermined period (performance period).\nThe award will only be settled after the vesting date and the participant will not have any shareholder or voting rights prior to the vesting\ndate. Participants do not receive dividends during the vesting period and will only begin receiving dividends if and after the awards have\nvested. Participants terminating employment due to resignation or dismissal on grounds of misconduct, proven poor performance or\nproven dishonest or fraudulent conduct, or any reason other than stated below will be classified as bad leavers and will forfeit all\nunvested awards.\nParticipants terminating employment due to death, retirement, retrenchment, ill health, disability, injury or sale of SPAR will be classified\nas good leavers and a portion of all unvested awards will vest on the date as soon as reasonably possible after the date of termination\nof employment.\nThe CSP officially grants performance share awards to employees which vest over a period of three years. These shares were awarded\nsubject to the following three performance conditions:\n• Headline earnings per share (HEPS) growth\n• Return on net assets (RONA)/Return on capital employed (ROCE)\n• Total shareholder return (TSR)\nThe fair value (excluding attrition) is calculated as the share price at grant date, multiplied by the number of shares granted. The fair value\nis then adjusted for attrition. To determine the number of shares that will vest at the end of the vesting period as a result of the\nperformance conditions, a model is used that has both stochastic and deterministic features. The assumptions and inputs used in\nthe valuation of the units issued are summarised in the table that follows. Also taken into account in this calculation are: SPAR forecast\nHEPS growth, SPAR Remuneration Committee HEPS tentative target set in November 2014 had raised the expectation for future\nRONA to midway between the tentative target and upper target; SPAR forecast average RONA, SPAR forecast average ROCE and\nconsumer price index to grant date. As expectations are revised during the performance period, the value per unit will be restated\naccordingly.\nThe volatilities of the TSR of SPAR and each of the peer companies were based on the three-year historical annualised standard\ndeviations of the weekly log returns. It should be noted that the absolute values of the volatility assumptions are less important than\nmost other schemes. This is because the proportion of shares vesting under the TSR performance condition is determined largely by\nperformance relative to the peer group.\n74\nTHE SPAR GROUP LTD ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n38.

The carrying amount of\ntrade receivables, after accounting for the expected credit losses and bad debts written off, approximates fair value.\n75\nTHE SPAR GROUP LTD ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n39. Financial risk management continued\nTrade receivables represent the estimated future cash to be received in the short term. The book values of the other categories of\nfinancial instruments approximate fair value.\nIn the normal course of its operations the Group is, inter alia, exposed to credit, interest, liquidity and currency risk on its financial\ninstruments. Executive management meets on a regular basis to analyse these risks and to re-evaluate financial management strategies.\nThe Group does not have any exposure to commodity price movements.\nCurrency risk\nThe Group is subject to translation exposure through the import of merchandise and its investments in foreign operations by way\nof translation risks and currency risks relating to the financial liabilities.\nForeign currency risks that do not influence the Group’s cash flows (i.e. the risks resulting from the translation of assets and liabilities of\nforeign operations in the Group’s reporting currency) are not hedged.\nSouthern Africa\nImport of merchandise\nIt is the Group’s policy to cover its material foreign currency exposure in respect of liabilities and purchase commitments. Forward\nexchange contracts have been taken out to hedge this currency risk at year end. There were no speculative positions in foreign currencies.\nInterest rate risk\nThe Group is exposed to interest rate risk on its cash deposits, loan receivables and loan payables which impacts the cash flow arising\nfrom these instruments. In the current year, from continuing operations, net interest paid on bank overdrafts was R315.1 million (2023:\nR255.0 million), interest received from loans was R21.1 million (2023: R24.9 million) and interest paid on loans was R255.5 million (2023:\nR226.3 million).\nThe exposure of cash deposits and overdrafts to interest rate risk is managed through the Group’s cash management system which\nenables the Group to maximise returns while minimising risk. Loan receivables are funded from the Group’s cash resources.\nThe Group is not exposed to interest rate risk on the block discounting loan receivable and payable balances, as the loan receivable at\nthe prime interest rate is immediately sold at prime less one to an approved financial institution.\nSensitivity analysis\nChanges in market interest rates relating to loan receivables do not have a material impact on the Group’s profits and hence no\nsensitivity analysis has been presented. Net bank overdraft of R2 420.7 million (2023: R1 736.2 million) and total borrowings of\nR6 694.6 million (2023: R8 265.2 million) expose the Group to interest rate risk.

Financial risk management continued\nCredit risk\nTrade receivables, short-term investments, loans and guarantees to retailers represent the significant categories of the Group’s financial\ninstruments exposed to credit risk amounting to R18 734.0 million (2023: R20 063.0 million). Concentration risk is mitigated as the\nGroup deals with a broad spread of customers.\nTrade receivables consist of:\nSouthern Africa: SPAR, Build it and Pharmacy retailer receivables\nIreland: Retailer and hospitality customers\nSwitzerland: SPAR retailers, TopCC and hospitality customers\nOverdue trade receivables balances, representing 14.3% (2023: 13.6%) of the total trade receivables balance, amounted to\nR2 441.8 million (2023: R2 363.3 million) at the reporting date. Expected credit losses totalling R1 587.1 million (2023: R 1 534.4 million)\nhave been raised against overdue balances.\nImpairment of financial assets\nThe Group has five types of financial assets that are impacted by IFRS 9’s expected credit loss model:\n• Trade receivables for sales of inventory\n• Loans provided by The SPAR Group\n• Block discounting Loans\n• Cash and cash equivalents\n• Lease receivables\nExpected credit losses on cash and cash equivalents are calculated in terms of the general model for impairment. All cash and cash\nequivalents were determined to be in stage 1 as counterparties have a low risk of default and a strong capacity to meet contractual cash\nflows. There was no significant increase in credit risk relating to the cash and cash equivalents. The expected credit losses were\ntherefore limited to 12-month expected losses and the identified impairment loss was immaterial.\nThe Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance\nfor all trade receivables making use of a provision matrix.\nTo measure the expected credit losses, trade and other receivable balances have been grouped based on shared credit risk\ncharacteristics and the days past due. The expected credit losses are based on the payment profiles of historical sales for customers\nand associated write-offs. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward looking information on macro-economic\nfactors affecting the ability of customers to settle the receivables. The Group has identified the inflation rate, fuel cost, prime rate\nfluctuations and the unemployment rate to be the most relevant factors and accordingly adjusts the historical loss rates based on\nexpected changes in these factors. Management considers these the most significant factors which effect the business’s operations,\nand their ability to service trade debt as the Group’s customers are independent retailers who heavily rely on the disposal income of\nend-consumers.\nDistribution centres have adopted a robust model in assessing and raising allowances relating to trade receivables with specific\nfinancial issues.\nThe credit risk associated with lease receivables are low as these relate to “back to back” sub lease arrangements for which SPAR acts\nas an intermediary between the head lessor and the lessee giving rise to the respective receivable and payable. SPAR has assessed\nthe risk associated with this lease receivables as low since SPAR has the right to terminate the sub lease in less than one month, step\ninto the lease, run the business and in doing so, service the amount due to the head lessor. The historic loss rate on these lease\nreceivables has been insignificant.\nCredit impaired financial assets are defined as financial assets for which there is any level of non-performance in terms of contractual\narrangements and the Group has exposure after taking into consideration the financial assets’ security held. SPAR assesses the ability\nof each retailer individually by store to service their debt. SPAR holds close relationships with its retailers so that all factors are\nunderstood, including macro-economic factors which have different effects on different stores’ consumers.\nTrade receivables are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. Debt is considered to be irrecoverable if\ncontinuous attempts to collect outstanding amounts are unsuccessful, which have been handed over to legal for collection or if\nmanagement has identified a specific financial issue with the customer.\n77\nTHE SPAR GROUP LTD ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n39.

These are considered to have low credit risk as the supplier rebates could\nbe credited against payable balances, guilds are in a cash surplus position and bridging loans are supported by acknowledgement of\ndebts as well as notarial bonds gives the Group the ability to recover the full amount.\nOn that basis, the loss allowance as at 30 September 2024 and 2023 for trade and other receivables is summarised as follows:\nGROUP COMPANY\n1 – 4 5 – 8 8+ 1 – 4 5 – 8 8+\nRmillion weeks weeks weeks Total weeks weeks weeks Total\n30 September 2024\nExpected loss rate 0.5% 1.1% 23.6% 0.4% 0.6% 4.5%\nTrade and other receivables-\nbalance subject to matrix 12 214.4 1 918.8 1 274.0 15 407.2 8 340.7 1 059.2 502.8 9 902.7\nLoss allowance excluding VAT 56.2 20.5 300.1 376.8 28.0 5.4 19.5 52.9\nSpecific allowances raised 1 210.3 891.8\nTotal loss allowance 1 587.1 – – – 944.7\n30 September 2023\nExpected loss rate 0.4% 1.5% 29.5% 0.3% 0.5% 3.5%\nTrade and other receivables-\nbalance subject to matrix* 13 348.5 2 013.6 1 239.9 16 602.0 8 360.7 1 297.9 638.8 10 297.4\nLoss allowance excluding VAT 54.1 30.6 365.2 449.9 28.1 5.4 19.5 53.0\nSpecific allowances raised 1 084.5 763.1\nTotal loss allowance 1 534.4 816.1\n* Comparative information has been restated – refer to note 43 for further detail.\nThe ECL allowance represents management’s estimate of the extent to which trade receivables at the reporting date will not be\nsubsequently recovered. This estimate takes into consideration past trends and makes an assessment of additional risk factors which\nare likely to impact recoverability such as significant actual or expected changes in the operating results or business conditions of the\nretailer. To the extent considered irrecoverable, debts are written off. Debt is written off when all legal attempts to recover the debt have\nbeen exhausted.\nIt is a prerequisite for appropriate forms of security to be obtained from retailers to reduce exposure on trade receivable balances.\nTrade receivable balances are secured by general and specific notarial bonds over movable assets, deeds of suretyship, cession and\npledge of shares and in some instances, lease options. General notarial bonds constitute the majority of the security held, which provide\nthe Group with a preferential claim over the movable assets. This bond can be perfected when the retailers account is in arrears. As at\n30 September 2024 security to the value of R12 987.6 million (2023: R13 047.1 million) was held by the Group. Ongoing credit evaluations\nare performed including regular reviews of security cover held (refer to note 21).\nThe Group selectively assists retail members suffering financial stress in order to ensure the continued operation of stores, thereby\npreserving the recoverability of trade receivable balances.\nThe directors are of the opinion that the credit risk in respect of short term cash investments is low as funds are only invested with\nacceptable financial institutions of high credit standing and within specific guidelines laid down by the Board.\n78\nTHE SPAR GROUP LTD ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n39. Financial risk management continued\nCredit risk continued\nLoans receivables and block discounting loans\nThe Group extends loans to retailers in the form of block discounting loans (refer to note 17) and retailer loans (refer to note 18).\nThese loans are fully secured, and as such the Group has not incurred a loss on these balances in the past five years.\nThe Group has adopted the general approach for loans receivable, which involves a three-stage approach to the recognition of credit\nlosses and interest.\nThe Group considers the probability of default upon initial recognition of an asset and whether there has been a significant increase in\ncredit risk on an ongoing basis throughout each reporting period. To assess whether there is a significant increase in credit risk, the Group\ncompares the risk of a default occurring on the asset as at the reporting date with the risk of default as at the date of initial recognition.\nIt considers available reasonable and supportive forward looking information. Default is generally considered a missed payment.\nA significant increase in credit risk has not been presumed if a debtor is more than 30 days past due in making a contractual payment,\nbut has been treated as an indicator for further investigation of credit risk assessment.\nThree categories of loans have been determined which reflect the credit risk profile based on default and timely payment history\nas follows:\nBasis for recognition of expected\nCategory Company definition of category credit losses\nPerforming Loans whose credit risk is in line with original expectations, no 12 months expected credit losses.\ndefaults or late payments recorded in previous 12-month period. Where the expected lifetime of\nan asset is less than 12 months,\nexpected losses are measured at its\nexpected lifetime (stage 1).\nUnderperforming Loans for which a significant increase in credit risk has occurred Lifetime expected losses (stage 2).\ncompared to original expectations; a significant increase in credit\nrisk is presumed if interest and/or principal repayments are 30 days\npast due, which is defined as a late payment but no default.\nNon-performing Interest and/or principal repayments are 90 days past due, i.e. three Lifetime expected losses (stage 3).\nconsecutive missed payments or it becomes probable a customer\nwill enter bankruptcy.\nWrite-off Interest and/or principal repayments are 120 days past due and Asset is written off.\nthere is no reasonable expectation of recovery.\nThe expected credit losses have been determined using the formula:\nProbability of default (PD) x loss given default (LGD) x exposure at default (EAD).\nPD is considered on initial recognition of an asset and credit risk is assessed throughout each reporting period for significant increases.\nTo assess whether a significant increase has occurred, the Group will compare the credit risk at the reporting date with that of the credit\nrisk at initial recognition, taking into account macro-economic conditions and supportable forward-looking information. These mirror\nthe factors in the trade receivables section above.\nLGD is the loss which is expected to arise at the date of default. The Group has securities over the financial assets which are preferential\nto the settlement of any trade debts, management has applied judgement in determining an amount which could be recorded as a loss\nshould a default event occur.\nEAD is the outstanding balance at reporting date.\nOver the term of the loans, the Group accounts for its credit risk by appropriately providing for expected credit losses on a timely basis.\nIn calculating the expected credit loss rates, the Company considered historical loss rates for each category of loans, which includes\nthe leverage ratios of the lender, and adjusts for forward looking macro-economic data. The Group provides for credit losses against\nloans to customers as follows:\nGROUP COMPANY\nSouthern\nAfrica Ireland Switzerland South Africa\nCategory of expected credit loss and rates\nPerforming 0.07% 14.82% 0.3% 0.07%\nUnder performing 4.64% 46.66% 60.9% 4.64%\nNon-performing 10.02% 100.00% 99.5% 91.30%\nGross carrying amounts\nPerforming 753.6 43.0 1 344.9 682.5\nUnder-performing 4.6 7.4\nNon-performing 35.3 1.5 80.2\n753.6 82.9 1 353.8 762.7\n79\nTHE SPAR GROUP LTD ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n39.

Events after the reporting date\nOn 4 November 2024, the Group entered into a sale agreement for the disposal of the property owned by Knowles Shopping Centre\nInvestments Proprietary Limited and the Central Office Building owned by the SPAR Group Limited as described in note 42. The sale\nagreement is subject to certain conditions precedent, which are anticipated to be fulfilled in the upcoming months.\nThis transaction is considered a non-adjusting event in accordance with IAS 10 Events after the Reporting Period, as the sale agreement\nwas signed after the reporting date and does not provide evidence of conditions that existed at the reporting date. Consequently,\nno adjustments have been made to the financial statements as at 30 September 2024 in respect of this transaction.\nPost the end of the financial year management have formally decided to dispose of a non-core property on the West Rand.\n81\nTHE SPAR GROUP LTD ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n40.

Contingent liability\nSouthern Africa\nAs was initially reported in 2022, summons was served on the Company by one of its larger retailers, the Giannacopoulos Group, for alleged\ndamages of R2.1 billion arising from a membership dispute. The Company denied any liability and has filed a plea to defend the matter.\nManagement have engaged extensively with the retailer and while many issues have been successfully resolved, a few major dispute\nmatters could not be finalised. The parties have agreed that the dispute be dealt with through a legal process. The Company remains\nsatisfied that, based on legal opinion, there is insufficient evidence to substantiate the claim and does not recognise any liability\nfor damages.\nSwitzerland\nThe Swiss business has received a notification of an “intention to sanction” from the Swiss Competition Commission (WEKO) regarding\nfindings in connection with compensation received from a trading and service cooperative. The Company has been given the opportunity\nto respond to the notice, make representations relating to the findings and to make submissions as to why some, or all, of the intended\nsanctions should not be imposed. The Company has engaged a specialist lawyer to examine the claim and to prepare formal responses.\nIt is therefore not yet possible to reliably estimate the form of any resolution or amount of any possible sanction.\n42. Discontinued operation and assets held for sale\nDiscontinued operation\nOn 28 September 2023, the Board announced its intention to exit the Polish market. In accordance with the requirements of\nIFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, NPI met the criteria to be considered held for sale and\ndiscontinued on 1 December 2023.\nOn 3 September 2024 SPAR entered into a sale and purchase agreement with Przedsiebiorstwo Produkcyjno Handlowo Uslugowe\nSpecja Spólka z o.o.

Change in Accounting Policy and Prior Period Errors\nChange in accounting policy\nIn the current financial year, SPAR implemented a change in accounting policy for its financial guarantee contracts. Previously,\nthese financial guarantees were accounted for under IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts. Under IFRS 4, SPAR was able to classify certain\nfinancial guarantees as insurance contracts, which primarily required disclosures but did not mandate full recognition and measurement\nas liabilities on the statement of financial position.\nIFRS 17 Insurance Contracts replaced IFRS 4 for financial periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023 and as such applies to the\ncurrent reporting period in which these annual financial statements are presented. Management has determined that accounting for\nthese financial guarantees under IFRS 9 Financial Instruments provides a more consistent approach that aligns better with SPAR’s\nexisting accounting policies. As a result, SPAR has changed the accounting policy to account for its financial guarantees under IFRS 9\nFinancial Instruments from the current financial year.\nUnder IFRS 9, financial guarantees are recognised as financial liabilities and must be measured at their fair value upon initial recognition.\nSubsequently, they are measured at the higher of:\n• The expected credit losses (ECL) calculated in accordance with IFRS 9’s impairment model, or\n• The amount initially recognised less the cumulative amount of income recognised in accordance with the principles of IFRS 15.\nImpact of the change\nThis change in accounting policy was applied retrospectively in accordance with IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting\nEstimates, and Errors. The retrospective adjustment was made only at the Company level and not the Group level, as it relates specifically\nto material financial guarantees provided by SPAR to its foreign subsidiaries. Consequently, the Group’s consolidated financial\nstatements remain unaffected by this change.\nThe adjustments made to Company are as follows:\nCOMPANY\n2023 2022\nAs As\npreviously previously\nRmillion reported Adjustment Restated reported Adjustment Restated\nStatement of financial position\nCapital and reserves\nRetained earnings 3 684.1 (420.3) 3 263.8 4 546.7 (495.9) 4 050.8\nCurrent liabilities\nCurrent portion of financial liabilities (420.3) (420.3) (495.9) (495.9)\nStatement of profit or loss\nNet operating expenses (9 253.8) 75.6 (9 178.2)\nAdministrative and information technology\nexpenses (2 306.4) 75.6 (2 230.8)\nOperating (loss)/profit (153.5) 75.6 (77.9)\n(Loss)/profit before taxation (437.0) 75.6 (361.4)\n(Loss)/profit after taxation (654.4) 75.6 (578.8)\nPrior period errors\nLease remeasurements\nDuring the current financial year, the Group identified a prior period error in relation to the accounting for leases under IFRS 16 Leases.\nSPAR has entered into “back-to-back” leasing arrangements with certain landlords and retailers, whereby it acts as both a lessee and\na lessor for the same underlying assets.\nIn the prior period, certain renewal clauses within these back-to-back lease agreements were exercised by both SPAR and the\ncounterparties. However, these renewals were not reflected in the Group’s lease accounting, resulting in an understatement of both\nlease receivables and lease payables as at the prior period end.\nThis only impacted the statement of financial position of the Group and Company for the prior financial year.\nReclassification of other receivables and payables\nDuring the current financial year, the Group identified a prior period error in relation to other receivable and payable balances which was\nclassified incorrectly.\nIn accordance with IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors, the Group has retrospectively corrected\nthese prior period errors.

Amidst navigating a challenging trading environment and addressing\nconsumer pressures across various territories, together with the ongoing impacts of the SAP system\nimplementation in South Africa, SPAR's continuing operations have demonstrated a resilient\nperformance.\nTurnover for the Group’s continuing operations in Southern Africa, Ireland and South-West England\n(“BWG Group”), and Switzerland, increased by 4.0% to R152.3 billion. Turnover growth slowed in the\nsecond half of the financial year across all geographies, influenced by the ZAR translation impacts of the\nforeign subsidiaries as the currency strengthened, together with slowing levels of food inflation, increased\ncompetition across all markets and consumers that continue to experience cost-of-living constraints.\nGross profit margins remained stable at 11.9% compared to the previous financial year. Whilst\ninterventions to resolve the SAP impacts in the KZN region are well underway, it will take some time for\nthe full effects to be felt and for the overhang on gross margins to be eliminated; gross profit margin for\nSPAR South Africa, including SPAR, Tops and Build it, decreased from 8.7% to 8.5%. BWG Group saw\na slight increase in its overall gross profit margin from 15.1% to 15.2%, driven by a more favourable\ncategory mix. Improved margin management within the wholesale and TopCC cash and carry business\nsaw SPAR Switzerland’s gross margin improve from 17.8% to 18.3%.\nOperating expenses were well managed, increasing by 3.5% to R18.7 billion, underpinned by an\nincreased focus on cost management and efficiency initiatives across the Group. The translation effect\nof foreign currency also impacted this performance. The Group delivered an operating profit of\nR2.9 billion, reflecting a 15.1% year-on-year increase, with an improvement in operating profit margin to\n1.9% (2023: 1.7%).\nNotwithstanding gross finance costs increasing by 11.1%, profit before tax rose by 15.8% to R2.1 billion\n(2023: R1.8 billion). Profit after tax grew by 20.9% to R1.6 billion (2023: R1.4 billion) and diluted headline\nearnings per share for continuing operations grew by 11.1% to 917.5 cents.\nGroup net borrowings reduced by R2.0 billion, from R11.1 billion as at 31 March 2024, to R9.1 billion at\n30 September 2024, resulting in the net borrowings/EBITDA (determined on a pre-IFRS 16 basis) ratio\nimproving to 2.41 times from 3.02 times in the previous financial year.\nSPAR Southern Africa, including SPAR, Tops, Build it and Pharma, reported a 3.7% increase in turnover\nin a trading environment characterised by high inflation, high interest rates and low GDP growth. Core\ngrocery and liquor turnover rose by 3.6%, with SPAR private label growing by 7.0%. Wholesale price\ninflation was internally measured at 5.5%. Build it achieved a 2.3% rise in turnover, improving from a 4.3%\ndecline in the previous financial year. Pharmacy at SPAR saw a 14.5% growth in turnover due to a strong\nperformance from Scriptwise. The SPAR2U on-demand shopping app expanded to 525 sites by the end\nof September, with order volumes increasing 380% year-on-year. Operating profit in our Southern African\nsegment, excluding non-recurring items, increased by 26.1%\nSPAR South Africa has arrested recent market share declines and stabilised its share amongst its key\ncustomer base over the past year with monthly market share, according to NielsenIQ, staying flat since\nFebruary 2024. In the case of the liquor segment, which continues to be a crucial contributor to SPAR's\noverall market position, monthly market share has grown year-on-year.\nTurnover in Ireland and South-West England, represented by BWG Group, grew by 2.8% in EUR terms\nand 6.7% in ZAR terms. Both markets faced challenges from persistent higher living and operating costs.\nIn Ireland, the successful integration of recent acquisitions made over the last 18 months into the Value\nCentre network provided synergies and contributed to turnover growth. Management’s continued focus\non cost containment in this region led to improved operating profit margins. The hospitality sector\ncontinued to grow in Ireland, even amidst cautious consumer spending. The UK business, Appleby\nWestward group, reported a steep decline in turnover as UK retailers struggled throughout the year. The\nsummer trading months were particularly weak, affected by very poor weather. This business has also\ndealt with the challenge of the change to the national minimum wage which came into effect from\nApril 2024 and resulted in an increase of 9.8% in the minimum wage.\nThe Swiss macro-economy showed little signs of recovery for consumers, leaving them opting for cheaper\nalternatives locally and abroad. SPAR Switzerland’s turnover declined by 6.2% in CHF terms (down\n0.3% in ZAR terms) compared to the previous financial year. The sustained contraction in the gastronomy\nsector continued to negatively impact the cash and carry business, TopCC, which reported a marked\ndecline in turnover. To address and defend against intensifying competition, the Group is focused on\ncost-saving initiatives and on its convenience and fresh food offering to counteract cross-border shopping\neffects.\nUPDATE ON KEY STRATEGIC PRIORITIES\nSPAR Poland Disposal\nAs stated in the Group’s trading statement published on SENS on 21 November 2024, the sale of the\nGroup’s interest in SPAR Poland was approved by the Polish anti-monopoly authorities (UOKiK) on\n19 November 2024 (“Approval”). The purchaser is conducting a final confirmatory due diligence to be\ncompleted within 30 business days of the Approval. The disposal of the Polish business will be completed\nonce this process is finalised. Management is expecting to finalise the exit from Poland by early\nJanuary 2025.\nSAP Implementation Update\nSignificant progress has been made in resolving SAP integration issues, including improving visibility of\npricing and subsidies for buyers, as well as addressing warehouse management inefficiencies that\nincreased labour and transport costs through the selection of a new warehouse management system.\nService levels achieved are currently in excess of 90% with KZN loyalty rates rising from 68.6% in the\nsecond quarter of 2024 to 70.9% in fourth quarter of 2024.\nBanking facilities\nDuring September 2024, the Group secured a R2.0 billion bridge facility from local lenders. R1.2 billion\nof the facility was used to partially settle the Polish funding as required per the terms of the sale. This\nfacility will be converted into a medium-term loan by the end of March 2025. The remaining funds will\nsettle the Polish business's working capital facilities at disposal closure. The Polish bridge facility is\nincluded in the disclosed closing net debt balance of R9.1 billion.\nThe Group was in compliance with all financing covenants as at year-end and remains committed to its\ndebt restructuring plans, with no plans to seek additional funding from shareholders.\nCHANGES TO THE BOARD AND BOARD COMMITTEES\nIn compliance with paragraph 3.59 of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements, the board of directors of\nthe Company (“Board”) hereby advises that Gertrude (Trudi) Makhaya, who has served as an\nindependent non-executive director of the Board since September 2023 as well as Chairperson of the\nSocial, Ethics and Sustainability Committee, has resigned as an independent non-executive director with\neffect from 31 December 2024. Trudi will assume a senior executive role at Boston Consulting Group on\na fulltime basis from 1 January 2025.\nSPAR shareholders are further advised that the Board has approved the appointment of\nMr Sundeep Naran as the new Chairperson of the Social, Ethics and Sustainability Committee. The Board\nextends its sincere gratitude to Trudi for her unwavering dedication and significant contributions,\nparticularly during a challenging period for the Group.\nSHAREHOLDER DISTRIBUTION\nThe Group has been focused on addressing various challenges over the past 18 months to ensure\nfinancial stability, balance sheet resilience and maximise its ability to position itself to take advantage of\ngrowth opportunities. Whilst significant progress has been made, work remains ongoing in these areas.\nConsequently, the Board believes it is prudent to not declare a dividend for the year ended\n30 September 2024 (2023: 0.0 cents per share). This decision will be reconsidered based on future\nmacro-economic and operating conditions. Prioritising improved capital allocation, including shareholder\nreturns, remains important to the Board.\nOUTLOOK\nThe operating environment across our territories continues to be challenging with ongoing inflationary\npressures in food, fuel and energy, though these are showing signs of easing in some areas.\nIn South Africa, we saw strong growth in our value focused formats compared to subdued growth in our\nhigher end stores, illustrating the prevailing tough macro-economic conditions and the impact on the\nmiddle and higher segment consumers. We believe that every customer should be treated as a segment\nof one, and we are focused on clarifying our market positioning through clearer format and brand\narchitecture. To that end, SPAR’s tiered private label approach is well placed to offer better value for all\nshopping budgets with the launch of a bespoke high-end offering seeking to capture the higher income\nconsumer segment. The revitalised SaveMor store format will include high quality products at competitive\nprices and the model will be focused on operational efficiency to establish SaveMor as a leading discount\nretailer. We will continue to scale our on-demand grocery delivery offering, SPAR2U, in line with evolving\nconsumer needs.\nOur European strategic review is well underway, but ongoing and we are evaluating the return on capital\nfor each international business unit. This review will guide our investment decisions, identifying where to\nallocate more capital, reassess existing models, or consider exits as part of our growth strategy.\nAs committed to shareholders, we have made significant progress on our 2024 priorities, including\nfinalising the sale of SPAR Poland, reducing debt and stabilising our balance sheet position, resolving\nSAP issues at the KZN distribution centre, and working towards a 3% operating margin in Southern Africa,\na target which remains intact. In 2025, we will focus on supporting SPAR’s independent retailers, defining\nour target operating model, improving Group profitability, and finalising the ERP system modernisation\nplan.\nABOUT THIS ANNOUNCEMENT\nAs the information in this announcement does not provide all of the details, any investment decision\nshould be based on consideration of the consolidated annual financial statements for the year ended\n30 September 2024 (“AFS”), which are accessible via the following JSE cloudlink:\nhttps://senspdf.jse.co.za/documents/2024/JSE/ISSE/SPP/FY24AFS.pdf and on the Company’s website\nat: https://thespargroup.com/resource-centre/results-announcements/.\nThe AFS were audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers Inc., who expressed an unmodified opinion thereon.\nBy order of the Board\nUmhlanga\n28 November 2024\nSponsor\nOne Capital"
