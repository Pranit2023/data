Governance\nCORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY GOVERNANCE\nWisdomTree has established a global committee and jurisdictional working groups to drive sustainability initiatives\nacross our business, with oversight from the WT Board of Directors (the “Board”) and our executive management team.\nThe Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board reviews and provides oversight of the Company’s strategy,\ninitiatives and policies concerning corporate responsibility, including a quarterly review of the Company’s human rights\npolicy and consideration of environmental, health and safety, and social matters, and makes recommendations to the\nBoard regarding the Company’s sustainability initiatives and relevant public disclosures.

All Rights Reserved.\nWisdomTree 2023 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY 7\n2. Governance (continued)\nWISDOMTREE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\nThe Board sets high standards for employees, officers and directors. Implicit in this philosophy is the importance of\nsound corporate governance. It is the Board’s duty to serve as a prudent fiduciary for stockholders and to oversee the\nmanagement of the Company’s business. To this end, the Board has established an Audit Committee, a Compensation\nCommittee and a Nominating and Governance Committee, each of which operates pursuant to a charter adopted by\nthe Board.\nThe Board has developed Corporate Governance Guidelines that serve to promote effective governance of\nWisdomTree. These guidelines include but are not limited to:\n+ Standards for Board composition, leadership, term and independence\n+ Conflicts of interest\n+ Compensation\n+ Annual Board and Committee evaluations\nUN PRINCIPLES FOR RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT\nSince February 2019, WisdomTree has been a signatory of the\nUnited Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (“PRI”).\nFounded in 2005, the PRI is a United Nations-supported network that encourages asset managers and other\ninstitutional investors to engage with corporations on environmental, social and governance issues to create a more\nsustainable global financial system and support long-term investment value.\n© 2024 WisdomTree, Inc. All Rights Reserved.\nWisdomTree 2023 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY 8\n3. Third-Party Service Providers\nSERVICE PROVIDER CODE OF CONDUCT\nWisdomTree is committed to conducting its business activities in a socially responsible and ethical manner and we\nexpect our service providers to act in the same manner. Similar to WisdomTree, the service providers that are most\ncritical to our business are primarily financial and professional services companies that have fairly low environmental\nimpacts. WisdomTree is dedicated to ensuring that its service providers are committed to maintaining the highest\nof ethical standards as it relates to their employees and sustainability initiatives. We expect each service provider to\nhave implemented a robust corporate responsibility program, and we incorporate the review of all such programs\ninto our standard due diligence process. On an ongoing basis, we review the policies of our most critical service\nproviders to ensure they continue to meet these high ethical standards. To date, we have not found any service\nproviders to be non-compliant.\nAt a minimum, WisdomTree expects primary service providers to:\n+ hold themselves to the highest ethical standards and act with integrity at all times;\n+ fully comply with all applicable laws and regulations within their respective industries and jurisdictions,\nincluding with regard to fair competition and anti-trust, bribery and corruption, employee wages and working\nhours, the use of child or forced labor, and involvement with human trafficking and slavery across their supply\nchains;\n+ provide a safe work environment for their employees and treat all employees and suppliers with dignity and\nrespect; and\n+ disclose any potential conflicts of interest in relation to the business they conduct with WisdomTree.\n© 2024 WisdomTree, Inc. All Rights Reserved.\nWisdomTree 2023 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY 9\n4. Culture of Compliance\nCOMPLIANCE\nWisdomTree is proud of its robust compliance program. It is WisdomTree’s policy to comply with all applicable\ngovernmental laws, rules and regulations. Each employee is responsible for adhering to the standards and restrictions\nimposed by those laws, rules and regulations, including those relating to accounting and auditing matters.\nCOMPLIANCE TRAINING FOR EMPLOYEES\nWisdomTree requires all new employees to attend a compliance training session with a Compliance Officer. The\ntraining covers all material aspects of WisdomTree’s policies and procedures, including the Code of Ethics. The Code\nof Ethics is a document that sets forth the standard of conduct for employees, including, among other things, the\nsafeguarding of material, non-public information, the avoidance of conflicts of interest, complying with applicable\nfederal securities laws and promptly reporting any violations of the Code of Ethics. Thereafter, at least annually,\nemployees are required to attest that they have read and understood all employee-related applicable policies and\nprocedures. These requirements are mandatory; non-attendance/non-completion may result in disciplinary action\nand, ultimately, loss of employment.\nCertain WisdomTree employees are designated as Access Persons because of their job function/title or their access\nto certain information. Access Persons are subject to additional compliance requirements, including pre-clearing\ncertain personal security trades with the Compliance Department before execution.\nWisdomTree employees in Europe who hold Certification Functions or are Senior Managers under the Senior\nManagers and Certification Regime are required to undergo fitness and probity testing on an annual basis to ensure\nthey remain competent to hold client dealing functions at the Company.\nAll European employees are required to complete continuous professional development hours each year alongside\ntheir compliance training. This requirement is 10 or 15 hours, depending on their jurisdiction in Europe.\nTo help reinforce WisdomTree’s commitment to shared values and to keep integrity, teamwork and excellence at the\nforefront, WisdomTree conducts training sessions in order to educate employees on impending regulatory changes,\ncertain compliance policies and procedures, and industry best practices, as they arise. For example, on an annual\nbasis, WisdomTree provides unconscious bias and other training for all employees, including leaders and managers,\nto assist in addressing potential personal biases that they may have when considering new hires and advancement of\nexisting employees. WisdomTree continuously explores other training opportunities and needs within the Company.\n© 2024 WisdomTree, Inc. All Rights Reserved.\nWisdomTree 2023 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY 10\n4. Culture of Compliance (continued)\nEMPLOYEE POLICIES & PROCEDURES\nWisdomTree employees are required to adhere to strict policies and procedures to ensure they act with the highest\nethical and business standards:\n+ Code of Business Conduct and Ethics: This policy governs the expectations for the conduct of our employees.\nAt the time of hire and annually thereafter, WisdomTree employees are required to certify that they have read,\nunderstand and agree to comply with the Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.\n+ Whistleblower Policy: WisdomTree has an established Whistleblower Policy that enables employees to report\ninstances of non-compliance on a named or anonymous basis (see additional information in the Whistleblower\nPolicy section below).\n+ Political Contributions Policy: This policy sets out the parameters and reporting requirements for employee\ncontributions to political organizations and campaigns for U.S.-based employees.\nBUSINESS CONTINUITY AND DISASTER RECOVERY\nAt WisdomTree, ensuring the continued operation of our business in the event of a significant business disruption\nor disaster is critical to us and our investors. To that end, WisdomTree has established a formal Business Continuity\nPlan (the “BCP”), which is designed to address unexpected events or significant business disruptions and to comply\nwith all applicable federal securities laws and other applicable laws or regulations to ensure preparedness during\nand following an unexpected event or significant business disruption. The BCP provides a structure and necessary\noperational details so that employees, the executive team, management, business operations and technical teams\ncan respond appropriately in the event of any disruption that could impact critical business functions. The BCP is\ndesigned to assess any situation and identify the potential impact on any critical business functions of WisdomTree,\nenabling us to recover and restore business operations as quickly as possible, continue to provide an acceptable level\nof services during any prolonged disruption, protect our books and records, and preserve fund shareholder services.\n© 2024 WisdomTree, Inc. All Rights Reserved.\nWisdomTree 2023 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY 11\n4. Culture of Compliance (continued)\nCYBERSECURITY\nWisdomTree’s cybersecurity risk management approach is based on emerging best practices for protecting against\ncyber threats—namely, the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. The NIST Cybersecurity Framework2 defines the set of\npeople, process and technology activities required to assess and mitigate cybersecurity risk. These activities are\nmapped to a set of specific technical security controls and cybersecurity policies and are applied to information\nassets3 based on their business criticality and level of risk.\nOur cybersecurity risk management policies and procedures include processes for the identification, assessment\nand treatment through mitigation, transfer, avoidance and/or acceptance of cybersecurity risks, and are designed\nto address cybersecurity risks identified by external auditors and assessors, threat intelligence providers, internal\nstakeholders, vulnerability management programs, and security management programs.\nAs part of our cybersecurity risk management program, WisdomTree uses external service providers, where appropriate,\nto assess, test or otherwise assist with aspects of our security controls. Additionally, as a public company, we are\nsubject to Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) requirements and must undergo independent audits of Information Technology\nGeneral Controls (ITGC) in support of Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICFR). These audits assess key\ninformation security and cybersecurity risks in the environment that may affect the confidentiality, integrity and\navailability of financial reporting systems and data.\nWisdomTree also conducts employee training and awareness programs that include periodic and ongoing\nassessments in an effort to drive adoption and awareness of cybersecurity processes and controls. On an annual\nbasis, employees are trained to identify potential cybersecurity threats so that they are better able to protect the\nCompany and colleagues from such risks. In addition, WisdomTree carries an information security risk insurance\npolicy that covers information security breaches.\nOur cybersecurity risk management program and related operations and processes are directed by our Chief\nInformation Officer (“CIO”), and the Board’s Audit Committee, which is 100% independent, oversees WisdomTree’s\nmanagement of cybersecurity risks. Pursuant to its charter, the Audit Committee is responsible for discussing\ncybersecurity-related risks with management and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such\nrisks, including our risk assessment and risk management policies. The CIO regularly reports to the Audit Committee\non our cybersecurity risks, and the chair of the Audit Committee reports on these discussions to the full Board. In\naddition, the CIO provides periodic reports to our Board.\nTo date, WisdomTree has not experienced any information security breaches. Accordingly, WisdomTree has not\nincurred any expenses from information security breaches or from related penalties and settlements to date.\n2 National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cyber Framework: http://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/\n3 An information asset is any data stored in company systems that is used or transformed by business processes.\n© 2024 WisdomTree, Inc. All Rights Reserved.\nWisdomTree 2023 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY 12\n4. Culture of Compliance (continued)\nPOLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS\nPolitical contributions by corporations to candidates are regulated, and may be prohibited, by the election laws of\nthe applicable jurisdiction. Accordingly, it is WisdomTree’s policy to not use “Company” funds to make contributions\nfor political purposes where such contributions are not permitted by the laws of the applicable jurisdiction. Any such\ncontributions, where permitted, must be reviewed and approved by the Chief Legal Officer (“CLO”) in advance.\nIn 2023, WisdomTree did not make any corporate political contributions, other than membership dues to trade\nassociations.\nIn addition, U.S.-based employees of WisdomTree must follow the procedures and reporting requirements of\nthe Company’s Political Contributions Policy when making personal political contributions, which includes the\nrequirement to pre-clear any such contributions with the Company’s Compliance Department.\nWHISTLEBLOWER POLICY\nIn order to maintain the highest standards of business conduct and ethics regarding its accounting standards and\ndisclosures, internal accounting controls, audit practices, and compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations,\nWisdomTree has established a formal Whistleblower Policy.\nIf employees have concerns or complaints related to compliance policies and procedures or applicable laws, or if\nthey believe that a potential compliance violation has occurred or is occurring, relating to WisdomTree, they may\nsubmit the complaint or concern directly to the applicable Chief Compliance Officer (“CCO”), CLO or other designated\nofficers of WisdomTree under the Whistleblower Policy, as applicable. Alternatively, employees can make an\nanonymous submission through the Company’s compliance management portal or send their complaint or concern\nto the mailing address and e-mail address maintained for the receipt of any accounting or auditing concerns or to\nthe Company’s outside legal counsel. WisdomTree’s European employees have the option to submit whistleblowing\nnotifications to the relevant regulator if they feel that concerns cannot be raised internally.\nAll complaints or concerns submitted will be treated seriously and with the utmost care, promptly reviewed by the\napplicable CCO, CLO or other designated officers and, if applicable, such other business area(s) as may be affected\nby such complaints or concerns and brought to the attention of other members of senior management and/or the\napplicable board of directors for further review or action. Each review will be conducted in a confidential manner to\nthe fullest extent possible, consistent with the need to conduct an adequate review.\nWisdomTree will not discharge, demote, suspend, threaten, harass or in any manner retaliate or discriminate against\nany employee, who in good faith, reports concerns regarding the Company’s accounting, internal accounting controls,\nfinancial statements, or auditing or compliance matters.\nTo date, no employee whistleblower complaints have been made.\n© 2024 WisdomTree, Inc. All Rights Reserved.\nWisdomTree 2023 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY 13\n4. Culture of Compliance (continued)\nANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING\nAlthough a formal anti-money laundering (“AML”) program requirement has not been established for U.S. registered\ninvestment advisors such as WTAM, we have adopted an AML policy and program for our U.S. ETF business as a best\npractice. The U.S. AML policy identifies an AML Compliance Officer who is responsible for overseeing, implementing,\nmonitoring and enforcing all aspects of the AML policy.\nGiven our business structure, the AML function is performed for our U.S. ETF business by our transfer agent State\nStreet Bank & Trust Company and our distributor, Foreside Fund Services, LLP (referred to collectively as the “AML\nservice providers”). The AML Compliance Officer oversees these AML service providers on an ongoing basis consistent\nwith the AML policy and procedures, including ensuring that each AML service provider subject to the USA Patriot\nAct has established written anti-money laundering compliance programs reasonably designed to comply with all\nrelevant anti-money laundering laws, including the USA Patriot Act. The AML Compliance Officer receives a quarterly\nAML certification from each AML service provider attesting to the effectiveness of its procedures and notifications of\nany AML issues that occurred during the period.\nFurther, WisdomTree Digital Assets presents a major addition to the Company’s overall AML compliance responsibilities\nand potential liability. Unlike WTAM and the U.S. ETF business, WisdomTree Digital Assets sells products directly to\nconsumers. This obligates WisdomTree Digital Assets to develop an AML program that fully complies with the U.S.\nBank Secrecy Act, certain related state laws, and the economic sanctions program administered by the Office of\nForeign Assets Control (“OFAC”). As a result, WisdomTree Digital Assets has developed an AML program that has:\n+ appropriate policies and procedures, including controls to detect and report unusual or suspicious activity, to\ncomply with the relevant regulation under the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act;\n+ designated an AML Compliance Officer for WisdomTree Digital Assets;\n+ an independent test (audit) of the AML compliance function on an at least annual basis; and\n+ appropriate subject matter-related training.\nIn addition, WisdomTree Digital Assets has created an appropriate OFAC compliance program. All customers are\nscanned against the relevant sanctions list at account opening and ongoing. Vendors and U.S. based employees of\nWisdomTree Digital Assets are included in the screening program.\nIn Europe, WisdomTree is obligated, under legal and regulatory requirements, to adopt effective and adequate\nprocedures to detect and prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. Our Europe AML policies and procedures\nextend across our European business and also consider the implications and potential risks of any third parties and\nservice providers. Under our Europe AML policy, WisdomTree has a Money Laundering Reporting Officer, who is\nresponsible for overseeing, implementing, monitoring, and enforcing all aspects of the AML policy. The Company’s\ncompliance function supports these efforts. Policy reviews are undertaken on a periodic basis with reporting to\nsenior management, the boards of directors of WisdomTree UK Ltd and WisdomTree Ireland Ltd, and the WT Board.\n© 2024 WisdomTree, Inc. All Rights Reserved.\nWisdomTree 2023 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY 14\n4. Culture of Compliance (continued)\nANTI-BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION\nWisdomTree has established policies to demonstrate its commitment to preventing bribery and corruption and\nestablishing a zero-tolerance approach in all parts of the organization’s business operation. These policies are overseen\nby the Board and executive management team.\nWisdomTree aims to limit its exposure to bribery by:\n+ setting out clear policies that prohibit bribery and corruption for WisdomTree’s operations;\n+ training all employees so that they can recognize and avoid bribery offenses or suspicious activity;\n+ encouraging employees to be vigilant and to report any suspicion of bribery, providing them with suitable channels\nof communication and ensuring sensitive information is treated appropriately; and\n+ taking appropriate action against any individual(s) involved in bribery.\nTo date, no fines have been imposed on, and no associated settlements have been entered into, by WisdomTree relating\nto bribery or corruption violations.\nTHIRD-PARTY OVERSIGHT\nWisdomTree’s U.S. ETF business uses third-party sub-advisers and other service providers to perform various back-office\nservices, including trading, investment management, distribution and administrative activities, and has agreements\nin place for all such relationships. All sub-advisers have a fiduciary duty to manage all investor accounts in a fair and\nequitable manner, and all third-party service providers must comply with all applicable rules and regulations regarding\ntrading, investment management and administrative activities.\nEach department head is responsible for conducting initial and ongoing due diligence relative to the services provided by\nthe sub-advisers and/or third-party service providers as it relates to their specific functions and operations. Any issues that\npresent business or compliance concerns are brought to the attention of the appropriate member of senior management\nand/or the CCO. The CCO receives quarterly and/or annual due diligence questionnaires from each sub-adviser that detail\nthe sub- adviser’s compliance with applicable securities laws as well as other activities as they relate to the ongoing\nmaintenance of WisdomTree’s and the sub-adviser’s compliance programs. Certain WisdomTree employees also receive\nreports that detail the internal control environment specifics and whether any deficiencies exist that require remediation.\nIn addition, WisdomTree has established a Risk Management Committee in the U.S. and a Risk and Compliance Committee\nin Europe. Both committees oversee relevant risks both inside and outside the Company including any heightened or\nchanged risks as they relate to independent third-party service providers. The Risk Management Committee consists of\nmembers of senior management, including all department heads, and WisdomTree’s CCO serves as the chairperson. The\nRisk and Compliance Committee consists of members of senior management, compliance teams and certain department\nheads; the Head of Compliance in Europe serves as the chairperson. Both committees generally meet on a quarterly basis.\nWisdomTree Digital Assets maintains a separate third-party oversight (vendor management) program. The process\nmirrors that of our U.S. ETF business with a similar escalation to the Risk Management Committee and a separate Risk\nCommittee maintained by WisdomTree Digital Assets. The relevant federal and state regulators require certain vendor\nmanagement processes, including an OFAC check and documentation of testing.\n© 2024 WisdomTree, Inc. All Rights Reserved.\nWisdomTree 2023 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY 15\n5. Diversity, Equity & Inclusion\nDIVERSE LEADERSHIP AND EMPLOYEE BASE\nWe recognize that a diverse set of perspectives is critical to innovation and have built a diverse workforce, inclusive\nof gender, race, ethnicity, religion, age, gender identity, gender expression and sexual orientation, as well as those in\nthe disabled community. We actively seek candidates from different backgrounds and outside traditional fields and\nreinforce our commitment to diversity through organizational policies, such as mandating fairness and equality for\nall employees and creating performance appraisal systems that are non-discriminatory. We pride ourselves on the\ndiversity of our employee base globally and are committed to offering employment to the best possible candidates\nregardless of whether they require sponsorship. Notably, WisdomTree Europe boasts employees from 20 different\nnationalities that speak 17 languages and are based throughout multiple countries, including the U.K., Italy, Ireland,\nFinland, France, Germany and Sweden.\nThe Board’s corporate governance guidelines specify that when considering director candidates, the Nominating and\nGovernance Committee should:\n+ take reasonable steps to ensure the Board’s overall composition complies with applicable law regarding\ndiversity matters, including with respect to the number of female directors and directors from unrepresented\ncommunities on the Board and to include qualified candidates having diversity inclusive of gender, race,\nethnicity, age, gender identity, gender expression and sexual orientation, in the pool of candidates to be\nconsidered by the Nominating and Governance Committee for recommendation to the Board; and\n+ actively seek out highly qualified women and people of color as nominees.\nConsistent with our corporate governance guidelines, since 2021, six highly qualified women have joined and\nare currently serving on our Board: Smita Conjeevaram (January 2021), Lynn S. Blake (May 2022), Daniela Mielke\n(September 2022), Shamla Naidoo (June 2023), Tonia Pankopf (June 2023) and Rilla Delorier (August 2023).\nWisdomTree Board of Directors Gender and Demographic Background\nGender Demographic Background\n(as of date of this report) (as of date of this report)\nMale, Multiracial,\n33% 11%\nAsian,\n11%\nFemale, White,\n67% 78%\n© 2024 WisdomTree, Inc.

Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (continued)\nDEI COUNCIL\nAt WisdomTree, we envision a future of investment excellence driven by a commitment to continuously strengthen our\ndiverse, equitable and inclusive workplace culture. Our Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Council (“DEI\nCouncil”), formed in 2021, is comprised of senior leaders and employees from both the U.S. and\nEurope and provides oversight and guidance in connection with the implementation of programs\ndesigned to foster a culture where every employee thrives, leveraging diverse perspectives and\ninclusive practices. For example, in 2023, the DEI Council held training sessions on understanding\nneurodiversity, implicit bias and embedding inclusion in feedback, roundtables on success\nand failure, and financial literacy workshops for employees and secondary school students. The DEI Council also\npromoted awareness days and months across the firm including with respect to black history, women’s history, pride,\nmental health and men’s health.\nWOMEN’S INITIATIVE NETWORK\nWisdomTree’s Women’s Initiative Network, or WIN, is a global employee-led network that is designed to provide:\n+ opportunities and support from all genders for women at WisdomTree;\n+ career development and professional training opportunities; and\n+ female empowerment and leadership within the organization.\nSince its inception in 2019, WIN has held numerous global events, including panel discussions on women in the\nworkforce featuring WisdomTree employees and notable guest speakers, interactive seminars on topics including\nnegotiation skills, workshops and coaching sessions to enhance confidence to speak up, and various roundtable\nforums and in-person and virtual social gatherings to promote connectivity and increase engagement. WIN also\nproduces regular internal “spotlight” newsletters to increase visibility and raise the profile of our female employees.\nIn addition, through WIN’s mentorship program, WIN members of all genders are connected with firm leaders who\ncan help them achieve their career development goals.\n© 2024 WisdomTree, Inc. All Rights Reserved.\nWisdomTree 2023 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY 17\n6. Employee Experience\nCOMPENSATION AND BENEFITS\nWisdomTree is committed to rewarding and supporting our employees in order to continue to attract and retain\ntop talent. Our incentive compensation program has been designed to reward our employees for their individual\nperformance as well as the Company’s performance and includes various quantitative metrics and qualitative\nresults that incentivize growth. We believe a key factor in our success has been and continues to be fostering an\nentrepreneurial culture where our employees act and think like our owners. As such, we believe that equity awards\nare an important part of our employees’ overall compensation package and that incentivizing our employees with\nequity aligns the interests of our employees with our stockholders.\nWe also offer a wide array of benefits including:\n+ generous healthcare coverage;\n+ employee retirement program—in the U.S., 50% of employee 401(k) contributions are matched;\n+ unlimited paid time off for U.S. employees;\n+ additional Wellness Days for U.S. employees, which are scheduled office closures around major market holidays;\n+ 8 weeks of paid sabbatical leave after 10 years of service with WisdomTree;\n+ life insurance and short- and long-term disability benefits;\n+ an Educational Assistance Program;\n+ paid parental leave for both parents;\n+ travel insurance;\n+ a stipend for mobile phone and home office supplies;\n+ discounted gym memberships and a “sweat equity” exercise reimbursement plan;\n+ CPR and first aid training;\n+ coverage for holistic medicine and pet insurance;\n+ virtual yoga, wellness and meditation sessions; and\n+ volunteer opportunities.\n© 2024 WisdomTree, Inc.

We are continuously evolving and refining how we work best to achieve\nindividual, team and Company goals. To that end, we have embraced a Work Smart philosophy that transcends physical work\nsettings, with a focus on optimizing productivity, efficiency and effectiveness of our work. Time in the office generally is not\nprescribed, and team leaders are empowered to determine how their teams work best, based on their roles, with employees\nremaining accountable for achieving individual, team and Company outcomes. To foster employee wellbeing and a healthy\nwork-life balance, we offer numerous wellness programs including meditation and yoga classes, health webinars, a weekly\nwellness newsletter and access to mental health professionals and other resources. Leveraging technology, we enhance\nthe employee experience through digital wellness platforms, facilitating remote access to health and wellbeing resources.\nWe also offer paid vacation (unlimited in the U.S.) and sick leave policies to provide employees additional flexibility, and\nour U.S. employees enjoy additional Wellness Days, which are scheduled office closures around major market holidays\nfor employees to collectively disconnect and rejuvenate. We support employees with their information technology needs,\nprovide a monthly stipend to cover remote work-related business expenses and provide guidance for managers to ensure\nthat employees remain connected and maintain physical, mental and emotional wellbeing.\nIn keeping with Work Smart, we now maintain a smaller office footprint globally to better align with the number of\nemployees expected to collaborate in person on any given day, while providing a space for employees to work and\nsocialize. As the safety and security of our employees who choose to work in our office space are of critical importance, we\nhave selected office buildings with robust security procedures, fire safety, and sanitation and health practices, and we offer\nvarious voluntary and mandatory safety training sessions.\nEMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT\nWe believe engaging our employees is key to fostering new ideas and driving commitment and productivity. We\ncommunicate frequently and transparently with our employees through a variety of communication methods, including\nan annual global virtual offsite where senior leaders review the firm’s prior-year accomplishments and articulate the\nobjectives for the coming year, and each department presents its respective prior-year accomplishments and current-year\nobjectives, monthly regional and quarterly global town halls, and firmwide weekly emails championing the team’s work.\nWe also seek feedback from our employees through annual engagement surveys and follow-up pulse surveys on various\ntopics. In addition, we provide opportunities for employees to participate in volunteer and charitable events.\nWe also believe it is important to celebrate employee and Company accomplishments. In 2023, we celebrated our fourth\nannual Team Alpha Awards to mark significant events and successes and to recognize employees who led those successes\nwhile exhibiting extraordinary teamwork and demonstrating strong character. Over 50 nominations were submitted and\nnarrowed down by a selection committee. The winners received a modest incentive compensation award, the opportunity\nto donate to a charity of their choice and to recognize other employees who assisted them.\nThe success of our employee engagement efforts is demonstrated by our employee retention rate of approximately\n93.4% in 2023. We also achieved overall positive results from our 2023 global employee engagement survey, with a 99%\nparticipation rate. Additionally, in the U.S., we were named a 2023 Best Places to Work in Money Management by Pensions\n& Investments for the fourth consecutive year and seventh year since the award was created. We ranked second within\nthe category for managers with 100–499 employees, the second consecutive year earning a ranking among the top five\nemployers. In the U.K., we were also named Best Workplace for medium-sized companies for a fourth consecutive year and\na 2023 Best Workplace for Women for medium-sized companies by Great Place to Work.\n© 2024 WisdomTree, Inc.

Community Investment\nCOMMUNITY SERVICE AT WISDOMTREE\nWisdomTree encourages employees to be active members of the community and to give back through a variety of\nprograms. In addition, WisdomTree selects charities each month to receive a donation, with a focus on support and\nDEI-related charities (e.g., MLK Day of Service, Black History Month, International Women’s Day, Earth Day, Mental\nHealth, PRIDE). In our London office, we support a program that matches our employees with local charities and social\nenterprises to provide business guidance and support to become more efficient, effective and sustainable organizations.\nWisdomTree has several programs and initiatives in place to encourage our workforce to give back, including:\n+ Charitable events: WisdomTree hosts employee events to raise money for charitable organizations throughout\nthe year, such as charity game nights and fitness challenges. We also offer unique volunteer and charity fundraising\nopportunities for our employees. For example, our London-based employees joined in in the World’s Largest\nCoffee morning for Macmillan Cancer Support.\n+ Clean the World: We worked with this organization to build 1,000 hygiene kits comprised of toiletry items and\ndonated them to a local New York City-based shelter.\n+ GradBag: In 2023, WIN members volunteered with GradBag, a charitable organization whose mission is to support\nunderserved college-bound students and to advance sustainability. WIN volunteers helped unload supplies and\nstage a shopping area for lightly used dorm room essentials for redistribution to incoming students in-need.\n+ Malala Fund: We work with the Malala Fund, which advocates for girls’ education and works for a world where\nevery girl can learn and lead, helping bolster girls’ secondary education globally.\n+ Movember: In November, several WisdomTree employees grew moustaches as a symbol of Movember, which is a\nmonth used to promote men’s health across the world. WisdomTree employees raised more than £2,000 through\na series of events that included hosting a comedy night, running, swimming and other activities. The donations will\nbe used to tackle testicular and prostate cancer as well as men’s mental health issues, which are often shied away\nfrom but affect men in our community.\n+ Paid Volunteer Days: Employees are offered paid time off to volunteer at a charitable organization of their choice.\n+ Refuge: In Europe, WisdomTree is raising money to support Refuge, the largest domestic abuse organization in the\nU.K. On any given day, our services support thousands of women and their children, helping them to overcome the\nphysical, emotional, financial and logistical impacts of abuse and rebuild their lives, free from fear.\n+ Schools Initiative: As part of its aim to amplify access to opportunities, the DEI Council has engaged with\nvarious high schools to provide financial literacy and exposure to roles within the financial service industry to\nunrepresented/underprivileged groups.\n+ Team Alpha Awards: On an annual basis, WisdomTree celebrates the Team Alpha Awards to mark significant\nevents and successes and to recognize employees who led those successes while exhibiting extraordinary\nteamwork and demonstrating strong character. In addition to their modest compensation award, winners are\ngiven the opportunity to donate to a charity of their choice. This incentive has resulted in charitable donations of\nmore than $30,000 per year.\n© 2024 WisdomTree, Inc. All Rights Reserved.\nWisdomTree 2023 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY 21\n8.
