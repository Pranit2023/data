Announces Transformative Merger with Premier Financial Corp.\n\nJuly 26, 2024\n\n_Creates a community-focused, regional financial services partner with $27+ billion in assets_\n\n_Announces $200 million in capital commitments in support of the merger_\n\nWHEELING, W. Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--  WesBanco, Inc. (“WesBanco”) (NASDAQ: WSBC) and Premier Financial Corp. (“Premier”) (NASDAQ: PFC) jointly announced today that they have executed a definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger (“Agreement”) providing for the merger of Premier with and into WesBanco. Jeff Jackson, President and Chief Executive Officer of WesBanco, and Gary Small, President and Chief Executive Officer of Premier, made the joint announcement. \n\nUnder the terms of the Agreement, which has been unanimously approved by the board of directors of both companies, WesBanco will exchange shares of its common stock for all of the outstanding shares of Premier common stock, in an all-stock transaction. Premier shareholders will be entitled to receive 0.80 of a share of WesBanco common stock for each share of Premier common stock they own upon the effective time of the merger, for aggregate merger consideration valued at approximately $959 million, or $26.66 per share, based on WesBanco’s closing stock price of $33.32 as of July 24, 2024. The transaction values Premier at a price to June 30, 2024 tangible book value per share of 142% and a price to mean analyst estimated 2024 earnings per share of 12.9 times. The merger is expected to qualify as a tax-free reorganization. \n\nWesBanco also announced today that it has entered into subscription agreements with investors to raise capital to support the merger, led by a $125 million investment from Wellington Management. Additional investors include Glendon Capital Management LP and Klaros Capital. In aggregate, $200 million of WesBanco common stock will be issued. The capital raise is expected to close on August 1, 2024. The proceeds of the capital raise are expected to support the pro forma bank’s balance sheet and regulatory capital ratios. \n\nUpon completion of the merger, the shares issued to Premier shareholders are expected to comprise 30% of the outstanding shares of the combined company, the shares issued in the capital raise are expected to represent 8% of the combined company, and 62% of the outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be held by legacy WesBanco shareholders. \n\nJeff Jackson, President and Chief Executive Officer of WesBanco, stated, “Today is an exciting day in WesBanco’s 155-year history as we announce our proposed merger with Premier and mark another milestone in our long-term growth strategy. This transformative merger will bring together two high-caliber institutions to create a community-focused, regional financial services partner strongly positioned to serve the unique needs of both our new and legacy communities. We are pleased to welcome Premier’s customers and employees to the WesBanco family and look forward to delivering exceptional customer experiences to our newest markets through a broader offering of banking and wealth management services. WesBanco has built an outstanding reputation for soundness, profitability, customer service, employer of choice and community development, as evidenced by multiple recent national accolades. We look forward to extending our legacy through this merger and bringing even greater value to our customers, teams, communities and shareholders.” \n\nWith highly compatible cultures and business models, the proposed merger will create a regional financial services institution with approximately $27 billion in assets, significant economies of scale, and strong pro forma profitability metrics. With complementary and contiguous geographic footprints, the combined company would be the 8th largest bank in Ohio, based on deposit market share, have increased presence in Indiana, and serve customers in nine states. \n\nExcluding certain merger-related charges and transaction related provision for credit losses, the transaction, with cost savings fully phased in, is anticipated to be more than 40% accretive to 2025 earnings. Estimated tangible book value dilution at closing of 13% is expected to be earned back in approximately 2.8 years, using the “cross-over” method. The merger is subject to a number of customary conditions, including the approvals of the appropriate regulatory authorities and approvals by the shareholders of both WesBanco and Premier. It is expected that the transaction should be completed during the first quarter of 2025. Upon completion of the merger, four members of Premier’s current Board of Directors will be appointed to WesBanco’s Board of Directors. \n\n“The combination of WesBanco and Premier makes for an excellent strategic fit. Both organizations value community level banking, are well aligned from a culture perspective, and are focused on performance,” said Gary Small, President and Chief Executive Officer of Premier. “The expanded reach of the organization will serve as a catalyst for growth and increased investment in products and services, to the benefit of all stakeholders: customers, associates, shareholders, as well as the communities we serve.” \n\nAt June 30, 2024, WesBanco had consolidated assets of approximately $18.1 billion, deposits of $13.4 billion, total loans of $12.3 billion, and shareholders’ equity of $2.5 billion. \n\nAt June 30, 2024, Premier had consolidated assets of approximately $8.8 billion, deposits of $7.2 billion, total loans of $6.8 billion, and shareholders’ equity of $1.0 billion. \n\nWhen the transaction is consummated, WesBanco will have more than 250 financial centers, as well as loan production offices, across nine states. The transaction will expand WesBanco’s franchise by 73 financial centers located primary throughout northern Ohio, as well as in southern Michigan and northeastern Indiana. Officials of both organizations are optimistic that organizing around customer services and product delivery can be accomplished with as little employee disruption as possible. \n\nAs a condition to WesBanco’s willingness to enter into the Agreement, all of the directors and executive officers of Premier have entered into voting agreements with WesBanco pursuant to which they have agreed to vote their shares in favor of the merger. \n\nFinancial advisors involved in the transaction were Raymond James & Associates, Inc., representing WesBanco, and Piper Sandler & Co., representing Premier. Raymond James & Associates, Inc. also served as placement agent on the private placement. \n\nLegal representations in the transaction include Phillips, Gardill, Kaiser & Altmeyer, PLLC and K&L Gates LLP for WesBanco, Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough, LLP for Premier, Hunton Andrews Kurth LLP for Raymond James and Schulte Roth & Zabel LLP for Wellington Management. \n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThe statements in this press release that are not historical facts, in particular the statements with respect to the expected timing of and benefits of the proposed merger between WesBanco and Premier, the parties’ plans, obligations, expectations, and intentions, and the statements with respect to accretion and earn back of tangible book value dilution, constitute forward-looking statements as defined by federal securities laws.

Announces Second Quarter 2024 Results and Strategic Merger with Wesbanco, Inc.\n\nJuly 26, 2024\n\nDEFIANCE, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)--  Premier Financial Corp. (Nasdaq: PFC) (“Premier” or the “Company”) announced today 2024 second quarter results and the signing of a definitive merger agreement with Wesbanco, Inc. (Nasdaq: WSBC). \n\n_**Strategic Merger** _\n\nOn July 26, 2024, PFC and WSBC announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement under which PFC will merge into WSBC in a stock-for-stock transaction. Under the terms of the merger agreement, shareholders of PFC will receive 0.80 shares of WSBC common stock for each share of PFC common stock. Premier Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of PFC, will merge into Wesbanco Bank, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of WSBC. Based upon a closing price for WSBC as of July 25, 2024 of $34.28, the transaction is valued at approximately $987 million, or $27.42 per common share of PFC. Upon closing, PFC shareholders will own approximately 30% of the combined company. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025, subject to the approval of shareholders of both PFC and WSBC and regulatory approvals, as well as satisfaction or waiver of other customary closing conditions. Additional information can be found in the press release announcing the merger dated July 26, 2024. \n\n_**Quarterly results** _\n\nNet income for the second quarter of 2024 was $16.2 million, or $0.45 per diluted common share, compared to income of $48.4 million, or $1.35 per diluted common share, for the second quarter of 2023. Second quarter 2023 results included the impact of the disposition of the Company’s insurance agency, First Insurance Group (“FIG”), for a net gain on sale after transaction costs of $32.6 million pre-tax or $0.67 per diluted common share after-tax. Excluding the impact of this transaction, second quarter 2023 earnings were $24.2 million or $0.68 per diluted common share. \n\n_Net interest income and margin_\n\nNet interest income of $49.3 million on a tax equivalent (“TE”) basis in the second quarter of 2024 was down 0.7% from $49.6 million in the first quarter of 2024 and down 8.8% from $54.1 million in the second quarter of 2023. The TE net interest margin of 2.46% in the second quarter of 2024 decreased four basis points from 2.50% in the first quarter of 2024 and 26 basis points from 2.72% in the second quarter of 2023. These results are primarily impacted by changes in deposit balances/costs and loan balances/yields. \n\nTotal deposits decreased $4.8 million during the second quarter of 2024 from the first quarter of 2024 due to an $18.7 million decrease in customer deposits offset partly by an increase of $13.9 million in brokered deposits. Total average interest-bearing deposit costs increased nine basis points to 3.10% during the second quarter of 2024 from the first quarter of 2024. This increase was primarily due to new customer acquisitions and the migration of customers from non-interest-bearing deposits into interest-bearing deposits, including higher cost time deposits, as customers continue to seek better yields. Total average customer deposit costs including non-interest bearing and excluding brokered deposits and acquisition marks were 2.33% during the month of June, representing a cumulative beta of 41% compared to the change in the monthly average effective Federal Funds rate that increased 525 basis points to 5.33% since December 2021, as reported by the Federal Reserve Economic Data. Beginning in March 2024 and through June 2024, management implemented rate reductions in certain higher-cost deposit tiers. The benefit of those actions began to be realized in June 2024 as the 2.33% average cost noted above was a decline of two basis points from the prior month. \n\nTotal loans including held-for-sale decreased $10.5 million, during the second quarter of 2024, primarily due to a $14.7 million decrease in residential loans including held-for-sale. Total average loan yields increased seven basis points to 5.26% for the second quarter of 2024. This increase was primarily due to origination of higher yielding loans and payoffs of lower yielding loans. Total average loan yields excluding PPP, balance sheet hedges and acquisition marks were 5.36% during the month of June (up seven basis points from 5.29% in March), representing a cumulative beta of 31% compared to the change in the monthly average effective Federal Funds rate for the same period. \n\n_Non-interest income_\n\nTotal non-interest income in the second quarter of 2024 of $12.1 million was down 3.3% from $12.5 million in the first quarter of 2024, and down 6.5% from $12.9 million in the second quarter of 2023, excluding insurance commissions and the gain on sale of insurance agency, primarily due to fluctuations in mortgage banking income. Mortgage banking income decreased $0.3 million on a linked quarter basis and $0.9 million from second quarter 2023, primarily as a result of fluctuations in gain on sale margins and MSR valuation adjustments. \n\nSecurity losses were $176 thousand in the second quarter of 2024, compared to losses of $37 thousand in the first quarter of 2024 and gains of $64 thousand in the second quarter of 2023, primarily due to valuation changes on equity securities. Service fees in the second quarter of 2024 were $7.0 million, an 8.4% increase from $6.5 million in the first quarter of 2024, but a 2.5% decrease from $7.2 million in the second quarter of 2023. This change was primarily due to fluctuations in loan fees, including commercial customer swap activity. Due to the insurance agency sale on June 30, 2023, there were no insurance commissions in the second quarter of 2024, compared to $4.1 million in the second quarter of 2023. Wealth management income of $1.8 million in the second quarter of 2024 was up slightly from $1.7 million in the first quarter of 2024 and 19.8% higher than $1.5 million in the second quarter of 2023. BOLI income of $1.2 million in the second quarter of 2024 included no claim gains, compared to $1.7 million in the first quarter of 2024, including $0.5 million of claim gains, and $1.0 million in the second quarter of 2023 with no claim gains. \n\n_Non-interest expenses_\n\nNon-interest expenses excluding transaction costs in the second quarter of 2024 were $38.2 million, a 4.4% decrease from $39.9 million in the first quarter of 2024, and a 6.6% decrease from $40.8 million in the second quarter of 2023, excluding transaction costs for the insurance agency sale. Compensation and benefits were $21.4 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared to $23.4 million in the first quarter of 2024 and $24.2 million in the second quarter of 2023. The linked quarter decrease was primarily due to lower staffing and items that occur annually in the first quarter. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to the insurance agency sale, partially offset by costs related to higher staffing levels and higher base compensation, including 2024 annual merit adjustments. Data processing costs were $5.1 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared to $4.7 million in the first quarter of 2024 and $3.6 million in the second quarter of 2023, with the year-over-year increase primarily due to the new digital platform launched in October 2023. All other non-interest expenses decreased a net $0.1 million on a linked quarter basis due to cost saving initiatives and decreased a net $1.3 million from second quarter 2023 due to the insurance agency sale and cost saving initiatives. The core efficiency ratio for the second quarter of 2024 was 62.0% compared to 64.2% in the first quarter of 2024 and 57.5% in the second quarter of 2023. The ratio of core non-interest expenses to average assets improved to 1.78% for the second quarter of 2024 from 1.87% for the first quarter of 2024 and from 1.91% for the second quarter of 2023. \n\n**_Credit quality_ **\n\nNon-performing assets totaled $64.6 million, or 0.74% of assets, at June 30, 2024, an increase from $39.3 million at March 31, 2024, and from $37.6 million at June 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to one large commercial credit that was previously reported in classified loans. Loan delinquencies increased to $24.6 million, or 0.36% of loans, at June 30, 2024, from $18.3 million at March 31, 2024, and from $19.0 million at June 30, 2023. Criticized loans totaled $207.8 million, or 3.04% of loans, as of June 30, 2024, an increase from $191.5 million at March 31, 2024, and from $121.2 million at June 30, 2023. \n\nThe 2024 second quarter results include net charge-offs of $2.6 million and a total provision expense of $2.9 million, compared with net loan recoveries of $0.2 million and a total provision expense of $0.5 million for the same period in 2023. The change in provision is primarily due to higher charge-offs. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.16% at June 30, 2024, compared with 1.15% at March 31, 2024, and 1.13% at June 30, 2023. \n\n**_Year to date results_ **\n\nNet income for the first half of 2024 was $34.0 million, or $0.95 per diluted common share, compared to income of $66.5 million, or $1.86 per diluted common share for the first half of 2023. First half 2023 results included the impact of the insurance agency sale for a net gain on sale after transaction costs of $32.6 million pre-tax or $0.67 per diluted common share after-tax. Excluding the impact of this item, first half 2023 earnings were income of $42.4 million or $1.19 per diluted common share. \n\nNet interest income of $98.9 million on a TE basis for the first half of 2024 was down 10.4% from $110.4 million in the first half of 2023. The TE net interest margin of 2.48% in the first half of 2024 decreased 33 basis points from 2.81% in the first half of 2023. These results are positively impacted by the combination of loan growth and higher loan yields, which were 5.23% for the first half of 2024 compared to 4.76% in the first half of 2023. These results are negatively impacted by increase in the cost of funds in the first half of 2024 of 2.56%, up 84 basis points from the first half of 2023. The year-over-year increase is largely due to increasing costs of customer deposits and higher utilization of FHLB borrowings. \n\nTotal non-interest income in the first half of 2024 of $24.6 million was up 19.0% from $20.7 million in the first half of 2023, excluding insurance commissions and the gain on the sale of the insurance agency. Mortgage banking income increased $1.7 million year-over-year primarily as a result of a $1.3 million increase in gains due to better margins. \n\nSecurity losses were $0.2 million in the first half of 2024 compared to $1.3 million in the first half of 2023, primarily due to valuations on equity securities. The company also sold $21 million of AFS securities for a $27 thousand gain with average yields less than FHLB borrowing rates during the first half of 2023. Service fees in the first half of 2024 were $13.5 million, a 1.1% decrease from $13.6 million in the first half of 2023, primarily due to fluctuations in loan fees including commercial customer swap activity and consumer activity for interchange and ATM/NSF charges. Due to the insurance agency sale on June 30, 2023, there were no insurance commissions in the first half of 2024, compared to $8.9 million in the first half of 2023. Wealth management income of $3.6 million in the first half of 2024 was up 17.7% from $3.0 million in the first half of 2023. BOLI income of $2.9 million in the first half of 2024 included $0.5 million of claim gains, compared to $2.4 million in the first half of 2023, including $0.4 million of claim gains. \n\nNon-interest expenses excluding transaction costs in the first half of 2024 were $78.1 million, a 6.7% decrease from $83.6 million in the first half of 2023. Compensation and benefits were $44.7 million in the first half of 2024, compared to $49.8 million in the first half of 2023. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to the insurance agency sale, partially offset by costs related to higher staffing levels and higher base compensation, including 2024 annual merit adjustments. FDIC premiums decreased $0.8 million on a year-over-year basis primarily due to lower rates. Data processing costs were $9.7 million in the first half of 2024, compared to $7.5 million in the first half of 2023, with the year-over-year increase primarily due to the new digital platform launched in October 2023. All other non-interest expenses decreased a net $1.9 million on a year-over-year basis due to the insurance agency sale and cost saving initiatives. The core efficiency ratio for the first half of 2024 of 63.1% increased from 59.2% in the first half of 2023 due to lower revenues partly offset by cost saving initiatives that began during the second quarter of 2023. The ratio of core non-interest expenses to average assets improved to 1.82% for the first half of 2024 from 1.98% for the first half of 2023. \n\nThe 2024 first half results include net loan charge-offs of $3.0 million and a total provision expense of $2.8 million, compared with net loan charge-offs of $2.2 million and a total provision expense of $4.2 million for the same period in 2023. The year-over-year change in provision expense is primarily due to a decrease in loans during the first half of 2024 compared to an increase in loans during the first half of 2023. \n\n**_Total assets at $8.78 billion_ **\n\nTotal assets at June 30, 2024, were $8.78 billion, compared to $8.63 billion at March 31, 2024, and $8.62 billion at June 30, 2023. Loans receivable were $6.68 billion at June 30, 2024, compared to $6.69 billion at March 31, 2024, and $6.71 billion at June 30, 2023. Securities at June 30, 2024, were $1.09 billion, compared to $1.02 billion at March 31, 2024, and $0.97 billion at June 30, 2023. All securities are either AFS or trading and are reflected at fair value on the balance sheet. Also, at June 30, 2024, goodwill and other intangible assets totaled $305.9 million compared to $306.8 million at March 31, 2024, and $309.9 million at June 30, 2023, with the decreases due to amortization of intangibles. \n\nTotal non-brokered deposits at June 30, 2024, were $6.80 billion, compared with $6.81 billion at March 31, 2024, and $6.58 billion at June 30, 2023. Brokered deposits were $382.7 million at June 30, 2024, compared to $368.8 million at March 31, 2024 and $413.2 million at June 30, 2023. FHLB borrowings increased to $393.0 million at June 30, 2024, from $253.0 million at March 31, 2024, but decreased from $455.0 million at June 30, 2023. On June 28, 2024, $50 million of deposits were received late in the day and used to paydown FHLB borrowings on July 1, 2024. \n\nTotal stockholders’ equity was $979.1 million at June 30, 2024, compared to $974.3 million at March 31, 2024, and $937.0 million at June 30, 2023, with the increases primarily due to net earnings in excess of dividends. Excluding goodwill and intangibles, tangible equity was $673.3 million at June 30, 2024, an increase from $667.5 million at March 31, 2024, and from $627.1 million at June 30, 2023. \n\nRegulatory ratios all improved during the second quarter of 2024, including CET1 of 11.91%, Tier 1 of 12.41% and Total Capital of 14.25%. All of these ratios also exceed well-capitalized guidelines pro forma for including accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”), including CET1 of 9.61%, Tier 1 of 10.10% and Total Capital of 11.95%. \n\n**_Dividend to be paid August 16_ **\n\nThe Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.31 per common share payable August 16, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 9, 2024. The dividend represents an annual dividend yield of 4.9% percent based on the Premier common stock closing price on July 25, 2024. Premier has approximately 35,839,000 common shares outstanding. \n\n**_Conference call canceled_ **\n\nPremier will no longer host its previously planned conference call at 10:00 a.m. ET on Wednesday, July 31, 2024. \n\n**_About Premier Financial Corp._ **\n\nPremier Financial Corp.

These statements may include, but are not limited to, statements regarding projections, forecasts, goals and plans of Premier Financial Corp. (“Premier”) and its management, and include statements related to the expected timing, completion and benefits of the proposed merger with WesBanco, Inc. (“WesBanco”) (the ‘Merger”), future movements of interest rates, loan or deposit production levels, future credit quality ratios, future strength in the market area, and growth projections. These statements do not describe historical or current facts and may be identified by words such as “intend,” “intent,” “believe,” “expect,” “estimate,” “target,” “plan,” “anticipate,” or similar words or phrases, or future or conditional verbs such as “will,” “would,” “should,” “could,” “might,” “may,” “can,” or similar verbs. There can be no assurances that the forward-looking statements included in this document will prove to be accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties in the forward-looking statements, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by Premier or any other persons, that our objectives and plans will be achieved, including with respect to the Merger. Forward-looking statements involve numerous risks and uncertainties, any one or more of which could affect Premier’s business and financial results in future periods and could cause actual results to differ materially from plans and projections. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, (1) the businesses of Premier and WesBanco may not be integrated successfully or such integration may take longer to accomplish than expected, (2) the expected cost savings and any revenue synergies from the proposed Merger may not be fully realized within the expected timeframes, (3) disruption from the proposed Merger may make it more difficult to maintain relationships with customers, associates, or suppliers, (4) the required governmental approvals of the proposed Merger may not be obtained on the expected terms and schedule, (5) Premier’s shareholders and/or WesBanco’s shareholders may not approve the proposed Merger and the merger agreement, and WesBanco’s shareholders may not approve the issuance of shares of WesBanco common stock in the proposed Merger. Further information regarding additional factors that could affect the forward-looking statements can be found in the cautionary language included under the headings “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” (in the case of Premier), “Forward-Looking Statements” (in the case of WesBanco), and “Risk Factors” in Premier’s and WesBanco’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and other documents subsequently filed by Premier and WesBanco with the SEC. These risks and uncertainties include other risks and uncertainties detailed from time to time in our Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and any further amendments thereto. All forward-looking statements made in this document are based on information presently available to the management of Premier and speak only as of the date on which they are made. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law. As required by U.S. GAAP, Premier will evaluate the impact of subsequent events through the issuance date of its June 30, 2024, consolidated financial statements as part of its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to be filed with the SEC, including with respect to the Merger. Accordingly, subsequent events could occur that may cause Premier to update its critical accounting estimates and to revise its financial information from that which is contained in this news release. \n\n**_Non-GAAP Reporting Measures_ **\n\nWe believe that net income, as defined by U.S. GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measurement. However, we consider core net interest income, core net income and core pre-tax pre-provision income to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance. We define core net interest income as net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis excluding income from PPP loans and purchase accounting marks accretion. We define core net income as net income excluding the after-tax impacts of the insurance agency gain on sale and transaction costs. We define core pre-tax pre-provision income as pre-tax pre-provision income excluding the pre-tax impact of the insurance agency gain on sale and transaction costs. We believe that these metrics are useful supplemental measures of operating performance because investors and equity analysts may use these measures to compare the operating performance of the Company between periods or as compared to other financial institutions or other companies on a consistent basis without having to account for income from PPP loans, purchase accounting marks accretion, or the insurance agency sale. Our supplemental reporting measures and similarly entitled financial measures are widely used by investors, equity and debt analysts and ratings agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies. Our management uses these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to historical operating results and in making operating decisions. Additionally, they are utilized by the Board of Directors to evaluate management. The supplemental reporting measures do not represent net income or cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity. Finally, the supplemental reporting measures, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other financial institutions or other companies. Please see the exhibits for reconciliations of our non-GAAP reporting measures. \n\n**_Subsequent Event_ **\n\nAs announced and further described in a separate press release jointly issued by Premier and WesBanco, Inc. today, Premier and WesBanco have entered into a merger agreement. \n\n_**Consolidated Balance Sheets (Unaudited)** _  \n---  \n_**Premier Financial Corp.** _  \n**June 30,** | March 31, | December 31, | September 30, | June 30,  \n_(in thousands)_ |  **2024** |  2024  |  2023  |  2023  |  2023   \n_**Assets** _  \nCash and cash equivalents  \nCash and amounts due from depositories |  **$** |  **72,053** |  $  |  57,956  |  $  |  81,973  |  $  |  70,642  |  $  |  71,096   \nInterest-bearing deposits |  **83,598** |  31,725  |  32,783  |  46,855  |  50,631   \n**155,651** |  89,681  |  114,756  |  117,497  |  121,727   \nAvailable-for-sale, carried at fair value |  **1,081,120** |  1,014,433  |  946,708  |  911,184  |  961,123   \nEquity securities, carried at fair value |  **5,559** |  5,736  |  5,773  |  5,860  |  6,458   \nSecurities investments |  **1,086,679** |  1,020,169  |  952,481  |  917,044  |  967,581   \nLoans (1) |  **6,682,138** |  6,693,745  |  6,739,387  |  6,696,869  |  6,708,568   \nAllowance for credit losses -
