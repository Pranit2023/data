Net income remained relatively the same for both the third quarter and second quarter of 2024 at $5.4 million, or $0.36 per diluted common share, compared with $5.1 million, or $0.33 per diluted common share, for the third quarter of 2023. \n\n**Min Kim, President and Chief Executive Officer** : \n\n“We continued to grow our loans and deposits at double digit annualized rates in this quarter while maintaining ample liquidity, stable net interest margin, and strong credit quality. As the Fed's easing cycle began in the quarter, the pressure on funding cost and net interest margin is diminishing, and we believe we are well positioned to prolong our growth and performance to achieve our long term strategic goals,” said Min Kim, President and Chief Executive. \n\n**SELECTED FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS**\n\n($ in thousands, except per share data)  |  **As of and For the Quarter**

These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those projected. These risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control, include, but are not limited to: the effects of substantial fluctuations in, and continuing elevated levels of, interest rates on our borrowers’ ability to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans and on our deposit customers’ expectation for higher rates on deposit products; cybersecurity risks, including the potential for the occurrence of successful cyberattacks and our ability to prevent and to mitigate the harms resulting from any such attacks; infrastructure risks and similar circumstances that affect our and our customers’ ability to communicate and to engage in routine online banking activities; business and economic conditions, particularly those affecting the financial services industry and our primary market areas; risks of international conflict, terrorism, civil unrest and domestic instability; the continuing effects of inflation and monetary policies, particularly those relating to the decisions and indicators of intent expressed by the Federal Reserve Open Markets Committee, as those circumstances impact our operations and our current and prospective borrowers and depositors; our ability to balance deposit liabilities and liquidity sources (including our ability to reprice those instruments and balancing our borrowings and investments to keep pace with changing market conditions) so as to meet current and expected withdrawals while promoting strong earning capacity; our ability to manage our credit risk successfully and to assess, adjust and monitor the sufficiency of our allowance for credit losses; factors that can impact the performance of our loan portfolio, including real estate values and liquidity in our primary market areas, the financial health of our commercial borrowers, the success of construction projects that we finance, including any loans acquired in acquisition transactions; the impacts of credit quality on our earnings and the related effects of increases to the reserve on our net income; our ability effectively to execute our strategic plan and manage our growth; interest rate fluctuations, which could have an adverse effect on our profitability; external economic and/or market factors, such as changes in monetary and fiscal policies and laws, including inflation or deflation, changes in the demand for loans, and fluctuations in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits, which may have an adverse impact on our financial condition; continued or increasing competition from other banks and from credit unions and non-bank financial services companies, many of which are subject to less restrictive or less costly regulations than we are; challenges arising from unsuccessful attempts to expand into new geographic markets, products, or services; practical and regulatory constraints on the ability of Open Bank to pay dividends to us; increased capital requirements imposed by banking regulators, which may require us to raise capital at a time when capital is not available on favorable terms or at all; a failure in the internal controls we have implemented to address the risks inherent to the business of banking; including internal controls that affect the reliability of our publicly reported financial statements; inaccuracies in our assumptions about future events, which could result in material differences between our financial projections and actual financial performance, particularly with respect to the effects of predictions of future economic conditions as those circumstances affect our estimates for the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses and the related provision expense; changes in our management personnel or our inability to retain motivate and hire qualified management personnel; disruptions, security breaches, or other adverse events, failures or interruptions in, or attacks on, our information technology systems; disruptions, security breaches, or other adverse events affecting the third-party vendors who perform several of our critical processing functions; an inability to keep pace with the rate of technological advances due to a lack of resources to invest in new technologies; risks related to potential acquisitions; political developments, uncertainties or instability, catastrophic events, or natural disasters, such as earthquakes, fires, drought, pandemic diseases (such as the coronavirus) or extreme weather events, any of which may affect services we use or affect our customers, employees or third parties with which we conduct business; incremental costs and obligations associated with operating as a public company; the impact of any claims or legal actions to which we may be subject, including any effect on our reputation; compliance with governmental and regulatory requirements, including the Dodd-Frank Act and others relating to banking, consumer protection, securities and tax matters, and our ability to maintain licenses required in connection with commercial mortgage origination, sale and servicing operations; changes in federal tax law or policy; and our ability the manage the foregoing and other factors set forth in the Company’s public reports. We describe these and other risks that could affect our results in Item 1A. “Risk Factors,” of our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and in our subsequent filings

Customers’ preference for high-rate deposit products continued to drive the increase in time deposits.

Noninterest-bearing deposits, as a percentage of total deposits, decreased to 27.2% from 33.2%. The composition shift to time deposits was primarily due to customers’ preference for high-rate deposit products driven by market rate increases as a result of the Federal Reserve’s rate increases. \n\nThe following table sets forth the maturity of time deposits as of September 30, 2024: \n\n**As of September 30, 2024**  \n---  \n($ in thousands)  |  **Within Three** **Months** |  **Three to** **Six Months** |  **Six to Nine Months** |  **Nine to Twelve** **Months** |  **After** **Twelve Months** |  **Total**  \nTime deposits (greater than $250)  |  $  |  205,957  |  $  |  189,693  |  $  |  87,508  |  $  |  80,133  |  $  |  1,256  |  $  |  564,547   \nTime deposits ($250 or less)  |  261,163  |  124,315  |  97,180  |  92,585  |  19,824  |  595,067   \nTotal time deposits  |  $  |  467,120  |  $  |  314,008  |  $  |  184,688  |  $  |  172,718  |  $  |  21,080  |  $  |  1,159,614   \nWeighted average rate  |  5.18  |  %  |  5.03  |  %  |  5.16  |  %  |  4.93  |  %  |  3.94  |  %  |  5.08  |  %   \n  \n**OTHER HIGHLIGHTS**\n\n**Liquidity**\n\nThe Company maintains ample access to liquidity, including highly liquid assets on our balance sheet and available unused borrowings from other financial institutions.

These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those projected. These risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control, include, but are not limited to: the effects of substantial fluctuations in, and continuing elevated levels of, interest rates on our borrowers’ ability to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans and on our deposit customers’ expectation for higher rates on deposit products; cybersecurity risks, including the potential for the occurrence of successful cyberattacks and our ability to prevent and to mitigate the harms resulting from any such attacks; infrastructure risks and similar circumstances that affect our and our customers’ ability to communicate and to engage in routine online banking activities; business and economic conditions, particularly those affecting the financial services industry and our primary market areas; risks of international conflict, terrorism, civil unrest and domestic instability; the continuing effects of inflation and monetary policies, particularly those relating to the decisions and indicators of intent expressed by the Federal Reserve Open Markets Committee, as those circumstances impact our operations and our current and prospective borrowers and depositors; our ability to balance deposit liabilities and liquidity sources (including our ability to reprice those instruments and balancing our borrowings and investments to keep pace with changing market conditions) so as to meet current and expected withdrawals while promoting strong earning capacity; our ability to manage our credit risk successfully and to assess, adjust and monitor the sufficiency of our allowance for credit losses; factors that can impact the performance of our loan portfolio, including real estate values and liquidity in our primary market areas, the financial health of our commercial borrowers, the success of construction projects that we finance, including any loans acquired in acquisition transactions; the impacts of credit quality on our earnings and the related effects of increases to the reserve on our net income; our ability effectively to execute our strategic plan and manage our growth; interest rate fluctuations, which could have an adverse effect on our profitability; external economic and/or market factors, such as changes in monetary and fiscal policies and laws, including inflation or deflation, changes in the demand for loans, and fluctuations in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits, which may have an adverse impact on our financial condition; continued or increasing competition from other banks and from credit unions and non-bank financial services companies, many of which are subject to less restrictive or less costly regulations than we are; challenges arising from unsuccessful attempts to expand into new geographic markets, products, or services; practical and regulatory constraints on the ability of Open Bank to pay dividends to us; increased capital requirements imposed by banking regulators, which may require us to raise capital at a time when capital is not available on favorable terms or at all; a failure in the internal controls we have implemented to address the risks inherent to the business of banking; including internal controls that affect the reliability of our publicly reported financial statements; inaccuracies in our assumptions about future events, which could result in material differences between our financial projections and actual financial performance, particularly with respect to the effects of predictions of future economic conditions as those circumstances affect our estimates for the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses and the related provision expense; changes in our management personnel or our inability to retain motivate and hire qualified management personnel; disruptions, security breaches, or other adverse events, failures or interruptions in, or attacks on, our information technology systems; disruptions, security breaches, or other adverse events affecting the third-party vendors who perform several of our critical processing functions; an inability to keep pace with the rate of technological advances due to a lack of resources to invest in new technologies; risks related to potential acquisitions; political developments, uncertainties or instability, catastrophic events, or natural disasters, such as earthquakes, fires, drought, pandemic diseases (such as the coronavirus) or extreme weather events, any of which may affect services we use or affect our customers, employees or third parties with which we conduct business; incremental costs and obligations associated with operating as a public company; the impact of any claims or legal actions to which we may be subject, including any effect on our reputation; compliance with governmental and regulatory requirements, including the Dodd-Frank Act and others relating to banking, consumer protection, securities and tax matters, and our ability to maintain licenses required in connection with commercial mortgage origination, sale and servicing operations; changes in federal tax law or policy; and our ability the manage the foregoing and other factors set forth in the Company’s public reports. We describe these and other risks that could affect our results in Item 1A. “Risk Factors,” of our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and in our subsequent filings

The\nCompany’s primary business operations are conducted through its wholly owned subsidiary, Open Bank, a California chartered\ncommercial bank (“Bank”), and unless the context requires otherwise, statements about the Company generally are intended to describe\nthe consolidated operations of the Company and the Bank.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nCertain matters set forth herein constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 3b-6 promulgated thereunder. All statements that are not statements of historical fact are\nforward-looking, and readers should not construe these statements of assurances of expected or intended results, or of promises that\nmanagement will take a given course of action or pursue the currently expected strategies and objectives. Forward-looking statements\nin this report include comments about the Company’s current business plans and expectations regarding future operating results, as well\nas management’s statements about expected future events and economic developments, plans, strategies and objectives. All such\nstatements reflect the current intentions, beliefs and expectations of the Company’s executive management based on currently available\ninformation and current and expected market conditions. Forward-looking statements can sometimes be identified by the use of\nforward-looking language, such as “likely result in,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “forecasts,” “projects,” “intends to,” or may\ninclude other similar words or phrases, such as “believes,” “plans,” “trend,” “objective,” “continues,” “remains,” or similar expressions,\nor future or conditional verbs, such as “will,” “would,” “should,” “could,” “may,” “might,” “can,” or similar verbs.\nOur forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance or\nachievements to differ materially from those projected or could cause us to change plans or strategies or otherwise to take actions that\ndiffer from those we currently expect. These risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond management's control, include, but are\nnot limited to:\n• our ability to anticipate and respond to technological changes and challenges, including our ability to identify and timely\nand effectively respond to cyber-security risks, including those posed by the increasing use of artificial intelligence, such\nas data security breaches, \"denial of service\" attacks, \"hacking\" and identify theft affecting us, our clients or our third\nparty vendors or service providers, which risks continue to grow more serious with the rise of artificial intelligence and\nincreasingly sophisticated attacks on infrastructure, information, and software;\n• factors that affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs, particularly our obligations to fund deposit withdrawals and\nundrawn lines of credit including such conditions as fluctuations in the fair value and liquidity of the securities and loans\nwe hold for sale and our ability to raise additional capital, if necessary, on acceptable or economically efficient terms, or at\nall;\n• government, quasi-governmental and extra-governmental actions in response to actual or expected economic, political or\nsocial events, such as disease outbreaks, domestic or international terrorism, or war or other hostilities, as such\ngovernment actions restrict our ability to conduct business or that have the effect of reducing our customers’ ability to\nmaintain compliance with their borrowing obligations or that affect their need for deposit liquidity or increased borrowing\ncapacity;\n• public confidence in the Bank and the banking system generally, and current volatility and market uncertainties on the\nbanking system generally and our Bank in particular;\n• inflationary pressures and interest rate fluctuations, which could have an adverse effect on our profitability, reduce our\nmargins and yields, the fair value of financial instruments or our level of loan originations, or increase the level of\ndefaults, losses and prepayments on loans to clients, whether held in the portfolio or in the secondary market;\n• external economic and/or market factors, such as changes in monetary and fiscal policies and laws, including the interest\nrate policies of the Federal Reserve, inflation or deflation, changes in the demand for loans, and fluctuations in consumer\nspending, borrowing and savings habits, which may have an adverse impact on our financial condition;\n1\n• business and economic conditions, particularly those affecting our primary market areas and customer concentrations;\n• management's ability to assess and accurately estimate the risk of losses in our credit portfolio and to establish and\nmaintain adequate reserves to offset those risks;\n• economic, market and political factors that affect our borrowers’ ability to repay and timely to perform their obligations\nunder their borrowing obligations;\n• continued or increasing competition from other financial institutions, credit unions, and non-bank financial services\ncompanies, many of which are subject to different regulations than we are;\n• liquidity, earnings and other factors that impact the Bank’s ability to continue paying dividends to the Company, which\nwould restrict the Company's ability to meet its operating capital needs;\n• increased capital requirements imposed by banking regulators, which may require us to raise capital at a time when capital\nis not available on favorable terms or at all, or may limit our ability to invest in growing our business;\n• the effectiveness and operation of the internal controls we maintain to address the risks inherent to the business of\nbanking, including but not limited to our ability to detect promptly any physical security breach, employee misfeasance or\nmalfeasance, data security violation, disclosure controls and procedures, or internal control over financial reporting;\n• changes in our management personnel or our inability to retain, motivate and hire qualified management personnel;\n• disruptions, security breaches, or other adverse events affecting the third-party vendors who perform several of our critical\nprocessing functions;\n• the effects of natural disasters, such as earthquakes, drought, pandemic diseases (such as the coronavirus) or extreme\nweather events, any of which may affect services we use or affect our customers, employees or third parties with which\nwe conduct business; and\n• our ability to manage and respond to changes in the foregoing.\nThe foregoing factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read together with the other cautionary statements\nincluded in this report, including those identified in \"Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors\" of this report. A more thorough discussion of the\nrisks and uncertainties confronting our business is set forth in the section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled “Risk Factors”\nfor the period ended December 31, 2023. Because of these risks and other uncertainties, our actual future results, performance or\nachievement, or industry results, may be materially different from the results indicated by the forward-looking statements in this report.\nIn addition, our past results of operations are not necessarily indicative of our future results. You should read all forward-looking\nstatements in the context of the foregoing and should not consider them to be reliable predictions of future events or as assurances of a\nparticular level of performance or intended course of action. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is\nmade, and we do not undertake any obligation to update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new\ninformation, future developments or otherwise.\n2\nPART I - FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nItem 1.

BANCORP AND SUBSIDIARY\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1. Business and Basis of Presentation\nOP Bancorp (\"Company\") is a California corporation and bank holding company for Open Bank (“Bank”). The Company\ncommenced operation as a bank holding company on June 1, 2016, and substantially all of its assets, operations and business are owned\nand conducted through the Bank. The Bank is a California state-chartered and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\")-insured\nfinancial institution, which began its operations on June 10, 2005. Headquartered in downtown Los Angeles, California, Open Bank\noperates primarily in the traditional banking business arena that includes accepting deposits and making loans and investments. Open\nBank's primary deposit products are demand and time deposits, and the primary lending products are commercial business loans to\nsmall to medium sized businesses. OP Bancorp is operating with eleven full-service branches located in California, Washington,\nNevada and Texas, and five loan production offices located in California, Georgia, Washington, Colorado, and Virginia.\nThe accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of the Company have been prepared by\nmanagement in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for Form 10-Q and\nconform to practices within the banking industry and include all of the information and disclosures required by accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial reporting. The accompanying unaudited\nconsolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments), which are necessary for a\nfair presentation of the financial results for the interim periods presented, including eliminating intercompany transactions and\nbalances. Certain items on the consolidated financial statements and notes for prior years have been reclassified to conform to the 2024\npresentation. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year. These interim\nunaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included\nin the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (“2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K”).\nDescriptions of our significant accounting policies are included in Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to\nconsolidated financial statements in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAccounting Policy for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nFASB ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”), provides the disclosure requirements for derivatives and hedging\nactivities with the intent to provide users of financial statements with an enhanced understanding of: (a) how and why an entity uses\nderivative instruments, (b) how the entity accounts for derivative instruments and related hedged items, and (c) how derivative\ninstruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. Further, qualitative\ndisclosures are required that explain the Company’s objectives and strategies for using derivatives, as well as quantitative disclosures\nabout the fair value of and gains and losses on derivative instruments, and disclosures about credit-risk-related contingent features in\nderivative instruments.\nAs required by ASC 815, the Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in\nthe fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in\na hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply\nhedge accounting. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or\nfirm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives designated and\nqualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are\nconsidered cash flow hedges. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the\nhedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the\nhedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge. The Company may\nenter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of its risk, even though hedge accounting does not apply,\nor the Company elects not to apply hedge accounting. For a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative, as well as the offsetting\nloss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in current earnings as fair values change. For a cash flow\nhedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported in other comprehensive income and is reclassified into earnings in the same period\nduring which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Changes in fair value of derivatives not designated are reported currently in\nearnings, as non-interest income.\nThe Company discontinues hedge accounting when it determines that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes\nin the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item, the derivative is settled or terminates, a hedged\n10\nforecasted transaction is no longer probable, a hedged firm commitment is no longer firm, or treatment of the derivative as a hedge is\nno longer appropriate or intended. When hedge accounting is discontinued, subsequent changes in fair value of the derivative are\nrecorded as non-interest income. When a fair value hedge is discontinued, the hedged asset or liability is no longer adjusted for changes\nin fair value and the existing basis adjustment is amortized or accreted over the remaining life of the asset or liability. When a cash flow\nhedge is discontinued but the hedged cash flows or forecasted transactions are still expected to occur, gains or losses that were\naccumulated in other comprehensive income are amortized into earnings over the same periods which the hedged transactions will\naffect earnings.\nIn accordance with the FASB’s fair value measurement guidance in Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2011-04, the\nCompany made an accounting policy election to measure the credit risk of its derivative financial instruments that are subject to master\nnetting agreements on a net basis by counterparty portfolio.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements Adopted\nFASB ASU No. 2023-02, Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax\nCredit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method. This ASU permits reporting entities to elect to account for tax equity\ninvestments, regardless of the tax credit program for which the income tax credits are received, using the proportional amortization\nmethod if certain conditions are met. Under the proportional amortization method, an entity amortizes the initial cost of the investment\nin proportion to the income tax credits and other income tax benefits received and recognizes the net amortization and income tax\ncredits and other income tax benefits in the Statement of Income as a component of income tax expense. A reporting entity makes an\naccounting policy election to apply the proportional amortization method on a tax-credit-program-by-tax-credit-program basis rather\nthan electing to apply the proportional amortization method at the reporting entity level or to individual investments. The Company\nadopted ASU No. 2023-02 on January 1, 2024, and the adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncement under Evaluation\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.\nThis ASU amends the disclosure requirements for income taxes, including the requirement for further disaggregation of the income tax\nrate reconciliation and income taxes paid disclosures. The amendments in this guidance must be applied prospectively, with the option\nto apply retrospectively. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is currently\nevaluating the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements and the adoption is not expected to have a significant\nimpact on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment\nDisclosures. This ASU updates reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant\nsegment expenses and information used to assess segment performance. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements and\nthe adoption is not expected to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.\n11\nNote 2.

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no holdings of securities of\nany one issuer, other than the U.S. Government and its agencies, in an amount greater than 10% of shareholders’ equity.\n12\nThe following table presents the fair value and the associated gross unrealized losses on AFS debt securities by length of time\nthose individual securities in each category have been in a continuous loss as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nSeptember 30, 2024\nLess Than 12 Months 12 Months or Longer Total\nFair Unrealized Fair Unrealized Fair Unrealized\n($ in thousands) Value Loss Value Loss Value Loss\nU.S. Government agencies or\nsponsored agency securities:\nResidential mortgage-\nbacked securities $ — $ — $ 34,246 $ (3,313) $ 34,246 $ (3,313)\nResidential collateralized\nmortgage obligations — — 99,258 (14,719) 99,258 (14,719)\nMunicipal securities - tax\nexempt — — 1,841 (3) 1,841 (3)\nTotal AFS debt\nsecurities $ — $ — $ 135,345 $ (18,035) $ 135,345 $ (18,035)\nDecember 31, 2023\nLess Than 12 Months 12 Months or Longer Total\nFair Unrealized Fair Unrealized Fair Unrealized\n($ in thousands) Value Loss Value Loss Value Loss\nU.S. Government agencies or\nsponsored agency securities:\nResidential mortgage-\nbacked securities $ 6,488 $ (59) $ 37,389 $ (4,382) $ 43,877 $ (4,441)\nResidential collateralized\nmortgage obligations 25,439 (177) 105,963 (17,573) 131,402 (17,750)\nMunicipal securities - tax\nexempt 1,842 (1) — — 1,842 (1)\nTotal AFS debt\nsecurities $ 33,769 $ (237) $ 143,352 $ (21,955) $ 177,121 $ (22,192)\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities are measured at fair value and are subject to impairment testing. A security is impaired if the\nfair value of the security is less than its amortized cost basis. When an available-for-sale debt security is considered impaired, the\nCompany must determine if the decline in fair value has resulted from a credit-related loss or other factors and then, (1) recognize an\nallowance for credit losses by a charge to earnings for the credit-related component of the decline in fair value, and (2) recognize in\nother comprehensive income (loss) any non-credit related components of the fair value decline. If the amount of the amortized cost\nbasis expected to be recovered increases in a future period, the valuation reserve would be reduced, but not more than the amount of the\ncurrent existing reserve for that security.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company's AFS debt securities consisted of 90 securities, of which 77 were in an unrealized\nloss position.\nThe unrealized losses from the decline in fair value is attributable to changes in interest rates, and not credit quality. The\nissuers of the AFS debt securities are of high credit quality. Approximately 97% of the AFS debt securities are residential mortgage-\nbacked securities and residential collateralized mortgage obligations that were issued by U.S. government-sponsored agencies, such as\nGinnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The remaining 3% of the AFS debt securities are tax-exempt municipal securities.\n13\n\nWe believe that the unrealized losses presented in the previous tables are temporary and no credit losses are expected. As a\nresult, the Company expects full collection of the carrying amount of these securities, does not intend to sell the securities in an\nunrealized loss position, and it was more-likely-than-not the Company will not have to sell these securities prior to recovery of\namortized cost. Accordingly, for available-for-sale debt securities, the Company did not have allowance for credit losses as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no pledged securities to secure public deposits, borrowing and\nletters of credit from the Federal Home Loan Bank System (\"FHLB\") and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and\nfor other purposes required or permitted by law.\nThe following table presents the other investment securities, which are included in other investments on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\n($ in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nFHLB stock $ 12,615 $ 12,528\nPacific Coast Bankers Bank (\"PCBB\") stock 190 190\nMutual fund - Community Reinvestment Act (\"CRA\") qualified 3,615 3,463\nTime deposits placed in other banks 100 95\nTotal other investments $ 16,520 $ 16,276\nThe Company has equity investment in a mutual fund with readily determinable fair value of $3.6 million and $3.5 million as\nof September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which is measured at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in net\nincome. The Company invested in the mutual fund for CRA purposes. For the mutual fund, the Company recorded a $127 thousand\nunrealized gain and a $106 thousand unrealized loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and a $77\nthousand unrealized gain and a $105 thousand unrealized loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe unrealized gains (losses) of the mutual fund are included in other income in the consolidated statements of income.\nNote 3. Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans\nLoans\nThe following table presents the composition of the loan portfolio as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\n($ in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nCommercial real estate $ 966,472 $ 885,585\nSBA—real estate 232,209 224,695\nSBA—non-real estate 20,170 14,997\nC&I 212,476 120,970\nHome mortgage 499,666 518,024\nConsumer 14 1,574\nGross loans receivable 1,931,007 1,765,845\nAllowance for credit losses (22,960) (21,993)\nLoans receivable, net(1) $ 1,908,047 $ 1,743,852\n(1) Includes net deferred loan fees and net unamortized discounts of $260 thousand as of September 30, 2024 and net deferred loan\ncosts and net unamortized premiums of $140 thousand as of December 31, 2023.\nNo loans were outstanding to related parties as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n14\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe Company employs a modeled approach that takes into account current and future economic conditions to estimate lifetime\nexpected losses on a collective basis. With the adoption of Current Expected Credit Losses (\"CECL\"), the Company elected not to\nconsider accrued interest receivable in its estimated credit losses because the Company writes off uncollectible accrued interest\nreceivable in a timely manner. The Company considers writing off accrued interest amounts once the amounts become 90 days past due\nto be considered within a timely manner. The Company has elected to write off accrued interest receivable by reversing interest income.\nThe Company uses transition matrices to develop the Probability of Default (\"PD\") and Loss Given Default (\"LGD\") approach,\nincorporating quantitative factors and qualitative considerations in the calculation of the allowance for credit losses for collectively\nassessed loans. The model provides forecasts of PD and LGD based on national unemployment rates using regression analysis. The\nCompany incorporates future economic conditions using a weighted multiple scenario approach: baseline and adverse. The Company\napplies a reasonable and supportable period of one year for the baseline scenario and two years for the adverse scenario, after which\nloss assumptions revert to historical loss information through a one-year reversion period for the baseline scenario and a two-year\nreversion period for the adverse scenario. Additionally, the Company aggregated loan portfolio based on similar risk characteristics.\nThe Company elected to use the Call Report codes and loan risk ratings for loan segmentation in allowance for credit losses.\nIn order to quantify the credit risk impact of other trends and changes within the loan portfolio, the Company utilizes\nqualitative adjustments to the modeled estimated loss approaches. Included in the qualitative portion of our analysis of the allowance\nfor credit losses are key inputs including GDP, unemployment rates, interest rates, asset quality ratios, loan portfolio concentration,\nCalifornia house price index and commercial real estate price index. The parameters for making adjustments are established under a\nCredit Risk Matrix that provides different possible scenarios for each of the factors listed below. The Credit Risk Matrix and the\npossible scenarios enable the Bank to qualitatively adjust the loss rates. This matrix considers the following nine factors, which are\npatterned after the guidelines provided under the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council Interagency Policy Statement on\nthe Allowance for Credit Losses, updated to reflect the adoption of CECL:\n• Changes in lending policies and procedures, including changes in underwriting standards and practices for collection,\ncharge-offs, and recoveries;\n• Actual and expected changes in national and local economic and business conditions and developments in which the\ninstitution operates that affect the collectivity of loans;\n• Changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio;\n• Changes in the experience, ability, and depth of lending management and staff;\n• Changes in the volume and severity of past due loans, the volume of nonaccrual loans, and the volume and severity of\nadversely classified loans;\n• Changes in the quality of the credit review function;\n• Changes in the value of the underlying collateral for loans that are not collateral-dependent;\n• The existence, growth, and effect of any concentrations of credit, and\n• The effect of other external factors, such as the regulatory, legal and technological environments; competition; and events\nsuch as natural disasters.\nThe Company segments loans primarily by Call Report codes (collateral type) and loan risk ratings, considering that the same\ntype of loans share considerable similar risk characteristics. For loans that do not share similar risk characteristics such as nonaccrual\nloans above $500 thousand, the Company evaluates these loans on an individual basis in accordance with ASC 326. Such nonaccrual\nloans are considered to have different risk profiles than performing loans and are therefore evaluated individually. The Company\nelected to collectively assess nonaccrual loans with balances below $500 thousand along with the performing and accrual loans, in\norder to reduce the operational burden of individually assessing small nonaccrual loans with immaterial balances. For individually\nassessed loans, the allowance for credit losses is measured using either 1) the present value of future cash flows discounted at the loan’s\neffective interest rate; or 2) the fair value of the collateral, if the loan is collateral-dependent. For the collateral-dependent loans, the\nCompany obtains a new appraisal to determine the fair value of collateral. The appraisals are based on an “as-is” valuation. To ensure\nthat appraised values remain current, the Company obtains updated appraisals every twelve months from a qualified\n15\n\nindependent appraiser. If the fair value of the collateral is less than the amortized balance of the loan, the Company recognizes an\nallowance for credit losses with a corresponding charge to the provision for credit losses.\nThe Company maintains a separate allowance for credit losses for its off-balance sheet commitments. The Company uses an\nestimated funding rate to allocate an allowance to undrawn exposures. This funding rate is used as a credit conversion factor to capture\nhow much undrawn lines of credit can potentially become drawn at any point. The funding rate is determined based on a look-back\nperiod of 8 quarters. Credit loss is not estimated for off-balance sheet commitments that are unconditionally cancellable by the\nCompany.\nThe following table summarizes the activity in the allowance for credit losses on loans by portfolio segment for the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nCommercial SBA— SBA —Non- Home\n($ in thousands) Real Estate Real Estate Real Estate C&I Mortgage Consumer Total\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024\nBeginning balance $ 7,926 $ 2,927 $ 253 $ 2,151 $ 9,499 $ 4 $ 22,760\nProvision for (reversal of) credit losses 1,481 173 58 8 (1,482) (4) 234\nCharge-offs — — (42) — 2 — (40)\nRecoveries — — 6 — — — 6\nEnding balance $ 9,407 $ 3,100 $ 275 $ 2,159 $ 8,019 $ — $ 22,960\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2023\nBeginning balance $ 6,784 $ 1,218 $ 55 $ 1,270 $ 11,472 $ 3 $ 20,802\nProvision for (reversal of) credit losses 1,171 34 91 (115) 125 (3) 1,303\nCharge-offs (457) (35) — — — — (492)\nRecoveries — — 4 — — — 4\nEnding balance $ 7,498 $ 1,217 $ 150 $ 1,155 $ 11,597 $ — $ 21,617\nCommercial SBA— SBA —Non- Home\n($ in thousands) Real Estate Real Estate Real Estate C&I Mortgage Consumer Total\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nBeginning balance $ 7,915 $ 1,657 $ 147 $ 1,215 $ 11,045 $ 14 $ 21,993\nProvision for (reversal of) credit losses 1,492 1,509 149 944 (3,026) (14) 1,054\nCharge-offs — (66) (42) — — — (108)\nRecoveries — — 21 — — — 21\nEnding balance $ 9,407 $ 3,100 $ 275 $ 2,159 $ 8,019 $ — $ 22,960\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nBeginning balance $ 6,951 $ 1,607 $ 207 $ 1,643 $ 8,826 $ 7 $ 19,241\nImpact of CECL adoption 875 (238) (142) (320) 1,753 (4) 1,924\nProvision for (reversal of) credit losses 220 (106) 84 (168) 1,018 (3) 1,045\nCharge-offs (548) (46) (34) — — — (628)\nRecoveries — — 35 — — — 35\nEnding balance $ 7,498 $ 1,217 $ 150 $ 1,155 $ 11,597 $ — $ 21,617\nCollateral-dependent loans are loans where repayment is expected to be provided solely by the sale of the underlying collateral\nand there are no other available and reliable sources of repayment. The estimated credit losses for these loans are based on the\ncollateral’s fair value less selling costs. In most cases, the Company records a partial charge-off to reduce the loan’s carrying value to\nthe collateral’s fair value less selling costs at the time of foreclosure.\n16\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were $2.5 million and $5.2 million, respectively, of collateral-\ndependent loans which are primarily secured by SBA—real estate and residential real estate.

This guidance was applied on a prospective basis.\nUpon adoption of this guidance, the Company no longer establishes a specific reserve for modifications to borrowers experiencing\nfinancial difficulty, unless those loans do not share the same risk characteristics with other loans in the portfolio. Provided that is not the\ncase, these modifications are included in their respective cohort and the allowance for credit losses is estimated on a pooled basis\nconsistent with the other loans with similar risk characteristics.\nModifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty may include interest rate reductions, principal or interest\nforgiveness, other than insignificant payment deferrals, other than insignificant term extensions, and other actions intended to minimize\neconomic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral. No charge-offs of previously modified loans were recorded for the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n18\nThe following table presents the amortized cost of modified loans and the financial effects of the modification for the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 by loan class and modification type:\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024\nModification Type\nPercentage to Each\n($ in thousands) Payment Delay Term Extension Total Loan Segment\nSBA—real estate $ 1,871 $ — $ 1,871 0.81 %\nTotal $ 1871 $ — $ 1871\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2023\nModification Type\nRate Reduction and Percentage to Each\n($ in thousands) Term Extension Interest Only Total Loan Segment\nC&I $ 121 $ — $ 121 0.10 %\nTotal $ 121 $ — $ 121\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024\nModification Type\nPercentage to Each\n($ in thousands) Payment Delay Interest Only Term Extension Total Loan Segment\nSBA—real estate $ 1,871 $ 390 $ — $ 2,261 0.97 %\nSBA—non-real estate — — 5 5 0.03 %\nTotal $ 1,871 $ 390 $ 5 $ 2,266\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nModification Type\nRate Reduction\nand Term Percentage to Each\n($ in thousands) Extension Interest Only Total Loan Segment\nSBA—real estate $ — $ 387 $ 387 0.17 %\nC&I 435 $ — 435 0.35 %\nTotal $ 435 $ 387 $ 822\nThe Company tracks the performance of modified loans. A modified loan may become delinquent and may result in a payment\ndefault (generally 90 days past due) subsequent to modification.

For consumer loans, a credit grade is established at inception, and\ngenerally only adjusted based on performance. The Company analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. This\nanalysis is performed on a quarterly basis. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings:\n20\nSpecial Mention—Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management’s close attention.\nIf left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the Company’s\ncredit position at some future date.\nSubstandard—Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the\nobligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the\nliquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are\nnot corrected.\nDoubtful—Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added\ncharacteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values,\nhighly questionable and improbable.\nLoans not meeting the criteria above that are analyzed individually as part of the above described process are considered to be\npass-rated loans.\nThe

Servicing Assets\nThe Company recognizes the right to service SBA loans for others as servicing assets when the servicing income the Company\nreceives is more than adequate compensation. Servicing assets are accounted for using the amortization method. Under this method, the\nCompany amortizes the servicing assets over the period of the economic life of the assets arising from estimated net servicing revenue.\nThe Company periodically stratifies its servicing assets into groupings based on risk characteristics and assesses each group\nfor impairment based on fair value. Based on the results of the impairment test, there was no valuation allowance for impairment as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n23\nThe following table presents an analysis of the changes in activity for loan servicing assets during the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nBeginning balance $ 11,043 $ 12,654 $ 11,741 $ 12,759\nAdditions from loans sold with servicing retained 783 505 2,081 2,474\nAmortized to expense (949) (1,228) (2,945) (3,302)\nEnding balance $ 10,877 $ 11,931 $ 10,877 $ 11,931\nThe fair value of the servicing assets was $16.5 million as of September 30, 2024, which was determined using discount rates\nranging from 3.75% to 11.25% and prepayment speeds ranging from 12.80% to 13.20%, depending on the stratification of the specific\nassets.\nThe fair value of the servicing assets was $17.0 million as of September 30, 2023, which was determined using discount rates\nranging from 4.50% to 11.22% and prepayment speeds ranging from 12.60% to 13.20% depending on the stratification of the specific\nassets.\nNote 6. Deposits\nTime deposits that exceed the FDIC insurance limit of $250 thousand as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were\n$564.5 million and $433.9 million, respectively.\nThe following table presents the scheduled contractual maturities of time deposits as of September 30, 2024:\n($ in thousands)\nRemainder of 2024 $ 467,121\n2025 672,935\n2026 18,802\n2027 257\n2028 and thereafter 499\nTotal $ 1,159,614\nDeposits from principal officers, directors, and their affiliates as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were $2.2\nmillion and $1.8 million, respectively.\nNote 7. Borrowing Arrangements\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had $75.0 million advances from FHLB with a weighted average interest rate of\n4.22% and a weighted average remaining term of 0.6 years, compared to $105 million advances with a weighted average interest rate of\n4.65% and a weighted average remaining term of 0.9 years as of December 31, 2023. The Company has a letter of credit with the\nFHLB in the amount of $100.0 million and $67.0 million to secure a public deposit as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively.\n24\nThe Company had available borrowing capacity from the following institutions as of September 30, 2024:\n($ in thousands)\nFHLB $ 397,617\nFederal Reserve Bank 207,782\nPacific Coast Bankers Bank 50,000\nZions Bank 25,000\nFirst Horizon Bank 25,000\nTotal $ 705,399\nThe Company has pledged approximately $1.41 billion and $1.39 billion of loans as collateral for these lines of credit as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nNote 8. Income Taxes\nThe Company’s income tax expense was $2.1 million and $1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023, respectively, and $6.3 million and $7.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The Company is no longer\nsubject to examination by Federal taxing authorities for tax years prior to 2020 and for state taxing authorities for tax years prior to\n2019.\nThere were no significant unrealized tax benefits recorded as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and the\nCompany does not expect any significant increase in unrealized tax benefits in the next twelve months.\nNote 9. Commitments and Contingencies\nOff-Balance-Sheet Credit Risk: In the normal course of business, the Company enters into commitments to extend credit such\nas loan commitments and standby letters of credits. These commitments expose the Company to varying degrees of credit and market\nrisk and are subject to the same credit and market risk limitation reviews as those instruments recorded on the Consolidated Balance\nSheets. Loan commitments represent arrangements to lend funds or provide liquidity subject to specified contractual conditions.\nStandby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third\nparty. These commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or contain termination clauses in the event the customer’s credit quality\ndeteriorates. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the commitment amounts do not\nnecessarily represent future funding requirements.\nThe Company applies the same credit underwriting criteria to extend loans and commitments to customers. Each customer’s\ncredit worthiness is evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Collateral may be obtained based on management’s assessment of a customer’s\ncredit. Collateral may include securities, accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, and income producing\ncommercial or other properties.\nThe following table presents the distribution of undisbursed credit-related commitments as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023:\n($ in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nLoan commitments $ 242,943 $ 257,626\nStandby letter of credit 19,649 6,707\nCommercial letter of credit — 22\nTotal undisbursed credit related commitments $ 262,592 $ 264,355\n25\nThe majority of these off-balance sheet commitments have a variable interest rate.

The Company\nexpects to finish fulfilling these commitments during the year ending 2040.\nUnder the proportional amortization method, the Company amortizes the initial cost of the investment in proportion to the tax\ncredit and other benefits received and recognizes the amortization in income tax expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nThe Company recognized amortization expense of $517 thousand and $361 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023, respectively, and $1.6 million and $1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nAdditionally, the Company recognized tax credits and other benefits from the investments in low-income housing partnerships of $655\nthousand and $456 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $2.0 million and $1.4 million\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nNote 10. Stock-Based Compensation\nThe Company has two stock-based compensation plans currently in effect as of September 30, 2024, as described further\nbelow. Total compensation cost that has been charged against earnings for these plans was $272 thousand and $323 thousand for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 respectively, and $908 thousand and $961 thousand for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n2010 Plan: In 2010, the Board of Directors of the Bank approved a new equity incentive plan for granting stock options and\nrestricted stock awards to key employees, officers, and non-employee directors of the Bank (the “2010 Plan”). In 2013, the 2010 Plan\nwas amended and approved by the shareholders to increase the number of shares authorized to be issued under from 1,350,000 shares to\n2,500,000 shares of common stock. The 2010 Plan was assumed by the Company in 2016 at the time of the bank holding company\nreorganization.\nThe exercise prices of stock options granted under the plan may not be less than 100% of the fair value of the Company’s\nstock at the date of grant. The options, when granted, vest ratably over five years from the date of the grant and expire after ten years if\nnot exercised. The 2010 Plan expired in August 2020, and no further grants can be made under the 2010 Plan.\nRestricted stock awards issued under the 2010 Plan may or may not be subject to vesting provisions. Owners of the restricted\nstock awards shall have all of the rights of a shareholder including the right to vote the shares and to all dividends (cash or stock).\nCompensation expense related to restricted stock awards will be recognized over the vesting period of the awards based on the fair\nvalue of the Company’s common stock at the issue date.\n26\nA summary of the stock options outstanding under the 2010 Plan for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is as follows:\nWeighted\nNumber of Average Aggregate\nOptions Exercise Intrinsic\n($ in thousands, except share data) Outstanding Price Value\nOutstanding, as of January 1, 2024 60,000 $ 8.00 $ 177\nOptions granted — —\nOptions exercised (60,000) 8.00\nOptions forfeited — —\nOptions expired — —\nOutstanding, as of September 30, 2024 — $ — $ —\nFully vested and expected to vest — $ — $ —\nVested — $ — $ —\nInformation related to stock options exercised under the 2010 Plan for the periods indicated follows:\nThree Months Ended September\n30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nIntrinsic value of options exercised $ — $ — $ 144 $ 186\nCash received from option exercises — — 160 720\nTax provision realized from option exercised — — 24 (3)\nA summary of the changes in the Company's non-vested restricted stock awards under the 2010 Plan for the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 is as follows:\nWeighted Average Aggregate\nGrant Date Fair Intrinsic\n($ in thousands, except share data) Shares Issued Value Value\nNon-vested, as of January 1, 2024 10,000 $ 9.69 $ 110\nAwards granted — —\nAwards vested — —\nAwards forfeited — —\nNon-vested, as of September 30, 2024 10,000 $ 9.69 $ 125\nInformation related to vested restricted stock awards under the 2010 Plan for the periods indicated follows:\nInformation related to vested restricted stock under the 2010 Plan for the periods indicated follows:\nThree Months Ended September\n30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nTax benefit (provision) realized from awards vested $ — $ 4 $ — $ 4\n27\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately $8 thousand of unrecognized compensation cost related to\nunvested restricted stock awards under the 2010 Plan.

There are no stock options granted under the 2021 Plan as of September 30, 2024.\nRestricted stock awards issued under the 2021 Plan may or may not be subject to vesting provisions. Owners of the restricted\nstock awards shall have all rights of a shareholder including the right to vote the shares and to all dividends (cash or stock).\nCompensation expense related to restricted stock awards will be recognized over the vesting period of the awards based on the fair\nvalue of the Company’s common stock at the issue date.\nA summary of the changes in the Company’s non-vested restricted stock awards under the 2021 Plan for the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 is as follows:\nWeighted\nAverage Aggregate\nShares Grant Date Intrinsic\n($ in thousands, except share data) Issued Fair Value Value\nNon-vested, as of January 1, 2024 278,851 $ 11.45 $ 3,053\nAwards granted 45,711 9.61\nAwards vested (74,429) 9.59\nAwards forfeited (3,000) 12.90\nNon-vested, as of September 30, 2024 247,133 $ 11.66 $ 3,084\nInformation related to vested restricted stock awards under the 2021 Plan for the periods indicated follows:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nTax provision realized from awards vested $ — $ — $ (3) $ (34)\nThere were 1,105,590 shares available for future grants of either stock options or restricted stock awards under the 2021 Plan as\nof September 30, 2024.

The Company expects to recognize these costs over a weighted average\nperiod of 1.3 years.\n28\nNote 11. Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or the price that would be paid to transfer a liability on\nthe measurement date and is determined using an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an\norderly transaction between market participants. The Company uses fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain\nassets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, such as\nAFS securities and equity investments. Additionally, from time to time, the Company records fair value adjustments on a nonrecurring\nbasis. These nonrecurring adjustments typically involve application of lower of cost or fair value accounting and write-downs of\nindividual assets.\nThe Company classifies its assets and liabilities recorded at fair value as one of the following three categories and a financial\ninstrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input significant to the fair value measurement:\nLevel 1—Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access\nas of the measurement date.\nLevel 2—Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities,\nquoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market\ndata.\nLevel 3—Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a company’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market\nparticipants would use in pricing an asset or liability.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nFollowing is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis, as\nwell as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.\nSecurities AFS: The fair values of investment securities are determined by matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique\nused to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities, but rather by relying on the\nsecurities’ relationship to other benchmark quoted securities (Level 2). Management obtains the fair values of investment securities on a\nmonthly basis from a third-party pricing service.\nOther Investment: The Company has an equity investment with readily determinable fair value. The fair value for the equity\ninvestment with readily determinable fair value is obtained from unadjusted quoted prices in active markets on the date of measurement\nand classified as Level 1.\nDerivatives: The fair values of derivatives are based on valuation models using observable market data as of the measurement\ndate (Level 2).\n29\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are\nsummarized below:\nFair Value Measure on a Recurring Basis\nSignificant\nQuoted Other Significant\nPrices in Observable Unobservable\nTotal Active Markets Inputs Inputs\n($ in thousands) Fair Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nSeptember 30, 2024\nAssets:\nU.S. Government agencies or sponsored agency\nsecurities:\nResidential mortgage-backed securities $ 40,161 $ — $ 40,161 $ —\nResidential collateralized mortgage obligations 153,114 — 153,114 —\nMunicipal securities - tax exempt 6,098 — 6,098 —\nOther investments:\nMutual fund - CRA qualified 3,615 3,615 — —\nLiabilities:\nDerivative financial instruments $ 1,486 $ — $ 1,486 $ —\nDecember 31, 2023\nAssets:\nU.S. Government agencies or sponsored agency\nsecurities:\nResidential mortgage-backed securities $ 43,877 $ — $ 43,877 $ —\nResidential collateralized mortgage obligations 144,459 — 144,459 —\nMunicipal securities - tax exempt 5,914 — 5,914 —\nOther investments:\nMutual fund - CRA qualified 3,463 3,463 — —\nThere were no transfers of assets or liabilities between the Level 1 and Level 2 classifications for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024 or 2023.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\nThe Company may be required, from time to time, to measure certain assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance\nwith GAAP. These adjustments to fair value usually result from application of lower of cost or fair value and write-downs of individual\nassets.\nCollateral-dependent loans: Collateral-dependent loans are loans where repayment is expected to be provided solely by the\nsale of the underlying collateral and there are no other available and reliable sources of repayment. Fair value for collateral-dependent\nloans are measured based on the value of the collateral securing these loans and are classified at a Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\nCollateral may include real estate, or business assets including equipment, inventory and accounts receivable. The value of real estate\ncollateral is determined based on an appraisal by qualified licensed appraisers hired by the Company. The value of business equipment\nis based on an appraisal by qualified licensed appraisers hired by the Company if significant, or the equipment’s net book value on the\nbusiness’ financial statements. Inventory and accounts receivable collateral are valued based on independent field examiner review or\naging reports. Appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination or approaches including comparable sales and the\nincome approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences\nbetween the comparable sales and income data available for similar loans and collateral underlying such loans. Appraised values are\n30\nreviewed by management using historical knowledge, market considerations, and knowledge of the client and client’s business.\nOther real estate owned: Fair value of other real estate owned (\"OREO\") is based primarily on third party appraisals, less costs\nto sell and result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value.

Derivative Financial Instruments\nRisk Management Objective of Using Derivatives\nThe Company is exposed to certain risk arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The Company\nprincipally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business\nactivities. The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk primarily by managing the amount,\nsources, and duration of its assets and liabilities and the use of derivative financial instruments. Specifically, the Company enters into\nderivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future\nknown and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates.\nCash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk\nThe Company’s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure\nto interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk\nmanagement strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in\nexchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional\namount. During 2024, such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with existing variable-rate debt. The\nCompany had no fair value hedges nor derivatives not designated as hedges as of September 30, 2024.\nFor derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk, the gain or loss on the derivative is\nrecorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (\"OCI\") and subsequently reclassified into interest expense in the same period(s)\nduring which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Amounts reported in accumulated OCI related to derivatives will be reclassified\nto interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company’s variable-rate debt. During the next 12 months, the Company\nestimates that an additional $279 thousand will be reclassified as a reduction to interest expense.\n33\nThe table below presents the fair value of the Company’s derivative financial instruments as well as their classification on the\nBalance Sheet as of September 30, 2024:\nDerivative Assets Derivative Liabilities\nBalance Sheet Balance Sheet\n($ in thousands) Notional Amount Location Fair Value Notional Amount Location Fair Value\nAs of September 30, 2024\nDerivatives designated as hedging\ninstruments:\nInterest rate products $ — Other assets $ — $ 75,000 Other liabilities $ 1,486\nTotal derivatives designated as\nhedging instruments $ — $ 1,486\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had no derivative financial instruments.\nThe table below presents the effect of cash flow hedge accounting on accumulated OCI for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024:\nAmount of Gain Amount of Gain\n(Loss) (Loss)\nLocation of Amount of Gain Reclassified Reclassified\nGain (Loss) (Loss) from from\nAmount of Amount of Amount of Recognized Reclassified Accumulated Accumulated\nGain (Loss) Gain (Loss) Gain (Loss) from from OCI into OCI into\nDerivatives in Subtopic 815-20 Recognized in Recognized in Recognized in Accumulated Accumulated Income Income\nHedging Relationships OCI on OCI Included OCI Excluded OCI into OCI into Included Excluded\n($ in thousands) Derivative Component Component Income Income Component Component\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024\nDerivatives in cash flow hedging\nrelationships:\nInterest rate products $ (1,131) $ (1,131) $ — Interest expense $ 152 $ 152 $ —\nTotal $ (1,131) $ (1,131) $ — $ 152 $ 152 $ —\nNine Months Ended September\n30, 2024\nDerivatives in cash flow hedging\nrelationships:\nInterest rate products $ (1,385) $ (1,385) $ — Interest expense $ 233 $ 233 $ —\nTotal $ (1,385) $ (1,385) $ — $ 233 $ 233 $ —\nThe Company had no derivative instruments that affect accumulated OCI for the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2023.\n34\nThe table below presents the effect of the Company’s derivative financial instruments on the Statement of Income for the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2024:\nThree Months Ended September Nine Months Ended September\n30, 2024 30, 2024\n($ in thousands) Interest Expense Interest Expense\nTotal amounts of income and expense line items presented in the\nstatement of financial performance in which the effects of fair value or\ncash flow hedges are recorded $ 152 $ 233\nThe effects of cash flow hedging:\nGain (loss) on cash flow hedging relationships in Subtopic 815-20\nInterest contracts\nAmount of loss reclassified from accumulated OCI into income $ 152 $ 233\nAmount of gain (loss) reclassified from accumulated OCI into income as\na result that a forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring — —\nAmount of loss reclassified from accumulated OCI into income - included\ncomponent 152 233\nAmount of gain (loss) reclassified from accumulated OCI into income -\nexcluded component — —\nThe Company had no derivative instruments that affect statement of income for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023.\nThe table below presents a gross presentation, the effects of offsetting, and a net presentation of the Company’s derivatives as\nof September 30, 2024.

Regulatory Capital Matters\nThe Bank is subject to certain risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements under the U.S. Basel III capital rules\nadministered by the federal and state banking agencies. Failure to be well-capitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could\nresult in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have an adverse\nmaterial effect on the Company's operations or financial condition. The Basel III capital rules also require the Bank to maintain a\ncapital conservation buffer of 2.50% above the minimum risk-based capital ratios in order to absorb losses during periods of economic\nstress, effective January 1, 2019. Banking institutions with a ratio of common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the\nminimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends. equity repurchases and compensation based on\nthe amount of the shortfall. Management believes that as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank met all capital\nadequacy requirements to which they are subject to. Based on recent changes to the Federal Reserve’s definition of a “Small Bank\nHolding Company” that increased the threshold to $3 billion in assets, the Company is not currently subject to separate minimum\ncapital measurements. At such time as the Company reaches the $3 billion asset level, it will again be subject to capital measurements\nindependent of the Bank.\nThe following table presents the regulatory capital amounts and ratios for the Company and the Bank as of dates indicated:\nSeptember 30, 2024\nRequired for Minimum\nCapital Adequacy To be Considered\nActual(1) Purposes \"Well Capitalized\"\n($ in thousands) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio\nTotal capital (to risk-weighted assets)\nConsolidated $ 240,012 12.79 % N/A N/A N/A N/A\nBank 238,097 12.69 $ 150,106 8.00 % $ 187,632 10.00 %\nTier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets)\nConsolidated 217,123 11.57 N/A N/A N/A N/A\nBank 215,208 11.47 112,579 6.00 150,106 8.00\nCommon equity Tier 1 capital (to risk-weighted\nassets)\nConsolidated 217,123 11.57 N/A N/A N/A N/A\nBank 215,208 11.47 84,435 4.50 121,961 6.50\nTier 1 capital (to average assets)\nConsolidated 217,123 9.30 N/A N/A N/A N/A\nBank 215,208 9.22 93,362 4.00 116,703 5.00\n(1) The capital requirements are only applicable to the Bank, and the Company's ratios are included for comparison purpose.\n36\nDecember 31, 2023\nRequired for Minimum\nCapital Adequacy To be Considered\nActual(1) Purposes \"Well Capitalized\"\n($ in thousands) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio\nTotal capital (to risk-weighted assets)\nConsolidated $ 229,544 13.77 % N/A N/A N/A N/A\nBank 227,773 13.66 $ 133,353 8.00 % $ 166,691 10.00 %\nTier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets)\nConsolidated 208,707 12.52 N/A N/A N/A N/A\nBank 206,936 12.41 100,014 6.00 133,353 8.00\nCommon equity Tier 1 capital (to risk-weighted\nassets)\nConsolidated 208,707 12.52 N/A N/A N/A N/A\nBank 206,936 12.41 75,011 4.50 108,349 6.50\nTier 1 capital (to average assets)\nConsolidated 208,707 9.57 N/A N/A N/A N/A\nBank 206,936 9.49 87,207 4.00 109,008 5.00\n(1) The capital requirements are only applicable to the Bank, and the Company's ratios are included for comparison purpose.\nNote 14. Earnings Per Share\nBasic EPS is calculated using the two-class method. Under the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and undistributed)\nare allocated to common stock and participating securities. The Company grants restricted stock awards, which entitle recipients to\nreceive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to dividends paid to holders of the Company's common\nstock. These restricted stock awards meet the definition of participating securities based on their respective rights to receive\nnonforfeitable dividends, and they are treated as a separate class of securities in computing basic EPS. Participating securities are not\nincluded as incremental shares in computing diluted EPS.\nDiluted EPS incorporates the potential impact of contingently issuable shares. Diluted EPS is calculated under both the two-\nclass and treasury stock methods, and the more dilutive amount is reported. For each of the periods presented in the table below, diluted\nEPS calculated under two-class method was more dilutive.\n37\nThe following table presents the calculation of net income applicable to common stockholders and basic and diluted EPS for\nthe three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n($ in thousands, except share and per share data) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nBasic\nNet income $ 5,436 $ 5,121 $ 16,098 $ 18,746\nDistributed and undistributed earnings allocated to\nparticipating securities (93) (96) (294) (379)\nNet income allocated to common shares $ 5,343 $ 5,025 $ 15,804 $ 18,367\nWeighted average common shares outstanding 14,812,118 15,131,587 14,890,479 15,149,203\nBasic earnings per common share $ 0.36 $ 0.33 $ 1.06 $ 1.21\nDiluted\nNet income allocated to common shares $ 5,343 $ 5,025 $ 15,804 $ 18,367\nWeighted average common shares outstanding for basic\nearnings per common share 14,812,118 15,131,587 14,890,479 15,149,203\nAdd: Dilutive effects of assumed exercises of stock\noptions — 8,990 — 51,409\nAverage shares and dilutive potential common shares 14,812,118 15,140,577 14,890,479 15,200,612\nDiluted earnings per common share $ 0.36 $ 0.33 $ 1.06 $ 1.21\nNo share of common stock was antidilutive for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n38\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with\nour consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto contained in this Report. Some of the information contained in this\ndiscussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our\nbusiness, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the sections titled “Cautionary\nNote Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of forward-looking statements and\nimportant factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking\nstatements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a bank holding company headquartered in Los Angeles, California. Our commercial community banking activities are\noperated through Open Bank, our banking subsidiary, and we do not conduct material business operations other than through the Bank.\nWe offer commercial banking services to small and medium-sized businesses, their owners and retail customers primarily in the\nKorean-American communities within our primary market areas.\nOur results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income. We drive our income from interest received on our loan\nportfolio, the fee income we receive in connection with our deposits, and the sale and service of SBA loans. Our major operating\nexpenses are the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings, the salaries and related benefits we pay our management and staff,\nand the rent we pay on our leased properties. We rely primarily on locally-generated deposits, mostly from the Korean-American\nmarket within California, to fund our loan activities. We currently operate eight branches in Los Angeles and Orange Counties in\nCalifornia, one branch in Santa Clara, California, one branch in Carrollton, Texas and one branch near Las Vegas, Nevada. We have\nfive loan production offices in Pleasanton, California, Atlanta, Georgia, Aurora, Colorado, Lynnwood, Washington, and Fairfax,\nVirginia.\nBanking Economy and Recent Developments\nIn recent periods, our earnings have been affected by a series of upward adjustments to the “discount rate” for short-term\nborrowings updated by the Federal Reserve Board Open Markets Committee in response to perceived increases in inflationary\npressures. Financial institutions and markets promptly followed these adjustments, significantly increasing interest rate pricing on loans\nand deposits. While such adjustments are commonplace and tend to affect the banking industry as a whole, the pace and degree of these\nadjustments were nearly unprecedented, resulting in banks, including the Bank, experiencing substantial pressure on multiple fronts. In\nparticular, banks were forced to increase interest rates paid on deposits in order to meet competitive pressures from other financial\ninstitutions, as well as from treasury securities and other investment opportunities that offered greater earning capabilities for those\ncustomers. These increases correspondingly increased the Bank’s cost of funds and exerted downward pressure on our net interest\nmargins.\nThe increases in market interest rates also affected loan pricing, which had multiple effects, including a reduction in borrowing\n(and thus a reduction in interest paid to banks) by customers that had the ability to avoid or defer additional indebtedness, a decline in\nthe origination of new loans, and an increase in credit risk as borrowers who faced rising interest rates found it more difficult to comply\nwith their loan obligations. The combination of these factors has exerted downward pressure on our fee income, the volume of our\ninterest-earning assets and our net interest income.\nMore recently, following a prolonged low-interest-rate environment, a series of rapid rate increases by the Federal Reserve\nresulted in a dramatic loss of value for bonds had been priced during the previous market. Those increases had the effect of rapidly\ndiminishing the value of debt securities and, concomitantly, adversely affected liquidity of many financial institutions. These markets\nappear to have stabilized substantially; however, the United States continues to confront considerable political and economic\nuncertainty owing to a relatively volatile election cycle, and it remains difficult to predict or to hedge against future fluctuations. While\nwe do not presently expect that the Federal Reserve will resume significant adjustments, the conditions that led the Federal Reserve to\nmake the recent adjustments remain uncertain and relatively volatile, and thus are highly unpredictable. Moreover, although the U.S.\npresidential election cycle has concluded as of the date of this report, the implications of these events is quite recent and remains\ndifficult to predict.\nWe believe we have adapted well to these shifts in the banking economy, and our success in weathering the challenges to date\nowes to the loyalty of our customers and the dedication of our employees and management. At the same\n39\ntime, these conditions have forced us to redirect our efforts toward liquidity and capital management, thus limiting our growth and our\nnear-term profitability.\nThe following significant items are of note as of or for the periods presented:\nAs of September 30, 2024 compared to as of December 31, 2023\n• Total assets were $2.39 billion, an increase of $240.3 million, or 11.2%, from $2.15 billion.\n• Gross loans were $1.93 billion, an increase of $165.2 million, or 9.4%, from $1.77 billion.\n• Total deposits were $2.06 billion, an increase of $257.0 million, or 14.2%, from $1.81 billion.\n• Shareholders’ equity was $203.6 million, an increase of $11.0 million, or 5.7%, from $192.6 million.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to three months ended September 30, 2023\n• Net interest income decreased to $16.5 million, a decrease of $0.8 million, or 4.7%, from $17.3 million.\n• Net income was $5.4 million or $0.36 per diluted common share, an increase of $315 thousand, or 6.2%, from $5.1\nmillion or $0.33 per diluted common share.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023\n• Net interest income decreased to $48.7 million, a decrease of $3.8 million, or 7.2%, from $52.5 million.\n• Net income was $16.1 million or $1.06 per diluted common share, a decrease of $2.6 million, or 14.1%, from $18.7\nmillion or $1.21 per diluted common share.\n40\nSELECTED FINANCIAL DATA\nThree Months Ended September\n30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n($ in thousands, except share and per share data) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nIncome Statement Data:\nInterest income $ 35,299 $ 31,186 $ 102,569 $ 89,882\nInterest expense 18,793 13,873 53,890 37,425\nNet interest income 16,506 17,313 48,679 52,457\nProvision for credit losses 448 1,359 1,210 1,021\nNoninterest income 4,240 2,601 12,010 10,501\nNoninterest expense 12,720 11,535 37,066 35,743\nIncome before income taxes 7,578 7,020 22,413 26,194\nIncome tax expense 2,142 1,899 6,315 7,448\nNet income 5,436 5,121 16,098 18,746\nPer Share Data:\nBasic income per share $ 0.36 $ 0.33 $ 1.06 $ 1.21\nDiluted income per share 0.36 0.33 1.06 1.21\nBook value per share 13.75 12.17 13.75 12.17\nShares of common stock outstanding 14,811,671 15,118,268 14,811,671 15,118,268\nPerformance Ratios:\nReturn on average assets(1) 0.94 % 1.15 % 0.95 % 1.29 %\nReturn on average equity(1) 10.95 13.27 11.00 15.02\nYield on total loans(1) 6.66 6.34 6.68 6.22\nYield on average interest-earning assets(1) 6.30 5.94 6.30 5.83\nCost of average interest-bearing liabilities(1) 4.82 4.01 4.80 3.79\nCost of deposits(1) 3.57 2.63 3.52 2.44\nNet interest margin(1) 2.95 3.40 2.99 3.48\nEfficiency ratio(2) 61.31 58.97 61.08 56.24\n(1) Annualized.\n(2) Represent noninterest expense divided by the sum of net interest income and noninterest income.\n41\nAs of\n($ in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nBalance Sheet Data:\nGross loans $ 1,931,007 $ 1,765,845\nLoans held for sale 8,160 1,795\nAllowance for credit losses 22,960 21,993\nTotal assets 2,387,980 2,147,730\nTotal deposits 2,064,603 1,807,558\nShareholders’ equity 203,603 192,626\nAsset Quality Data:\nNonperforming loans to gross loans 0.19 % 0.34 %\nAllowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans 634 362\nAllowance for credit losses to gross loans 1.19 1.25\nBalance Sheet and Capital Ratios:\nGross loans to deposits 93.53 % 97.69 %\nNoninterest-bearing deposits to deposits 27.21 28.92\nAverage equity to average total assets 8.63 8.62\nLeverage ratio 9.30 9.57\nCommon equity tier 1 ratio 11.57 12.52\nTier 1 risk-based capital ratio 11.57 12.52\nTotal risk-based capital ratio 12.79 13.77\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThere have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates since those described in our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nCredit risk is inherent in the business of making loans. We establish an allowance for credit losses both on loans and off-\nbalance sheet commitments through charges to earnings, which are shown in the statements of operations as the provision for credit\nlosses. Specifically identifiable and quantifiable known losses are promptly charged off against the allowance. The provision for credit\nlosses is determined by conducting a quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses and charging the shortfall\nor excess, if any, to the current quarter’s expense. This has the effect of creating variability in the amount and frequency of charges to\nearnings. The provision for credit losses and level of allowance for each period are dependent upon many factors, including loan\ngrowth, net charge-offs, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio, delinquencies, management’s assessment of the quality of the\nloan portfolio, the valuation of problem loans and the general economic conditions in our market area.\nThe Company employs a modeled approach that takes into account current and future economic conditions to estimate lifetime\nexpected losses on a collective basis. With the adoption of CECL, the Company elected not to consider accrued interest receivable in its\nestimated credit losses because the Company writes off uncollectible accrued interest receivable in a timely manner. The Company\nconsiders writing off accrued interest amounts once the amounts become 90 days past due to be considered within a timely manner. The\nCompany has elected to write off accrued interest receivable by reversing interest income. The Company uses transition matrices to\ndevelop the Probability of Default (\"PD\") and Loss Given Default (\"LGD\") approach, incorporating quantitative factors and qualitative\nconsiderations in the calculation of the allowance for credit losses for collectively assessed loans. The model provides forecasts of PD\nand LGD based on national unemployment rates using regression analysis. The Company incorporates future economic conditions\nusing a weighted multiple scenario approach: baseline and adverse. The Company applies a reasonable and supportable period of one\nyear for the baseline scenario and two years for the adverse scenario, after which loss assumptions revert to historical loss information\nthrough a one-year reversion period for the baseline scenario and a two-year reversion period for the adverse\n42\nscenario. We make critical accounting estimates, including the judgments made in the application of significant accounting policies,\nsensitivity to change, and the likelihood of materially different reported results if different assumptions were used.\nIn order to quantify the credit risk impact of other trends and changes within the loan portfolio, we utilize qualitative\nadjustments to the modeled estimated loss approaches. The parameters for making adjustments are established under a Credit Risk\nMatrix that provides different possible scenarios for each of the factors listed below. The Credit Risk Matrix and the possible scenarios\nenable the Bank to qualitatively adjust the loss rates. This matrix considers the following nine factors, which are patterned after the\nguidelines provided under the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council Interagency Policy Statement on the Allowance for\nCredit Losses, updated to reflect the adoption of CECL:\n• Changes in lending policies and procedures, including changes in underwriting standards and practices for collection,\ncharge-offs, and recoveries;\n• Actual and expected changes in national and local economic and business conditions and developments in which the\ninstitution operates that affect the collectivity of loans;\n• Changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio;\n• Changes in the experience, ability, and depth of lending management and staff;\n• Changes in the volume and severity of past due loans, the volume of nonaccrual loans, and the volume and severity of\nadversely classified loans;\n• Changes in the quality of the credit review function;\n• Changes in the value of the underlying collateral for loans that are not collateral-dependent;\n• The existence, growth, and effect of any concentrations of credit, and\n• The effect of other external factors, such as the regulatory, legal and technological environments; competition; and events\nsuch as natural disasters.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Income\nWe reported net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of $5.4 million, an increase of $315 thousand, or\n6.2%, compared to net income of $5.1 million for the same period of 2023. The increase was due to a $1.6 million increase in\nnoninterest income and a $911 thousand decrease in provision for credit losses, primarily offset by a $1.2 million increase in\nnoninterest expense and a $807 thousand decrease in net interest income.\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nInterest income $ 35,299 $ 31,186 $ 4,113 13.2 %\nInterest expense 18,793 13,873 4,920 35.5\nNet interest income 16,506 17,313 (807) (4.7)\nProvision for credit losses 448 1,359 (911) (67.0)%\nNoninterest income 4,240 2,601 1,639 63.0\nNoninterest expense 12,720 11,535 1,185 10.3\nIncome before income tax expense 7,578 7,020 558 7.9\nIncome tax expense 2,142 1,899 243 12.8\nNet income $ 5,436 $ 5,121 $ 315 6.2 %\nWe reported net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of $16.1 million, a decrease of $2.6 million, or 14.1%,\ncompared to net income of $18.7 million for the same period of 2023.

Net interest income, the\ndifference between interest income and interest expense, is the largest component of our total revenue. Management closely monitors\nboth total net interest income and the net interest margin (net interest income divided by average earning assets). We seek to maximize\nnet interest income without exposing us to excessive interest rate risk through our asset and liability policies. Interest rate risk is\nmanaged by monitoring the pricing, maturity and repricing options of all classes of interest-bearing assets and liabilities. Our net\ninterest margin is also adversely impacted by the reversal of interest on nonaccrual loans and the reinvestment of loan payoffs into\nlower yielding investment securities and other short-term investments.\n44\nThe following table presents, for the periods indicated, information about: (i) weighted average balances, the total dollar\namount of interest income from interest-earning assets and the resultant average yields, (ii) average balances, the total dollar amount of\ninterest expense on interest-bearing liabilities and the resultant average rates, (iii) net interest income, (iv)

The provision for credit losses on loans of $234 thousand for three months ended September 30, 2024 was\nprimarily due to a $215 thousand increase in the qualitative reserve driven by declining collateral values for collateral dependent CRE\nloans and weakening economic and business conditions. The provision for credit losses on off-balance sheet exposure of $214 thousand\nwas primarily due to increases in unfunded commitment balance and utilization of commitment.\nTotal provision for credit losses was $1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the credit losses\nof $1.0 million for the same period of 2023. The provision for credit losses on loans and on off-balance sheet exposure were $1.1\nmillion and $156 thousand, respectively. The provision for credit losses on loans of $1.1 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 was primarily due to a $1.7 million increase in the quantitative general reserve, partially offset by a $843 thousand\ndecrease in the qualitative reserve. The increase in the quantitative reserve was primarily due to changes in historical loss factors and\nincreases in loan balances. The decrease in the qualitative reserve was due to net improvements in various asset quality metrics and\neconomic conditions compared to those metrics and conditions as of December 31, 2023. The provision for credit losses on off-balance\nsheet exposure of $156 thousand was primarily due to increases in unfunded commitment balance and utilization of commitment.\nNoninterest Income\nWhile interest income remains the largest single component of total revenues, noninterest income is also an important\ncomponent. A portion of our noninterest income is associated with SBA lending activity, consisting of gains on the sale of loans sold in\nthe secondary market and servicing income from loans sold with servicing retained.

Effective tax rates were 28.2% and 28.4% for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nWe recognized net deferred tax assets of $12.3 million and $13.3 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively. After consideration of the matters in the preceding paragraph, we have determined that it is more likely than not that net\ndeferred tax assets as of September 30, 2024 will be fully realized in future years.\n52\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nInvestment Portfolio\nThe securities portfolio is the second largest component of our interest earning assets, and the structure and composition of this\nportfolio is important to an analysis of our financial condition. The portfolio serves the following purposes: (i) it provides a source of\npledged assets for securing certain deposits and borrowed funds, as may be required by law or by specific agreement with a depositor or\nlender; (ii) it provides liquidity to even out cash flows from the loan and deposit activities of customers; (iii) it can be used as an\ninterest rate risk management tool, because it provides a large base of assets, the maturity and interest rate characteristics of which can\nbe changed more readily than the loan portfolio to better match changes in the deposit base and our other funding sources; and (iv) it is\nan alternative interest-earning use of funds when loan demand is weak or when deposits grow more rapidly than loans.\nWe classify our securities as either available-for-sale or held-to-maturity at the time of purchase. Accounting guidance requires\navailable-for-sale securities to be marked to fair value with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component\nof shareholders’ equity. Monthly adjustments are made to reflect changes in the fair value of our available-for-sale securities.\nAll securities in our investment portfolio were classified as available-for-sale as of September 30, 2024. There were no held-\nto-maturity or trading securities in our investment portfolio as of September 30, 2024. All available-for-sale securities are carried at fair\nvalue and consist of U.S. government agencies or sponsored agency securities and tax-exempt municipal securities.\nThe following table summarizes the fair value of the available-for-sale securities portfolio as of the dates presented:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nAmortized Unrealized Amortized Unrealized\n($ in thousands) Cost Fair Value Loss Cost Fair Value Loss\nU.S. Government agencies or\nsponsored agency securities:\nResidential mortgage-backed\nsecurities $ 43,472 $ 40,161 $ (3,311) $ 48,318 $ 43,877 $ (4,441)\nResidential collateralized\nmortgage obligations 166,819 153,114 (13,705) 162,142 144,459 (17,683)\nMunicipal securities - tax exempt 5,803 6,098 295 5,726 5,914 188\nTotal available-for-sale debt\nsecurities $ 216,094 $ 199,373 $ (16,721) $ 216,186 $ 194,250 $ (21,936)\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities increased $5.1 million, or 2.6%, to $199.4 million as of September 30, 2024 from $194.3\nmillion as of December 31, 2023, primarily due to a $5.2 million decrease in unrealized loss for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024. No issuer of the available-for-sale securities, other than U.S. Government and its agencies, comprised more than ten percent of\nour shareholders’ equity as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nCertain securities have fair values less than amortized cost and, therefore, contain unrealized losses. The unrealized losses\nwere primarily attributable to interest rate movement, not credit quality. These securities (Fannie Mae, Ginnie Mae, and Freddie Mac)\nare guaranteed or sponsored by agencies of the U.S. government, and the issuers of the securities are of high credit quality. We believe\nthat the net unrealized losses presented in the previous tables are temporary and no credit losses are expected. As a result, we expect full\ncollection of the carrying amount of these securities, do not intend to sell the securities in an unrealized loss position, and believe it is\nmore-likely-than-not we will not have to sell these securities prior to recovery of amortized cost. Accordingly, for available-for-sale\ndebt securities, we did not have allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n53\nThe following table sets forth certain information regarding contractual maturities and the weighted average yields of our\ninvestment securities as of the dates presented.

We do not have any material\nconcentrations by industry or group of industries in the loan portfolio. However, 88.0% of our gross loans were secured by real property\nas of September 30, 2024, compared to 92.2% as of December 31, 2023.\nLoans — Commercial Real Estate: We have established concentration limits in the loan portfolio for commercial real estate\nloans, commercial and industrial loans, and unsecured lending, among others. All loan types are within established limits. We use\nunderwriting guidelines to assess the borrowers’ historical cash flow to determine debt service, and we further stress test the debt\nservice under higher interest rate scenarios. Financial and performance covenants are used in commercial lending agreements to allow\nus to react to a borrower’s deteriorating financial condition, should that occur.\nCommercial real estate loans include owner-occupied and non-occupied commercial real estate. We originate both fixed and\nadjustable rate loans. Adjustable rate loans are based on the Wall Street Journal prime rate. Our commercial real estate loan portfolio\ntotaled $966.5 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to $885.6 million as of December 31, 2023. During the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, we originated $155.1 million of commercial real estate loans. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 76.4% of\nthe commercial real estate portfolio consisted of fixed-rate loans. Our policy maximum loan-to-value, or LTV, is 70% for commercial\nreal estate loans. As of September 30, 2024, our average loan to value for commercial real estate loans was 50.8%.\nLoans — SBA: We are designated as an SBA Preferred Lender under the SBA Preferred Lender Program. We offer mostly\nSBA 7(a) variable-rate loans. We generally sell the 75% guaranteed portion of the SBA loans that we originate. Our SBA loans are\ntypically made to small-sized manufacturing, wholesale, retail, hotel/motel and service businesses for working capital needs or business\nexpansions. SBA loans have maturities up to 25 years. Typically, non-real estate secured loans mature in less than 10 years. Collateral\nmay also include inventory, accounts receivable and equipment, and may include personal guarantees. Our unguaranteed SBA loans\ncollateralized by real estate are monitored by collateral type and included in our commercial real estate Concentration Guidance.\n55\nAs of September 30, 2024, our SBA portfolio totaled $252.4 million, compared to $239.7 million as of December 31, 2023.\nWe originated $122.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We sold SBA loans of $92.5 million with a 8.02%\naverage premium during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nFrom our total SBA loan portfolio, $232.2 million is secured by real estate and $20.2 million is unsecured or secured by\nbusiness assets as of September 30, 2024.\nLoans — Commercial and Industrial: Commercial and industrial loans totaled $212.5 million as of September 30, 2024,\ncompared to $121.0 million as of December 31, 2023. We originated $71.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nLoans - Home Mortgage: We originate mainly non-qualified, alternative documentation single-family home mortgage loans\n(“home mortgage”) primarily through our retail branch network and our correspondent lender network. The primary loan product is a\nfive-year or seven-year hybrid adjustable rate mortgage, which reprices after five years to a selected SOFR plus certain spreads. We\nalso purchase residential mortgage loans from third party mortgage originators based on the review of their underwriting and file\nquality as opportunities arise.\nHome mortgage loans totaled $499.7 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $518.0 million as of December 31, 2023.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we originated $26.3 million of home mortgage loans. There was no home mortgage\nloan purchase from third party mortgage originators for the same period.\nLoan Servicing\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we serviced $694.8 million and $707.4 million, respectively, of SBA loans\nfor others. Activity for loan servicing rights was as follows:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nBeginning balance $ 11,043 $ 12,654 $ 11,741 $ 12,759\nAdditions from loans sold with servicing retained 783 505 2,081 2,474\nAmortized to expense (949) (1,228) (2,945) (3,302)\nEnding balance $ 10,877 $ 11,931 $ 10,877 $ 11,931\nLoan servicing rights are reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and reported net of amortization.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe allowance for credit losses is sensitive to numerous factors, including unemployment rate forecasts, change in asset\nquality, prepayment rates, and real estate indices. Given the dynamic relationship between these factors within our model, it is difficult\nto estimate the impact of any one factor or input on the allowance for credit losses. Changes in the factors and inputs considered may\nnot occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or product types. Additionally, changes in factors and input\nmay be discretionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in others. However, to provide\nadditional context regarding the sensitivity of the allowance for credit losses to changes in key variable, we used the following\nassumptions in a sensitivity analysis of our allowance for credit losses: unemployment rate forecast based on supervisory severely\nadverse scenario, 0% prepayment rates, loan risk grade changes of commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loan portfolio\nin worst case scenario based on our history, and applying a 100% weighting to severely adverse scenario.\nThe analysis demonstrates the sensitivity to the allowance for credit losses to key quantitative assumptions and it is not\nintended to estimate changes in the overall allowance for credit losses and it does not capture all the potential unknown variables that\ncould arise in the forecast period, but it provides an approximation of a possible outcome under hypothetical severe conditions.\n56\n\nThe Company used the following assumptions in a sensitivity analysis of our allowance for credit losses: unemployment rate\nforecast based on supervisory severely adverse scenario, 0% prepayment rates, loan risk grade changes of commercial real estate and\ncommercial and industrial loan portfolio in worst case scenario based on the Company history, and applying a 100% weighting to\nseverely adverse scenario. The analysis demonstrates the sensitivity to the allowance for credit losses to key quantitative assumptions\nand it is not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance for credit losses and it does not capture all the potential unknown\nvariables that could arise in the forecast period, but it provides an approximation of a possible outcome under hypothetical severe\nconditions.\nCollateral-dependent loans are loans where repayment is expected to be provided solely by the sale of the underlying collateral\nand there are no other available and reliable sources of repayment. The estimated credit losses for these loans are based on the\ncollateral’s fair value less selling costs. In most cases, the Company records a partial charge-off to reduce the loan’s carrying value to\nthe collateral’s fair value less selling costs at the time of foreclosure.\nThe allowance for credit losses was $23.0 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $22.0 million as of December 31,\n2023. Provision of credit losses of $448 thousand was recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $1.4\nmillion for the same period in 2023.

Delinquent loans may\nremain on accrual status between 30 days and 90 days past due. Loans on which the accrual of interest has been discontinued are\ndesignated as non-accrual loans. Typically, the accrual of interest on loans is discontinued when principal or interest payments are 90\ndays past due or when, in the opinion of management, there is a reasonable doubt as to collectability in the normal course of business.\nWhen loans are placed on non-accrual status, all interest previously accrued, but not collected, is reversed against current period\ninterest income. Income on non-accrual loans is subsequently recognized only to the extent that cash is received, and the loan’s\nprincipal balance is deemed collectible. Loans are restored to accrual status when loans become well-secured and management believes\nfull collectability of principal and interest is probable.\nNonperforming loans include loans that are 90 days past due and still accruing, loans accounted for on a non-accrual basis, and\naccruing restructured loans. Nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans plus other real estate owned (\"OREO\").\nNonperforming loans were $3.6 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $6.1 million as of December 31, 2023.\nNonperforming loans excluded the guaranteed portion of SBA loans of $11.1 million and $2.0 million as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively.\nReal estate we acquire as a result of foreclosure or by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure is classified as OREO until being sold, and is\ninitially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis. As of September 30, 2024, OREO totaled\n$1.2 million, which is secured by a mix-use property in Los Angeles with 90% guaranteed by SBA. There was no OREO as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\n59\nThe following table sets forth the allocation of our nonperforming assets among our different asset categories as of the dates\nindicated.

We offer a variety of deposit products including demand deposits\naccounts, interest-bearing products, savings accounts and certificate of deposits. We dedicate continuing effort into gathering\nnoninterest demand deposits accounts through marketing to our existing and new loan customers, customer referrals, our marketing\nstaff and various involvement with community networks.\nThe following table show the composition of deposits by type as of the dates presented:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\n($ in thousands) Amount Percent Amount Percent\nNoninterest-bearing demand $ 561,801 27.3 % $ 522,751 28.9 %\nInterest-bearing:\nMoney market and others 343,188 16.6 399,018 22.1\nTime deposits (greater than $250) 564,547 27.3 433,892 24.0\nTime deposits ($250 or less) 595,067 28.8 451,897 25.0\nTotal interest-bearing 1,502,802 72.7 1,284,807 71.1\nTotal deposits $ 2,064,603 100.0 % $ 1,807,558 100.0 %\nThe following tables set forth the maturity of time deposits as of September 30, 2024:\nMaturity Within:\nThree Three to Six to Twelve After\n($ in thousands) Months Six Months Months Twelve Months Total\nTime deposits (greater than $250) $ 205,957 $ 189,693 $ 167,641 $ 1,256 $ 564,547\nTime deposits ($250 or less) 261,163 124,315 189,765 19,824 595,067\nTotal time deposits $ 467,120 $ 314,008 $ 357,406 $ 21,080 $ 1,159,614\nOther than deposits, we also utilized FHLB advances as a supplementary funding source to finance our operations. The\nadvances from the FHLB are collateralized by residential and commercial real estate loans. As of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, we had maximum borrowing capacity from the FHLB of $650.7 million and $655.9 million, respectively. We had\nborrowings from FHLB of $75.0 million and $105.0 million as of September 30, 2024 and\n60\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively. The Company had estimated uninsured deposits of $946.4 million, or 45.8% of total deposits, and\n$781.0 million, or 43.2% of total deposits, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity refers to our ability to meet the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers, while at the same time meeting\nour operating, capital and strategic cash flow needs, while effectively balancing the related costs. We continuously monitor our liquidity\nposition to ensure that assets and liabilities are managed in a manner that will meet all short-term and long-term cash requirements. We\nmanage our liquidity position to meet the daily cash flow needs of customers, while maintaining an appropriate balance between assets\nand liabilities to meet the return on investment objectives of our shareholders. Our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements are\nprimarily met through cash flow from operations, redeployment of prepaying and maturing balances in our loan and investment\nportfolios, and increases in customer deposits. Other alternative sources of funds will supplement these primary sources to the extent\nnecessary to meet additional liquidity requirements on either a short-term or long-term basis.\nDeposits are the primary funding source for the Bank. Deposits provide a stable source of funding and reduce our reliance on\nthe wholesale funding markets. The following table presents the loan and deposit balances, the loans-to-deposit ratios, and deposits as a\npercentage of total liabilities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\n($ in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nDeposits $ 2,064,603 $ 1,807,558\nDeposits as a % of total liabilities 94.5 % 92.5 %\nLoans, net $ 1,908,047 $ 1,743,852\nLoans-to-deposits ratio 92.4 % 96.5 %\nIn addition to deposits, we have access to various sources of wholesale funding, as well as borrowing capacity at the FHLB,\nFederal Reserve, and correspondent banks to sustain an adequate liquid asset portfolio, meet daily cash demands and allow\nmanagement flexibility to execute the business strategy. Economic conditions and the stability of capital markets impact the access to\nand the cost of wholesale funding. The access to capital markets is also affected by the ratings received from various credit rating\nagencies.\nWe had $100.0 million of unsecured federal funds lines with no amounts advanced as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023. In addition, on such dates we had lines of credit from the Federal Reserve discount window of $207.8 million and\n$183.0 million, respectively. The Federal Reserve discount window lines were collateralized by a pool of commercial real estate loans\nand commercial and industrial loans totaling $278.9 million and $251.0 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively. We did not have any borrowings outstanding with the Federal Reserve as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023,\nand our borrowing capacity is limited only by eligible collateral.\nBased on the values of loans pledged as collateral, we had $397.6 million of additional borrowing availability with the FHLB\nas of September 30, 2024. We also maintain relationships in the capital markets with brokers to issue certificates of deposit and money\nmarket accounts.\nWe maintain ample access to liquidity, including highly liquid assets on our balance sheet and available unused borrowings\nfrom other financial institutions.

These include unused commitments to extend\ncredit, standby letters of credit and commercial letters of credit. Since many of these commitments expire without being drawn upon,\nand each customer must continue to meet the conditions established in the contract, the total amount of these commercial commitments\ndoes not necessarily represent the future cash requirements of us. Our liquidity sources have been, and are expected to be, sufficient to\nmeet the cash requirements of our lending activities. Information about our loan commitments, standby letters of credit and commercial\nletters of credit is provided in Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies to the unaudited consolidated financial statements in this\nReport.\nCapital Requirements\nWe are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal and state banking regulators, although, as\na “smaller bank holding company,” we are not subject to most of these standards at the holding company level. These standards are,\nhowever, applicable to the Bank, and failure to meet regulatory capital requirements may result in certain mandatory and possible\nadditional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our consolidated financial\nstatements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for “prompt corrective action”, the Bank must meet\nspecific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated\nunder regulatory accounting policies. The capital\n62\namounts and classifications are subject to qualitative judgments by the federal banking regulators regarding components, risk\nweightings and other factors. Qualitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy required us to maintain\nminimum amounts and various ratios of CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital to risk-weighted assets and of Tier 1 capital to\naverage consolidated assets, referred to as the “leverage ratio.”\nThe table below also summarizes the capital requirements applicable to us and the Bank in order to be considered “well-\ncapitalized” from a regulatory perspective, as well as our and the Bank’s capital ratios as of September 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023. The Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements under the Basel III Capital Rules and were considered to be “well-\ncapitalized” as of the dates reflected in the table below. As of September 30, 2024, the FDIC categorized us as well-capitalized under\nthe prompt corrective action framework. There have been no conditions or events since September 30, 2024 that management believes\nwould change this classification.\nRegulatory Capital Ratio\nMinimum to be Requirements, including\nRegulatory Capital Considered \"Well fully phased in Capital\nAs of September 30, 2024 Actual(1) Ratio Requirements Capitalized\" Conservation Buffer\n($ in thousands) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio\nTotal capital (to risk-weighted\nassets)\nConsolidated $ 240,012 12.79 % N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A\nBank 238,097 12.69 $ 150,106 8.00 % $ 187,632 10.00 % $ 197,014 10.50 %\nTier 1 capital (to risk-weighted\nassets)\nConsolidated 217,123 11.57 N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A\nBank 215,208 11.47 112,579 6.00 150,106 8.00 159,487 8.50\nCET1 capital (to risk-weighted\nassets)\nConsolidated 217,123 11.57 N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A\nBank 215,208 11.47 84,435 4.50 121,961 6.50 131,343 7.00\nTier 1 leverage (to average assets)\nConsolidated 217,123 9.30 N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A\nBank 215,208 9.22 93,362 4.00 116,703 5.00 93,362 4.00\n(1) The capital requirements are only applicable to the Bank, and our ratios are included for comparison purpose.\n63\nRegulatory Capital Ratio\nMinimum to be Requirements, including\nRegulatory Capital Considered \"Well fully phased in Capital\nAs of December 31, 2023 Actual(1) Ratio Requirements Capitalized\" Conservation Buffer\n($ in thousands) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio\nTotal capital (to risk-weighted\nassets)\nConsolidated $ 229,544 13.77 % N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A\nBank 227,773 13.66 $ 133,353 8.00 % $ 166,691 10.00 % $ 175,025 10.50 %\nTier 1 capital (to risk-weighted\nassets)\nConsolidated 208,707 12.52 N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A\nBank 206,936 12.41 100,014 6.00 133,353 8.00 141,687 8.50\nCET1 capital (to risk-weighted\nassets)\nConsolidated 208,707 12.52 N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A\nBank 206,936 12.41 75,011 4.50 108,349 6.50 116,684 7.00\nTier 1 leverage (to average assets)\nConsolidated 208,707 9.57 N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A\nBank 206,936 9.49 87,207 4.00 109,008 5.00 87,207 4.00\n(1) The capital requirements are only applicable to the Bank, and our ratios are included for comparison purpose.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nMarket risk represents the risk of loss due to changes in market values of assets and liabilities. We incur market risk in the\nnormal course of business through exposures to market interest rates, equity prices, and credit spreads. We have identified interest rate\nrisk as our primary source of market risk.\nInterest Rate Risk\nInterest rate risk is the risk to earnings and value arising from changes in market interest rates. Interest rate risk arises from\ntiming differences in the repricing and maturities of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities (repricing risk), changes in the\nexpected maturities of assets and liabilities arising from embedded options, such as borrowers’ ability to prepay home mortgage loans\nat any time and depositors’ ability to redeem certificates of deposit before maturity (option risk), changes in the shape of the yield curve\nwhere interest rates increase or decrease in a nonparallel fashion (yield curve risk), and changes in spread relationships between\ndifferent yield curves, such as U.S. Treasuries and SOFR (basis risk).\nOur board’s asset liability committee, or ALM, establishes broad policy limits with respect to interest rate risk. Our\nmanagement’s asset liability committee, or ALCO, establishes specific operating guidelines within the parameters of the policies set by\nthe ALM. In general, we seek to minimize the impact of changing interest rates on net interest income and the economic values of\nassets and liabilities. Our ALCO monitors the level of interest rate risk sensitivity on a quarterly basis to ensure compliance with the\nALM-approved risk limits. The policy requires a periodic review of all key assumptions used, such as identifying appropriate interest\nrate scenarios, setting loan prepayment rates based on historical analysis, and noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing deposit durations\nbased on historical analysis.\nInterest rate risk management is an active process that encompasses monitoring loan and deposit flows complemented by\ninvestment and funding activities. Effective management of interest rate risk begins with understanding the dynamic characteristics of\nassets and liabilities and determining the appropriate interest rate risk posture given business forecasts, management objectives, market\nexpectations, and policy constraints.\nAn asset sensitive position refers to a balance sheet position in which an increase in short-term interest rates is expected to\ngenerate higher net interest income, as rates earned on our interest-earning assets would reprice upward more quickly than rates paid on\nour interest-bearing liabilities, thus expanding our net interest margin. Conversely, a liability sensitive position refers to a balance sheet\nposition in which an increase in short-term interest rates is expected to generate\n64\n\nlower net interest income, as rates paid on our interest-bearing liabilities would reprice upward more quickly than rates earned on our\ninterest-earning assets, thus compressing our net interest margin.\nInterest rate risk measurement is calculated and reported to the ALCO and ALM at least quarterly. The information reported\nincludes period-end results and identifies any policy limits exceeded, along with an assessment of the policy limit breach and the action\nplan and timeline for resolution, mitigation, or assumption of the risk.\nEvaluation of Interest Rate Risk\nWe use a net interest income simulation model to measure and evaluate potential changes in our net interest income. We run\nvarious hypothetical interest rate scenarios at least quarterly and compare these results against a scenario with no changes in interest\nrates. We use two approaches to model interest rate risk: Earnings at Risk, or EAR, and Economic Value of Equity, or EVE. Under\nEAR, net interest income is modeled utilizing various assumptions for assets and liabilities. EVE measures the period end market value\nof assets minus the market value of liabilities and the change in this value as rates change. EVE is a period end measurement.\nOur simulation model incorporates various assumptions, which we believe are reasonable but which may have a significant\nimpact on results such as: (i) the timing of changes in interest rates; (ii) shifts or rotations in the yield curve; (iii) re-pricing\ncharacteristics for market-rate-sensitive instruments; (iv) varying loan prepayment speeds for different interest rate scenarios; and (v)\nthe overall growth and mix of assets and liabilities. Because of limitations inherent in any approach used to measure interest rate risk,\nsimulation results are not intended as a forecast of the actual effect of a change in market interest rates on our results but rather as a\nmeans to better plan and execute appropriate asset-liability management strategies and manage our interest rate risk.\nPotential changes to our net interest income in hypothetical rising and declining rate scenarios calculated as of September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023 are presented in the following table. The projections assume (1) immediate, parallel shifts downward of\nthe yield curve of 100, 200 and 300 basis points and (2) immediate, parallel shifts upward of the yield curve of 100, 200, and 300 basis\npoints over 12 months.\nNet Interest Sensitivity Economic Value of Equity Sensitivity\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\n+300 basis points 3.01 % 1.57 % (20.23)% (41.40)%\n+200 basis points 2.51 2.39 (8.93) (18.75)\n+100 basis points 1.38 1.54 (2.31) (6.32)\n-100 basis points (1.20) (0.97) 0.60 5.58\n-200 basis points 0.19 (0.14) (5.19) 3.41\n-300 basis points 2.94 1.77 (14.74) (3.47)\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of disclosure controls and procedures\nThe Company’s management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, have\nevaluated the effectiveness of our “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange\nAct of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)), as of the end of the period covered in this Report. Based on such evaluation, our\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Company’s\ndisclosure controls and procedures were effective as of that date to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be\ndisclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported\nwithin the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the\nreports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required\ndisclosure.\n65\nChanges in internal control over financial reporting\nThere have not been any changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule\n13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act), during the period covered by this Report, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management\nrecognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of\nachieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial\nreporting must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the\nbenefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\n66\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nIn the normal course of business, we are subject to legal proceedings or claims. Management has reviewed all legal claims\nagainst us and possible loss contingencies, and does not expect the amounts to be material to any of the consolidated financial\nstatements.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nReaders should consider the matters discussed in the section captioned “Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors,” set forth in our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (“Annual Report”), for a list of known risks and uncertainties that\ncould affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and could cause our actual results to vary materially\nfrom those expressed in this Report and our other public filings. Except as expressly set forth below, there have been no material\nchanges from the risk factors described in the Company's Annual Report. Other factors besides those described in our Annual Report or\ndiscussed elsewhere in our other reports filed with or furnished to the SEC could affect our business or results. Readers should not\nconsider any description of such factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that the Company faces.\nInterruptions, cyberattacks, fraudulent activity or other security breaches may have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness.\nOur business is highly dependent on the collection, storage, transmittal, sharing, processing and retention of information about\nour customers and employees. To accomplish these activities, we rely heavily upon electronic infrastructure that we own or that we\nobtain via license or other contractual arrangements with third parties. These technologies affect, among other things, our customers’\nability to access and transfer funds, initiate and pay loans and leases, communicate with our customer service teams, and engage in a\nvariety of other activities that form the foundation of modern financial services businesses. Likewise, our employee data and related\ntechnologies allow us to communicate with our employees about routine and extraordinary matters, compensate our staff, maintain\ntimekeeping, payroll and benefits records, and comply with an increasingly complex web of labor and employment laws and\nregulations. The loss, interruption or disruption of these systems may damage our relationships with customers and correspondingly\nmay harm our reputation. Compromises or interruptions in our employment-related systems may cause challenges in our relationships\nwith our employees, upon whom we are heavily dependent in the conduct of our business and the development and maintenance of our\nrelationships with customers and prospective customers.\nThere have been a number of recent and well-publicized incidents involving various types of cybersecurity lapses, some of\nwhich have had substantial adverse impacts upon targeted businesses and on customers of even some of the world’s most prominent\ncybersecurity and financial services firms. Similarly, extremely sophisticated criminal and nation-state organizations routinely target\nand exploit information technology networks, data systems, and other critical infrastructure. One of the most prominent recent events\nresulted in a widespread failure of a large cybersecurity platform, some of the consequences of which are not yet, and may not soon be,\nfully known or estimable.\nWe devote significant resources and management focus to ensuring the integrity of our systems against cybercriminals and\nsimilar actors, as well as against threats from fires and other natural disasters; power or telecommunications failures; acts of terrorism\nor wars or other catastrophic events; breaches, physical break-ins or errors resulting in interruptions and unauthorized disclosure of\nconfidential information, through information security and business continuity programs. Likewise, we have made, and we continue to\nmake, substantial investments in systems that are intended to protect against these vulnerabilities, including real-time threat detection\nand warning, security programs and protocols, backup and alternative-access systems, virus and malware protection programs, and a\nwide variety of other protective measures.\nNotwithstanding these investments, cybersecurity measures are, by their nature, largely reactive, and threats are constantly\nevolving. We expect that the development of AI-based technologies will accelerate both the number and the sophistication of these\nthreats. We routinely experience attempts to exploit our networks and systems, and we must continue investing in increasingly\nadvanced (and concomitantly expensive) technology to counteract these threats. Further, if our systems cannot timely detect and\nmitigate vulnerabilities, or cannot promptly respond to threats, we may experience damage to or interruptions in the availability of our\ncomputer networks, or we may experience a loss of data, unauthorized use or disclosure of customer information, or a loss of customer\nfunds as a result of unauthorized access to customer\n67\naccounts. Likewise, breaches of our payroll, benefits, and other employee-related systems may give rise to liability under employment\nlaws and may damage our relationships with our employees.\nDisruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure, controls or operating systems that support our businesses and customers,\nfailures of the third parties on which we rely to adequately or appropriately provide their services or perform their responsibilities, or\nour failure to effectively manage or oversee our third-party relationships, could result in business disruptions, loss of revenue or\ncustomers, legal or regulatory proceedings, remediation and other costs, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, reputational\ndamage, customer harm, or other adverse consequences, any of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or\nfinancial condition. Further, new and evolving SEC regulations, as well as federal and state banking and consumer privacy laws and\nregulations, could require us to provide notices of security breaches. Such disclosures could result in increased regulatory scrutiny,\nexacerbate our potential legal liability, and result in a loss of confidence in the security of our systems or an adverse perception of our\nproducts and services.\nThe access by unauthorized persons to, or the improper disclosure by us or our third-party vendors of, confidential information\nregarding our customers or our own proprietary information, software, methodologies and business secrets, failures or disruptions in\nour communications, information and technology systems, or our failure to adequately address them, could negatively affect our\ncustomer relationship management, online banking, accounting or other systems. We cannot assure readers that such breaches, failures\nor interruptions will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed by us or the third parties on which we rely.\nAccordingly, any failures or interruptions of our communications, information and technology systems could damage our\nreputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible\nfinancial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur cybersecurity investments may create unforeseen implementation challenges that confer unexpected disruptions,\nunbudgeted costs, or delays in adaptation to crucial threats.\nEnhancements and upgrades to our infrastructure or computer systems may be time-consuming, may entail significant costs,\nand may themselves create risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones. Due to the\ncomplexity and interconnectedness of our systems, the process of enhancing our infrastructure and operating systems, including their\nsecurity measures and controls, also can create an inherent risk of system disruptions and security issues. Similarly, we may not be able\nto timely recover critical business processes or operations that have been disrupted, which may further increase any associated costs\nand consequences of such disruptions. Although we have enterprise incident response processes, business continuity plans and other\nsafeguards in place to help provide operational resiliency, our business operations may be adversely affected by significant and\nwidespread disruption to our physical infrastructure or computer systems that support our businesses and customers.\nOur relatively small size requires us to be heavily reliant upon third-party vendors for cybersecurity expertise. Those\nvendors may themselves be subject to vulnerabilities, and their failures may be harmful to our business.\nAs a smaller bank holding company and a small community bank, we lack the resources available to larger institutions to\nrecruit, train and retain a large staff focused on data security. Instead, like most community banks, we rely heavily on third-party\nvendors and other service providers for these functions. As financial institutions and technology systems become more interconnected\nand more complex, any operational incident at a third party, such as a vendor or customer, may increase our operational risks, including\nfrom information breaches or loss, breakdowns, disruptions or failures of their own systems or infrastructure, or any deficiencies in the\nperformance of their responsibilities. These risks are increased to the extent we rely on a single-source vendor or provider. If a third-\nparty vendor or service provider is not fully effective in assisting us in protecting our data and systems, we may be held responsible for\nany resulting failures, and even a failure by a third party could damage or jeopardize our relationships with our customers. Further, a\nrecent and well-publicized cybersecurity incident involving the failure of one of the world’s most sophisticated security platforms\nresulted in extensive outages of that provider’s customer systems, the effect of which was a cascading failure of several of that firm’s\nclients’ networks. Such interruptions, occurring as a result of the acts or omissions of one or more of our vendors, could result in\nliability to our customers, as well as reputational harm and a potential interruption of our business.\nCybersecurity incidents, failures or lapses could give rise to regulatory harms to the Company or the Bank.\n68\nAs cybersecurity threats become increasingly widespread and sophisticated, federal and state banking and privacy regulations\nare becoming correspondingly complex and prevalent, and the penalties for the actual or suspected violations of such rules are\nbecoming increasingly substantial. Accordingly, we must meet stringent and increasingly costly regulatory requirements regarding our\nown obligations, as well as our reliance on third-party service providers, and any failure by us or our third-party service providers to\ncomply with applicable laws, rules, regulations, or internal policies could result in the Company or the Bank becoming subject to fines,\npenalties, or business restrictions, as well as to increased costs to remediate any actual or perceived deficiencies and potentially to legal\nand other costs associated with defending against such regulatory sanctions.\nItem 2.
