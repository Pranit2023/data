For the three months ended September 30, 2024, consolidated net income was $7,324,000, or $0.89 per diluted share (EPS), as compared to $5,889,000, or $0.71 EPS, for the prior quarter and $7,354,000, or $0.89 EPS, for the same period a year ago. Consolidated net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $18,940,000, or $2.30 EPS, compared to $24,983,000 or $3.04 EPS for the same period of 2023.\n\nThe increase in third quarter net income compared to the prior quarter was primarily due to loan recoveries that resulted in a reversal of allowance for credit losses of $1,620,000. The QTD and YTD decreases compared to the same periods of 2023 were related to an increase in deposit interest expense and general operating expenses.\n\nNet interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $17,655,000, compared to $17,292,000 in the prior quarter, and $18,938,000 in the same period a year ago. The increase in net interest income over the prior quarter is attributed to earning asset growth and an increase of 3 basis points in the average earning asset yield. The decrease from the same period a year ago is due to an increase in deposit interest expense, as the average cost of funds increased to 0.83% bps for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 0.33% for the comparable period of 2023. The higher interest expense was partially offset by loan growth of $103.9 million over the same period. Net interest margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 4.04%, compared to 4.11% for the prior quarter and 4.34% for the same period last year.\n\n“Our strong core deposits have helped manage funding costs and maintain a healthy net interest margin. Loan growth is crucial to minimizing future margin compression amid possible interest rate drops. Oak Valley was founded on service-focused relationship banking, which drives these efforts. Our success in growing relationships relies on standing out from our competitors by meeting and surpassing client expectations,” stated Rick McCarty, President and Chief Operating Officer.\n\nNon-interest income was $1,846,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $1,760,000 for the prior quarter and $1,566,000 for the same period last year. The increases compared to prior periods was mainly due to unrealized gains on equity securities as a result of lower interest rates.\n\nNon-interest expense totaled $11,324,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $11,616,000 in the prior quarter and $10,578,000 in the same quarter a year ago. The decrease compared to the prior period is mainly due to charitable contributions and data processing expense. The third quarter increase compared to the same period a year ago is mainly due to staffing expense and general operating costs related to servicing the growing loan and deposit portfolios.\n\nTotal assets were $1.90 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of $59.9 million and $65.1 million over June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Gross loans were $1.08 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of $5.1 million over June 30, 2024 and $103.9 million over September 30, 2023. The Company’s total deposits were $1.69 billion as of September 30, 2024, an increase of $45.6 million and $23.8 million from June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Our liquidity position is very strong as evidenced by $213.9 million in cash and cash equivalents balances at September 30, 2024.\n\nNon-performing assets (“NPA”) remained at zero as of September 30, 2024, as they were for all of 2024 and 2023. The allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) as a percentage of gross loans increased to 1.07% at September 30, 2024, compared to 1.04% at June 30, 2024 and 1.00% at September 30, 2023. The increase over the prior quarter is due to macro-economic forecasts, loan growth and other credit-risk factors included in the ACL calculation which dictated an increase of $358,000 in the ACL. Loan recoveries totaled $2.0 million during the third quarter of 2024, which consisted of two loans that dated back to the recession. The net impact of the $2.0 million loan recoveries and the $358,000 increase in the ACL calculation resulted in a reversal of ACL provisions totaling $1.62 million. Given industry concerns of credit risk specific to commercial real estate, management has performed a thorough analysis of this segment as part of the CECL credit risk model’s ACL computation, concluding that the credit loss reserves relative to gross loans remains at acceptable levels, and credit quality remains stable.\n\nOak Valley Bancorp operates Oak Valley Community Bank & their Eastern Sierra Community Bank division, through which it offers a variety of loan and deposit products to individuals and small businesses. They currently operate through 18 conveniently located branches: Oakdale, Turlock, Stockton, Patterson, Ripon, Escalon, Manteca, Tracy, Sacramento, Roseville, two branches in Sonora, three branches in Modesto, and three branches in their Eastern Sierra division, which includes Bridgeport, Mammoth Lakes, and Bishop.\n\nFor more information, call 1-866-844-7500 or visit [www.ovcb.com](http://www.ovcb.com).\n\nThis press release includes forward-looking statements about the corporation for which the corporation claims the protection of safe harbor provisions contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\n\nForward-looking statements are based on management's knowledge and belief as of today and include information concerning the corporation's possible or assumed future financial condition, and its results of operations and business.

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, consolidated net income was $7,324,000, or $0.89 per diluted share (EPS), as compared to $5,889,000, or $0.71 EPS, for the prior quarter and $7,354,000, or $0.89 EPS, for the same period a year ago. Consolidated net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $18,940,000, or $2.30 EPS, compared to $24,983,000 or $3.04 EPS for the same period of 2023.\n\nThe increase in third quarter net income compared to the prior quarter was primarily due to loan recoveries that resulted in a reversal of allowance for credit losses of $1,620,000. The QTD and YTD decreases compared to the same periods of 2023 were related to an increase in deposit interest expense and general operating expenses.\n\nNet interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $17,655,000, compared to $17,292,000 in the prior quarter, and $18,938,000 in the same period a year ago. The increase in net interest income over the prior quarter is attributed to earning asset growth and an increase of 3 basis points in the average earning asset yield. The decrease from the same period a year ago is due to an increase in deposit interest expense, as the average cost of funds increased to 0.83% bps for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 0.33% for the comparable period of 2023. The higher interest expense was partially offset by loan growth of $103.9 million over the same period. Net interest margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 4.04%, compared to 4.11% for the prior quarter and 4.34% for the same period last year.\n\n“Our strong core deposits have helped manage funding costs and maintain a healthy net interest margin. Loan growth is crucial to minimizing future margin compression amid possible interest rate drops. Oak Valley was founded on service-focused relationship banking, which drives these efforts. Our success in growing relationships relies on standing out from our competitors by meeting and surpassing client expectations,” stated Rick McCarty, President and Chief Operating Officer.\n\nNon-interest income was $1,846,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $1,760,000 for the prior quarter and $1,566,000 for the same period last year. The increases compared to prior periods was mainly due to unrealized gains on equity securities as a result of lower interest rates.\n\nNon-interest expense totaled $11,324,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $11,616,000 in the prior quarter and $10,578,000 in the same quarter a year ago. The decrease compared to the prior period is mainly due to charitable contributions and data processing expense. The third quarter increase compared to the same period a year ago is mainly due to staffing expense and general operating costs related to servicing the growing loan and deposit portfolios.\n\nTotal assets were $1.90 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of $59.9 million and $65.1 million over June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Gross loans were $1.08 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of $5.1 million over June 30, 2024 and $103.9 million over September 30, 2023. The Company’s total deposits were $1.69 billion as of September 30, 2024, an increase of $45.6 million and $23.8 million from June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Our liquidity position is very strong as evidenced by $213.9 million in cash and cash equivalents balances at September 30, 2024.\n\nNon-performing assets (“NPA”) remained at zero as of September 30, 2024, as they were for all of 2024 and 2023. The allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) as a percentage of gross loans increased to 1.07% at September 30, 2024, compared to 1.04% at June 30, 2024 and 1.00% at September 30, 2023. The increase over the prior quarter is due to macro-economic forecasts, loan growth and other credit-risk factors included in the ACL calculation which dictated an increase of $358,000 in the ACL. Loan recoveries totaled $2.0 million during the third quarter of 2024, which consisted of two loans that dated back to the recession. The net impact of the $2.0 million loan recoveries and the $358,000 increase in the ACL calculation resulted in a reversal of ACL provisions totaling $1.62 million. Given industry concerns of credit risk specific to commercial real estate, management has performed a thorough analysis of this segment as part of the CECL credit risk model’s ACL computation, concluding that the credit loss reserves relative to gross loans remains at acceptable levels, and credit quality remains stable.\n\nOak Valley Bancorp operates Oak Valley Community Bank & their Eastern Sierra Community Bank division, through which it offers a variety of loan and deposit products to individuals and small businesses.

PRESENTATION\nOak Valley Bancorp (“the Company”, “us”, “our”) is the parent holding company for Oak Valley Community Bank (the “Bank”), a California state-chartered\nbank. Eastern Sierra Community Bank operates as a division within Oak Valley Community Bank for select branches. The consolidated financial statements\ninclude the accounts of the parent company and its wholly-owned bank subsidiary. Unless otherwise stated, the “Company” refers to the consolidated entity,\nOak Valley Bancorp, while the “Bank” refers to Oak Valley Community Bank. All material intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The interim\nconsolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are unaudited but reflect all adjustments which, in the opinion of\nmanagement, are necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and results of operations for the interim periods presented. All such adjustments are\nof a normal recurring nature. The results of operations for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the\nresults of a full year’s operations. [Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. There was no effect on net\nincome or shareholders’ equity as previously reported as a result of reclassifications.] For further information, refer to the audited consolidated financial\nstatements and footnotes included in the Company’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of California on May 31, 1990, and began operations in Oakdale, California on May 28, 1991. The\nCompany operates branches in Oakdale, Sonora, Bridgeport, Bishop, Mammoth Lakes, Modesto, Manteca, Patterson, Turlock, Ripon, Stockton, Escalon, and\nSacramento, California. The Bridgeport, Mammoth Lakes, and Bishop branches operate as a separate division, Eastern Sierra Community Bank. The\nCompany’s primary source of revenue is providing loans to customers who are predominantly middle-market businesses.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the\nfinancial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant accounting estimates reflected in the\nCompany’s consolidated financial statements include the allowance for credit losses and fair value measurements. The estimates and assumptions may change\nas new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as the Company’s operating environment changes. Actual results\nmay differ from these estimates due to the uncertainty of various qualitative factors. Descriptions of our significant accounting policies are included in Note 1.\nSummary of Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNOTE 2 – RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit\nLosses (Topic 326). This update revises the methodology used by financial institutions under GAAP to recognize credit losses in the financial statements.\nPreviously, GAAP required the use of an “incurred loss” model, whereby financial institutions recognize in current period earnings, incurred credit losses and\nthose inherent in the financial statements, as of the date of the balance sheet. The “incurred loss” methodology for recognizing credit losses delayed\nrecognition until it is probable that a loss has been incurred. ASU 2016-13 replaces such incurred loss impairment model with a new methodology that requires\norganizations to measure all expected credit losses for financial instruments held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions and\nreasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. This ASU guidance results in a new model for estimating the\nallowance for credit losses, commonly referred to as the Current Expected Credit Loss (“CECL”) model. Under the CECL model, financial institutions are\nrequired to estimate future credit losses and recognize those losses in current period earnings. The amendments within the update were initially effective for\nfiscal years and all interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019. In October 2019, FASB approved an amendment that delayed the adoption of this ASU\nfor three years for certain entities including the Company since we are classified as a Smaller Reporting Company. The Company adopted these standards as\nrequired on January 1, 2023 using the modified retrospective method for all financial assets measured at amortized cost and off-balance sheet credit exposures.\nThere was no cumulative effect adjustment related to our available-for-sale investment portfolio upon adoption and the Company had no securities designated\nas held-to-maturity as of January 1, 2023.\nResults for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2023 are presented under CECL. The transition adjustment of the CECL adoption included an increase\nin the allowance for credit losses of $346,000, an increase of $547,000 to the reserve for unfunded commitments, a $629,000 decrease to retained earnings, and\na $264,000 tax benefit recorded as part of the deferred tax asset in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n6\nTable of Contents\nIn March 2020, FASB issued ASU 2020-04 - Reference Rate Reform (Subtopic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial\nReporting. This ASU provides optional expedients and exceptions for contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or other\nreference rates expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. The ASU was effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31,\n2022. In December 2022, FASB Issued ASU 2022-06 to defer the sunset date from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. The ASU did not have a\nmaterial impact on our consolidated financial statements. As a result of the phase out of LIBOR immediately after June 30, 2023, our loans that were indexed\nto LIBOR have transitioned to CME Term SOFR, as of September 30, 2024.\nIn March 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures\n(“ASU 2022-02”). ASU 2022-02 eliminates the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Subtopic\n310-40, Receivables - Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors, while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancing and restructurings by\ncreditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. Additionally, ASU 2022-02 requires entities to disclose current-period gross write-offs by year of\norigination for financing receivables and net investments in leases within the scope of ASC Subtopic 326-20, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses - Measured\nat Amortized Cost. ASU 2022-02 became effective on January 1, 2023. The adoption of ASU 2022-02 did not have a significant impact on our consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nIn March 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-02, Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit\nStructures Using the Proportional Amortization Method (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force). The amendments in this update permit reporting\nentities to elect to account for their tax equity investments, regardless of the program from which the income tax credits are received, using the proportional\namortization method if certain conditions are met. A reporting entity may make an accounting policy election to apply the proportional amortization method on\na tax-credit-program-by-tax-credit-program basis rather than electing to apply the proportional amortization method at the reporting entity level or to individual\ninvestments. Previously, only Low-Income Housing Tax Credit investments were eligible to apply the proportional amortization method. This ASU became\neffective on January 1, 2024. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (ASU 2023-07).\nThe update requires enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses, enhanced interim disclosure requirements, clarification for when multiple\nsegment measures of profit or loss can be disclosed and other requirements intended to improve overall reportable segment disclosures in annual and interim\nperiods. ASU 2023-07 is effective for the Company in the annual period beginning on January 1, 2024 and interim periods beginning on January 1, 2025 with\nretrospective application to all prior periods presented. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect ASU 2023-07 to have a significant impact\non its disclosures as the Company operates as a single segment and reporting unit.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (ASU 2023-09). ASU 2023-09\nrequires additional annual disclosures including further disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation, additional information for reconciling items\nmeeting a quantitative threshold, further disaggregation of income taxes paid and other required disclosures. ASU 2023-09 is effective for the Company in the\nannual period beginning on January 1, 2025 and applied on a prospective basis with both early adoption and retrospective application permitted. The Company\ndoes not anticipate ASU 2023-09 to have a significant impact on its income tax disclosures or financial statements.\nNOTE 3 – SECURITIES\nEquity Securities\nThe Company held equity securities with fair values of $3,274,000 and $3,132,000 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. There were\nno sales of equity securities during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Consistent with ASC 321, Equity Securities, these\nsecurities are carried at fair value with the changes in fair value recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of income. Accordingly, the Company\nrecognized a gain of $141,000 during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, and a loss of $60,000, during the nine-month period ended September\n30, 2024, as compared to losses of $144,000 and $141,000 during the same periods of 2023.\n7\nTable of Contents\nDebt Securities\nDebt securities have been classified in the financial statements as available for sale. The amortized cost and estimated fair values of debt securities as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 are as follows:\nGross\nUnrealized Gross Unrealized\n(dollars in thousands) Amortized Cost Gains Losses Fair Value\nAvailable-for-sale securities:\nU.S. agencies $ 96,862 $ 226 $ (3,106) $ 93,982\nCollateralized mortgage obligations 26,388 65 (355) 26,098\nMunicipalities 322,063 1,671 (17,522) 306,212\nSBA pools 940 1 (1) 940\nCorporate debt 43,500 10 (2,477) 41,033\nAsset backed securities 49,637 59 (629) 49,067\n$ 539,390 $ 2,032 $ (24,090) $ 517,332\nThe following table details the gross unrealized losses and fair values of debt securities aggregated by investment category and the length of time that\nindividual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2024.\n(dollars in thousands) Less than 12 months 12 months or more Total\nNumber\nof Fair Unrealized Fair Unrealized Fair Unrealized\nDescription of Securities Securities Value Loss Value Loss Value Loss\nU.S. agencies 37 $ 4,966 $ (119) $ 57,899 $ (2,987) $ 62,865 $ (3,106)\nCollateralized mortgage obligations 6 8,286 (7) 3,568 (348) 11,854 (355)\nMunicipalities 93 28,246 (139) 183,696 (17,383) 211,942 (17,522)\nSBA pools 3 128 0 160 (1) 288 (1)\nCorporate debt 11 0 0 39,023 (2,477) 39,023 (2,477)\nAsset backed securities 14 8,143 (21) 17,625 (608) 25,768 (629)\nTotal temporarily impaired securities 164 $ 49,769 $ (286) $ 301,971 $ (23,804) $ 351,740 $ (24,090)\nFor available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, management evaluates whether the decline in fair value is a reflection of credit deterioration\nor other factors. In performing this evaluation, management considers the extent which fair value has fallen below amortized cost, changes in ratings by rating\nagencies, and other information indicating a deterioration in repayment capacity of either the underlying issuer or the borrowers providing repayment capacity\nin a securitization. If management’s evaluation indicates that a credit loss exists then a present value of the expected cash flows is calculated and compared to\nthe amortized cost basis of the security in question and, to the degree that the amortized cost basis exceeds the present value, an allowance for credit loss\n(“ACL”) is established, with the caveat that the maximum amount of the reserve on any individual security is the difference between the fair value and\namortized cost balance of the security in question. Any unrealized loss that has not been recorded through an ACL is recognized in other comprehensive\nincome. As of September 30, 2024, accrued interest receivable on available-for-sale securities was $4,164,000 and is not included in the tables within this\nfootnote.\nThe unrealized losses are due primarily to rising market yields and not due to credit deterioration. As such, no ACL on available-for-sale securities has been\nestablished as of September 30, 2024. The Company does not intend to sell the securities and it is not likely that the Company will be required to sell the\nsecurities before the earlier of the forecasted recovery or the maturity of the underlying investment security.\n8\nTable of Contents\nThe amortized cost and estimated fair value of debt securities as of September 30, 2024, segregated by contractual maturity or call date, are shown below.\nExpected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or\nprepayment penalties.\n(dollars in thousands) Amortized Fair\nCost Value\nAvailable-for-sale securities:\nDue in one year or less $ 89,461 $ 86,651\nDue after one year through five years 155,826 153,114\nDue after five years through ten years 185,793 172,544\nDue after ten years 108,310 105,023\n$ 539,390 $ 517,332\nThe amortized cost and estimated fair values of debt securities as of December 31, 2023 are as follows:\nGross Gross\n(dollars in thousands) Unrealized Unrealized\nAmortized Cost Gains Losses Fair Value\nAvailable-for-sale securities:\nU.S. agencies $ 84,678 $ 11 $ (4,430) $ 80,259\nCollateralized mortgage obligations 9,108 0 (444) 8,664\nMunicipalities 345,981 2,792 (19,865) 328,908\nSBA pools 1,394 3 (2) 1,395\nCorporate debt 47,500 9 (3,992) 43,517\nAsset backed securities 56,613 133 (1,411) 55,335\n$ 545,274 $ 2,948 $ (30,144) $ 518,078\nThe following tables detail the gross unrealized losses and fair values aggregated of debt securities by investment category and length of time that individual\nsecurities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position at December 31, 2023.\n(dollars in thousands) Less than 12 months 12 months or more Total\nNumber\nof Unrealized Unrealized Unrealized\nDescription of Securities Securities Fair Value Loss Fair Value Loss Fair Value Loss\nU.S. agencies 51 $ 190 $ (3) $ 79,556 $ (4,427) $ 79,746 $ (4,430)\nCollateralized mortgage obligations 6 4,791 (1) 3,873 (443) 8,664 (444)\nMunicipalities 106 44,859 (453) 178,812 (19,412) 223,671 (19,865)\nSBA pools 4 116 0 472 (2) 588 (2)\nCorporate debt 13 0 0 41,508 (3,992) 41,508 (3,992)\nAsset backed securities 19 2,123 (8) 32,535 (1,403) 34,658 (1,411)\nTotal temporarily impaired securities 199 $ 52,079 $ (465) $ 336,756 $ (29,679) $ 388,835 $ (30,144)\nThere were no sales of available-for-sale securities during the three-months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company sold eighteen available-for-sale\nsecurities during the nine-months ended September 30, 2024 with a book value of $28,258,000, resulting in gross gains of $106,000, as compared to 24\navailable-for-sale securities sold with a book value of $42,791,000, resulting in gross losses of $72,000 and gross gains of $215,000, for a net gain of $143,000\nduring the nine-months ended September 30, 2023. In addition, the Company recognized a net gain of $8,000 and $9,000 on called securities during the three\nand nine-month periods ended June, 2024, respectively, as compared to gains of $13,000 during the comparable 2023 periods.\nDebt securities carried at $305,109,000 and $288,199,000 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, were pledged to secure deposits of\npublic funds.\n9\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 4 – LOANS\nThe Company’s customers are primarily located in Stanislaus, San Joaquin, Tuolumne, Inyo, and Mono Counties. As of September 30, 2024, approximately\n86% of the Company’s loans are commercial real estate loans, which include construction loans. Approximately 8% of the Company’s loans are for general\ncommercial uses including professional, retail, and small business. Additionally, 3% of the Company’s loans are for residential real estate and other consumer\nloans. The remaining 3% are agriculture loans.

Diversification in the loan portfolio is a means of managing risk associated with fluctuations in economic conditions.\nCommercial and industrial loans are underwritten after evaluating and understanding the borrower’s ability to operate profitably and prudently expand its\nbusiness. Underwriting standards are designed to promote relationship banking rather than transactional banking. Once it is determined that the borrower’s\nmanagement possesses sound ethics and solid business acumen, the Company’s management examines current and projected cash flows to determine the\nability of the borrower to repay their obligations as agreed. Commercial and industrial loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flows of the\nborrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. The cash flows of borrowers, however, may not be as expected and the\ncollateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Most commercial and industrial loans are secured by the assets being financed or other business assets\nsuch as accounts receivable or inventory and may incorporate a personal guarantee; however, some short-term loans may be made on an unsecured basis. In the\ncase of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the\nborrower to collect amounts due from its customers.\nCommercial real estate loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to commercial and industrial loans, in addition to those of real estate\nloans. These loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate. Commercial real estate lending typically involves\nhigher loan principal amounts and the repayment of these loans is generally largely dependent on the successful operation of the property securing the loan or\nthe business conducted on the property securing the loan. Commercial real estate loans may be more adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets\nor in the general economy. The properties securing the Company’s commercial real estate portfolio are diverse in terms of type and geographic location. This\ndiversity helps reduce the Company’s exposure to adverse economic events that affect any single market or industry. Management monitors and evaluates\ncommercial real estate loans based on collateral, geography and risk grade criteria. As a general rule, the Company avoids financing single-purpose projects\nunless other underwriting factors are present to help mitigate risk. The Company also utilizes third-party experts to provide insight and guidance about\neconomic conditions and trends affecting market areas it serves. In addition, management tracks the level of owner-occupied commercial real estate loans\nversus non-owner occupied loans. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximately 35% of the outstanding principal balance of the\nCompany’s commercial real estate loans were secured by owner-occupied properties.\n10\nTable of Contents\nWith respect to loans to developers and builders that are secured by non-owner occupied properties that the Company may originate from time to time, the\nCompany generally requires the borrower to have had an existing relationship with the Company and have a proven record of success.\nConstruction loans are underwritten utilizing feasibility studies, independent appraisal reviews, sensitivity analysis of absorption and lease rates and financial\nanalysis of the developers and property owners. Construction loans are generally based upon estimates of costs and value associated with the complete project.\nThese estimates may be inaccurate. Significant events can affect the construction industry, including: the inherent volatility of real estate markets and\nvulnerability to delays due to weather, change orders, inability to obtain construction permits, labor or material shortages, and price changes. Construction\nloans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment substantially dependent on the success of the ultimate project. Sources of repayment\nfor these types of loans may be pre-committed permanent loans from approved long-term lenders, sales of developed property or an interim loan commitment\nfrom the Company until permanent financing is obtained. These loans are closely monitored by on-site inspections and are considered to have higher risks than\nother real estate loans due to their ultimate repayment being sensitive to interest rate changes, governmental regulation of real property, general economic\nconditions and the availability of long-term financing.\nConsumer loans are originated utilizing a computer-based credit scoring analysis to supplement the underwriting process. To monitor and manage consumer\nloan risk, policies and procedures are developed and modified, as needed, jointly by line and staff personnel. This activity, coupled with relatively small loan\namounts that are spread across many individual borrowers, minimizes risk. Additionally, trend and outlook reports are reviewed by management on a regular\nbasis. Underwriting standards for home equity loans follow bank policy, which include, but are not limited to, a maximum loan-to-value percentage of 80%, a\nmaximum housing and total debt ratio of 36% and 42%, respectively and other specified credit and documentation requirements.\nAgricultural loans largely consist of real estate loans, development loans, and operating facilities to support crop production, livestock, dairy, and other\nagricultural interests. Agricultural loans are especially vulnerable to two risk factors that are largely outside the control of the Company and borrowers:\ncommodity prices and weather conditions. Other environmental factors such as the availability of water will also affect the production of crops. Underwriting\npractices include estimating future repayment sources based on information taken from the customer, peer reports, or appraisals. With the cyclicality of\nagricultural operations, increased focus is placed on access to liquidity and equity to support the operations when faced with unfavorable industry trends as well\nas the sponsor’s industry experience.\nThe Company maintains an independent loan review function that validates the credit risk program on a periodic basis. Results of these reviews are presented\nto management. The loan review process complements and reinforces the risk identification and assessment decisions made by lenders and credit personnel, as\nwell as the Company’s policies and procedures.\nNon-Accrual and Past Due Loans. Loans are considered past due if the required principal and interest payments have not been received as of the date such\npayments were due. Loans are placed on non-accrual status when, in management’s opinion, the borrower may be unable to meet payment obligations as they\nbecome due, as well as when required by regulatory provisions. Loans may be placed on non-accrual status regardless of whether or not such loans are\nconsidered past due. When interest accrual is discontinued, all unpaid accrued interest is reversed. Interest income is subsequently recognized only to the extent\ncash payments are received in excess of principal due. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are\nbrought current and future payments are reasonably assured.\nNo loans were on non-accrual status as of September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023, and September 30, 2023.\n11\nTable of Contents\nThe following table analyzes past due loans including any past due non-accrual loans, segregated by class of loans, as of September 30, 2024 (in thousands):\n90 Days\nor More\n30-59 60-89 90 Days Past Due\nDays Days or More Total and Still\nSeptember 30, 2024 Past Due Past Due Past Due Past Due Current Total Accruing\nCommercial real estate:\nConstruction & land $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 $ 31,300 $ 31,300 $ 0\nMulti-family 0 0 0 0 58,360 58,360 0\nOwner occupied 0 0 0 0 228,516 228,516 0\nNon-owner occupied 0 0 0 0 517,254 517,254 0\nFarmland 0 0 0 0 93,881 93,881 0\nCommercial and industrial 0 0 0 0 81,439 81,439 0\nConsumer 0 0 0 0 33,612 33,612 0\nAgriculture 0 0 0 0 30,776 30,776 0\nTotal $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 $ 1,075,138 $ 1,075,138 $ 0\nThe following table analyzes past due loans including any past due non-accrual loans, segregated by class of loans, as of December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\n90 Days\nor More\n30-59 60-89 90 Days Past Due\nDays Days or More Total and Still\nDecember 31, 2023 Past Due Past Due Past Due Past Due Current Total Accruing\nCommercial real estate:\nConstruction & land $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 $ 63,060 $ 63,060 $ 0\nMulti-family 0 0 0 0 54,045 54,045 0\nOwner occupied 0 0 0 0 210,407 210,407 0\nNon-owner occupied 0 0 0 0 470,052 470,052 0\nFarmland 0 0 0 0 96,188 96,188 0\nCommercial and industrial 0 0 0 0 65,218 65,218 0\nConsumer 0 0 0 0 31,687 31,687 0\nAgriculture 0 0 0 0 25,922 25,922 0\nTotal $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 $ 1,016,579 $ 1,016,579 $ 0\nCollateral Dependent Loans. Management’s evaluation as to the ultimate collectability of loans includes estimates regarding future cash flows from operations\nand the value of property, real and personal, pledged as collateral. These estimates are affected by changing economic conditions and the economic prospects of\nborrowers. Under CECL, loans can be determined to be collateral dependent if foreclosure of the loan’s underlying collateral is probable or as a practical\nexpedient if the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and the repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the\ncollateral. Loans are written down to the lower of cost or fair value of underlying collateral, less estimated costs to sell. The Company had no collateral\ndependent loans as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nLoan Modification Disclosures Pursuant to ASU 2022-02 - The Company may agree to different types of concessions when modifying a loan. There were no\nloan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, including principal forgiveness, rate reductions, payment deferral or term extension, during\nthe three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nLoan Risk Grades– Quality ratings (Risk Grades) are assigned to all commitments and stand-alone notes. Risk grades define the basic characteristics of\ncommitments or stand-alone note in relation to their risk. All loans are graded using a system that maximizes the loan quality information contained in loan\nreview grades, while ensuring that the system is compatible with the grades used by bank examiners.\n12\nTable of Contents\nThe Company grades loans using the following letter system:\n1 Exceptional Loan\n2 Quality Loan\n3A Better Than Acceptable Loan\n3B Acceptable Loan\n3C Marginally Acceptable Loan\n4 (W) Watch Acceptable Loan\n5 Special Mention Loan\n6 Substandard Loan\n7 Doubtful Loan\n8 Loss\n1. Exceptional Loan - Loans with A+ credits that contain very little, if any, risk. Grade 1 loans are considered Pass. To qualify for this rating, the following\ncharacteristics must be present:\n● A high level of liquidity and whose debt-servicing capacity exceeds expected obligations by a substantial margin.\n● Where leverage is below average for the industry and earnings are consistent or growing without severe vulnerability to economic cycles.\n● Also included in this rating (but not mandatory unless one or more of the preceding characteristics are missing) are loans that are fully secured\nand properly margined by our own time instruments or U.S. blue chip securities. To be properly margined, cash collateral must be equal to, or\ngreater than, 110% of the loan amount.\n2. Quality Loan - Loans with excellent sources of repayment that conform in all respects to bank policy and regulatory requirements. These are also loans for\nwhich little repayment risk has been identified. No credit or collateral exceptions. Grade 2 loans are considered Pass. Other factors include:\n● Unquestionable debt-servicing capacity to cover all obligations in the ordinary course of business from well-defined primary and secondary\nsources.\n● Consistent strong earnings.\n● A solid equity base.\n3A. Better than Acceptable Loan - In the interest of better delineating the loan portfolio’s true credit risk for reserve allocation, further granularity has been\nsought by splitting the grade 3 category into three classifications. The distinction between the three are bank-defined guidelines and represent a further\nrefinement of the regulatory definition of a pass, or grade 3 loan. Grade 3A is characterized by:\n● Strong earnings with no loss in last three years and ample cash flow to service all debt well above policy guidelines.\n● Long term experienced management with depth and defined management succession.\n● The loan has no exceptions to policy.\n● Loan-to-value on real estate secured transactions is 10% to 20% less than policy guidelines.\n● Very liquid balance sheet that may have cash available to pay off our loan completely.\n● Little to no debt on balance sheet.\n3B. Acceptable Loan - 3B loans are simply defined as all loans that are less qualified than 3A loans and are stronger than 3C loans. These loans are\ncharacterized by acceptable sources of repayment that conform to bank policy and regulatory requirements. Repayment risks are acceptable for these loans.\nCredit or collateral exceptions are minimal, are in the process of correction, and do not represent repayment risk. These loans:\n● Are those where the borrower has average financial strengths, a history of profitable operations and experienced management.\n● Are those where the borrower can be expected to handle normal credit needs in a satisfactory manner.\n3C. Marginally Acceptable Loan - 3C loans have similar characteristics as that of 3Bs with the following additional characteristics:\n● Requires collateral.\n● A credit facility where the borrower has average financial strengths, but usually lacks reliable secondary sources of repayment other than the\nsubject collateral.\n● Other common characteristics can include some or all of the following: minimal background experience of management, lacking continuity of\nmanagement, a start-up operation, erratic historical profitability (acceptable reasons-well identified), lack of or marginal sponsorship of\nguarantor, and government guaranteed loans.\n13\nTable of Contents\n4(W). Watch Acceptable Loan - Watch grade will be assigned to any credit that is adequately secured and performing but monitored for a number of indicators.\nThese characteristics may include:\n● Any unexpected short-term adverse financial performance from budgeted projections or a prior period’s results (i.e., declining profits, sales,\nmargins, cash flow, or increased reliance on leverage, including adverse balance sheet ratios, trade debt issues, etc.).\n● Any managerial or personal problems with company management, decline in the entire industry or local economic conditions, or failure to\nprovide financial information or other documentation as requested.\n● Issues regarding delinquency, overdrafts, or renewals.\n● Any other issues that cause concern for the company.\n● Loans to individuals or loans supported by guarantors with marginal net worth and/or marginal collateral.\n● Weaknesses that are identified are short-term in nature.\n● Loans in this category are usually accounts the Bank would want to retain providing a positive turnaround can be expected within a reasonable\ntime frame. Grade 4(W) loans are considered Pass.\n5. Special Mention Loan - A special mention extension of credit is defined as having potential weaknesses that deserve management’s close attention. If left\nuncorrected, these potential weaknesses may, at some future date result in the deterioration of the repayment prospects for the credit or the institution’s credit\nposition. Extensions of credit that might be detailed in this category include the following:\n● The lending officer may be unable to properly supervise the credit because of an inadequate loan or credit agreement.\n● Questions exist regarding the condition of and/or control over collateral.\n● Economic or market conditions may unfavorably affect the obligor in the future.\n● A declining trend in the obligor’s operations or an imbalanced position in the balance sheet exists, but not to the point that repayment is\njeopardized.\n6. Substandard Loan - A “substandard” extension of credit is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the\ncollateral pledged, if any. Extensions of credit so classified must have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They\nare characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Loss potential, while existing in the\naggregate amount of substandard credits, does not have to exist in individual extensions of credit classified as substandard.\n7. Doubtful Loan - An extension of credit classified as “doubtful” has all the weaknesses inherent in one classified substandard, with the added characteristic\nthat the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.\nThe possibility of loss is extremely high but because of certain important and reasonably specific pending factors that may work to the advantage of and\nstrengthen the credit, its classification as an estimated loss is deferred until its more exact status may be determined. Pending factors may include a proposed\nmerger or acquisition, liquidation proceedings, capital injection, perfecting liens on additional collateral or refinancing plans. The entire loan need not be\nclassified as doubtful when collection of a specific portion appears highly probable.\n8. Loss - Extensions of credit classified as “loss” are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as bankable assets is not warranted.\nThis classification does not mean that the credit has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather that it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off,\neven though partial recovery may be affected in the future. It should not be the Company’s practice to attempt long-term recoveries while the credit remains on\nthe books. Losses should be taken in the period in which they surface as uncollectible.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there are no loans that are classified with risk grades of 8- Loss.\nThe risk grades are reviewed every month, at a minimum and on an as-needed basis depending on the specific circumstances of the loan.\n14\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes loan risk grade totals by class and year of origination as of September 30, 2024.

As noted in Note 2, as required by ASU 2016-13, on January 1, 2023 the Company implemented CECL and increased\nour ACL, previously the allowance for loan losses, with a $346,000 cumulative adjustment. Under ASU 2016-13, the allowance for credit losses is a valuation\naccount that is deducted from the related loan’s amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loans. The measurement of\nexpected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable\nforecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. The Company’s ACL is calculated monthly, with any difference in the calculated ACL and the\nrecorded ACL trued-up through an entry to the provision for credit losses. Management calculates the quantitative portion of collectively evaluated reserves for\nall loan categories, using a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) methodology. For purposes of estimating the Company’s ACL, management generally evaluates\ncollectively evaluated loans by Federal Call code in order to group loans with similar risk characteristics together, however management has grouped loans in\nselected call codes together in determining portfolio segments, due to similar risk characteristics and reserve methodologies used for certain call code\nclassifications.\nThe DCF quantitative reserve methodology incorporates the consideration of probability of default (“PD”) and loss given default (“LGD”) estimates to\nestimate periodic losses. The PD estimates are derived through the application of reasonable and supportable economic forecasts to call code specific\nregression models, derived from the consideration of historical bank-specific and peer loss-rate data. The loss rate data has been regressed against benchmark\neconomic indicators, for which reasonable and supportable forecasts exist, in the development of the call-code specific regression models. Regression models\nare generally refreshed on an annual basis, in order to pull in more recent loss rate data. Reasonable and supportable forecasts of the selected economic metric\nare then input into the regression model to calculate an expected default rate. The expected default rates are then applied to expected monthly loan balances\nestimated through the consideration of contractual repayment terms and expected prepayments. The Company utilizes a four-quarter forecast period, after\nwhich the expected default rates revert to the historical average for each call code, over a four-quarter reversion period, on a straight-line basis. The prepayment\nassumptions applied to expected cash flow over the contractual life of the loans are estimated based on historical, bank-specific experience, peer data and the\nconsideration of current and expected conditions and circumstances including the level of interest rates. The prepayment assumptions may be updated by\nManagement in the event that changing conditions impact Management’s estimate or additional historical data gathered has resulted in the need for a\nreevaluation. LGD utilized in the DCF is derived from the application of the Frye-Jacobs theory which relates LGD to PD based on historical peer data, as\ncalculated by a third-party. The call code regression models utilized upon implementation of CECL on January 1, 2023, and as of September 30, 2024, were\nidentical, and relied upon reasonable and supportable forecasts of the National Unemployment Rate. Some of the call code regression models also use the Real\nGross Domestic Product. Management selected the National Unemployment Rate and the Real Gross Domestic Product as the drivers of quantitative portion of\ncollectively reserves on loan classes reliant upon the DCF methodology, primarily as a result of high correlation coefficients identified in regression modeling,\nthe availability of forecasts including the quarterly FOMC forecast, and given the widespread familiarity of stakeholders with this economic metric.\nManagement recognizes that there are additional factors impacting risk of loss in the loan portfolio beyond what is captured in the quantitative portion of\nreserves on collectively evaluated loans. As current and expected conditions, may vary compared with conditions over the historical lookback period, which is\nutilized in the calculation of quantitative reserves, management considers whether additional or reduced reserve levels on collectively evaluated loans may be\nwarranted given the consideration of a variety of qualitative factors. Several of the following qualitative factors (“Q-factors”) considered by management\nreflect the legacy regulatory guidance on Q-factors, whereas several others represent factors unique to the Company or unique to the current time period.\n● Changes in lending policies and procedures, including changes in underwriting standards and collection, charge-off, and recovery practices\n● Changes in international, regional and local economic and business conditions, and developments that affect the collectability of the portfolio, as\nreflected in forecasts of the California unemployment rate\n● Changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio\n● Changes in the experience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff\n● Changes in the volume and severity of past due, watch loans and classified loans\n● Changes in the quality of the Bank’s loan review processes\n● Changes in the value of underlying collateral for loans not identified as collateral dependent\n● Changes in loan categorization concentrations\n● Other external factors, which include, the regulatory risk ratings.\nThe qualitative portion of the Company’s reserves on collectively evaluated loans are calculated using a combination of numeric frameworks and management\njudgement, to determine risk categorizations in each of the Q-factors presented above. The amount of qualitative reserves is also contingent upon the relative\nweighting of Q-factors according to management’s judgement.\n17\nTable of Contents\nLoans identified as losses by management, internal loan review and/or bank examiners are charged-off. Furthermore, consumer loan accounts are charged-off\nautomatically based on regulatory requirements.\nAccrued interest receivable for loans is included in the “Interest receivable and other assets” line item on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The\nCompany elected not to measure an allowance for accrued interest receivable and instead elected to reverse accrued interest income on loans that are placed on\nnonaccrual status. The Company believes this policy results in the timely reversal of uncollectible interest.\nThe following table details activity in the ACL by portfolio segment for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Allocation of a\nportion of the allowance to one category of loans does not preclude its availability to absorb losses in other categories.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nFor the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\n(in thousands)\nCRE CRE CRE CRE Commercial\nThree Months Ended Construction Multi- Owner Non-owner CRE and\nSeptember 30, 2024 & Land family occupied occupied Farmland Industrial Consumer Agriculture Total\nBeginning balance $ 909 $ 666 $ 1,856 $ 4,764 $ 1,409 $ 1,177 $ 239 $ 101 $ 11,121\nCharge-offs 0 0 0 0 0 0 (14) 0 (14)\nRecoveries 1,988 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 1,992\n(Reversal of) provision for\ncredit losses (2,294) (219) (347) 1,282 300 (282) (64) 4 (1,620)\nEnding balance $ 603 $ 447 $ 1,509 $ 6,046 $ 1,709 $ 895 $ 165 $ 105 $ 11,479\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024\nBeginning balance $ 1,227 $ 667 $ 1,805 $ 4,805 $ 1,468 $ 650 $ 227 $ 47 $ 10,896\nCharge-offs 0 0 0 0 0 0 (39) 0 (39)\nRecoveries 2,230 0 0 0 0 0 12 0 2,242\n(Reversal of) provision for\ncredit losses (2,854) (220) (296) 1,241 241 245 (35) 58 (1,620)\nEnding balance $ 603 $ 447 $ 1,509 $ 6,046 $ 1,709 $ 895 $ 165 $ 105 $ 11,479\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2023\nBeginning balance $ 578 $ 514 $ 1,944 $ 4,628 $ 901 $ 600 $ 207 $ 39 $ 9,411\nCharge-offs 0 0 0 0 0 0 (11) 0 (11)\nRecoveries 35 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 38\nProvision for (reversal of)\ncredit losses 179 108 (189) (195) 478 (73) (7) (1) 300\nEnding balance $ 792 $ 622 $ 1,755 $ 4,433 $ 1,379 $ 527 $ 192 $ 38 9,738\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2023\nBeginning balance $ 1,055 $ 479 $ 1,798 $ 4,211 $ 830 $ 612 $ 311 $ 172 $ 9,468\nCECL day-one adjustments 338 23 103 25 12 102 (120) (137) 346\nCharge-offs 0 0 0 0 0 (12) (28) 0 (40)\nRecoveries 103 0 0 0 0 12 9 0 124\n(Reversal of) provision for\ncredit losses (704) 120 (146) 197 537 (187) 20 3 (160)\nEnding balance $ 792 $ 622 $ 1,755 $ 4,433 $ 1,379 $ 527 $ 192 $ 38 $ 9,738\nThe loan recoveries of $1,992,000 recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of two loans to different borrowers, both of which\ndate back to the recession period approximately 15 years ago in which collateral values were considerably depressed.

Then, a historic loss rate as computed by our CECL model is applied to the\nestimated average outstanding balance to calculate the off-balance-sheet reserve amount. The funding rates, historic loss rates and resulting reserve amount for\noff-balance-sheet commitments are evaluated by management periodically as part of the CECL procedures. Reserves for off-balance-sheet commitments are\nrecorded in interest payable and other liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, loans carried at $1,075,136,000 and $1,016,579,000, respectively, were pledged as collateral on advances from\nthe Federal Home Loan Bank.\n20\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 5 — FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nFair values of financial instruments — The condensed consolidated financial statements include various estimated fair value information as of September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023. Such information, which pertains to the Company’s financial instruments, does not purport to represent the aggregate net fair\nvalue of the Company. Further, the fair value estimates are based on various assumptions, methodologies, and subjective considerations, which vary widely\namong different financial institutions and which are subject to change.\nWe determine the fair values of our financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy established under applicable accounting guidance which requires an\nentity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value:\nLevel 1: Inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2: Inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs that are observable for the\nasset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.\nLevel 3: Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.\nIn certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value\nhierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value\nmeasurement in its entirety. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment\nand considers factors specific to the asset or liability. Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are recognized on the actual date of the event or\ncircumstance that caused the transfer, which generally corresponds with the Company’s quarterly valuation process. There were no transfers between levels\nduring the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nThe estimated fair values of the Company’s financial instruments not measured at fair value as of September 30, 2024 were as follows:\nHierarchy\n(in thousands) Carrying Fair Valuation\nAmount Value Level\nFinancial assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 213,907 $ 213,907 1\nRestricted equity securities 6,285 6,285 2\nLoans, net 1,062,230 989,539 3\nInterest receivable 8,085 8,085 2\nFinancial liabilities:\nDeposits (1,690,301) (1,689,844) 3\nInterest payable (232) (232) 2\nOff-balance-sheet liabilities:\nCommitments and standby letters of credit (1,766) 3\n21\nTable of Contents\nThe estimated fair values of the Company’s financial instruments not measured at fair value as of December 31, 2023 were as follows:\nHierarchy\n(in thousands) Carrying Fair Valuation\nAmount Value Level\nFinancial assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 216,568 $ 216,568 1\nRestricted equity securities 5,956 5,956 2\nLoans, net 1,004,277 917,242 3\nInterest receivable 8,386 8,386 2\nFinancial liabilities:\nDeposits (1,650,534) (1,649,808) 3\nInterest payable (128) (128) 2\nOff-balance-sheet assets (liabilities):\nCommitments and standby letters of credit (1,863) 3\nThe following tables present the carrying value of recurring and nonrecurring financial instruments that were measured at fair value and that were still held in\nthe condensed consolidated balance sheets at each respective period end, by level within the fair value hierarchy as of September 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023.\nFair Value Measurements as of September 30, 2024 Using\nQuoted Prices Significant\nin Active Other Significant\nMarkets for Observable Unobservable\nSeptember 30, Identical Assets Inputs Inputs\n(in thousands) 2024 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nAssets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis:\nAvailable-for-sale securities:\nU.S. agencies $ 93,982 $ 0 $ 93,982 $ 0\nCollateralized mortgage obligations 26,098 0 26,098 0\nMunicipalities 306,212 0 306,212 0\nSBA pools 940 0 940 0\nCorporate debt 41,033 0 41,033 0\nAsset-backed securities 49,067 0 49,067 0\nEquity Securities:\nMutual fund $ 3,274 $ 3,274 $ 0 $ 0\nAssets and liabilities measured on a non-recurring basis: N/A\n22\nTable of Contents\nFair Value Measurements at December 31, 2023 Using\nQuoted Prices Significant\nin Active Other Significant\nMarkets for Observable Unobservable\nDecember 31, Identical Assets Inputs Inputs\n(in thousands) 2023 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nAssets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis:\nAvailable-for-sale securities:\nU.S. agencies $ 80,259 $ 0 $ 80,259 $ 0\nCollateralized mortgage obligations 8,664 0 8,664 0\nMunicipalities 328,908 0 328,908 0\nSBA pools 1,395 0 1,395 0\nCorporate debt 43,517 0 43,517 0\nAsset backed securities 55,335 0 55,335 0\nEquity Securities:\nMutual fund $ 3,132 $ 3,132 $ 0 $ 0\nAssets and liabilities measured on a non-recurring basis: N/A\nAvailable-for-sale and equity securities - Investment securities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value measurement is based upon quoted\nmarket prices, if available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are measured using independent pricing models or other model-based valuation\ntechniques such as the present value of future cash flows, adjusted for the security’s credit rating, prepayment assumptions, and other factors such as credit loss\nassumptions. Level 1 securities include those traded on an active exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange, U.S. Treasury securities that are traded by\ndealers or brokers in active over-the-counter markets and money market funds. Level 2 securities include mortgage-backed securities issued by government\nsponsored entities, municipal bonds and corporate debt securities. Securities classified as Level 3 include asset-backed securities in less liquid markets where\nsignificant inputs are unobservable.\nLoans Evaluated Individually - The Company does not record portfolio loans at fair value on a recurring basis. However, periodically, a loan is evaluated\nindividually and is reported at the fair value of the underlying collateral, less estimated costs to sell, if repayment is expected solely from the collateral. If the\ncollateral value is not sufficient, a specific reserve is recorded. Collateral values are estimated using a combination of observable inputs, including recent\nappraisals, and unobservable inputs based on customized discounting criteria. Due to the significance of unobservable inputs, fair values of individually\nevaluated collateral dependent loans have been classified as Level 3.\nThere have been no significant changes in the valuation techniques during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024.\nNOTE 6 – EARNINGS PER SHARE\nEarnings per share (“EPS”) are based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each year. The following table shows: (1)\nweighted average basic shares, (2) effect of dilutive securities related to non-vested restricted stock, and (3) weighted average shares of common stock and\ncommon stock equivalents. Net income available to common stockholders is calculated as net income reduced by dividends accumulated on preferred stock, if\nany. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during\neach period, excluding unvested restricted stock awards. Diluted EPS is calculated using the weighted average diluted shares, which reflects the potential\ndilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock. The dilutive shares included in\nyear-to-date diluted EPS is a weighted average of the dilutive shares included in each quarterly diluted EPS computation under the treasury stock method. The\nCompany has two forms of outstanding common stock: fully vested common stock and unvested restricted stock awards. Holders of restricted stock awards\nreceive non-forfeitable dividends at the same rate as common stockholders and they both share equally in undistributed earnings. Therefore, under the two-\nclass method the difference in EPS is not significant for these participating securities.\n23\nTable of Contents\nThe Company’s calculation of basic and diluted EPS for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are reflected in the tables\nbelow.\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023\nBASIC EARNINGS PER SHARE\nNet income $ 7,324 $ 7,354\nWeighted average shares outstanding 8,221 8,197\nNet income per common share $ 0.89 $ 0.90\nDILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE\nNet income $ 7,324 $ 7,354\nWeighted average shares outstanding 8,221 8,197\nEffect of dilutive non-vested restricted shares 43 35\nWeighted average shares of common stock and common stock equivalents 8,264 8,232\nNet income per diluted common share $ 0.89 $ 0.89\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023\nBASIC EARNINGS PER SHARE\nNet income $ 18,940 $ 24,983\nWeighted average shares outstanding 8,217 8,192\nNet income per common share $ 2.30 $ 3.05\nDILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE\nNet income $ 18,940 $ 24,983\nWeighted average shares outstanding 8,217 8,192\nEffect of dilutive non-vested restricted shares 35 37\nWeighted average shares of common stock and common stock equivalents 8,252 8,229\nNet income per diluted common share $ 2.30 $ 3.04\n24\nTable of Contents\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain matters discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation\nReform Act of 1995 and therefore may involve risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the Company’s actual results to be materially different\nfrom the results expressed or implied by the Company’s forward-looking statements. These statements generally appear with words such as “will,”\n“anticipate,” “target,” “believe,” “estimate,” “forecast”, “enhance,” “may,” “intend,” “plan,” “goal,” “believe, “forecast,” “project,” “outlook,” “expect” or\nother words of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements are not statements of historical fact and may include those that discuss, among others, our\nstrategies, goals, plans, outlook, forecasts, expectations, intentions or other non-historical matters; future operations, financial condition, results of operations,\nor business developments; and the assumptions that underlie these matters. Although management believes that the assumptions and expectations reflected in\nsuch forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Factors that could cause actual\nresults to differ from results discussed in forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: the credit exposure of certain loan products and other\ncomponents of our business that could be impacted by the changing economic and business conditions; changes in monetary, fiscal or tax policy to address\nchanging economic conditions including interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve Board, any of which could cause us to incur additional loan losses and\nadversely affect our results of operations in the future; economic conditions (both generally and in the markets where the Company operates) including\nunemployment levels, energy prices, increased energy costs in California, inflation, supply chain issues, a decline in housing prices or collateral values and the\nrisk of a recession or slowed economic growth in the United States economy; the continuing impact of the changing economic conditions on our employees and\ncustomers, including consumer income, creditworthiness, confidence, spending and savings; the credit quality of borrowers; increasing geopolitical instability,\nincluding the war between Russia and Ukraine and the impact of sanctions; the success of our efforts to mitigate the impact of the changing economic\nconditions; competition from other providers of financial services offered by the Company and our response to competitive pressures; changes in government\nregulation and legislation; the impact of any failure by the U.S. government to increase the debt ceiling or any federal government shutdown; changes in\ninterest rates and interest rate fluctuations; volatility in the capital markets; the amount and rate of deposit growth and changes in deposit costs; material\nunforeseen changes in the financial stability and liquidity of the Company’s credit customers; risks associated with concentrations in real estate related loans;\nour ability to maintain adequate capital or liquidity levels or to comply with revised capital or liquidity requirements; changes in accounting standards and\ninterpretations; changes in the level and direction of loan delinquencies and write-offs and changes in estimates of the adequacy of the allowance for credit\nlosses; the soundness of other financial institutions, including disruptions, instability and failures in the banking industry; physical or transition risks related to\nclimate change; cybersecurity risks and heightened legislative and regulatory focus on cybersecurity and data privacy; and other risks as may be detailed from\ntime to time in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, all of which are difficult to predict and which may be beyond the control\nof the Company. Many of the foregoing risks and uncertainties are, and will be, exacerbated by the worsening of the global business and economic\nenvironment. The Company undertakes no obligation to revise forward-looking statements to reflect events or changes after the date of this discussion or to\nreflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.\nForward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the Company does not undertake to update forward-looking statements to reflect\ncircumstances or events that occur after the date the forward-looking statements are made, whether as a result of new information, future developments or\notherwise, except as may be required by law.\nThe following discussion explains the significant factors affecting the Company’s operations and financial position for the periods presented. The discussion\nshould be read in conjunction with the Company’s financial statements and the notes related thereto which appear or that are referenced to elsewhere in this\nreport, and with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in the Company’s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Average\nbalances, including balances used in calculating certain financial ratios, are generally comprised of average daily balances.\nThe discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Company’s financial statements, which have been\nprepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires\nmanagement to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of\ncontingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Company’s financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or\nconditions. This discussion and analysis includes management’s insight of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations of Oak Valley Bancorp\nand its subsidiary. Unless otherwise stated, the “Company” refers to the consolidated entity, Oak Valley Bancorp, while the “Bank” refers to Oak Valley\nCommunity Bank.\nIntroduction\nOak Valley Bancorp is the bank holding company for its sole subsidiary, Oak Valley Community Bank, a community bank in the general commercial banking\nbusiness. Our primary market encompasses the California Central Valley around Sacramento, Stockton, Modesto, and the Eastern Sierras. Eastern Sierra\nCommunity Bank operates as a division of and is a part of Oak Valley Community Bank, for the branches located in Mammoth Lakes, Bridgeport and Bishop.\nAs such, unless otherwise noted, all references are about Oak Valley Bancorp.\n25\nTable of Contents\nOak Valley Community Bank (the “Bank”) is an insured bank under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and is a member of the Federal Reserve. Since its\nformation, the Bank has provided basic banking services to individuals and business enterprises in Oakdale, California and the surrounding areas. The focus of\nthe Bank is to offer a range of commercial banking services designed for both individuals and small to medium-sized businesses in the Central Valley and the\nEastern Sierras.\nThe Bank offers a complement of business checking and savings accounts for its business customers. The Bank also offers commercial and real estate loans, as\nwell as lines of credit. Real estate loans are generally of a short-term nature for both residential and commercial purposes. Longer-term real estate loans are\ngenerally made with adjustable interest rates and contain normal provisions for acceleration. In addition, the Bank offers traditional residential mortgages\nthrough a third party.\nThe Bank also offers other services for both individuals and businesses including online banking, remote deposit capture, merchant services, night depository,\nextended hours, traveler’s checks, wire transfer of funds, note collection, and automated teller machines in a national network. The Bank does not currently\noffer international banking or trust services although the Bank may make such services available to the Bank’s customers through financial institutions with\nwhich the Bank has correspondent banking relationships. The Bank does not offer stock transfer services, nor does it directly issue credit cards.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nCritical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that involve a significant level of\nestimation and uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We consider an\naccounting estimate to be critical to our financial results if (i) the accounting estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that are highly\nuncertain, (ii) management could have applied different assumptions during the reported period, and (iii) changes in the accounting estimate are reasonably\nlikely to occur in the future and could have a material impact on our financial statements. Management has determined the following accounting estimates and\nrelated policies to be critical:\nGoodwill Impairment - The Company applies a qualitative analysis of conditions in order to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying value is\nimpaired. In the event that the qualitative analysis suggests that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired, the Company uses several quantitative\nvaluation methodologies in evaluating goodwill for impairment that includes assumptions and estimates made concerning the future earnings potential of the\norganization, and a market-based approach that looks at values for organizations of comparable size, structure and business model.\nEstimates of fair value are based on a complex model using, among other things, estimated cash flows and industry pricing multiples. The Company tests its\ngoodwill for impairment annually as of December 31 (the Measurement Date), and quarterly if a triggering event causes concern of a possible goodwill\nimpairment charge. At each Measurement Date, the Company, in accordance with ASC 350-20-35-3, evaluates, based on the weight of evidence, the\nsignificance of all qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each of the reporting units is less than its carrying\namount.\nThe assessment of qualitative factors at the most recent Measurement Date (December 31, 2023), indicated that it was not more likely than not that impairment\nexisted; as a result, no further testing was performed.\nAllowance for Credit Losses - Credit risk is inherent in the business of lending and making commercial loans. Accounting for our allowance for credit losses\ninvolves significant judgment and assumptions by management and is based on historical data as well as reasonable and supportable forecasts of future events.\nAt least on a quarterly basis, our management reviews the methodology and adequacy of allowance for credit losses and reports its assessment to the Board of\nDirectors for its review and approval.\nThe allowance for credit losses is an estimate dependent upon many factors, including loan growth, net charge-offs, changes in the composition of the loans,\nqualitative factors, the valuation of problem loans and the general economic conditions in our market area. See Note 2 and Note 4 to the consolidated financial\nstatements, and the “Provision for Credit Losses” and “Allowance for Credit Losses” sections of this discussion and analysis for more information on the\nestablishment of the Allowance for Credit Losses and the implementation of CECL.\nIncome Taxes - Deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and\nliabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or\nliabilities are expected to be realized or settled using the liability method. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are\nadjusted through the provision for income taxes.\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and the State of California. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or\nlocal income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2020.\n26\nTable of Contents\nFair Value Measurements - We use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value\ndisclosures. We base our fair values on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market\nparticipants at the measurement date. Securities available for sale, derivatives, and loans held for sale, if any, are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis.\nAdditionally, from time to time, we may be required to record certain assets at fair value on a non-recurring basis, such as certain impaired loans held for\ninvestment and securities held to maturity that are other-than-temporarily impaired. These non-recurring fair value adjustments typically involve write-downs\nof individual assets due to application of lower-of-cost or market accounting.\nWe have established and documented a process for determining fair value. We maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable\ninputs when developing fair value measurements. Whenever there is no readily available market data, management uses its best estimate and assumptions in\ndetermining fair value, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. As a result, if other assumptions had\nbeen used, our recorded earnings or disclosures could have been materially different from those reflected in these financial statements. For detailed information\non our use of fair value measurements and our related valuation methodologies, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements Item 1 of this report.\nOverview of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nThe purpose of this summary is to provide an overview of the items that management focuses on when evaluating the condition of the Company and its success\nin implementing its business and shareholder value strategies. The Company’s business strategy is to operate the Bank as a well-capitalized, profitable and\nindependent community-oriented bank. The Company’s shareholder value strategy has three major objectives: (1) enhancing shareholder value; (2) making its\nretail banking franchise more valuable; and (3) efficiently utilizing its capital.\nManagement believes the following were important factors in the Company’s performance during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024:\n• The Company recognized net income of $7,324,000 and $18,940,000 for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as\ncompared to $7,354,000 and $24,983,000 for the same periods in 2023. The net income decreases were mainly due to higher interest rates on deposit\naccounts, and an increase in operating expenses.\n• The Company recorded a credit loss provision reversal of $1,620,000 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to\ncredit loss provisions of $300,000 and a reversal of $160,000 during the comparable periods of 2023, mainly due to loan recoveries totaling\n$1,992,000, as described below.\n• Net interest income decreased $1,283,000 and $5,700,000 for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to\nthe same periods in 2023. The net interest income decrease was mainly due to an increase in interest expense on deposit accounts.\n• Non-interest income increased by $280,000 and $249,000 for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared\nto the same periods in 2023. The increases were primarily due to unrealized fair value gains on equity securities, and a positive variance in investment\nadvisory service fees.\n• Non-interest expense increased by $746,000 and $4,072,000 for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as\ncompared to the same periods in 2023. The increase was primarily due to staffing increases and overhead related to servicing the growing business\nportfolios.\n• Total assets increased by $58,033,000 or 3.1%, total net loans increased by $57,953,000 or 5.8% and investment securities decreased by $604,000 or\n0.1% in each case from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024, while deposits increased by $39,767,000 or 2.4% for the same period.\nConsequently, cash and cash equivalent balances decreased by $2,661,000 or 1.2%.\n27\nTable of Contents\nIncome Summary\nFor the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded net income of $7,324,000 and $18,940,000, respectively, representing\ndecreases of $30,000 and $6,043,000, as compared to the same periods in 2023. Return on average assets (annualized) was 1.56% and 1.38% for the three and\nnine-months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to 1.57% and 1.76% for the same periods in 2023. Annualized return on average common\nequity was 16.54% and 14.90% for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to 19.85% and 23.71% for the same\nperiods in 2023. Net income before provisions for income taxes increased by $171,000 and decreased by $8,063,000 for the three and nine-month periods\nended September 30, 2024, respectively, from the same periods in 2023. The income statement components of these variances are as follows:\nPre-Tax Income Variance Summary:\nEffect on Pre-Tax Effect on Pre-Tax\nIncome Income\n(In thousands) Increase (Decrease) Increase (Decrease)\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2024\nChange from 2023 to 2024 in:\nNet interest income $ (1,283) $ (5,700)\nProvision for credit losses 1,920 1,460\nNon-interest income 280 249\nNon-interest expense (746) (4,072)\nChange in net income before income taxes $ 171 $ (8,063)\nThese variances will be explained in the discussion below.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income is the largest source of the Company’s operating income. For the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, net interest\nincome was $17,655,000 and $52,188,000, respectively, which represents decreases of $1,283,000 and $5,700,000, from the comparable periods in 2023. The\ndecrease was due to rising interest rates on deposit accounts, as the average cost of funds increased to 0.83% and 0.75% for the three and nine-months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to 0.33% and 0.20% in the same periods of 2023. The Company has increased rates on certain accounts and\ndeposit products in order to remain competitive to our peer group and to maintain current liquidity levels, which remains at a high level.\nThe net interest margin (net interest income as a percentage of average interest earning assets) was 4.04% and 4.08% for the three and nine-month periods\nended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to 4.34% and 4.39% for the same periods in 2023. The decrease in net interest margin is primarily due to\nthe rising interest rates on deposit accounts, as discussed above.\nThe FOMC increased rates in 2022 and 2023 and kept interest rates elevated until a recent rate cut in September of 2024. The higher interest rates have\ncontinued to have a positive impact on repricing of earning asset yields, which partially offset the higher cost of funds. The earning asset yield increased by 17\nand 20 basis points for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods of 2023.\n28\nTable of

Changes in earning asset yields and rates on interest-bearing liabilities resulted in a decrease\nof $949,000 to net interest income, over the same period. This decrease was mainly due to higher interest rates paid on deposit accounts.\n31\nTable of Contents\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nCompared to September 30, 2023\nIncrease (Decrease)\nin interest income and expense\n(in thousands) due to changes in:\nVolume Rate Total\nInterest income:\nGross loans (1) (2) $ 3,949 $ 2,586 $ 6,535\nInvestment securities (2) (667) 109 (558)\nFederal funds sold 121 87 208\nInterest-earning deposits (6,054) 405 (5,649)\nTotal interest income $ (2,651) $ 3,187 $ 536\nInterest expense:\nInterest-earning DDA $ (33) $ 832 $ 799\nMoney market deposits 10 4,219 4,229\nSavings deposits (16) 48 32\nTime deposits $250,000 and under 172 861 1,033\nTime deposits over $250,000 61 483 544\nTotal interest expense $ 194 $ 6,443 $ 6,637\nChange in net interest income $ (2,845) $ (3,256) $ (6,101)\n(1) Loan fees have been included in the calculation of interest income.\n(2) Interest income on municipal securities and loans has been adjusted to their fully-taxable equivalents, based on a federal marginal tax rate of 21.0%.\nThe table above reflects a decrease of $2,845,000 in net interest income due to changes in volume combined with the overall change in mix of balances during\nthe first nine months of 2024, as compared to the same period of 2023. Changes in earning asset yields and rates on interest-bearing liabilities resulted in a\ndecrease of $3,256,000 to net interest income, over the same period. This decrease was mainly due to higher interest rates paid on deposit accounts.\nProvision for Credit Losses\nThe Company makes provisions for credit losses when required to bring the total allowance for credit losses to a level deemed appropriate for the level of risk\nin the loan portfolio. At least quarterly, management conducts an assessment of the overall quality of the loan portfolio and general economic trends in the\nlocal market. The determination of the appropriate level for the allowance is based on that review, considering such factors as historical experience, the volume\nand type of lending conducted, the amount of and identified potential loss associated with specific non-performing loans, regulatory policies, general economic\nconditions, and other factors, including reasonable and supportable forecasts, related to the collectability of loans in the portfolio.\nThe Company recorded a reversal of provisions for credit losses of $1,620,000 during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, as\ncompared to provisions of $300,000 and provision reversals of $160,000 during the same periods of 2023, as determined by the output of our CECL internal\ncredit risk model. Loan recoveries totaled $2.0 million during the third quarter of 2024, which consisted of two loans that dated back to the recession. The net\nimpact of the $2.0 million loan recoveries and the $358,000 increase in the ACL calculation resulted in the reversal of ACL provisions totaling $1.62 million.\nCredit quality remained strong with non-accrual loans remaining at a zero balance throughout the nine-month period ending September 30, 2024. Management\nwill continue to closely monitor the credit risks to our loan portfolio and may need to make qualitative adjustments depending on factors that may impact the\neconomy and the financial condition of our borrowers.\n32\nTable of Contents\nNon-Interest Income\nNon-interest income represents service charges on deposit accounts and other non-interest related charges and fees, including fees from mortgage commissions\nand investment service fee income. For the three and nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, non-interest income was $1,846,000 and $5,125,000,\nrespectively, representing an increase of $280,000 or 17.9% and $249,000 or 5.1%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023.\nThe following tables show the major components of non-interest income:\n(in thousands) For the Three Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nService charges on deposits $ 437 $ 488 $ (51) -10.5%\nDebit card transaction fee income 436 459 (23) -5.0%\nEarnings on cash surrender value of life insurance 287 196 91 46.4%\nMortgage commissions 7 6 1 16.7%\nGains on calls of available-for-sale securities 0 13 (13) -100.0%\nOther income 679 404 275 68.1%\nTotal non-interest income $ 1,846 $ 1,566 $ 280 17.9%\n(in thousands) For the Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nService charges on deposits $ 1,255 $ 1,365 $ (110) -8.1%\nDebit card transaction fee income 1,297 1,322 (25) -1.9%\nEarnings on cash surrender value of life insurance 764 578 186 32.2%\nMortgage commissions 21 14 7 50.0%\nGains on sales and calls of available-for-sale securities 114 156 (42) -26.9%\nOther income 1,674 1,441 233 16.2%\nTotal non-interest income $ 5,125 $ 4,876 $ 249 5.1%\nService charges on deposits decreased by $51,000 and $110,000 for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same\nperiods in 2023.

The decrease is attributable to normal fluctuations in electronic payment methods.\nEarnings on cash surrender value of life insurance increased by $91,000 and $186,000 for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024, respectively,\ncompared to the same periods in 2023, corresponding to higher yields earned in 2024 and three additional policies that were purchased during the second\nquarter of 2024.\nMortgage commissions increased by $1,000 and $7,000 for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods of 2023.\nOverall, the demand for home purchases and refinancing has decreased in 2023 and 2024 compared to prior years, mainly due to higher interest rates.\nGains on sales and calls of available-for-sale securities decreased by $13,000 and $42,000 for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, as there was eighteen securities sold during the first nine months of 2024, compared to twenty-four\nsecurities sold during the same period of 2023.\nOther income increased by $275,000 and $233,000 for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same\nperiods of 2023, mainly due to higher production from investment advisory services, and positive changes in the fair value of one equity security.\n33\nTable of Contents\nNon-Interest Expense\nNon-interest expense represents salaries and benefits, occupancy expenses, professional expenses, outside services, and other miscellaneous expenses\nnecessary to conduct business.\nThe following tables show the major components of non-interest expenses:\n(in thousands) For the Three Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nSalaries and employee benefits $ 7,177 $ 6,505 $ 672 10.3%\nOccupancy expenses 1,137 1,149 (12) -1.0%\nData processing fees 659 788 (129) -16.4%\nRegulatory assessments (FDIC & DFPI) 240 305 (65) -21.3%\nOther operating expenses 2,111 1,831 280 15.3%\nTotal non-interest expense $ 11,324 $ 10,578 $ 746 7.1%\n(in thousands) For the Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nSalaries and employee benefits $ 21,700 $ 19,280 $ 2,420 12.6%\nOccupancy expenses 3,432 3,467 (35) -1.0%\nData processing fees 2,099 2,018 81 4.0%\nRegulatory assessments (FDIC & DFPI) 790 720 70 9.7%\nOther operating expenses 6,448 4,912 1,536 31.3%\nTotal non-interest expense $ 34,469 $ 30,397 $ 4,072 13.4%\nNon-interest expenses increased by $746,000 or 7.1% and $4,072,000 or 13.4% for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as\ncompared to the same periods of 2023. Salaries and employee benefits increased by $672,000 and $2,420,000 for the three and nine-months ended September\n30, 2024, as compared to the same periods of 2023, mainly due to additional staffing expense required to support the continued growth of our business\nportfolios.\nOccupancy expenses decreased by $12,000 and $35,000 for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same\nperiods of 2023, due to a decline in fixed asset depreciation and general operating costs related to branch facilities.\nData processing fees decreased by $129,000 and increased by $81,000 for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as\ncompared to the same periods of 2023. The QTD decreases were related to online banking upgrades during the third quarter of 2023. YTD increases were\nprimarily due to servicing costs on the growing number of loan and deposit accounts.\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) and California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (“DFPI”) regulatory assessments decreased\nby $65,000 and increased by $70,000 for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. The\nQTD decrease is related to a decline in average deposits compared to the prior year. The YTD increase was due to the FDIC increasing the base rate to 0.05%,\non an annual basis, for all member banks in order to build up the Deposit Insurance Fund. The FDIC adopted a final rule in June 2022, applicable to all insured\ndepository institutions, to increase initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules uniformly by 2 basis points, beginning in the first quarterly\nassessment period of 2023. The final rule became effective as of January 1, 2023, with an invoice payment date of June 30, 2023. The FDIC said that the\nincrease in assessment rate schedules is intended to increase the likelihood that the reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance fund reaches the statutory minimum\nof 1.35 percent by the statutory deadline of September 30, 2028. The final assessment rate for financial institutions is determined by making adjustments to the\nbase rate for various credit quality factors and other risk metrics of the institution as defined by the FDIC. The Company’s risk profile and the related\nassessment rate remains at a relatively low level due to our strong credit quality, earnings and risk-based capital ratios. Management recognizes that\nassessments could increase further depending on deposit growth throughout the remainder of 2024, as the FDIC assessment rates are applied to average\nquarterly total liabilities as the primary basis, and based on FDIC’s discretion to increase the base assessment rate as needed to replenish the Deposit Insurance\nFund. Moreover, the FDIC retains the authority and discretion to increase base assessment rates for banking entities in the future, as circumstances warrant.\nOther expense increased by $280,000 and $1,536,000 for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same\nperiods in 2023. The increase was mainly due to advertising expenses from a marketing campaign launched during the first quarter of 2024 to attract new\ncustomers, in combination with various general operating expense increases, which is expected given the expansion of the Company’s business portfolios.\nManagement anticipates that non-interest expense will continue to increase as the Company continues to grow. However, management remains committed to\ncost-control and efficiency, and expects to keep these increases to a minimum relative to growth.\n34\nTable of Contents\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company recorded provisions for income taxes of $2,473,000 and $5,524,000 for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively, representing an increase of $201,000 and a decrease of $2,020,000, compared to the provisions recorded in the comparable periods of 2023. The\neffective income tax rate on income from continuing operations was 25.2% and 22.6% for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024, respectively,\ncompared to 23.6% and 23.2% for the comparable periods of 2023. These provisions reflect accruals for taxes at the applicable rates for federal income tax and\nCalifornia franchise tax based upon reported pre-tax income, and adjusted for the effects of all permanent differences between income for tax and financial\nreporting purposes (such as earnings on qualified municipal securities, bank owned life insurance and certain tax-exempt loans). The disparity between the\neffective tax rates for the year-to-date period of 2023 as compared to 2024 is primarily due to tax credits from low-income housing projects as well as tax-free\nincome on municipal securities and loans that comprised a larger proportion of pre-tax income in 2024 as compared to 2023. The increase in the third quarter\neffective tax rate to 25.2% is related to cumulative YTD adjustments due to decreases in the balances of tax-exempt municipal investment securities.\nAsset Quality\nNon-performing assets consist of loans on non-accrual status, including loans restructured on non-accrual status, where the terms of repayment have been\nrenegotiated resulting in a reduction or deferral of interest or principal, loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest and other real estate owned\n(“OREO”).\nLoans are generally placed on non-accrual status when they become 90 days past due, unless management believes the loan is adequately collateralized and in\nthe process of collection. The past due loans may or may not be adequately collateralized, but collection efforts are continuously pursued. Loans may be\nrestructured by management when a borrower has experienced some changes in financial status, causing an inability to meet the original repayment terms, and\nwhere management believes the borrower will eventually overcome those circumstances and repay the loan in full. OREO consists of properties acquired by\nforeclosure or similar means and which management intends to offer for sale.\nNon-accrual loans totaled $0 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no loan\nmodifications pursuant to ASU 2022-02, and therefore there were no payment delinquencies on modified loans during the three and nine-months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no OREO properties. There were no sales, acquisitions or fair value adjustments of OREO\nproperties during the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nThe following table presents information about the Bank’s non-performing assets, including asset quality ratios as of September 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023:\nNon-Performing Assets\n(in thousands) September 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nLoans in non-accrual status $ 0 $ 0\nLoans past due 90 days or more and accruing 0 0\nTotal non-performing loans 0 0\nOther real estate owned 0 0\nTotal non-performing assets $ 0 $ 0\nAllowance for credit losses $ 11,479 $ 10,896\nAsset quality ratios:\nNon-performing assets to total assets 0.00% 0.00%\nNon-performing loans to total loans 0.00% 0.00%\nAllowance for credit losses to total loans 1.07% 1.07%\nAllowance for credit losses to total non-performing loans NA NA\nNon-performing assets remained at $0 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, due to strong credit quality within our loan portfolio.\n35\nTable of Contents\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nDue to credit risk inherent in the lending business, the Company routinely sets aside allowances through charges to earnings. Such charges are not only made\nfor the outstanding loan portfolio, but also for off-balance sheet items, such as commitments to extend credits or letters of credit. Charges for the outstanding\nloan portfolio have been credited to the allowance for credit losses, whereas charges for off-balance sheet items have been credited to the reserve for off-\nbalance sheet items, which is presented as a component of other liabilities. The Company recorded a reversal of credit loss provisions of $1,620,000 during the\nthree and nine-months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a provision of $300,000 and a provision reversal of $160,000 recorded during the same\nperiods of 2023. The Company recorded provision reversals of $44,000 and $122,000 for off-balance sheet items during the three and nine-months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to provision reversals of $84,000 and $506,000 recorded during the same periods of 2023.\nThe allowance for credit losses increased by $583,000 to $11,479,000 as of September 30, 2024, as compared to $10,896,000 as of December 31, 2023, due to\nnet loan recoveries of $2,242,000 during the first nine months of 2024. Recoveries totaled $1,992,000 during the third quarter of 2024, due to two loan\nrecoveries that dated back to the recession period and prior to a bank acquisition completed in 2015, from which one of the loans was acquired. The increases\nin the ACL and gross loans were consistent, and therefore the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans remained at 1.07% as of September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023.\nThe Company will continue to monitor the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses and make additions to the allowance in accordance with the analysis\nreferred to above. Because of uncertainties inherent in estimating the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses, actual results may differ from\nmanagement’s estimate of credit losses and the related allowance.\nThe Company makes provisions for credit losses when required to bring the total allowance for credit losses to a level deemed appropriate for the level of risk\nin the loan portfolio. At least quarterly, management conducts an assessment of the overall quality of the loan portfolio and general economic trends in the\nlocal market. The determination of the appropriate level for the allowance is based on that review, considering such factors as historical experience, the volume\nand type of lending conducted, the amount of and identified potential loss associated with specific non-performing loans, regulatory policies, general economic\nconditions, and other factors related to the collectability of loans in the portfolio.\nAlthough management believes the allowance as of September 30, 2024 was adequate to absorb expected credit losses from any known and inherent risks in\nthe portfolio, no assurance can be given that the adverse effect of current and future economic conditions on the Company’s service areas, or other variables,\nwill not result in increased losses in the loan portfolio in the future.\nInvestment Activities\nInvestments are a key source of interest income. Management of the investment portfolio is set in accordance with strategies developed and overseen by the\nCompany’s Investment Committee. Investment balances, including cash equivalents and interest-bearing deposits in other financial institutions, are subject to\nchange over time based on the Company’s asset/liability funding needs and interest rate risk management objectives. The Company’s liquidity levels take into\nconsideration anticipated future cash flows and all available sources of credits, and are maintained at levels management believes are appropriate to assure\nfuture flexibility in meeting anticipated funding needs.\nCash Equivalents\nThe Company holds federal funds sold, unpledged available-for-sale securities and salable government guaranteed loans to help meet liquidity requirements\nand provide temporary holdings until the funds can be otherwise deployed or invested. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company had\n$213,907,000 and $216,568,000, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents.\nInvestment Securities\nManagement of the investment securities portfolio focuses on providing an adequate level of liquidity and establishing an interest rate-sensitive position, while\nearning an adequate level of investment income without taking undue risk. Investment securities that the Company intends to hold until maturity are classified\nas held-to-maturity securities, and all other investment securities are classified as available-for-sale or equity securities. Currently, all of the investment\nsecurities are classified as available-for-sale except for one mutual fund classified as an equity security with a carrying value of $3,274,000 as of September 30,\n2024. The carrying values of available-for-sale investment securities are adjusted for unrealized gains or losses as a valuation allowance and any gain or loss is\nreported on an after-tax basis as a component of other comprehensive income. The carrying values of equity securities are adjusted for unrealized gains or\nlosses through noninterest income in the consolidated statement of income.\n36\nTable of Contents\nFor available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, management evaluates whether the decline in fair value is a reflection of credit deterioration\nor other factors. In performing this evaluation, management considers the extent which fair value has fallen below amortized cost, changes in ratings by rating\nagencies, and other information indicating a deterioration in repayment capacity of either the underlying issuer or the borrowers providing repayment capacity\nin a securitization. If management’s evaluation indicates that a credit loss exists then a present value of the expected cash flows is calculated and compared to\nthe amortized cost basis of the security in question and to the degree that the amortized cost basis exceeds the present value an allowance for credit loss\n(“ACL”) is established, with the caveat that the maximum amount of the reserve on any individual security is the difference between the fair value and\namortized cost balance of the security in question. Any unrealized loss that has not been recorded through an ACL is recognized in other comprehensive\nincome.\nThe unrealized losses are due primarily to rising market yields and not due to credit deterioration. As such, no ACL on available-for-sale securities has been\nestablished as of September 30, 2024. The Company does not intend to sell the securities and it is not likely that the Company will be required to sell the\nsecurities before the earlier of the forecasted recovery or the maturity of the underlying investment security.\nLow Income Housing Tax Credit Funds\nDuring 2018 and 2022, we committed to invest $5 million and $10.5 million, respectively, in low-income housing tax credit funds (“LIHTC”) to promote our\nparticipation in CRA activities, which had unfunded commitments of $7,164,000 and $9,781,000 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. For\nLIHTC investments, we receive the return in the form of tax credits and tax deductions over a period of approximately 15 years.\nDeposits\nTotal deposits as of September 30, 2024 were $1,690,301,000, an increase of $39,767,000 or 2.4% from the deposit total of $1,650,534,000 as of December 31,\n2023. Average deposits decreased by $84,279,000 to $1,640,761,000 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in\n2023.\nDeposits Outstanding\nSeptember 30, December 31, Nine Month Change\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 $ %\nDemand $ 1,084,660 $ 1,099,830 $ (15,170) (1.4%)\nMMDA 396,892 363,386 33,506 9.2%\nSavings 122,602 131,796 (9,194) (7.0%)\nTime < $250K 52,013 33,399 18,614 55.7%\nTime > $250K 34,134 22,123 12,011 54.3%\n$ 1,690,301 $ 1,650,534 $ 39,767 2.4%\nBecause the Company’s client base is comprised primarily of commercial and industrial accounts, individual account balances are generally higher than those\nof consumer-oriented banks. Five clients carry deposit balances of more than 1% of total deposits, one of which had a deposit balance of more than 3% of total\ndeposits as of September 30, 2024. Management believes that the Company’s funding concentration risk is not significant and is mitigated by the ample\nsources of funds the Bank has access to.\nThe YTD deposit increase is attributable to an advertising campaign that we launched in January 2024, in order to increase our market share of deposit\nbalances. The number of DDA checking accounts has increased over the prior nine months, demonstrating the effectiveness of this endeavor and that our core\ndeposit base has continued to expand. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section below for more information.\nSince the deposit growth strategy emphasizes core deposit growth, the Company has avoided relying on brokered deposits as a consistent source of funds. The\nCompany had no brokered deposits as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n37\nTable of Contents\nBorrowings\nAlthough deposits are the primary source of funds for lending and investment activities and for general business purposes, the Company may obtain advances\nfrom the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) as an alternative to retail deposit funds. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no\noutstanding FHLB advances or borrowings of any kind, as the Company continues to rely on deposit growth as its primary source of funding. See “Liquidity\nand Capital Resources” below for the details on the FHLB borrowings program.\nCapital Ratios\nThe Company is regulated by the Federal Reserve Bank (“FRB”) and is subject to the securities registration and public reporting regulations of the Securities\nand Exchange Commission. As a California state-chartered bank, the Company’s banking subsidiary is subject to primary supervision, examination and\nregulation by the DFPI and the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board is the primary federal regulator of state member banks. The Bank is also\nsubject to regulation by the FDIC, which insures the Bank’s deposits as permitted by law. Management is not aware of any recommendations of regulatory\nauthorities or otherwise which, if they were to be implemented, would have a material effect on the Company’s or Bank’s liquidity, capital resources, or\noperations.\nThe U.S. Basel III rules contain capital standards regarding the composition of capital, minimum capital ratios and counter-party credit risk capital\nrequirements. The Basel III rules also include a definition of common equity Tier 1 capital and require that certain levels of such common equity Tier 1 capital\nbe maintained. The rules also include a capital conservation buffer, which imposes a common equity requirement above the new minimum that can be depleted\nunder stress and could result in restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses under certain circumstances, as well as a new standardized\napproach for calculating risk-weighted assets. Under the Basel III rules, we must maintain a ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at\nleast 4.5%, a ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6%, a ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8% and a minimum Tier 1\nleverage ratio of 4.0%. In addition to the preceding requirements, all financial institutions subject to the Rules, including both the Company and the Bank, are\nrequired to establish a \"conservation buffer,\" consisting of common equity Tier 1 capital, which is at least 2.5% above each of the preceding common equity\nTier 1 capital ratio, the Tier 1 risk-based ratio and the total risk-based ratio. An institution that does not meet the conservation buffer will be subject to\nrestrictions on certain activities including payment of dividends, stock repurchases and discretionary bonuses to executive officers.\nFailure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger regulatory actions that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial statements\nand operations. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and Bank must meet specific\ncapital guidelines that rely on quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices.\nThe Company’s and Bank’s amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other\nfactors.\n38\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables present a comparison of our actual capital ratios to the minimum required ratios as of the dates indicated:\n(in thousands) Regulatory\nActual Minimum\nCapital ratios for Bank: Amount Ratio Amount Ratio\nAs of September 30, 2024\nTotal capital (to Risk- Weighted Assets) $ 208,800 15.3% $ 143,086 >10.5%\nTier I capital (to Risk- Weighted Assets) $ 196,834 14.4% $ 115,831 >8.5%\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital (to Risk Weighted Assets) $ 196,834 14.4% $ 95,390 >7.0%\nTier I capital (to Average Assets) $ 196,834 10.4% $ 75,617 >4.0%\nAs of December 31, 2023\nTotal capital (to Risk- Weighted Assets) $ 193,005 14.7% $ 137,819 >10.5%\nTier I capital (to Risk- Weighted Assets) $ 181,500 13.8% $ 111,567 >8.5%\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital (to Risk Weighted Assets) $ 181,500 13.8% $ 91,879 >7.0%\nTier I capital (to Average Assets) $ 181,500 9.6% $ 75,303 >4.0%\nCapital ratios for the Company:\nAs of September 30, 2024\nTotal capital (to Risk- Weighted Assets) $ 209,485 15.4% $ 143,109 >10.5%\nTier I capital (to Risk- Weighted Assets) $ 197,519 14.5% $ 115,850 >8.5%\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital (to Risk Weighted Assets) $ 197,519 14.5% $ 95,406 >7.0%\nTier I capital (to Average Assets) $ 197,519 10.5% $ 75,622 >4.0%\nAs of December 31, 2023\nTotal capital (to Risk- Weighted Assets) $ 193,280 14.7% $ 137,835 >10.5%\nTier I capital (to Risk- Weighted Assets) $ 181,775 13.9% $ 111,851 >8.5%\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital (to Risk Weighted Assets) $ 181,775 13.9% $ 91,890 >7.0%\nTier I capital (to Average Assets) $ 181,775 9.7% $ 75,306 >4.0%\nProposed new rules for U.S. implementation of capital requirements under Basel IV rules, more recently referred to as the Basel III \"Endgame\", were issued by\nthe U.S. federal banking agencies on July 27, 2023. These proposed rules include broad-based changes to the risk-weighting framework for various credit\nexposures and operational risk capital requirements. However, the proposed rules generally apply only to large banking organizations with total assets of $100\nbillion or more, and hence, would not be applicable to the Company.\n39\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nMaterial Cash Commitments\nThe following tables summarizes short- and long-term material cash requirements as of September 30, 2024, which we believe that we will be able to\nfund these obligations through cash generated from our operations and available alternative sources of funds (dollars in thousands):\nLess than More than\n(in thousands) 1 year 1 year Total\nOperating lease obligations $ 1,475 $ 6,713 $ 8,188\nSupplemental retirement plans 62 11,294 11,356\nTime deposit maturities 79,784 6,364 86,148\nTotal $ 81,321 $ 24,371 $ 105,692\nLiquidity Management\nSince the Company is a holding company and does not conduct regular banking operations, its primary sources of liquidity are dividends from the Bank. Under\nthe California Financial Code, payment of a dividend from the Bank to the Company is restricted to the lesser of the Bank’s retained earnings or the amount of\nthe Bank’s undistributed net profits from the previous three fiscal years. The primary uses of funds for the Company are stockholder dividends, investment in\nthe Bank and ordinary operating expenses. Management anticipates that there will be sufficient earnings at the Bank level to provide dividends to the Company\nto meet its funding requirements for the next twelve months.\nMaintenance of adequate liquidity requires that sufficient resources be available at all times to meet the Company’s cash flow requirements. Liquidity in a\nbanking institution is required primarily to provide for deposit withdrawals and the credit needs of its customers and to take advantage of investment\nopportunities as they arise. Liquidity management involves the ability to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without incurring significant loss, and to\nraise cash or maintain funds without incurring excessive additional cost. For this purpose, the Company maintains a portion of funds in cash and cash\nequivalents, salable government guaranteed loans and securities available for sale. The Company obtains funds from the repayment and maturity of loans as\nwell as deposit inflows, investment security maturities and paydowns, Federal funds purchased, FHLB advances, and other borrowings. The Company’s\nprimary use of funds are the origination of loans, the purchase of investment securities, withdrawals of deposits, maturity of certificate of deposits, repayment\nof borrowings and dividends to common stockholders. The Company’s liquid assets as of September 30, 2024 were $445.1 million compared to $489.0 million\nas of December 31, 2023. The Company’s liquidity level measured as the percentage of liquid assets to total assets was 23.4% as of September 30, 2024,\ncompared to 26.5% as of December 31, 2023. Liquid assets decreased during the first nine months of 2024, mainly due to the increase in public deposits which\nrequires AFS investment securities to be pledged as collateral, and thereby reducing the total unpledged securities that could be liquidated. Management\nanticipates that cash and cash equivalents on hand and other sources of funds will provide adequate liquidity for operating, investing and financing needs and\nregulatory liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months. Management monitors the Company’s liquidity position daily, balancing loan\nfunding/payments with changes in deposit activity and overnight investments.\nAs a secondary source of liquidity, the Company relies on advances from the FHLB to supplement the supply of lendable funds and to meet deposit withdrawal\nrequirements. Advances from the FHLB are typically secured by a portion of the loan portfolio. The FHLB determines limitations on the amount of advances\nby assigning a percentage to each eligible loan category that will count towards the borrowing capacity. As of September 30, 2024, the Company’s borrowing\ncapacity from the FHLB was approximately $350.4 million and there were no outstanding advances. The Company also maintains a line of credit with two\ncorrespondent banks to purchase up to $70 million in federal funds, and approximately $32.8 million borrowing capacity through the FRB Discount Window,\nfor which there were no advances on either borrowing source as of September 30, 2024.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nDuring the ordinary course of business, the Company provides various forms of credit lines to meet the financing needs of customers. These commitments,\nwhich represent a credit risk to us, are not represented in any form on the balance sheets.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had commitments to extend credit of $176.6 million and $186.3 million, respectively, which\nincludes obligations under letters of credit of $4.2 million and $3.6 million, respectively.\nThe effect on the Company’s revenues, expenses, cash flows and liquidity from the unused portion of the commitments to provide credit cannot be reasonably\npredicted because there is no guarantee that the lines of credit will be used.\n40\nTable of Contents\nRecent Regulatory Developments\nCFPB Open Banking Rule\nIn October 2024, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) finalized a rule to implement Section 1033 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which\nwould require certain entities, including the Company and the Bank, to, among other things, make available to a consumer, upon request, information in its\ncontrol or possession concerning the consumer financial product or service that the consumer obtained from that entity. In issuing the rule, the CFPB said that\nthe rule will move the U.S. closer to an “open banking” system and will let consumers more easily switch banks or other providers. In general, the rule also\nrequires, among other things, data providers holding a consumer account, such as the Bank, to establish a developer interface satisfying certain data security\nspecifications and other standards, through which the data provider can receive requests for, and provide, specific types of data covered by the rule in\nelectronic, usable form to authorized third parties, including data aggregators. Under the rule, data providers are prohibited from, among other things, charging\nconsumers or third parties fees for processing these consumer data requests. The rule also places certain data security, authorization and other obligations on\nthird parties accessing covered data from data providers, which could include the Company and the Bank when acting in certain capacities. The rule requires\nthird parties to limit their collection, use, and retention of the data received to only what is reasonably necessary to provide the consumers’ requested product or\nservice. The compliance date for a depository institution data provider that holds at least $1.5 billion in total assets but less than $3 billion in total assets is\nApril 1, 2029; however, the final rule is subject to ongoing litigation that could impact whether and when the Company and the Bank are required to comply\nwith the rule. We continue to evaluate the final rule and the potential impacts on the Company and the Bank.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nFor qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk, please see the sections entitled “Market Risk” and “Interest Rate Management” in Item 7A of the\nCompany’s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. As of September 30, 2024, the Company’s exposures to market risk have not changed materially since\nDecember 31, 2023.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nThe Company’s Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and\nprocedures, as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this\nreport (the “Evaluation Date”) have concluded that as of the Evaluation Date, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that\nmaterial information relating to the Company would be made known to them by others within the Company, particularly during the period in which this report\nwas being prepared. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by management in the reports that the\nCompany files or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and\nExchange Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that\ninformation required to be disclosed by management in the reports that the Company files under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to\nmanagement, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required\ndisclosure.\nThere were no significant changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially\naffected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting subsequent to the Evaluation Date.\n41\nTable of Contents\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1.
