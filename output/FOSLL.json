REPORTS THIRD QUARTER 2024 FINANCIAL RESULTS\nRemains On Track to Achieve at Least $100 Million of Annualized Savings in 2024 Under TAG Plan\nUpdates Full Year Outlook\nRichardson, TX, November 7, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) - Fossil Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: FOSL) today\nannounced financial results for the fiscal third quarter ended September 28, 2024.\nThird Quarter Summary\n• Third quarter worldwide net sales decreased to $288 million, down 16% on both a reported and constant\ncurrency basis. The results included six points of negative impact related to the Company’s strategic actions\nto exit the smartwatch category and optimize its retail store portfolio.\n• Gross margins expanded 240 basis points to 49.4%, primarily reflecting progress under the Company’s\nTransform and Grow (\"TAG\") Plan.\n• Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses of $161 million were down 16% versus last year,\nprimarily due to lower compensation costs as a result of efficiencies from the Company’s TAG Plan.\n• Third quarter operating loss of $24 million compared to an operating loss of $46 million a year ago.\nAdjusted operating loss of $19 million compared to an adjusted operating loss of $31 million last year.\n• Inventory totaled $226 million, a decrease of 31% versus a year ago; the Company had total liquidity of\n$130 million at quarter end, including cash and cash equivalents of $106 million and $24 million of\navailability under its revolving credit facility.\n“In my first sixty days at Fossil Group, I’ve been spending time with our brands, teams and partners around the\nworld to immerse myself in the business,” said Franco Fogliato, Chief Executive Officer. “During this time, I have\ndeveloped an even stronger conviction about the Company’s significant potential and our ability to return the\nbusiness to profitable growth. We are moving quickly to develop a plan that will be built upon discipline,\nsimplification and focus, leveraging our great brands and talented teams to drive a successful turnaround and create\nvalue for our shareholders.”\nThird Quarter 2024 Operating Results\nAmounts referred to as “adjusted” as well as “constant currency” are non-GAAP financial measures.\nReconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their closest reported GAAP measures are included at the\nend of this press release.\n• Net sales totaled $287.8 million, a decrease of 16.4% on a reported basis and 16.3% in constant currency\ncompared to $344.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The sales decrease was largely driven by\noverall category, consumer and channel softness. Declines in smartwatch sales resulting from our exit of\nthe category, and our store rationalization initiatives comprised approximately six points of the sales\ndecline in the third quarter. Net sales in constant currency declined 20% in the Americas, 11% in Europe\nand 17% in Asia. Wholesale sales in constant currency declined 12%, while our direct to consumer sales\ndecreased 24%. Within our direct to consumer channels, comparable retail sales declined 12%. In our major\nproduct categories, traditional watch sales declined 12% in constant currency in the third quarter compared\nto the prior year period. The leathers category decreased 28% and jewelry sales declined 10% in constant\ncurrency during the third quarter. From a brand lens, the majority of the brands in our portfolio decreased in\nthe third quarter.\n• Gross profit totaled $142.2 million compared to $161.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. Gross margin\nincreased 240 basis points to 49.4% versus 47.0% in the third quarter of 2023. The year-over-year increase\nwas primarily due to initiatives under our TAG Plan, including improved product margins in our core\ncategories and our exit from the smartwatch category. These favorable impacts were partially offset by\nincreased licensor minimum royalty costs.\n• Operating expenses totaled $166.7 million, down 20% compared to $208.1 million a year ago. As a\npercentage of net sales, operating expenses were 57.9% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 60.5% in\nthe prior year third quarter. Operating expenses in the third quarter of 2024 included $4.8 million of\nrestructuring costs, primarily related to professional services and employee costs, while operating expenses\nin the third quarter of 2023 included $16.0 million of restructuring costs. SG&A expenses were $160.9\nmillion, down 16% compared to the third quarter of 2023. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses\nwere 55.9% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 55.6% in the prior year third quarter, largely driven by\ndecreased sales.\n• Operating loss was $24.5 million compared to $46.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. Operating\nmargin was (8.5)% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to (13.5)% in the prior year third quarter.\nAdjusted operating loss totaled $18.7 million compared to $31.1 million in the third quarter of 2023.\nAdjusted operating margin was (6.5)% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to (9.0)% in the prior year\nthird quarter.\n• Interest expense decreased to $4.9 million compared to $5.8 million in the third quarter of 2023, primarily\ndriven by a lower debt balance.\n• Other income (expense) was income of $3.6 million compared to expense of $3.0 million in the third\nquarter of 2023, reflecting net currency gains in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to net currency\nlosses in the prior year third quarter.\n• Income (loss) before income taxes was $(25.8) million compared to $(55.2) million in the third quarter of\n2023.\n• Adjusted EBITDA was $(12.3) million, or (4.3)% of net sales in the third quarter of 2024 and $(29.3)\nmillion, or (8.4)% of net sales in the prior year quarter.\n• Provision (benefit) for income taxes was an expense of $6.2 million, resulting in an effective income tax\nrate of (23.9)% compared to an expense of $5.6 million and an effective tax rate of (10.1)% in the prior\nyear. The effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2024 differed from the prior year third quarter primarily\ndue to a change in the Company’s global mix of earnings.\n• Net loss totaled $32.0 million with net loss per diluted share of $0.60, which compares to net loss of $61.1\nmillion and net loss per diluted share of $1.16 in the prior year quarter. Adjusted net loss for the third\nquarter was $27.4 million with adjusted net loss per diluted share of $0.51 compared to adjusted net loss of\n$49.0 million with adjusted net loss per diluted share of $0.93 in the prior year quarter. During the third\nquarter of 2024, currencies favorably affected net loss per diluted share by approximately $0.07.\nBalance Sheet Summary\nAs of September 28, 2024, the Company had total liquidity of $130.1 million, including $106.3 million of cash and\ncash equivalents and $23.8 million of availability under its revolving credit facility. Inventories at the end of the\nthird quarter of 2024 totaled $226.4 million, a decrease of 31% versus a year ago. Total debt was $175.7 million.\nTransform and Grow Plan\nThe Company remains on track with its TAG Plan, a comprehensive operational plan designed to reduce operating\nexpenses, improve operating margins and advance the Company’s commitment to profitable growth. The plan\nencompasses multiple workstreams with a target to drive $300 million in annualized operating income benefits by\nthe end of 2025. The TAG Plan generated annualized operating income benefits of approximately $125 million in\n2023 and is expected to generate additional annualized operating income benefits of at least $100 million in 2024.\nRestructuring costs associated with the TAG Plan are estimated to be $40 million in fiscal year 2024.\nStrategic Business Review\nIn March 2024, the Company announced a strategic review of its current business model and capital structure. This\nincludes efforts to optimize its business model through additional changes to its operations, as well as further\nstructural cost reductions, which are under consideration. The Company anticipates this effort will expand on its\ncurrent TAG Plan and could include additional debt and equity financing options, including monetization of various\nassets to strengthen its balance sheet. The Company has retained Evercore to act as its financial advisor.\nOutlook\nThe Company is revising its full year financial outlook for 2024. Worldwide net sales are expected to be\napproximately $1.1 billion, reflecting consumer and channel softness, as well as approximately $100 million of\nnegative impact related to the exit of its smartwatch business, and the closure of owned retail stores. Fiscal year\nadjusted operating margin(1) is expected to be in the range of (6)% to (8)%. The Company expects to generate\npositive free cash flow(2) in full year 2024, inclusive of tax refunds of approximately $57 million, which were\nreceived in the second quarter of 2024.\n(1) A reconciliation of adjusted operating margin, a non-GAAP financial measure, to a corresponding GAAP measure is not available on a\nforward-looking basis without unreasonable efforts due to the high variability and low visibility of certain income and expense items that are\nexcluded in calculating adjusted operating margin.\n(2) Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure, defined as net cash from operating activities less net cash used in investing activities. A\ncorresponding reconciliation of free cash flow to a corresponding GAAP measure is not available on a forward-looking basis without\nunreasonable effort.\nSafe Harbor\nCertain statements contained herein that are not historical facts, including, but not limited to, statements regarding\nour outlook, expected financial position, TAG Plan benefits and expenses, liquidity and strategic review, constitute\n“forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and\ninvolve a number of risks and uncertainties.

The renowned singer-songwriter will become the brand’s global watch ambassador for 2025 – 2026 with a worldwide campaign set to launch in the back half of 2025. The groundbreaking campaign will harness the cultural power of music—a platform that resonates deeply with the Fossil audience’s passions and values. Music serves as a meaningful and unifying connection and celebrates Fossil’s timeless spirit and its place within today’s cultural landscape.\n\nJonas and the campaign embody the perennial, energetic ethos of the brand for the modern world while remaining true to the core pillars of design and innovation. Known for his distinctive style and widespread appeal, Nick Jonas embodies the spirit of Fossil, making him the perfect partner that will reach consumers across the globe.\n\n_“I’ve been a longtime admirer of watches, and Fossil was my very first as I was growing up, so this partnership is truly a full circle moment for me,”_ said **Nick Jonas.**_“I’m excited to work with the incredible Fossil team and bring my creative input to their process to design something special for watch lovers everywhere.”_\n\n_“As we continue to redefine Fossil at the global level, we’re searching for like-minded talent that not only resonate with but also embody our consumers worldwide,”_ said **Franco Fogliato** , Chief Executive Officer of Fossil Group, Inc _. “Nick Jonas is a force in music and fashion and has been an authentic brand fan for decades, making the choice clear.

We create timeless, well-crafted leather goods, jewelry and watches to accessorize a joyful, inspired life. In everything we do, we strive to Make Time For Good™, working to create positive change for our people and communities.\n\n**NICK JONAS** After electrifying music from multiple angles, appearing in blockbuster films, and launching successful business ventures, Nick Jonas still challenges himself and popular culture. Of course, his story as one-third of Jonas Brothers remains well-documented—especially given the band’s chart-dominating 2019 comeback Happiness Begins, sold out tours, and subsequent GRAMMY® Award nomination. At the same time, he established himself as a dynamic solo artist with a penchant for breaking boundaries. 2014’s self-titled Nick Jonas yielded the triple-platinum “Jealous,” double-platinum “Chains,” and gold-certified “Levels.” Its 2016 follow-up Last Year Was Complicated spawned the anthem “Close” [feat. Tove Lo] and brought his streams into the billions. In 2017, he contributed the Golden Globe® Award-nominated “Home” to the Ferdinand soundtrack. Meanwhile, his songwriting would be recognized with the prestigious Hal David Starlight Award from the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2016. He will mark his return to Broadway starring opposite Adrienne Warren in  _Last Five Years_ next year and most recently starred in director Robert Schwartzman’s  _The Good Half_. Along the way, he also captivated audiences as a recurring judge on NBC’s The Voice in big screen favorites such as Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, Ugly Dolls, Midway, Jumanji: The Next Level, Chaos Walking and more. In 2021, Nick released his studio album Spaceman [Island Records]. In 2023, Nick and Jonas Brothers once again proved they are a constant force, embarking on a new era with the release of The Album, via Republic Records. The Album was produced by Jon Bellion and features hit singles “Waffle House” and “Wings.” In support of the new album and this new era for Jonas Brothers, they kicked off “The Tour” with two sold-out shows at New York’s iconic Yankee Stadium. “The Tour” includes stadium and arena dates around the globe through 2024, resulting in the band’s biggest and most extensive tour to date.\n\n[Read the Announcement on WWD](https://wwd.com/menswear-news/mens-accessories/nick-jonas-fossil-brand-ambassador-1236717902/)\n\n![](https://www.fossilgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Nick-Jonas-feature-imageA-1080x1080-1-1024x1024.jpg)\n\n_Nick Jonas | Pamela Littky_\n\nType and Press “enter” to Search\n\n[WordPress Video Lightbox Plugin](http://www.wonderplugin.com/wordpress-lightbox/ \"WordPress Video Lightbox Plugin\")\n"

          "content": "FOSSIL GROUP, INC. REPORTS THIRD QUARTER 2024 FINANCIAL RESULTS\nRemains On Track to Achieve at Least $100 Million of Annualized Savings in 2024 Under TAG Plan\nUpdates Full Year Outlook\nRichardson, TX, November 7, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) - Fossil Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: FOSL) today\nannounced financial results for the fiscal third quarter ended September 28, 2024.\nThird Quarter Summary\n• Third quarter worldwide net sales decreased to $288 million, down 16% on both a reported and constant\ncurrency basis. The results included six points of negative impact related to the Company’s strategic actions\nto exit the smartwatch category and optimize its retail store portfolio.\n• Gross margins expanded 240 basis points to 49.4%, primarily reflecting progress under the Company’s\nTransform and Grow (\"TAG\") Plan.\n• Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses of $161 million were down 16% versus last year,\nprimarily due to lower compensation costs as a result of efficiencies from the Company’s TAG Plan.\n• Third quarter operating loss of $24 million compared to an operating loss of $46 million a year ago.\nAdjusted operating loss of $19 million compared to an adjusted operating loss of $31 million last year.\n• Inventory totaled $226 million, a decrease of 31% versus a year ago; the Company had total liquidity of\n$130 million at quarter end, including cash and cash equivalents of $106 million and $24 million of\navailability under its revolving credit facility.\n“In my first sixty days at Fossil Group, I’ve been spending time with our brands, teams and partners around the\nworld to immerse myself in the business,” said Franco Fogliato, Chief Executive Officer. “During this time, I have\ndeveloped an even stronger conviction about the Company’s significant potential and our ability to return the\nbusiness to profitable growth. We are moving quickly to develop a plan that will be built upon discipline,\nsimplification and focus, leveraging our great brands and talented teams to drive a successful turnaround and create\nvalue for our shareholders.”\nThird Quarter 2024 Operating Results\nAmounts referred to as “adjusted” as well as “constant currency” are non-GAAP financial measures.\nReconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their closest reported GAAP measures are included at the\nend of this press release.\n• Net sales totaled $287.8 million, a decrease of 16.4% on a reported basis and 16.3% in constant currency\ncompared to $344.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The sales decrease was largely driven by\noverall category, consumer and channel softness. Declines in smartwatch sales resulting from our exit of\nthe category, and our store rationalization initiatives comprised approximately six points of the sales\ndecline in the third quarter. Net sales in constant currency declined 20% in the Americas, 11% in Europe\nand 17% in Asia. Wholesale sales in constant currency declined 12%, while our direct to consumer sales\ndecreased 24%. Within our direct to consumer channels, comparable retail sales declined 12%. In our major\nproduct categories, traditional watch sales declined 12% in constant currency in the third quarter compared\nto the prior year period. The leathers category decreased 28% and jewelry sales declined 10% in constant\ncurrency during the third quarter. From a brand lens, the majority of the brands in our portfolio decreased in\nthe third quarter.\n• Gross profit totaled $142.2 million compared to $161.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. Gross margin\nincreased 240 basis points to 49.4% versus 47.0% in the third quarter of 2023. The year-over-year increase\nwas primarily due to initiatives under our TAG Plan, including improved product margins in our core\ncategories and our exit from the smartwatch category. These favorable impacts were partially offset by\nincreased licensor minimum royalty costs.\n• Operating expenses totaled $166.7 million, down 20% compared to $208.1 million a year ago. As a\npercentage of net sales, operating expenses were 57.9% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 60.5% in\nthe prior year third quarter. Operating expenses in the third quarter of 2024 included $4.8 million of\nrestructuring costs, primarily related to professional services and employee costs, while operating expenses\nin the third quarter of 2023 included $16.0 million of restructuring costs. SG&A expenses were $160.9\nmillion, down 16% compared to the third quarter of 2023. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses\nwere 55.9% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 55.6% in the prior year third quarter, largely driven by\ndecreased sales.\n• Operating loss was $24.5 million compared to $46.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. Operating\nmargin was (8.5)% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to (13.5)% in the prior year third quarter.\nAdjusted operating loss totaled $18.7 million compared to $31.1 million in the third quarter of 2023.\nAdjusted operating margin was (6.5)% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to (9.0)% in the prior year\nthird quarter.\n• Interest expense decreased to $4.9 million compared to $5.8 million in the third quarter of 2023, primarily\ndriven by a lower debt balance.\n• Other income (expense) was income of $3.6 million compared to expense of $3.0 million in the third\nquarter of 2023, reflecting net currency gains in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to net currency\nlosses in the prior year third quarter.\n• Income (loss) before income taxes was $(25.8) million compared to $(55.2) million in the third quarter of\n2023.\n• Adjusted EBITDA was $(12.3) million, or (4.3)% of net sales in the third quarter of 2024 and $(29.3)\nmillion, or (8.4)% of net sales in the prior year quarter.\n• Provision (benefit) for income taxes was an expense of $6.2 million, resulting in an effective income tax\nrate of (23.9)% compared to an expense of $5.6 million and an effective tax rate of (10.1)% in the prior\nyear. The effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2024 differed from the prior year third quarter primarily\ndue to a change in the Company’s global mix of earnings.\n• Net loss totaled $32.0 million with net loss per diluted share of $0.60, which compares to net loss of $61.1\nmillion and net loss per diluted share of $1.16 in the prior year quarter. Adjusted net loss for the third\nquarter was $27.4 million with adjusted net loss per diluted share of $0.51 compared to adjusted net loss of\n$49.0 million with adjusted net loss per diluted share of $0.93 in the prior year quarter. During the third\nquarter of 2024, currencies favorably affected net loss per diluted share by approximately $0.07.\nBalance Sheet Summary\nAs of September 28, 2024, the Company had total liquidity of $130.1 million, including $106.3 million of cash and\ncash equivalents and $23.8 million of availability under its revolving credit facility. Inventories at the end of the\nthird quarter of 2024 totaled $226.4 million, a decrease of 31% versus a year ago. Total debt was $175.7 million.\nTransform and Grow Plan\nThe Company remains on track with its TAG Plan, a comprehensive operational plan designed to reduce operating\nexpenses, improve operating margins and advance the Company’s commitment to profitable growth. The plan\nencompasses multiple workstreams with a target to drive $300 million in annualized operating income benefits by\nthe end of 2025. The TAG Plan generated annualized operating income benefits of approximately $125 million in\n2023 and is expected to generate additional annualized operating income benefits of at least $100 million in 2024.\nRestructuring costs associated with the TAG Plan are estimated to be $40 million in fiscal year 2024.\nStrategic Business Review\nIn March 2024, the Company announced a strategic review of its current business model and capital structure. This\nincludes efforts to optimize its business model through additional changes to its operations, as well as further\nstructural cost reductions, which are under consideration. The Company anticipates this effort will expand on its\ncurrent TAG Plan and could include additional debt and equity financing options, including monetization of various\nassets to strengthen its balance sheet. The Company has retained Evercore to act as its financial advisor.\nOutlook\nThe Company is revising its full year financial outlook for 2024. Worldwide net sales are expected to be\napproximately $1.1 billion, reflecting consumer and channel softness, as well as approximately $100 million of\nnegative impact related to the exit of its smartwatch business, and the closure of owned retail stores. Fiscal year\nadjusted operating margin(1) is expected to be in the range of (6)% to (8)%. The Company expects to generate\npositive free cash flow(2) in full year 2024, inclusive of tax refunds of approximately $57 million, which were\nreceived in the second quarter of 2024.\n(1) A reconciliation of adjusted operating margin, a non-GAAP financial measure, to a corresponding GAAP measure is not available on a\nforward-looking basis without unreasonable efforts due to the high variability and low visibility of certain income and expense items that are\nexcluded in calculating adjusted operating margin.\n(2) Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure, defined as net cash from operating activities less net cash used in investing activities. A\ncorresponding reconciliation of free cash flow to a corresponding GAAP measure is not available on a forward-looking basis without\nunreasonable effort.\nSafe Harbor\nCertain statements contained herein that are not historical facts, including, but not limited to, statements regarding\nour outlook, expected financial position, TAG Plan benefits and expenses, liquidity and strategic review, constitute\n“forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and\ninvolve a number of risks and uncertainties.

REPORTS SECOND QUARTER 2024 FINANCIAL RESULTS\nContinued Operational and Financial Progress under TAG Plan\nMaintains Full Year 2024 Outlook\nRichardson, TX, AUGUST 8, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) - Fossil Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: FOSL) today\nannounced financial results for the fiscal second quarter ended June 29, 2024.\nSecond Quarter Summary\n• Second quarter worldwide net sales decreased to $260 million, down 19% on a reported basis and 18% in\nconstant currency, which includes five points of negative impact related to the Company’s strategic actions\nto exit the smartwatch category and optimize its retail store portfolio.\n• Gross margins expanded 390 basis points to 52.6%, primarily reflecting progress under the Company’s\nTransform and Grow (\"TAG\") Plan.\n• Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses of $154 million were down 18% versus last year,\nprimarily due to lower compensation costs as a result of efficiencies from the Company’s TAG Plan.\n• Second quarter operating loss of $34 million compared to operating loss of $35 million a year ago.\nAdjusted operating loss of $17 million compared to adjusted operating loss of $28 million last year.\n• Inventory totaled $202 million, a decrease of 38% versus a year ago; the Company had total liquidity of\n$156 million at quarter end, including cash and cash equivalents of $105 million and $51 million of\navailability under its revolving credit facility.\n“Our second quarter results were in line with our expectations and reflect continued progress under our TAG Plan,”\nsaid Jeffrey Boyer, Interim CEO. \"Strong execution of our initiatives resulted in gross margin expansion, cost\nreduction and adjusted operating margin improvement in the second quarter. Our teams remain focused on further\nadvancing our TAG Plan, while progressing on our actions to stabilize the business, strengthen the balance sheet and\nconduct a strategic review of our business model and capital structure.”\nSecond Quarter 2024 Operating Results\nAmounts referred to as “adjusted” as well as “constant currency” are non-GAAP financial measures.\nReconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their closest reported GAAP measures are included at the\nend of this press release.\n• Net sales totaled $260.0 million, a decrease of 19.3% on a reported basis and 18.5% in constant currency\ncompared to $322.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The sales decrease was largely driven by\noverall category, consumer and channel softness. Declines in smartwatch sales resulting from our exit of\nthe category, and our store rationalization initiatives comprised approximately 5 points of the sales decline\nin the second quarter. Net sales, in constant currency, declined 18% in the Americas, 15% in Europe and\n20% in Asia. Wholesale sales declined 16% while our direct to consumer sales decreased 22% on a\nconstant currency basis. Within our direct to consumer channels, comparable retail sales declined 10%. In\nour major product categories, traditional watch sales declined 17% in constant currency in the second\nquarter compared to the prior year period. The leathers category decreased 18% and jewelry sales declined\n10% in constant currency during the second quarter. From a brand lens, the majority of the brands in our\nportfolio decreased in the second quarter.\n• Gross profit totaled $136.9 million compared to $156.7 million in the second quarter of 2023. Gross\nmargin increased 390 basis points to 52.6% versus 48.7% a year ago. The year-over-year increase is\nprimarily due to initiatives under our TAG Plan, including our exit from the smartwatch category and\nimproved product margins in our core categories.\n• Operating expenses totaled $170.9 million, down 11% compared to $192.0 million a year ago. As a\npercentage of net sales, operating expenses were 65.7% in the second quarter of 2024 compared to 59.6%\nin the prior year second quarter. Operating expenses in the second quarter of 2024 included $16.7 million\nof restructuring costs, primarily related to professional services and employee costs, while operating\nexpenses in the second quarter of 2023 included $4.6 million of restructuring costs. SG&A expenses were\n$153.6 million, down 18% compared to the second quarter of 2023. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A\nexpenses were 59.1% in the second quarter of 2024 compared to 58.1% in the prior year second quarter,\nlargely driven by decreased sales.\n• Operating loss was $34.0 million compared to $35.3 million in the second quarter of 2023. Operating\nmargin was (13.1)% in the second quarter of 2024 compared to (11.0)% in the prior year second quarter.\nAdjusted operating loss totaled $16.7 million compared to $27.6 million in the second quarter of 2023.\nAdjusted operating margin was (6.4)% in the second quarter of 2024 compared to (8.6)% in the prior year\nsecond quarter.\n• Interest expense decreased to $4.1 million compared to $5.3 million in the second quarter of 2023,\nprimarily driven by a lower debt balance.\n• Other income (expense) was $1.5 million compared to $7.2 million in the second quarter of 2023,\nreflecting decreased net currency gains in the second quarter of 2024 as compared to the prior year second\nquarter.\n• Income (loss) before income taxes was $(36.6) million compared to $(33.5) million in the second quarter\nof 2023.\n• Adjusted EBITDA was $(11.7) million, or (4.5)% of net sales in the second quarter of 2024 and $(15.4)\nmillion, or (4.8)% of net sales in the prior year quarter.\n• Provision (benefit) for income taxes was an expense of $2.2 million, resulting in an effective income tax\nrate of (6.0)% compared to a benefit of $7.2 million and an effective tax rate of 21.5% in the prior year.\nThe effective tax rate in the second quarter of 2024 differed from the prior year second quarter primarily\ndue to a change in the Company’s global mix of earnings.\n• Net loss totaled $38.8 million with net loss per diluted share of $0.73, which compares to net loss of $26.5\nmillion and net loss per diluted share of $0.51 in the prior year quarter. Adjusted net loss for the second\nquarter was $25.1 million with adjusted net loss per diluted share of $0.47 compared to adjusted net loss of\n$20.4 million with adjusted net loss per diluted share of $0.40 in the prior year quarter. During the second\nquarter of 2024, currencies unfavorably affected net loss per diluted share by approximately $0.08.\nBalance Sheet Summary\nAs of June 29, 2024, the Company had total liquidity of $156.0 million, including $104.9 million of cash and cash\nequivalents and $50.8 million of availability under its revolving credit facility. Inventories at the end of the second\nquarter of 2024 totaled $202.1 million, a decrease of 38% versus a year ago. Total debt was $159 million.\nTransform and Grow Plan\nThe Company remains on track with its TAG Plan, a comprehensive operational plan designed to reduce operating\nexpenses, improve operating margins and advance the Company’s commitment to profitable growth. The plan\nencompasses multiple workstreams with a target to drive $300 million in annualized operating income benefits by\nthe end of 2025. The TAG Plan generated annualized operating income benefits of approximately $125 million in\n2023 and is expected to generate additional annualized operating income benefits of at least $100 million in 2024.\nRestructuring costs associated with the TAG Plan are estimated to be $40 million in fiscal year 2024.\nStrategic Business Review\nIn March 2024, the Company announced a strategic review of its current business model and capital structure. This\nincludes efforts to optimize its business model through additional changes to its operations, as well as further\nstructural cost reductions, which are under consideration. The Company anticipates this effort will expand on its\ncurrent TAG Plan and could include additional debt and equity financing options, including monetization of various\nassets to strengthen its balance sheet. The Company has retained Evercore to act as its financial advisor.\nOutlook\nThe Company is reiterating its full year financial outlook for 2024. Worldwide net sales are expected to be\napproximately $1.2 billion, reflecting consumer and channel softness, as well as approximately $100 million of\nnegative impact related to the exit of its smartwatch business, and the closure of owned retail stores. Fiscal year\nadjusted operating margin(1) is expected to be in the range of -3% to -5%. The Company expects to generate positive\nfree cash flow(2) in full year 2024, inclusive of tax refunds of approximately $57 million, which were received in the\nsecond quarter of 2024.\n(1) A reconciliation of adjusted operating margin, a non-GAAP financial measure, to a corresponding GAAP measure is not available on a\nforward-looking basis without unreasonable efforts due to the high variability and low visibility of certain income and expense items that are\nexcluded in calculating adjusted operating margin.\n(2) Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure, defined as net cash from operating activities less net cash used in investing activities. A\ncorresponding reconciliation of free cash flow to a corresponding GAAP measure is not available on a forward-looking basis without\nunreasonable effort.\nSafe Harbor\nCertain statements contained herein that are not historical facts, including, but not limited to, statements regarding\nour outlook, expected financial position, TAG Plan benefits and expenses, liquidity and strategic review, constitute\n“forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and\ninvolve a number of risks and uncertainties.

We define Adjusted net income (loss)\nand Adjusted earnings (loss) per share as net income (loss) attributable to Fossil Group, Inc. and diluted earnings\n(loss) per share, respectively, before impairment expense, restructuring expense and unamortized debt issuance costs\nincluded in loss on extinguishment of debt. We have included Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted operating income (loss),\nAdjusted net income (loss) and Adjusted earnings (loss) per share herein because they are widely used by investors\nfor valuation and for comparing our financial performance with the performance of our competitors. We also use\nboth non-GAAP financial measures to monitor and compare the financial performance of our operations. Our\npresentation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted operating income (loss), Adjusted net income (loss) and Adjusted\nearnings (loss) per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures other companies report.
