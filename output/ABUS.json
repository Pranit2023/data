Patients with HBsAg levels less than 1000 IU/mL represent a significant portion of the cHBV population. These data will be presented as a late-breaker poster presentation on November 18, 2024 at The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) – The Liver Meeting® 2024.\n\n“For the first time, we are seeing a meaningful percentage of HBV patients functionally cured with an RNAi therapeutic and interferon,” commented Professor Man-Fung Yuen, D.Sc., M.D., Ph.D., Chief of the Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, the University of Hong Kong and Principal Investigator of the IM-PROVE I clinical trial, who will present the data at AASLD. “While 48 weeks of interferon can be used as a standard of care treatment for HBV patients, historically less than 10% of patients experience a functional cure. Here, with the combination of imdusiran and 24 weeks of interferon, we see a 50% functional cure rate in HBV patients with HBsAg less than 1000 IU/mL at baseline and a 25% functional cure rate overall. In addition, I was pleased to see that this regimen with a short course of interferon was generally safe and well-tolerated. These data are extremely impressive and provide hope for the millions of HBV patients worldwide and the medical community that a finite curative treatment is possible with imdusiran and interferon.”\n\nKey data from patients in Cohort A1 that received 6 doses of imdusiran plus 24 weeks of IFN in addition to ongoing NA therapy include:\n\n  * 50% of patients (3/6) with baseline HBsAg <1000 IU/mL achieved a functional cure (defined as sustained HBsAg loss and HBV DNA less than the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) 24 weeks off all treatment (including NAs), with or without hepatitis B surface antibodies (anti-HBs)).\n  * Overall, 25% of patients (3/12) achieved a functional cure.\n  * Those patients that achieved a functional cure also seroconverted with anti-HBs levels increasing as patients lost HBsAg.\n  * The combination of imdusiran and IFN was generally safe and well-tolerated. There were no serious adverse events (SAEs) related to imdusiran or IFN, and no adverse events (AEs) leading to discontinuation.\n\n\n\nThe late-breaker poster, titled, “IM-PROVE I: Imdusiran in Combination with Short Courses of Pegylated Interferon Alfa-2a in Virally Suppressed, HBeAg Negative Subjects with Chronic HBV (cHBV) Infection Leads to Functional Cure”, is available on the Company’s website and provides the complete data set for all four cohorts of patients dosed in this clinical trial.\n\nAdditional immune activation data in those patients in Cohort A1 that achieved a functional cure will be presented by Dr. Emily Thi, Senior Director, Immunobiology and Biomarkers Research at Arbutus Biopharma in a poster titled, “Soluble Immune Biomarker Profiling of Chronic Hepatitis B Subjects Treated with Imdusiran in Combination with Pegylated Interferon Alfa Reveals Phases of Immune Activation.” The data in this poster show that patients in Cohort A1 had greater increases in favorable immune biomarkers than those in other cohorts. Functionally cured patients and those with baseline HBsAg <1000 IU/mL had elevations of key immune biomarkers during the imdusiran lead-in, IFN treatment and follow-up periods, suggesting immune activation induced by imdusiran plus IFN treatment.\n\n“We are extremely excited to have functionally cured these patients with the imdusiran and interferon treatment regimen. There is a significant need for a functional cure for the more than 250 million patients chronically infected with HBV worldwide,” commented Dr. Karen Sims, Chief Medical Officer of Arbutus Biopharma. “Excess production of surface antigen is believed to contribute to host immune exhaustion, resulting in inadequate immune response and failure to suppress the virus. These data support our belief that lowering surface antigen with imdusiran and incorporating an immunomodulator in the treatment regimen provides a functional cure in some patients with cHBV. We thank all the patients and investigators who participated in this clinical trial.”\n\nAll of the above posters that will be presented at AASLD – The Liver Meeting can be accessed through the Arbutus website under [Publications](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=P-N2bCGJco2-2VBgs2OM-yqwsUp5-dXEwvPxgJfM1xP9LuVWtmo7ISCSZlsQs2S4weyUuji_46v2xZEnIRJAuB3sHTop3sjVtetQKxTck6c=).\n\n**_IM-PROVE I CLINICAL TRIAL DETAILS_**\n\nThe IM-PROVE I Phase 2a Clinical trial (AB-729-201; [NCT04980482](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=FR4g3J6zGOhIlZNCGs1D_zuwPx4T2VruUthxVs7MeNZB2J1NnpYpxfRdTATeMc4KNd2vKsuFx0Rz_tZnXsh1TYO-duXTJYRFrW0uaspm5BUMOOSfhn24o5JJHPr_XDJGZUXM0bYhKm6Hr3WyC5DsLg==)) enrolled 43 HBeAg-negative, NA-suppressed patients with cHBV infection. After a 24-week lead-in with imdusiran (60 mg every 8 weeks, 4 doses) added to ongoing NA therapy, patients were randomized into one of the following four cohorts: Cohort A1: imdusiran (2 doses) + NA + IFN weekly for 24 weeks (n=12), Cohort A2: NA + IFN weekly for 24 weeks (n=13), Cohort B1: Imdusiran (1 dose) + NA + IFN weekly for 12 weeks (n=8) and Cohort B2: NA + IFN weekly for 12 weeks (n=10).\n\nAfter completion of the IFN treatment period (Week 52 for cohorts A1 and A2 and Week 40 for cohorts B1 and B2), patients underwent a 24-week follow-up period on NA therapy alone and were then assessed for discontinuation of NA therapy. Patients with ALT levels less than two times the upper limit of normal, undetectable HBV DNA, and HBsAg <100 IU/mL at two consecutive visits at least 24 weeks after the last dose of imdusiran qualified to discontinue all therapy and will be followed for at least 48 weeks.\n\n**_About Imdusiran (AB-729)_**\n\nImdusiran is an RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutic specifically designed to reduce all HBV viral proteins and antigens including hepatitis B surface antigen, which is thought to be a key prerequisite to enable reawakening of a patient’s immune system to respond to the virus. Imdusiran targets hepatocytes using Arbutus’ novel covalently conjugated N-Acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) delivery technology enabling subcutaneous delivery. In a Phase 2a clinical trial, imdusiran achieved meaningful functional cure rates in patients with cHBV when combined with pegylated interferon alfa-2α and nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy. Additional clinical data generated thus far has shown imdusiran to be generally safe and well-tolerated, while also providing meaningful reductions in hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B DNA. Plans are underway to advance imdusiran into a Phase 2b clinical trial. \n\n**_About HBV_**\n\nHepatitis B is a potentially life-threatening liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). HBV can cause chronic infection which leads to a higher risk of death from cirrhosis and liver cancer. Chronic HBV infection represents a significant unmet medical need. The World Health Organization estimates that over 250 million people worldwide suffer from chronic HBV infection, while other estimates indicate that approximately 2 million people in the United States suffer from chronic HBV infection. Approximately 1.1 million people die every year from complications related to chronic HBV infection despite the availability of effective vaccines and current treatment options.\n\n**_About Arbutus_**\n\nArbutus Biopharma Corporation (Nasdaq: ABUS) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company leveraging its extensive virology expertise to develop novel therapeutics with distinct mechanisms of action, which can potentially be combined to provide a functional cure for patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (cHBV). Arbutus believes the key to success in developing a functional cure involves suppressing HBV DNA, reducing surface antigen, and boosting HBV-specific immune responses.

Known risk factors include, among others: anticipated pre-clinical studies and clinical trials may be more costly or take longer to complete than anticipated, and may never be initiated or completed, or may not generate results that warrant future development of the tested product candidate; Arbutus may elect to change its strategy regarding its product candidates and clinical development activities; Arbutus may not receive the necessary regulatory approvals for the clinical development of Arbutus’ products; economic and market conditions may worsen; market shifts may require a change in strategic focus.\n\nA more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties facing Arbutus appears in Arbutus’ Annual Report on Form 10-K, Arbutus’ Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Arbutus’ continuous and periodic disclosure filings, which are available at [www.sedar.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=PVBdcWqWiYL43AIABx1lePhlruqBggC5y4i3L2MVeclW-85Lz59r-8O-6tuUHiLODFQm0Z3d5PLoG3VoSTusoKWBNfP87E5KGo8PfG1sJsn0tjqPBek7dHgAPtVvJb4TINyvsAAJosJQdm0tFOLAyOP9wbToFc0XWs1BpYHKjiLBha5c_4prZJWfCnhhp2kAGL0S_5s_1OcgXQ-2moLgjItGShnk6oyshSQ0nTkUlLo=) and at [www.sec.gov](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=PVBdcWqWiYL43AIABx1leJblFAG9DtHdiGqiIJyzJGScix2f5fqU9RkPs_Hy7rN1jDgnFF4ZHy8E9WO0-8QAidcjnhIJCQ0OM9uPsZGLg73VLpaVgw4w0dPvFojUHvAG89OZEWEWVSm0s-ndsLoQAfJDdBOllLKDyztGvcQIuWRGcAqZ4K6UOpAJOsHcP5dMxJt-jO4cBeTRB8InqJrmAoIb-H4blAYE2shOYLSgeoI=).
