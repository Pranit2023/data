(NASDAQ: SFIX), the leading online personal styling service, today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2024, ended August 3, 2024. Fiscal 2024 included 53 weeks, with the additional week occurring in the fourth quarter.\n\n“We are executing our transformation strategy with discipline and, during the fourth quarter, we delivered results at the high end of our guidance on both the top and bottom line,” said Matt Baer, Chief Executive Officer, Stitch Fix. “I am proud of the Stitch Fix team’s efforts this past fiscal year and encouraged by the progress we have already made to strengthen the foundation of our business and reimagine our client experience. While there is a lot of work still to do, I am confident we are on the right path to continue to improve the trajectory of our business which includes returning to revenue growth by the end of FY26.”\n\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we ceased operations of our UK business and met the accounting requirements for reporting the UK business as a discontinued operation. Accordingly, our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect the results of the UK business as a discontinued operation for all periods presented. Unless otherwise noted, amounts and disclosures below relate to our continuing operations.\n\n**Fourth****Quarter Fiscal****2024** **Key Metrics and Financial Highlights**\n\n  * Net revenue of $319.6 million, a decrease of 12.4% year-over-year, or a decrease of 18.3% year-over-year adjusted for the impact of the extra week in Q4’24.\n  * Gross margin of 44.6%, an increase of 50 basis points year-over-year, which reflects improved transportation leverage.\n  * Net loss of $35.7 million and diluted loss per share of $0.29.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA of $9.5 million, which reflects continued cost management discipline.\n  * Free cash flow was $4.5 million in the fourth fiscal quarter.\n  * We ended the quarter with $247.0 million of cash, cash equivalents, and investments; and no debt.\n\n\n\n**Full Year Fiscal 2024** **Key Metrics and Financial Highlights**\n\n  * Net revenue of $1.34 billion, a decrease of 16.0% year-over-year, or a decrease of 17.4% year-over-year adjusted for the impact of the extra week in 2024.\n  * Active clients of 2,508,000, a decrease of 125,000, or 4.7%, quarter-over-quarter; and a decrease of 613,000, or 19.6%, year-over-year.\n  * Net revenue per active client (“RPAC”) of $533, an increase of 4.5% year-over-year.\n  * Gross margin of 44.3%.\n  * Net loss of $118.9 million and diluted loss per share of $0.99.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA of $29.3 million.\n  * Free cash flow was $14.2 million for the full fiscal year.\n\n\n\n**Financial Outlook**\n\nOur financial outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 ending November 2, 2024, is as follows:\n\n**Q1 2025**  \n---  \nNet Revenue | $303 million - $310 million | (17)% - (15)% YoY  \nAdjusted EBITDA | $5 million - $9 million | 1.7% - 2.9% margin  \n  \nOur fiscal year is a 52-week or 53-week period ending on the Saturday closest to July 31. The fiscal year 2025 is a 52-week year and the fiscal year 2024 is a 53-week year, with the extra week occurring in the fourth quarter ending August 3, 2024.\n\nOur financial outlook for fiscal year 2025 is as follows:\n\n**Fiscal Year 2025**  \n---  \nNet Revenue | $1.11 billion - $1.16 billion | (17)% - (13)% YoY  \n(16)% - (12)% YoY adjusted to a 52-week period(1)  \nAdjusted EBITDA | $14 million - $28 million | 1.3% - 2.4% margin  \n(1) Full fiscal year 2024 net revenue from continuing operations has been adjusted to remove the impact of the 53rd week for year-over-year comparative purposes.  \n  \nStitch Fix has not reconciled its Adjusted EBITDA outlook to GAAP net income (loss) because it does not provide an outlook for GAAP net income (loss) due to the uncertainty and potential variability of restructuring and other one-time costs, net other income (expense), provision for income taxes, and stock-based compensation expense, which are reconciling items between Adjusted EBITDA and GAAP net income (loss). Because Stitch Fix cannot reasonably predict such items, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure outlook to the corresponding GAAP measure is not available without unreasonable effort. We caution, however, that such items could have a significant impact on the calculation of GAAP net income (loss). For more information regarding the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this release, please see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast Information**\n\nMatt Baer, Chief Executive Officer of Stitch Fix, and David Aufderhaar, Chief Financial Officer of Stitch Fix, will host a conference call at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time today to discuss the Company’s financial results and outlook.

Measures**\n\nWe report our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide users of our financial information with additional useful information in evaluating our performance. We believe that adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations (“Adjusted EBITDA”) is frequently used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluations of companies, and that this supplemental measure facilitates comparisons between continuing operations of companies. We believe free cash flow from continuing operations (“Free Cash Flow”) is an important metric because it represents a measure of how much cash from continuing operations we have available for discretionary and non-discretionary items after the deduction of capital expenditures. These non-GAAP financial measures may be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n\nOur non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as substitutes for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. There are several limitations related to the use of our non-GAAP financial measures as compared to the closest comparable GAAP measures. Some of these limitations include:\n\n  * Adjusted EBITDA excludes interest income and net other (income) expense as these items are not components of our core business;\n  * Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our provision for income taxes, which may increase or decrease cash available to us;\n  * Adjusted EBITDA excludes the recurring, non-cash expenses of depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and, although these are non-cash expenses, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future;\n  * Adjusted EBITDA excludes the non-cash expense of stock-based compensation, which has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, an important part of how we attract and retain our employees and a significant recurring expense in our business;\n  * Adjusted EBITDA excludes costs incurred related to discrete restructuring plans and other one-time costs attributable to our continuing operations that are fundamentally different in strategic nature and frequency from ongoing initiatives. We believe exclusion of these items facilitates a more consistent comparison of operating performance over time, however these costs do include cash outflows; and\n  * Free Cash Flow does not represent the total residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes and does not reflect our future contractual commitments.\n\n\n\n**_Adjusted EBITDA_**\n\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net loss from continuing operations excluding interest income, net other (income) expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, and restructuring and other one-time costs related to our continuing operations. The following table presents a reconciliation of net loss from continuing operations, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, to Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods presented:\n\n**For the Three Months Ended** | **For the Twelve Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n**(in thousands)** | **August 3, 2024** | **July 29, 2023** | **August 3, 2024** | **July 29, 2023**  \nNet loss from continuing operations | $ | (35,741 | ) | $ | (20,319 | ) | $ | (118,885 | ) | $ | (150,336 | )  \nAdd (deduct):  \nInterest income | (3,327 | ) | (2,027 | ) | (11,250 | ) | (5,841 | )  \nOther (income) expense, net | (651 | ) | (1,018 | ) | (1,631 | ) | 25  \nProvision (benefit) for income taxes | (2,169 | ) | 421 | (1,661 | ) | 871  \nDepreciation and amortization (1) | 8,210 | 9,633 | 35,489 | 38,375  \nStock-based compensation expense | 16,845 | 23,649 | 76,756 | 102,072  \nRestructuring and other one-time costs (2) | 26,356 | 2,772 | 50,463 | 45,749  \n**Adjusted EBITDA** | **$** | **9,523** | **$** | **13,111** | **$** | **29,281** | **$** | **30,915**  \n(1) For the three and twelve months ended August 3, 2024, depreciation and amortization excluded $2.9 million and $12.1 million, respectively, reflected in “Restructuring and other one-time costs.” For the three and twelve months ended July 29, 2023, depreciation and amortization excluded $1.1 million and $2.8 million, respectively, reflected in “Restructuring and other one-time costs.”  \n(2) Restructuring charges for the three and twelve months ended August 3, 2024, were $22.7 million and $43.8 million, respectively. For the three months ended August 3, 2024, this included a $19.3 million impairment charge related to a portion of our corporate office space, recorded in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Restructuring charges for the three and twelve months ended July 29, 2023, were $2.8 million and $39.9 million, respectively.  \n  \n**_Free Cash Flow_**\n\nWe define Free Cash Flow as net cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities from continuing operations, reduced by purchases of property and equipment that are included in cash flows from investing activities from continuing operations.

A client checks out a Fix when she indicates what items she is keeping through our mobile application or on our website. We consider each Women’s, Men’s, or Kids account as a client, even if they share the same household.\n\n**_Net Revenue per Active Client_**\n\nWe calculate net revenue per active client based on net revenue over the preceding four fiscal quarters divided by the number of active clients, measured as of the last day of the period.
