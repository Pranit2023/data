Revenues\nOur revenues are classified into the following two categories:\n• Transaction revenues: Net transaction fees charged to merchants and consumers on a transaction basis based on the Total\nPayment Volume (“TPV”) completed on our payments platform. Growth in TPV is directly impacted by the number of payment\ntransactions that we enable on our payments platform. We generate additional revenue from merchants and consumers: on\ntransactions where we perform currency conversion, when we enable cross-border transactions (i.e., transactions where the\nmerchant and consumer are in different countries), to facilitate the instant transfer of funds for our customers from their PayPal or\nVenmo account to their bank account or debit card, to facilitate the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies, as contractual\ncompensation from sellers that violate our contractual terms (for example, through fraud or counterfeiting), and other\nmiscellaneous fees.\n• Revenues from other value added services: Net revenues derived primarily from revenue earned through partnerships, referral\nfees, subscription fees, gateway fees, and other services we provide to our merchants and consumers. We also earn revenues from\ninterest and fees earned on our portfolio of loans receivable, and interest earned on certain assets underlying customer balances.\nNet Revenues by Type Three Months Ended\nSeptember 30, June 30, March 31, December 31, September 30,\n2024 2024 2024 2023 2023\n(In millions, except percentages)\nTransaction revenues $ 7,067 $ 7,153 $ 7,034 $ 7,283 $ 6,654\nCurrent quarter vs prior quarter (1) % 2 % (3) % 9 % 1 %\nCurrent quarter vs prior year quarter 6 % 9 % 11 % 9 % 7 %\nPercentage of total 90 % 91 % 91 % 91 % 90 %\nRevenues from other value added services $ 780 $ 732 $ 665 $ 743 $ 764\nCurrent quarter vs prior quarter 7 % 10 % (10) % (3) % 5 %\nCurrent quarter vs prior year quarter 2 % — % (2) % 9 % 25 %\nPercentage of total 10 % 9 % 9 % 9 % 10 %\nTotal net revenues $ 7,847 $ 7,885 $ 7,699 $ 8,026 $ 7,418\nCurrent quarter vs prior quarter — % 2 % (4) % 8 % 2 %\nCurrent quarter vs prior year quarter 6 % 8 % 9 % 9 % 8 %\nNet Revenues by Geography Three Months Ended\nSeptember 30, June 30, March 31, December 31, September 30,\n2024 2024 2024 2023 2023\n(In millions, except percentages)\nU.S. net revenues $ 4,518 $ 4,550 $ 4,467 $ 4,639 $ 4,257\nCurrent quarter vs prior quarter (1) % 2 % (4) % 9 % 1 %\nCurrent quarter vs prior year quarter 6 % 8 % 8 % 8 % 7 %\nPercentage of total 58 % 58 % 58 % 58 % 57 %\nInternational net revenues $ 3,329 $ 3,335 $ 3,232 $ 3,387 $ 3,161\nCurrent quarter vs prior quarter — % 3 % (5) % 7 % 3 %\nCurrent quarter vs prior year quarter 5 % 8 % 12 % 10 % 10 %\n(FXN) Current quarter vs prior year quarter 6 % 10 % 14 % 12 % 11 %\nPercentage of total 42 % 42 % 42 % 42 % 43 %\nTotal net revenues $ 7,847 $ 7,885 $ 7,699 $ 8,026 $ 7,418\nCurrent quarter vs prior quarter — % 2 % (4) % 8 % 2 %\nCurrent quarter vs prior year quarter 6 % 8 % 9 % 9 % 8 %\n(FXN) Current quarter vs prior year quarter 6 % 9 % 10 % 9 % 9 %\n3Q 2024 Results 9\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nUnaudited Supplemental Operating Data\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30, June 30, March 31, December 31, September 30,\n2024 2024 2024 2023 2023\n(In millions, except percentages)\nActive accounts(1) 432 429 427 426 428\nCurrent quarter vs prior quarter 1 % — % — % (1) % (1) %\nCurrent quarter vs prior year quarter 1 % — % (1) % (2) % (1) %\nNumber of payment transactions(2) 6,631 6,580 6,505 6,798 6,275\nCurrent quarter vs prior quarter 1 % 1 % (4) % 8 % 3 %\nCurrent quarter vs prior year quarter 6 % 8 % 11 % 13 % 11 %\nPayment transactions per active account(3) 61.4 60.9 60.0 58.7 56.6\nCurrent quarter vs prior quarter 1 % 2 % 2 % 4 % 3 %\nCurrent quarter vs prior year quarter 9 % 11 % 13 % 14 % 13 %\nTPV(4) $ 422,641 $ 416,814 $ 403,860 $ 409,832 $ 387,701\nCurrent quarter vs prior quarter 1 % 3 % (1) % 6 % 3 %\nCurrent quarter vs prior year quarter 9 % 11 % 14 % 15 % 15 %\n(FXN) Current quarter vs prior year quarter 9 % 11 % 14 % 13 % 13 %\nTransaction Expense Rate(5) 0.91 % 0.95 % 0.97 % 0.97 % 0.93 %\nTransaction and Credit Loss Rate(6) 0.08 % 0.08 % 0.08 % 0.10 % 0.12 %\nTransaction Margin(7) 46.6 % 45.8 % 45.0 % 45.8 % 45.4 %\nAmounts in the table are rounded to the nearest million, except as otherwise noted. As a result, certain amounts may not recalculate using\nthe rounded amounts provided.\n(1) An active account is an account registered directly with PayPal or a platform access partner that has completed a transaction on our\nplatform, not including gateway-exclusive transactions, within the past 12 months. A platform access partner is a third party whose\ncustomers are provided access to PayPal’s platform or services through such third party’s login credentials, including individuals and\nentities that utilize Hyperwallet’s payout capabilities. A user may register on our platform to access different products and may register\nmore than one account to access a product. Accordingly, a user may have more than one active account. The number of active accounts\nprovides management with additional perspective on the overall scale of our platform, but may not have a direct relationship to our\noperating results.\n(2) Number of payment transactions is the total number of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments\nplatform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions.\n(3) Number of payment transactions per active account reflects the total number of payment transactions within the previous 12-month\nperiod, divided by active accounts at the end of the period. The number of payment transactions per active account provides management\nwith insight into the average number of times an account engages in payments activity on our payments platform in a given period. The\nnumber of times a consumer account or a merchant account transacts on our platform may vary significantly from the average number of\npayment transactions per active account.\n(4) TPV is the value of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by PayPal via a\npartner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions.\n(5) Transaction expense rate is transaction expense divided by TPV.\n(6) Transaction and credit loss rate is transaction and credit losses divided by TPV.\n(7) Transaction margin is net revenues less transaction expense and transaction and credit losses, divided by net revenues.\n3Q 2024 Results 10\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNon-GAAP Measures of Financial Performance\nTo supplement the company’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,\nor GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP\nnet income, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP effective tax rate, free\ncash flow, and adjusted free cash flow.\nThese non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different\nfrom non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting\nrules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the company’s results of\noperations as determined in accordance with GAAP. These measures should be used to evaluate the company’s results of operations only in\nconjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.\nReconciliation of all non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in the subsequent tables included in this\npress release.\nThese non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors’ overall understanding of the company’s current financial performance and its\nprospects for the future. Specifically, the company believes the non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and investors\nby excluding certain expenses, gains and losses, as the case may be, that may not be indicative of its core operating results and business outlook. In\naddition, because the company has historically reported certain non-GAAP results to investors, the company believes that the inclusion of non-\nGAAP measures provides consistency in the company’s financial reporting.\nFor its internal budgeting process, and as discussed further below, the company’s management uses financial measures that do not include\namortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets, impairment of goodwill, restructuring-related charges, certain other gains, losses, benefits,\nor charges that are not indicative of the company’s core operating results, and the income taxes associated with the foregoing. In addition to the\ncorresponding GAAP measures, the company’s management also uses the foregoing non-GAAP measures in reviewing the financial results of the\ncompany.\nThe company excludes the following items from non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, non-GAAP operating income, non-\nGAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP effective tax rate:\nAmortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets, impairment of goodwill, and transaction expenses from the acquisition or\ndisposal of a business. We incur amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill in connection with acquisitions and\nmay incur significant gains or losses or transactional expenses from the acquisition or disposal of a business and therefore exclude these\namounts from our non-GAAP measures. We exclude these items because management does not believe they are reflective of our ongoing\noperating results.\nRestructuring. These consist of expenses related to workforce reduction and include employee severance and benefits costs, real estate and\nfacilities charges, stock-based compensation expense, and other exit and disposal costs. The company excludes significant restructuring\ncharges primarily because management does not believe they are reflective of ongoing operating results.\nGains and losses on strategic investments. The gains and losses we record on our strategic investments are tied to the performance of the\ncompanies that we invest in. We exclude such gains and losses in full because the operations of the investee and the related gains and losses\nare not indicative of our ongoing operating results.\nCertain other significant gains, losses, benefits, or charges that are not indicative of the company’s core operating results. These are\nsignificant gains, losses, benefits, or charges during a period that are the result of isolated events or transactions that have not occurred\nfrequently in the past and are not expected to occur regularly in the future. The company excludes these amounts from its non-GAAP results\nbecause management does not believe they are indicative of our current or ongoing operating results.\nTax effect of non-GAAP adjustments. This adjustment is made to present the amounts described above on an after-tax basis consistent with\nthe presentation of non-GAAP net income.\nFree cash flow represents operating cash flows less purchases of property and equipment. The company uses free cash flow as a liquidity measure\nthat provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases of property,\nbuildings, and equipment, which can then be used to, among other things, invest in the company’s business, make strategic acquisitions and\ninvestments, and repurchase stock. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance is that it does not represent the\ntotal increase or decrease in the company’s cash balance for the period.\nIn addition to the non-GAAP measures discussed above, the company also analyzes certain measures, including net revenues and operating\nexpenses, on an FX-neutral basis to better measure the comparability of operating results between periods. The company believes that changes in\nforeign currency exchange rates are not indicative of the company’s operations and evaluating growth in net revenues and operating expenses on an\nFX-neutral basis provides an additional meaningful and comparable assessment of these measures to both management and investors. FX-neutral\nresults are calculated by translating the current period’s local currency results with the prior period’s exchange rate. FX-neutral growth rates are\ncalculated by comparing the current period’s FX-neutral results by the prior period’s results, excluding the impact from hedging activities.\n3Q 2024 Results 11\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nReconciliation of GAAP Operating Income to Non-GAAP Operating Income and\nGAAP Operating Margin to Non-GAAP Operating Margin\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023(1)\n(In millions, except percentages)\n(unaudited)\nGAAP net revenues $ 7,847 $ 7,418\nGAAP operating income 1,391 1,168\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets 51 58\nRestructuring(2) 36 3\nOther(3) (1) 23\nTotal non-GAAP operating income adjustments 86 84\nNon-GAAP operating income $ 1,477 $ 1,252\nGAAP operating margin 18 % 16 %\nNon-GAAP operating margin 19 % 17 %\n(1) As announced on February 7, 2024, the Company’s non-GAAP results now include the impact of stock-based compensation expense and\nrelated employer payroll taxes.

Revenues\nOur revenues are classified into the following two categories:\n• Transaction revenues: Net transaction fees charged to merchants and consumers on a transaction basis based on the Total\nPayment Volume (“TPV”) completed on our payments platform. Growth in TPV is directly impacted by the number of payment\ntransactions that we enable on our payments platform. We generate additional revenue from merchants and consumers: on\ntransactions where we perform currency conversion, when we enable cross-border transactions (i.e., transactions where the\nmerchant and consumer are in different countries), to facilitate the instant transfer of funds for our customers from their PayPal or\nVenmo account to their bank account or debit card, to facilitate the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies, as contractual\ncompensation from sellers that violate our contractual terms (for example, through fraud or counterfeiting), and other\nmiscellaneous fees.\n• Revenues from other value added services: Net revenues derived primarily from revenue earned through partnerships, referral\nfees, subscription fees, gateway fees, and other services we provide to our merchants and consumers. We also earn revenues from\ninterest and fees earned on our portfolio of loans receivable, and interest earned on certain assets underlying customer balances.\nNet Revenues by Type Three Months Ended\nSeptember 30, June 30, March 31, December 31, September 30,\n2024 2024 2024 2023 2023\n(In millions, except percentages)\nTransaction revenues $ 7,067 $ 7,153 $ 7,034 $ 7,283 $ 6,654\nCurrent quarter vs prior quarter (1) % 2 % (3) % 9 % 1 %\nCurrent quarter vs prior year quarter 6 % 9 % 11 % 9 % 7 %\nPercentage of total 90 % 91 % 91 % 91 % 90 %\nRevenues from other value added services $ 780 $ 732 $ 665 $ 743 $ 764\nCurrent quarter vs prior quarter 7 % 10 % (10) % (3) % 5 %\nCurrent quarter vs prior year quarter 2 % — % (2) % 9 % 25 %\nPercentage of total 10 % 9 % 9 % 9 % 10 %\nTotal net revenues $ 7,847 $ 7,885 $ 7,699 $ 8,026 $ 7,418\nCurrent quarter vs prior quarter — % 2 % (4) % 8 % 2 %\nCurrent quarter vs prior year quarter 6 % 8 % 9 % 9 % 8 %\nNet Revenues by Geography Three Months Ended\nSeptember 30, June 30, March 31, December 31, September 30,\n2024 2024 2024 2023 2023\n(In millions, except percentages)\nU.S. net revenues $ 4,518 $ 4,550 $ 4,467 $ 4,639 $ 4,257\nCurrent quarter vs prior quarter (1) % 2 % (4) % 9 % 1 %\nCurrent quarter vs prior year quarter 6 % 8 % 8 % 8 % 7 %\nPercentage of total 58 % 58 % 58 % 58 % 57 %\nInternational net revenues $ 3,329 $ 3,335 $ 3,232 $ 3,387 $ 3,161\nCurrent quarter vs prior quarter — % 3 % (5) % 7 % 3 %\nCurrent quarter vs prior year quarter 5 % 8 % 12 % 10 % 10 %\n(FXN) Current quarter vs prior year quarter 6 % 10 % 14 % 12 % 11 %\nPercentage of total 42 % 42 % 42 % 42 % 43 %\nTotal net revenues $ 7,847 $ 7,885 $ 7,699 $ 8,026 $ 7,418\nCurrent quarter vs prior quarter — % 2 % (4) % 8 % 2 %\nCurrent quarter vs prior year quarter 6 % 8 % 9 % 9 % 8 %\n(FXN) Current quarter vs prior year quarter 6 % 9 % 10 % 9 % 9 %\n3Q 2024 Results 9\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nUnaudited Supplemental Operating Data\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30, June 30, March 31, December 31, September 30,\n2024 2024 2024 2023 2023\n(In millions, except percentages)\nActive accounts(1) 432 429 427 426 428\nCurrent quarter vs prior quarter 1 % — % — % (1) % (1) %\nCurrent quarter vs prior year quarter 1 % — % (1) % (2) % (1) %\nNumber of payment transactions(2) 6,631 6,580 6,505 6,798 6,275\nCurrent quarter vs prior quarter 1 % 1 % (4) % 8 % 3 %\nCurrent quarter vs prior year quarter 6 % 8 % 11 % 13 % 11 %\nPayment transactions per active account(3) 61.4 60.9 60.0 58.7 56.6\nCurrent quarter vs prior quarter 1 % 2 % 2 % 4 % 3 %\nCurrent quarter vs prior year quarter 9 % 11 % 13 % 14 % 13 %\nTPV(4) $ 422,641 $ 416,814 $ 403,860 $ 409,832 $ 387,701\nCurrent quarter vs prior quarter 1 % 3 % (1) % 6 % 3 %\nCurrent quarter vs prior year quarter 9 % 11 % 14 % 15 % 15 %\n(FXN) Current quarter vs prior year quarter 9 % 11 % 14 % 13 % 13 %\nTransaction Expense Rate(5) 0.91 % 0.95 % 0.97 % 0.97 % 0.93 %\nTransaction and Credit Loss Rate(6) 0.08 % 0.08 % 0.08 % 0.10 % 0.12 %\nTransaction Margin(7) 46.6 % 45.8 % 45.0 % 45.8 % 45.4 %\nAmounts in the table are rounded to the nearest million, except as otherwise noted. As a result, certain amounts may not recalculate using\nthe rounded amounts provided.\n(1) An active account is an account registered directly with PayPal or a platform access partner that has completed a transaction on our\nplatform, not including gateway-exclusive transactions, within the past 12 months. A platform access partner is a third party whose\ncustomers are provided access to PayPal’s platform or services through such third party’s login credentials, including individuals and\nentities that utilize Hyperwallet’s payout capabilities. A user may register on our platform to access different products and may register\nmore than one account to access a product. Accordingly, a user may have more than one active account. The number of active accounts\nprovides management with additional perspective on the overall scale of our platform, but may not have a direct relationship to our\noperating results.\n(2) Number of payment transactions is the total number of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments\nplatform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions.\n(3) Number of payment transactions per active account reflects the total number of payment transactions within the previous 12-month\nperiod, divided by active accounts at the end of the period. The number of payment transactions per active account provides management\nwith insight into the average number of times an account engages in payments activity on our payments platform in a given period. The\nnumber of times a consumer account or a merchant account transacts on our platform may vary significantly from the average number of\npayment transactions per active account.\n(4) TPV is the value of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by PayPal via a\npartner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions.\n(5) Transaction expense rate is transaction expense divided by TPV.\n(6) Transaction and credit loss rate is transaction and credit losses divided by TPV.\n(7) Transaction margin is net revenues less transaction expense and transaction and credit losses, divided by net revenues.\n3Q 2024 Results 10\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNon-GAAP Measures of Financial Performance\nTo supplement the company’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,\nor GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP\nnet income, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP effective tax rate, free\ncash flow, and adjusted free cash flow.\nThese non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different\nfrom non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting\nrules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the company’s results of\noperations as determined in accordance with GAAP. These measures should be used to evaluate the company’s results of operations only in\nconjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.\nReconciliation of all non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in the subsequent tables included in this\npress release.\nThese non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors’ overall understanding of the company’s current financial performance and its\nprospects for the future. Specifically, the company believes the non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and investors\nby excluding certain expenses, gains and losses, as the case may be, that may not be indicative of its core operating results and business outlook. In\naddition, because the company has historically reported certain non-GAAP results to investors, the company believes that the inclusion of non-\nGAAP measures provides consistency in the company’s financial reporting.\nFor its internal budgeting process, and as discussed further below, the company’s management uses financial measures that do not include\namortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets, impairment of goodwill, restructuring-related charges, certain other gains, losses, benefits,\nor charges that are not indicative of the company’s core operating results, and the income taxes associated with the foregoing. In addition to the\ncorresponding GAAP measures, the company’s management also uses the foregoing non-GAAP measures in reviewing the financial results of the\ncompany.\nThe company excludes the following items from non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, non-GAAP operating income, non-\nGAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP effective tax rate:\nAmortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets, impairment of goodwill, and transaction expenses from the acquisition or\ndisposal of a business. We incur amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill in connection with acquisitions and\nmay incur significant gains or losses or transactional expenses from the acquisition or disposal of a business and therefore exclude these\namounts from our non-GAAP measures. We exclude these items because management does not believe they are reflective of our ongoing\noperating results.\nRestructuring. These consist of expenses related to workforce reduction and include employee severance and benefits costs, real estate and\nfacilities charges, stock-based compensation expense, and other exit and disposal costs. The company excludes significant restructuring\ncharges primarily because management does not believe they are reflective of ongoing operating results.\nGains and losses on strategic investments. The gains and losses we record on our strategic investments are tied to the performance of the\ncompanies that we invest in. We exclude such gains and losses in full because the operations of the investee and the related gains and losses\nare not indicative of our ongoing operating results.\nCertain other significant gains, losses, benefits, or charges that are not indicative of the company’s core operating results. These are\nsignificant gains, losses, benefits, or charges during a period that are the result of isolated events or transactions that have not occurred\nfrequently in the past and are not expected to occur regularly in the future. The company excludes these amounts from its non-GAAP results\nbecause management does not believe they are indicative of our current or ongoing operating results.\nTax effect of non-GAAP adjustments. This adjustment is made to present the amounts described above on an after-tax basis consistent with\nthe presentation of non-GAAP net income.\nFree cash flow represents operating cash flows less purchases of property and equipment. The company uses free cash flow as a liquidity measure\nthat provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases of property,\nbuildings, and equipment, which can then be used to, among other things, invest in the company’s business, make strategic acquisitions and\ninvestments, and repurchase stock. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance is that it does not represent the\ntotal increase or decrease in the company’s cash balance for the period.\nIn addition to the non-GAAP measures discussed above, the company also analyzes certain measures, including net revenues and operating\nexpenses, on an FX-neutral basis to better measure the comparability of operating results between periods. The company believes that changes in\nforeign currency exchange rates are not indicative of the company’s operations and evaluating growth in net revenues and operating expenses on an\nFX-neutral basis provides an additional meaningful and comparable assessment of these measures to both management and investors. FX-neutral\nresults are calculated by translating the current period’s local currency results with the prior period’s exchange rate. FX-neutral growth rates are\ncalculated by comparing the current period’s FX-neutral results by the prior period’s results, excluding the impact from hedging activities.\n3Q 2024 Results 11\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nReconciliation of GAAP Operating Income to Non-GAAP Operating Income and\nGAAP Operating Margin to Non-GAAP Operating Margin\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023(1)\n(In millions, except percentages)\n(unaudited)\nGAAP net revenues $ 7,847 $ 7,418\nGAAP operating income 1,391 1,168\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets 51 58\nRestructuring(2) 36 3\nOther(3) (1) 23\nTotal non-GAAP operating income adjustments 86 84\nNon-GAAP operating income $ 1,477 $ 1,252\nGAAP operating margin 18 % 16 %\nNon-GAAP operating margin 19 % 17 %\n(1) As announced on February 7, 2024, the Company’s non-GAAP results now include the impact of stock-based compensation expense and\nrelated employer payroll taxes.

25\nDefinitions (page 1 of 2)\nOur key metrics are calculated using internal company data based on the activity we measure on our payments platform and compiled from multiple systems, including systems that\nare internally developed or acquired through business combinations. While the measurement of our key metrics is based on what we believe to be reasonable methodologies and\nestimates, there are inherent challenges and limitations in measuring our key metrics globally at our scale. The methodologies used to calculate our key metrics require significant\njudgment.\nWe regularly review our processes for calculating these key metrics, and from time to time we may make adjustments to improve the accuracy or relevance of our metrics. For\nexample, we continuously apply models, processes, and practices designed to detect and prevent fraudulent account creation on our platforms, and work to improve and enhance\nthose capabilities. When we detect a significant volume of illegitimate activity, we generally remove the activity identified from our key metrics. Although such adjustments may\nimpact key metrics reported in prior periods, we generally do not update previously reported key metrics to reflect these subsequent adjustments unless the retrospective impact of\nprocess improvements or enhancements is determined by management to be material.\nActive Accounts: An active account is an account registered directly with PayPal or a platform access partner that has completed a transaction on our platform, not including\ngateway-exclusive transactions, within the past 12 months. A platform access partner is a third party whose customers are provided access to PayPal’s platform or services through\nsuch third party’s login credentials, including individuals and entities that utilize Hyperwallet’s payout capabilities. A user may register on our platform to access different products\nand may register more than one account to access a product. Accordingly, a user may have more than one active account. The number of active accounts provides management with\nadditional perspective on the overall scale of our platform, but may not have a direct relationship to our operating results.\nMonthly Active Accounts or “MAA” are a subset of Active Accounts (primarily PayPal and Venmo)1 that have completed a transaction on our platform at least once during the\nmonth of measurement. The number of MAAs provides management with perspective on the overall scale of our platform reflecting recent usage but may not have a direct\nrelationship to our operating results. MAAs presented at of the end of a quarter or year are the average of each month’s MAAs in the respective quarter or year.\nNumber of Payment Transactions are the total number of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by PayPal via a\npartner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions.\nNumber of Payment Transactions per Active Account or “TPA” reflects the total number of payment transactions within the previous 12-month period, divided by active accounts\nat the end of the period. The number of payment transactions per active account provides management with insight into the average number of times an account engages in\npayments activity on our payments platform in a given period. The number of times a consumer account or a merchant account transacts on our platform may vary significantly from\nthe average number of payment transactions per active account.\nNumber of Payment Transactions per Active Account excluding Unbranded Card Processing2 or “TPA ex. PSP” reflects the total number of payment transactions within the\nprevious 12-month period excluding all unbranded card processing transactions, divided by active accounts at the end of the period excluding unbranded card processing accounts.\nThis metric provides management with insight into the average number of times an account engages in payments activity on our payments platform in a given period, apart from\nunbranded card processing activity.\n(1) MAAs exclude Braintree, Hyperwallet, Zettle, and certain other products that do not reflect engagement from a consumer perspective.\n(2) Unbranded Card Processing is primarily comprises Braintree full-stack transactions and does not include gateway-exclusive transactions. Unbranded\n©2024 PayPal Holdings, Inc. 26\nprocessing also includes unbranded credit and debit card processing on the PayPal platform.\nDefinitions (page 2 of 2)\nTotal Payment Volume or “TPV” is the value of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments platform, or enabled by PayPal via a partner\npayment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions.\nBranded checkout TPV comprises PayPal branded checkout volume and does not include volume associated with Pay with Venmo, eBay, or PayPal P2P (peer to peer).\nPSP (unbranded card processing) TPV primarily comprises Braintree full-stack volume and does not include gateway-exclusive volume. PSP TPV includes unbranded credit and\ndebit card processing on the PayPal platform.\nP2P ex-Venmo TPV primarily comprises PayPal P2P volume, with some contribution from Xoom.\nOther merchant services TPV includes volumes associated with invoicing, Paidy, payouts (including Hyperwallet), point-of-sale solutions (including Zettle), QR code, etc.\nTotal Take Rate is total revenue divided by TPV.\nTransaction Take Rate is transaction revenue divided by TPV.\nTransaction Expense Rate is transaction expense divided by TPV.\nTransaction Loss Rate is transaction losses divided by TPV.\nCredit Loss Rate is credit losses divided by TPV.\nTransaction Margin or “TM” is total revenue less transaction expense and transaction and credit losses, divided by total revenue.\nTransaction Margin Dollars ($) or “TM$” is total revenue less transaction expense and transaction and credit losses.\nTransaction Margin Dollars excluding interest on customer balances is total revenue excluding interest on customer balances, less transaction expense and transaction and credit\nlosses. Interest on customer balances is captured as part of Other Value Added Services (OVAS) revenue in this presentation and in our quarterly/annual SEC filings.\n©2024 PayPal Holdings, Inc. 27\nUpcoming calendar\nFourth Quarter 2024 Earnings February 4, 2025\nInvestor Day (NYC) February 25, 2025\n©2024 PayPal Holdings, Inc. 28"

AND ORGANIZATION\nPayPal Holdings, Inc. (“PayPal,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) was incorporated in Delaware in January 2015 and is a leading technology platform\nthat enables digital payments and personalizes commerce experiences on behalf of merchants and consumers worldwide. PayPal’s mission is to revolutionize\ncommerce globally by creating innovative experiences that are designed to make moving money, selling, and shopping simple, personalized, and secure.\nWe operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened focus by regulators globally on all aspects of the payments\nindustry, including countering terrorist financing, anti-money laundering, privacy, cybersecurity, and consumer protection. The laws and regulations applicable\nto us, including those enacted prior to the advent of digital payments, continue to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation.\nNew or changing laws and regulations, including changes to their interpretation and implementation, as well as increased penalties and enforcement actions\nrelated to non-compliance, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We monitor these areas closely\nand are focused on designing compliant solutions for our customers.\nSIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of presentation and principles of consolidation\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of PayPal and our wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries.\nAll intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nInvestments in entities where we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee are accounted for using the equity method\nof accounting. For such investments, our share of the investee’s results of operations is included in other income (expense), net on our condensed consolidated\nstatements of income (loss). Investments in entities where we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee are accounted for at fair\nvalue or cost minus impairment, if any, adjusted for changes resulting from observable price changes, which are included in other income (expense), net on our\ncondensed consolidated statements of income (loss). Our investment balances are included as short-term and long-term investments on our condensed\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nWe determine at the inception of each investment, and re-evaluate if certain events occur, whether an entity in which we have made an investment is considered\na variable interest entity (“VIE”). If we determine an investment is in a VIE, we then assess if we are the primary beneficiary, which would require\nconsolidation. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, no VIEs qualified for consolidation as the structures of these entities do not provide us with\nthe ability to direct activities that would significantly impact their economic performance. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying\nvalue of our investments in nonconsolidated VIEs was $195 million and $175 million, respectively, and is included as non-marketable equity securities\napplying the equity method of accounting in long-term investments on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The investments in nonconsolidated VIEs\nare primarily investments in funds that are limited partnerships or similar structures which are focused on increasing access to capital for underserved\ncommunities. Our maximum exposure to loss related to our nonconsolidated VIEs, which represents funded commitments and any future funding\ncommitments, was $246 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nThese condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements\nand accompanying notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the “2023 Form 10-K”) filed with the United\nStates (“U.S.”) Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on February 8, 2024.\nIn the opinion of management, these condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments,\nwhich are necessary for a fair statement of the condensed consolidated financial statements for all interim periods presented. Certain amounts for prior periods\nhave been reclassified to conform to the financial statement presentation as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n11\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n(Unaudited)\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the\ndate of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis,\nwe evaluate our estimates, including those related to provisions for transaction and credit losses, income taxes, loss contingencies, revenue recognition, and the\nevaluation of strategic investments for impairment. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions which we believe to be\nreasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could materially differ from these estimates.\nRecent accounting guidance\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic\n280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The amended guidance requires incremental reportable segment disclosures, primarily about\nsignificant segment expenses. The amendments also require entities with a single reportable segment to provide all disclosures required by these amendments,\nas well as all existing segment disclosures. The amendments will be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements and is\neffective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption\npermitted. We will adopt this guidance in the fourth quarter of 2024 and provide additional disclosures as required.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-08, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other – Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60): Accounting for and Disclosure of\nCrypto Assets. This amended guidance requires fair value measurement of certain crypto assets each reporting period with the changes in fair value reflected in\nnet income. The amendments also require disclosures of the name, fair value, units held, and cost basis for each significant crypto asset held and annual\nreconciliations of crypto asset holdings. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December\n15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. We are required to apply these amendments as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning\nof the fiscal year in which the guidance is adopted. Based on our current crypto asset holdings and fair value, the adoption of this guidance is not expected to\nhave a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The amended guidance enhances\nincome tax disclosures primarily related to the effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. This guidance requires disclosure of specific\ncategories in the effective tax rate reconciliation and additional information on reconciling items meeting a quantitative threshold. In addition, the amended\nguidance requires disaggregating income taxes paid (net of refunds received) by federal, state, and foreign taxes. It also requires disaggregating individual\njurisdictions in which income taxes paid (net of refunds received) is equal to or greater than 5 percent of total income taxes paid (net of refunds received). The\namended guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The guidance can be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. We are\nevaluating the impact this amended guidance may have on the footnotes to our condensed consolidated financial statements.\nThere are other new accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB that we have adopted or will adopt, as applicable. We do not believe any of these new\naccounting pronouncements have had, or will have, a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements or disclosures.\nNOTE 2—REVENUE\nWe enable our customers to send and receive payments. We earn revenue primarily by completing payment transactions for our customers on our payments\nplatform and from other value added services. Our revenues are classified into two categories: transaction revenues and revenues from other value added\nservices.\n12\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n(Unaudited)\nDISAGGREGATION OF REVENUE\nWe determine operating segments based on how our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) manages the business, makes operating decisions around the\nallocation of resources, and evaluates operating performance. Our CODM is our Chief Executive Officer, who regularly reviews our operating results on a\nconsolidated basis. We operate as one segment and have one reportable segment. Based on the information provided to and reviewed by our CODM, we\nbelieve that the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of our revenue and cash flows and how they are affected by economic factors are most appropriately\ndepicted through our primary geographical markets and types of revenue categories (transaction revenues and revenues from other value added services).\nRevenues recorded within these categories are earned from similar products and services for which the nature of associated fees and the related revenue\nrecognition models are substantially similar.\nThe following table presents our revenue disaggregated by primary geographical market and category:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(In millions)\nPrimary geographical markets\nU.S. $ 4,518 $ 4,257 $ 13,535 $ 12,614\nOther countries(1) 3,329 3,161 9,896 9,131\nTotal net revenues(2) $ 7,847 $ 7,418 $ 23,431 $ 21,745\nRevenue category\nTransaction revenues $ 7,067 $ 6,654 $ 21,254 $ 19,574\nRevenues from other value added services 780 764 2,177 2,171\nTotal net revenues(2) $ 7,847 $ 7,418 $ 23,431 $ 21,745\n(1) No single country included in the other countries category generated more than 10% of total net revenues.\n(2) Total net revenues include $515 million and $433 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $1.5 billion and $1.3 billion for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which do not represent revenues recognized in the scope of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from contracts with customers. Such\nrevenues relate to interest and fees earned on loans and interest receivable, including loans and interest receivable, held for sale, as well as hedging gains or losses, and interest earned on certain assets\nunderlying customer balances.\nNet revenues are attributed to the country in which the party paying our fee is located.\nNOTE 3—NET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE\nBasic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding\nduring the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) for the period by the weighted average number of shares of\ncommon stock and potentially dilutive common stock outstanding for the period. The dilutive effect of outstanding equity incentive awards is reflected in\ndiluted net income (loss) per share by application of the treasury stock method. The calculation of diluted net income (loss) per share excludes all anti-dilutive\ncommon shares.

We maintain the internal recordkeeping of our customers’ crypto assets, including the amount and type of crypto asset owned by each of our\ncustomers in that custodial account.

All other financial assets and liabilities are valued using\nquoted prices for identical instruments in less active markets, readily available pricing sources for comparable instruments, or models using market observable\ninputs (Level 2).\nA majority of our derivative instruments are valued using pricing models that take into account the contract terms as well as multiple observable inputs where\napplicable, such as currency rates, interest rate yield curves, option volatility, and equity prices (Level 2).\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we did not have any assets or liabilities requiring measurement at fair value on a recurring basis with\nsignificant unobservable inputs that would require a high level of judgment to determine fair value (Level 3).\nWe elect to account for available-for-sale debt securities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries under the fair value\noption.

Accordingly, loans and interest receivable, held for sale are classified within Level 2 in the fair\nvalue hierarchy. Refer to “Note 11—Loans and interest receivable” for additional information on loans and interest receivable, held for sale.\nWe measure the non-marketable equity securities accounted for under the Measurement Alternative at cost minus impairment, if any, adjusted for observable\nprice changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment in the same issuer. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured\nduring the period based on observable price changes are classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the fair value based on\nvaluation methods which only include significant inputs that are observable, such as the observable transaction price at the transaction date. The fair value of\nnon-marketable equity securities are classified within Level 3 when we estimate fair value using significant unobservable inputs such as when we remeasure\ndue to impairment and use discount rates, forecasted cash flows, and market data of comparable companies, among others.\nWe evaluate ROU assets related to leases for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an\nROU asset may not be recoverable. Impairment losses on ROU lease assets related to office operating leases are calculated using estimated rental income per\nsquare foot derived from observable market data, and the impaired asset is classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\nFINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES NOT MEASURED AND RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE\nOur financial instruments, including cash, restricted cash, time deposits, reverse repurchase agreements, loans and interest receivable, net, certain customer\naccounts, and long-term debt related to borrowings on our credit facilities, are carried at amortized cost, which approximates their fair value. Our notes\nreceivable had a carrying value of approximately $521 million and fair value of approximately $506 million as of September 30, 2024. Our notes receivable\nhad a carrying value of approximately $513 million and fair value of approximately $474 million as of December 31, 2023.

Our term debt (including current portion) in the form of fixed rate notes had a carrying value of approximately $10.6 billion and fair value of\napproximately $10.0 billion as of December 31, 2023. If these financial instruments were measured at fair value in the financial statements, cash would be\nclassified as Level 1; restricted cash, time deposits, reverse repurchase agreements, certain customer accounts, and term debt (including current portion) would\nbe classified as Level 2; and the remaining financial instruments would be classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\n30\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n(Unaudited)\nNOTE 10—DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS\nSUMMARY OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS\nOur primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nOur derivatives expose us to credit risk to the extent that our counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the arrangement. We seek to mitigate such risk\nby limiting our counterparties to, and by spreading the risk across, major financial institutions and by entering into collateral security arrangements. In addition,\nthe potential risk of loss with any one counterparty resulting from this type of credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. We do not use any derivative\ninstruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nCash flow hedges\nWe have significant international revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, which subjects us to foreign currency exchange risk. We have a\nforeign currency exposure management program in which we designate certain foreign currency exchange contracts, generally with maturities of 12 months or\nless, to reduce the volatility of cash flows primarily related to forecasted revenues and expenses denominated in certain foreign currencies. The objective of\nthese foreign currency exchange contracts is to help mitigate the risk that the U.S. dollar-equivalent cash flows are adversely affected by changes in the\napplicable U.S. dollar/foreign currency exchange rate. These derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges and accordingly, the derivative’s gain or\nloss is initially reported as a component of AOCI and subsequently reclassified into revenue or applicable expense line item in the condensed consolidated\nstatements of income (loss) in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. We evaluate the effectiveness of our foreign currency exchange\ncontracts on a quarterly basis by comparing the critical terms of the derivative instruments with the critical terms of the forecasted cash flows of the hedged\nitem; if the critical terms are the same, we conclude the hedge will be perfectly effective. We do not exclude any component of the changes in fair value of the\nderivative instruments from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. We report cash flows arising from derivative instruments consistent with the classification\nof cash flows from the underlying hedged items that these derivatives are hedging. Accordingly, the cash flows associated with derivatives designated as cash\nflow hedges are classified in cash flows from operating activities on our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we estimated that $106 million of net derivative losses related to our cash flow hedges included in AOCI are expected to be\nreclassified into earnings within the next 12 months. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we did not discontinue any cash\nflow hedges because it was probable that the original forecasted transaction would not occur and as such, did not reclassify any gains or losses to earnings prior\nto the occurrence of the hedged transaction. If we elect to discontinue our cash flow hedges and it is probable that the original forecasted transaction will occur,\nwe continue to report the derivative’s gain or loss in AOCI until the forecasted transaction affects earnings, at which point we also reclassify it into earnings.\nGains and losses on derivatives held after we discontinue our cash flow hedges and on derivative instruments that are not designated as cash flow hedges are\nrecorded in the same financial statement line item to which the derivative relates.\nNet investment hedges\nWe use forward foreign currency exchange contracts to reduce the foreign currency exchange risk related to our investment in certain foreign subsidiaries.\nThese derivatives are designated as net investment hedges and accordingly, the gains and losses on the portion of the derivatives included in the assessment of\nhedge effectiveness is recorded in AOCI as part of foreign currency translation. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and\nrecognize them in other income (expense), net on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. The accumulated gains and losses associated with these\ninstruments will remain in AOCI until the foreign subsidiaries are sold or substantially liquidated, at which point they will be reclassified into earnings. The\ncash flows associated with derivatives designated as a net investment hedge are classified in cash flows from investing activities on our condensed consolidated\nstatements of cash flows.\nWe have not reclassified any gains or losses related to net investment hedges from AOCI into earnings for any of the periods presented.\n31\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n(Unaudited)\nForeign currency exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments\nWe have a foreign currency exposure management program in which we use foreign currency exchange contracts to offset the foreign currency exchange risk\nof our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. These contracts are not designated as hedging\ninstruments and reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The gains and\nlosses due to remeasurement of certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are recorded in other income (expense), net, which are\noffset by the gains and losses on these foreign currency exchange contracts. The cash flows associated with our non-designated derivatives used to hedge\nforeign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are classified in cash flows from operating activities on our condensed consolidated statements of\ncash flows.\nFAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS\nThe fair value of our outstanding derivative instruments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was as follows:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\nBalance Sheet Location 2024 2023\n(In millions)\nDerivative Assets:\nForeign currency exchange contracts designated as hedging instruments Other current assets $ 42 $ 7\nForeign currency exchange contracts designated as hedging instruments Other assets (non-current) 152 77\nForeign currency exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments Other current assets 20 57\nTotal derivative assets $ 214 $ 141\nDerivative Liabilities:\nForeign currency exchange contracts designated as hedging instruments Other current liabilities $ 111 $ 64\nForeign currency exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments Other current liabilities 50 67\nTotal derivative liabilities $ 161 $ 131\nMASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS - RIGHTS OF SET-OFF\nUnder master netting agreements with certain counterparties to our derivative contracts, repurchase agreements, and reverse repurchase agreements, subject to\napplicable requirements, we are allowed to net settle transactions of the same type with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. PayPal has not\nelected to offset for balance sheet presentation and we present the derivative assets, derivative liabilities, repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase\nagreements on a gross basis on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. Rights of set-off associated with our derivative contracts represented a potential\noffset to both assets and liabilities of $19 million as of September 30, 2024 and $38 million as of December 31, 2023.\nWe have entered into collateral security arrangements with certain counterparties that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of\ncertain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds.

Our revolving\ncredit product consists of PayPal Credit in the U.K., which is made available to consumers as a funding source in their PayPal wallet once they are approved\nfor credit. Additionally, we offer installment credit products at the time of checkout in various markets, including the U.S., several markets across Europe,\nAustralia, and Japan. We offer non interest-bearing installment credit products in these markets as well as interest-bearing installment credit products in the\nU.S. and Germany. We purchase receivables related to interest-bearing installment loans extended to U.S. consumers by an independent chartered financial\ninstitution (“partner institution”) and are responsible for the servicing functions related to that portfolio. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023, we purchased approximately $390 million and $643 million in consumer receivables, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nthe outstanding balance of consumer receivables, which consisted of revolving and installment loans and interest receivable, was $5.1 billion and $4.8 billion,\nrespectively, net of the participation interest sold to the partner institution of $16 million and $14 million, respectively.\nWe closely monitor the credit quality of our consumer receivables to evaluate and manage our related exposure to credit risk. Credit risk management begins\nwith initial underwriting and continues through the full repayment of a loan. To assess a consumer who requests a loan, we use, among other indicators,\ninternally developed risk models using detailed information from external sources, such as credit bureaus where available, and internal data, including the\nconsumer’s prior repayment history with our credit products where available. We use delinquency status and trends to assist in making (or, for interest-bearing\ninstallment loans in the U.S., to assist the partner institution in making) new and ongoing credit decisions, to adjust our models, to plan our collection practices\nand strategies, and in determining our allowance for consumer loans and interest receivable.\nConsumer receivables delinquency and allowance\nThe following tables present the delinquency status and gross charge-offs of consumer loans and interest receivable by year of origination.

Accounts in\nbankruptcy are charged off within 60 days after receipt of notification of bankruptcy. Charge-offs are recorded as a reduction to our allowance for loans and\ninterest receivable and subsequent recoveries, if any, are recorded as an increase to the allowance for loans and interest receivable.\nMerchant receivables\nWe offer access to merchant finance products for certain small and medium-sized businesses through our PayPal Working Capital (“PPWC”) and PayPal\nBusiness Loan (“PPBL”) products, which we collectively refer to as our merchant finance offerings. We purchase receivables related to credit extended to U.S.\nmerchants by a partner institution and are responsible for the servicing functions related to that portfolio. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023, we purchased approximately $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion in merchant receivables, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nthe total outstanding balance in our pool of merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable was $1.4 billion, and $1.2 billion, net of the participation\ninterest sold to the partner institution of $47 million and $44 million, respectively.\nThrough our PPWC product, merchants can borrow a certain percentage of their annual payment volume processed by PayPal and are charged a fixed fee for\nthe loan or advance based on the overall credit assessment of the merchant. Loans and advances are repaid through a fixed percentage of the merchant’s future\npayment volume that PayPal processes. Through our PPBL product, we provide merchants access to short-term business financing for a fixed fee based on an\nevaluation of the applying business as well as the business owner. PPBL repayments are collected through periodic payments until the balance has been\nsatisfied.\nThe interest or fee is fixed at the time the loan or advance is extended and is recognized as deferred revenue in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on\nour condensed consolidated balance sheets. The fixed interest or fee is amortized into revenues from other value added services based on the amount repaid\nover the repayment period. We estimate the repayment period for PPWC based on the merchant’s payment processing history with PayPal. For PPWC, there is\na general requirement that at least 10% of the original amount of the loan or advance plus the fixed fee must be repaid every 90 days. We calculate the\nrepayment rate of the merchant’s future payment volume so that repayment of the loan or advance and fixed fee is expected to generally occur within 9 to 12\nmonths from the date of the loan or advance. On a monthly basis, we recalculate the repayment period based on the repayment activity on the receivable. As\nsuch, actual repayment periods are dependent on actual merchant payment processing volumes. For PPBL, we receive fixed periodic payments over the\ncontractual term of the loan, which generally ranges from 3 to 12 months.\nWe actively monitor receivables with repayment periods greater than the original expected or contractual repayment period, as well as the credit quality of our\nmerchant loans and advances that we extend or purchase, so that we can evaluate, quantify, and manage our credit risk exposure. To assess a merchant seeking\na loan or advance, we use, among other indicators, risk models developed internally which utilize information obtained from multiple internal and external data\nsources to predict the likelihood of timely and satisfactory repayment by the merchant of the loan or advance amount and the related interest or fee. Primary\ndrivers of the models include the merchant’s annual payment volume, payment processing history with PayPal, prior repayment history with PayPal’s credit\nproducts where available, information sourced from consumer and business credit bureau reports, and other information obtained during the application\nprocess. We use delinquency status and trends to assist in making (or, in the U.S., to assist the partner institution in making) ongoing credit decisions, to adjust\nour internal models, to plan our collection strategies, and in determining our allowance for these loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable.\n37\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n(Unaudited)\nMerchant receivables delinquency and allowance\nThe following tables present the delinquency status and gross charge-offs of merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable by year of origination.\nThe amounts are based on the number of days past the expected or contractual repayment date for amounts outstanding.

In the third quarter of 2024, we updated our expected credit loss model for our PPWC portfolio to reflect its current risk\ncharacteristics. These changes did not have a material impact on our provision recorded in the period.\nThe decrease in charge-offs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of the prior year was due to the decrease in\noriginations in the second half of 2023 and improvement in credit quality of the PPBL portfolio.\nFor merchant loans and advances, the determination of delinquency is based on the current expected or contractual repayment period of the loan or advance\nand fixed interest or fee payment as compared to the original expected or contractual repayment period. We charge off the receivables outstanding under our\nPPBL product when the repayments are 180 days past the contractual repayment date. We charge off the receivables outstanding under our PPWC product\nwhen the repayments are 180 days past our expectation of repayments and the merchant has not made a payment in the last 60 days, or when the repayments\nare 360 days past due regardless of whether the merchant has made a payment in the last 60 days. Accounts in bankruptcy are charged off within 60 days after\nreceipt of notification of bankruptcy. The provision for credit losses on merchant loans and advances is recognized in transaction and credit losses on our\ncondensed consolidated statements of income (loss), and the provision for interest and fees receivable is recognized as a reduction of deferred revenue in\naccrued expenses and other current liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. Charge-offs are recorded as a reduction to our allowance for loans\nand interest receivable and subsequent recoveries, if any, are recorded as an increase to the allowance for loans and interest receivable.\nNOTE 12—DEBT\nFIXED RATE NOTES\nIn May 2024, we issued fixed rate notes with varying maturity dates for an aggregate principal amount of $1.3 billion.

Borrowings under the Paidy Credit Agreement are for use by Paidy for working capital,\ncapital expenditures, and other permitted purposes. Loans under the Paidy Credit Agreement bear interest at the Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate plus a margin\n(based on our public debt rating) ranging from 0.40% to 0.60%. The Paidy Credit Agreement will terminate and all amounts owed thereunder will be due and\npayable in February 2027, unless the commitments are terminated earlier. The Paidy Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties,\naffirmative and negative covenants, including a financial covenant, events of default, and indemnification provisions in favor of the lenders. The negative\ncovenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens and subsidiary indebtedness, in each case subject to certain exceptions. The financial covenant\nrequires us to meet a quarterly financial test with respect to a maximum consolidated leverage ratio.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, ¥90.0 billion (approximately $633 million) and ¥50.0 billion (approximately $355 million) was drawn\ndown under the Paidy Credit Agreement, respectively, which was recorded in long-term debt on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. At September 30,\n2024, no borrowing capacity was available for the purposes permitted by the Paidy Credit Agreement.

Certain of these proceedings are in early stages and may seek an indeterminate\namount of damages or penalties or may require us to change or adopt certain business practices. If we believe that a loss arising from such matters is probable\nand can be reasonably estimated, we accrue the estimated liability in our financial statements at that time. If only a range of estimated losses can be determined,\nwe accrue an amount within the range that, in our judgment, reflects the most likely outcome; if none of the estimates within that range is a better estimate than\nany other amount, we accrue the low end of the range. For those proceedings in which an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible but not probable, we\nhave disclosed an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of losses or we have concluded that an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of\nlosses arising directly from the proceeding (i.e., monetary damages or amounts paid in judgment or settlement) are not material. If we cannot estimate the\nprobable or reasonably possible loss or range of losses arising from a legal proceeding, we have disclosed that fact. In assessing the materiality of a legal\nproceeding, we evaluate, among other factors, the amount of monetary damages claimed, as well as the potential impact of non-monetary remedies sought by\nplaintiffs (e.g., injunctive relief) that may require us to change our business practices in a manner that could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWith respect to the matters disclosed in this Note 13, we are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the\napplication of such non-monetary remedies.\nAmounts accrued for legal and regulatory proceedings for which we believe a loss is probable and reasonably estimable were not material as of September 30,\n2024. Except as otherwise noted for the proceedings described in this Note 13, we have concluded, based on currently available information, that reasonably\npossible losses arising directly from the proceedings (i.e., monetary damages or amounts paid in judgment or settlement) in excess of our recorded accruals are\nalso not material. Determining legal reserves or possible losses from such matters involves judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and\nunpredictable outcomes. We may be exposed to losses in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material. If any of our estimates and\nassumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash\nflows.\nRegulatory proceedings\nPayPal Australia Pty Limited (“PPAU”) self-reported a potential violation to the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (“AUSTRAC”) on May\n22, 2019. This self-reported matter relates to PPAU incorrectly filing required international funds transfer instructions over a period of time under the Anti-\nMoney Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (“AML/CTF Act”). On September 23, 2019, PPAU received a notice from AUSTRAC requiring\nthat PPAU appoint an external auditor (a partner of a firm which is not our independent auditor) to review certain aspects of PPAU’s compliance with its\nobligations under the AML/CTF Act. The external auditor was appointed on November 1, 2019.\nAUSTRAC had notified PPAU that its enforcement team was investigating the matters reported upon by the external auditor in its August 31, 2020 final report.\nAs a resolution of this investigation, on March 17, 2023, AUSTRAC’s Chief Executive Officer accepted an enforceable undertaking from PPAU in relation to\nthe self-reported issues.\nThe enforceable undertaking does not include a monetary penalty. The entry into and compliance with the enforceable undertaking will not require a change to\nour business practices in a manner that could result in a material loss, require significant management time, result in the diversion of significant operational\nresources, or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nPPAU is required to deliver an Assurance Action Plan (“AAP”) under the enforceable undertaking to demonstrate that the governance and oversight\narrangements following the remedial work completed by PPAU are sustainable and appropriate. The enforceable undertaking requires PPAU to appoint an\nexternal auditor. The external auditor was appointed on June 22, 2023 to assess and report on the appropriateness, sustainability and efficacy of the actions to\nbe taken under the AAP. PPAU provided the external auditor’s final report to AUSTRAC on April 16, 2024. The successful completion of the enforceable\nundertaking is subject to AUSTRAC’s ultimate review and decision based on the external auditor’s final report. We cannot predict the outcome of AUSTRAC’s\ndecision.\n42\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n(Unaudited)\nAny failure to comply with the enforceable undertaking could result in penalties or require us to change our business practices.\nIn February 2022, we received a Civil Investigative Demand (“CID”) from the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) related to PayPal’s practices relating to\ncommercial customers that submit charges on behalf of other merchants or sellers, and related activities. The CID requests the production of documents and\nanswers to written questions. We are cooperating with the FTC in connection with this CID.\nIn January 2023, we received notice of an administrative proceeding and a related request for information from the German Federal Cartel Office (“FCO”)\nrelated to terms in PayPal (Europe) S.à.r.l. et Cie, S.C.A.’s contractual terms with merchants in Germany prohibiting surcharging and requiring parity\npresentation of PayPal relative to other payment methods. We are cooperating with the FCO in connection with this proceeding.\nWe have received CIDs from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) related to investigation and error-resolution obligations under Regulation E,\nthe presentment of transactions to linked bank accounts, and related matters. The CIDs request the production of documents and answers to written questions.\nWe are cooperating with the CFPB in connection with these CIDs.\nOn November 1, 2023, we received a subpoena from the U.S. SEC Division of Enforcement relating to PayPal USD stablecoin. The subpoena requests the\nproduction of documents. We are cooperating with the SEC in connection with this request.\nIn August 2024, we received a CID from the CFPB related to PayPal Credit. The CID also relates to backup payment options in a digital wallet to pay for\ngoods or services. The CID requests the production of documents and answers to written questions. We are cooperating with the CFPB in connection with this\nCID.\nLegal proceedings\nOn October 4, 2022, a putative securities class action captioned Defined Benefit Plan of the Mid-Jersey Trucking Industry and Teamsters Local 701 Pension\nand Annuity Fund v. PayPal Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 22-cv-5864, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. On January 11,\n2023, the Court appointed Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec as lead plaintiff and renamed the action In re PayPal Holdings, Inc. Securities Litigation\n(“PPH Securities Action”). On March 13, 2023, the lead plaintiff filed an amended and consolidated complaint. The PPH Securities Action asserts claims\nrelating to our public statements with respect to net new active accounts (“NNA”) results and guidance, and the detection of illegitimately created accounts.\nThe PPH Securities Action purports to be brought on behalf of purchasers of the Company’s stock between February 3, 2021 and February 1, 2022 (the “Class\nPeriod”), and asserts claims for alleged violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act against the Company, as well as its former Chief Executive Officer,\nformer Chief Strategy, Growth and Data Officer, and former Chief Financial Officer (collectively, the “Individual Defendants,” and together with the Company,\n“Defendants”), and for alleged violations of Sections 20(a) and 20A of the Exchange Act against the Individual Defendants. The complaint alleges that certain\npublic statements made by Defendants during the Class Period were rendered materially false and misleading (which, allegedly, caused the Company’s stock to\ntrade at artificially inflated prices) by the Defendants’ failure to disclose that, among other things, the Company’s incentive campaigns were susceptible to\nfraud and led to the creation of illegitimate accounts, which allegedly affected the Company’s NNA results and guidance. The PPH Securities Action seeks\nunspecified compensatory damages on behalf of the putative class members. Defendants have filed a motion to dismiss the PPH Securities Action, which is\nfully briefed and pending before the court.\nOn November 2, 2022, a putative shareholder derivative action captioned Shah v. Daniel Schulman, et al., Case No. 22-cv-1445, was filed in the U.S. District\nCourt for the District of Delaware (the “Shah Action”), purportedly on behalf of the Company. On April 4, 2023, a putative shareholder derivative action\ncaptioned Nelson v. Daniel Schulman, et. al., Case No. 23-cv-01913, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey (the “Nelson Action”)\npurportedly on behalf of the Company. The Shah and Nelson Actions are based on the same alleged facts and circumstances as the PPH Securities Action, and\nname certain of our officers, including our former Chief Executive Officer and former Chief Financial Officer, and members of our Board of Directors, as\ndefendants. The Shah and Nelson Actions allege claims for breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of\ncorporate assets, gross mismanagement and violations of the Exchange Act, and seek to recover damages on behalf of the Company. The Shah and Nelson\nActions have been stayed pending further developments in the PPH Securities Action.\n43\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n(Unaudited)\nOn December 20, 2022, a civil lawsuit captioned State of Hawai‘i, by its Office of Consumer Protection, v. PayPal, Inc., and PayPal Holdings, Inc., Case No.\n1CCV-22-0001610, was filed in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit of the State of Hawai‘i (the “Hawai‘i Action”). The Hawai‘i Action asserts claims for\nunfair and deceptive acts and practices under Hawai‘i Revised Statutes Sections 480-2(a) and 481A-3(a). Plaintiff seeks injunctive relief as well as unspecified\npenalties and other monetary relief. On July 14, 2023, the court denied Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint. Trial is scheduled to begin in October\n2025.\nGeneral matters\nOther third parties have from time to time claimed, and others may claim in the future, that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. We are subject\nto patent disputes and expect that we will increasingly be subject to additional patent infringement claims involving various aspects of our business as our\nproducts and services continue to expand in scope and complexity. Such claims may be brought directly or indirectly against our companies and/or against our\ncustomers (who may be entitled to contractual indemnification under their contracts with us), and we are subject to increased exposure to such claims as a\nresult of our acquisitions, particularly in cases where we are introducing new products or services in connection with such acquisitions. We have in the past\nbeen forced to litigate such claims, and we believe that additional lawsuits alleging such claims will be filed against us. Intellectual property claims, whether\nmeritorious or not, are time-consuming and costly to defend and resolve, could require expensive changes in our methods of doing business, or could require us\nto enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms or make substantial payments to settle claims or to satisfy damages awarded by courts.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in other disputes or regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business, including suits by our consumers\n(individually or as class actions), merchants or regulators alleging, among other things, improper disclosure of our prices, rules, or policies, that our practices,\nprices, rules, policies, or user, product, business or merchant agreements violate applicable law, or that we have acted unfairly or not acted in conformity with\nsuch prices, rules, policies, or agreements. In addition to these types of disputes and regulatory inquiries, our operations are also subject to regulatory and legal\nreview and challenges that may reflect the increasing global regulatory focus to which the payments industry is subject and, when taken as a whole with other\nregulatory and legislative action, such actions could result in the imposition of costly new compliance burdens on our business and customers and may lead to\nincreased costs and decreased transaction volume and revenue. Further, the number and significance of these disputes and inquiries are increasing as our\nbusiness has grown and expanded in scale and scope, including the number of active accounts and payments transactions on our platform, the range and\nincreasing complexity of the products and services that we offer, and our geographical operations. Any claims or regulatory actions against us, whether\nmeritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, settlement payments, damage awards (including statutory damages for certain causes of\naction in certain jurisdictions), fines, penalties, injunctive relief, or increased costs of doing business through adverse judgment or settlement, require us to\nchange our business practices in expensive ways, require significant amounts of management time, result in the diversion of significant operational resources,\nor otherwise harm our business.\nINDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS\nOur agreements with eBay governing our separation from eBay provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations for both eBay and us. Disputes between\neBay and us have arisen and others may arise in the future, and an adverse outcome in such matters could materially and adversely impact our business, results\nof operations, and financial condition. In addition, the indemnity rights we have against eBay under the agreements may not be sufficient to protect us, and our\nindemnity obligations to eBay may be significant.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we include indemnification provisions in certain of our agreements with parties with whom we have commercial\nrelationships. Under these contracts, we generally indemnify, hold harmless, and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the\nindemnified party in connection with claims by any third party with respect to our domain names, trademarks, logos, and other branding elements to the extent\nthat such marks are related to the subject agreement. We have provided an indemnity for other types of third-party claims, which may include indemnities\nrelated to intellectual property rights, confidentiality, willful misconduct, data privacy obligations, and certain breach of contract claims, among others. We\nhave also provided an indemnity to our payments processors in the event of card association fines against the processor arising out of conduct by us or our\ncustomers. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential loss under these indemnification provisions due to our limited history of prior indemnification\nclaims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular situation.\n44\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n(Unaudited)\nPayPal has participated in the U.S. Government’s Paycheck Protection Program administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration. Loans made under\nthis program were funded by an independent chartered financial institution that we partnered with. We received a fee for providing services in connection with\nthese loans and retained operational and audit risk related to those activities. We have agreed, under certain circumstances, to indemnify the chartered financial\ninstitution and its assignee of a portion of these loans in connection with the services provided for loans made under this program.\nAs part of the agreement to sell a portion of our consumer installment receivables portfolio, in certain circumstances such as breaches in loan warranties, we\nmay be required to indemnify the global investment firm that purchased the loans or repurchase the loans. The estimate of the maximum potential amount of\nfuture payments we may be required to make is equal to the current outstanding balances of the loans sold; however, the maximum potential amount of the\nindemnification is not, in our view, representative of the expected future exposure. As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding balances of the loans sold was\n$2.7 billion. The terms of the indemnification align to the maturities of the loans sold.\nTo date, no significant costs have been incurred, either individually or collectively, in connection with our indemnification provisions.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future\nmaterial effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.\nPROTECTION PROGRAMS\nWe provide merchants and consumers with protection programs for certain transactions completed on our payments platform. These programs are intended to\nprotect both merchants and consumers from loss primarily due to fraud and counterparty performance. Our Purchase Protection Program provides protection to\nconsumers for qualifying purchases by reimbursing the consumer for the full amount of the purchase if a purchased item does not arrive or does not match the\nseller’s description. Our Seller Protection Programs provide protection to merchants against claims that a transaction was not authorized by the buyer or claims\nthat an item was not received by covering the seller for the full amount of the payment on eligible sales. These protection programs are considered assurance-\ntype warranties under applicable accounting standards for which we estimate and record associated costs in transaction and credit losses during the period the\npayment transaction is completed.\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the allowance for transaction losses was $89 million and $64 million, respectively. The allowance for negative\ncustomer balances was $217 million and $218 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The following table shows changes in the\nallowance for transaction losses and negative customer balances related to our protection programs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in millions)\nBeginning balance $ 270 $ 346 $ 282 $ 278\nProvision 264 329 783 915\nRealized losses (281) (417) (876) (970)\nRecoveries 53 39 117 74\nEnding balance $ 306 $ 297 $ 306 $ 297\nNOTE 14—STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAMS\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased approximately 77 million shares of our common stock for approximately $4.8 billion at an\naverage cost of $62.29, excluding excise tax. These shares were purchased in the open market under our stock repurchase program authorized in June 2022. As\nof September 30, 2024, a total of approximately $6.1 billion remained available for future repurchases of our common stock under our June 2022 stock\nrepurchase program.\n45\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n(Unaudited)\nThe Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 imposed a nondeductible 1% excise tax on the net value of certain stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022.\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2023, we have reflected the applicable excise tax in treasury stock on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. During the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded $40 million in excise tax within treasury stock on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The\npayable associated with the excise tax is a non-cash financing activity which is not reflected on the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows until\nsettled.\nNOTE 15—STOCK-BASED PLANS\nIn May 2024, our stockholders approved the authorization of an additional 20 million shares to the Amended and Restated PayPal Holdings, Inc. 2015 Equity\nIncentive Award Plan.\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE\nStock-based compensation expense for our equity incentive plans are measured based on their estimated fair value at the time of grant and recognized over the\naward’s vesting period.\nThe impact on our results of operations of recording stock-based compensation expense under our equity incentive plans for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023 was as follows:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(In millions)\nCustomer support and operations $ 50 $ 79 $ 173 $ 227\nSales and marketing 30 44 108 132\nTechnology and development 111 156 366 453\nGeneral and administrative 81 115 257 315\nRestructuring and other 28 — 88 —\nTotal stock-based compensation expense $ 300 $ 394 $ 992 $ 1,127\nCapitalized as part of internal use software and website development costs $ 32 $ 14 $ 77 $ 38\nNOTE 16—INCOME TAXES\nOur effective tax rate for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 23%. Our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 was 18% and 21%, respectively. The difference between our effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% in the periods\npresented was primarily the result of foreign income taxed at different rates, tax expense related to stock-based compensation and other discrete tax\nadjustments.\nGross unrecognized tax benefits were approximately $2.3 billion and $2.2 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Due to\nvarious factors, including uncertainties of the judicial, administrative, and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the timing of the resolution of these\nunrecognized tax benefits is highly uncertain. It is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months, we may receive additional tax adjustments by\nvarious tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of audits in one or more jurisdictions. These adjustments or settlements could result in changes to our\nunrecognized tax benefits related to positions on prior year tax filings. We also continue to accrue unrecognized tax benefits for certain recurring tax positions.\nNOTE 17—RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, management initiated a global workforce reduction intended to streamline operations, focus resources on core strategic\npriorities, and improve our cost structure. The associated restructuring charges during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $36 million\nand $294 million, respectively, and included employee severance and benefits costs and stock-based compensation expense, substantially all of which were\naccrued for as of September 30, 2024.\n46\nTable of Contents\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n(Unaudited)\nThe following table summarizes the restructuring reserve activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2024:\nEmployee Severance and Benefits\nCosts\n(In millions)\nAccrued liability as of January 1, 2024 $ —\nCharges(1) 206\nPayments (182)\nAccrued liability as of September 30, 2024(2) $ 24\n(1) Excludes stock-based compensation expense of $88 million.\n(2) Accrued restructuring liability is included in “accrued expenses and other current liabilities” on our condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nDuring the first quarter of 2023, management initiated a global workforce reduction intended to focus resources on core strategic priorities, and improve our\ncost structure and operating efficiency. The associated restructuring charges during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were $3 million and\n$120 million, respectively. We primarily incurred employee severance and benefits costs, which were substantially completed by the fourth quarter of 2023.\nWe continue to review our real estate and facility capacity requirements due to our new and evolving work models. We incurred asset impairment charges of nil\nin the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and $18 million and $61 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively,\ndue to exiting of certain leased properties, which resulted in a reduction of ROU lease assets and related leasehold improvements. Additionally, we recognized\na gain of $17 million due to the sale of an owned property and we also incurred a loss of $12 million related to another owned property held for sale in the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately $28 million and $92 million, respectively, of losses were recorded in restructuring\nand other, which included net loss on sale of loans and interest receivable previously held for sale and fair value adjustments to measure loans and interest\nreceivable, held for sale, at the lower of cost or fair value. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, approximately $15 million and $49\nmillion, respectively, of losses were recorded in restructuring and other, which included fair value adjustments to measure loans and interest receivable, held for\nsale, at the lower of cost or fair value.\n47\nTable of Contents\nITEM 2: MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including statements that involve expectations, plans, or intentions (such as those relating to future business, future results\nof operations or financial condition, new or planned features or services, mergers or acquisitions, or management strategies). These forward-looking\nstatements can be identified by words such as “may,” “will,” “would,” “should,” “could,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “intend,”\n“continue,” “strategy,” “future,” “opportunity,” “plan,” “project,” “forecast,” and other similar expressions. These forward-looking statements involve risks\nand uncertainties that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking\nstatements. Such risks and uncertainties include, among others, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023 (the “2023 Form 10-K”), as supplemented in the risk factors set forth below in Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Form 10-\nQ, as well as in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, related notes, and the other information appearing in this report and our other\nfilings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not intend, and undertake no obligation except as required by law, to update any of our forward-\nlooking statements after the date of this report to reflect actual results, new information, or future events or circumstances. Given these risks and uncertainties,\nreaders are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. You should read the following “Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nof Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes that\nappear in this report. Unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires, references to “we,” “our,” “us,” “the Company,” and “PayPal”\nrefer to PayPal Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\nTHE COMPANY\nWe are a leading technology platform that enables digital payments and personalizes commerce experiences on behalf of merchants and consumers worldwide.\nPayPal’s mission is to revolutionize commerce globally by creating innovative experiences that are designed to make moving money, selling, and shopping\nsimple, personalized, and secure.\nRegulatory environment\nWe operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened focus by regulators globally on all aspects of the payments\nindustry, including countering terrorist financing, anti-money laundering, privacy, cybersecurity, and consumer protection. The laws and regulations applicable\nto us, including those enacted prior to the advent of digital payments, continue to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation.\nNew or changing laws and regulations, including changes to their interpretation and implementation, as well as increased penalties and enforcement actions\nrelated to non-compliance, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We monitor these areas closely\nand are focused on designing compliant solutions for our customers.\nCybersecurity and information security\nCybersecurity and information security risks for global payments and technology companies like us have increased significantly in recent years. Although we\nhave developed systems and processes designed to protect the data we manage, prevent data loss and other security incidents, and enable us to effectively\nrespond to known and potential risks, and expect to continue to expend significant resources to bolster these protections, we have experienced and expect to\ncontinue to experience cybersecurity incidents and remain subject to these risks. There can be no assurance that our security measures will provide sufficient\nprotection or security to prevent breaches or attacks. For additional information regarding our cybersecurity and information security risks, see Part I, Item 1A,\nRisk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K, as supplemented and, to the extent inconsistent, superseded below (if applicable) in Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors of this\nForm 10-Q.\nMACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT\nThe broader implications of the macroeconomic environment, including uncertainty around international conflicts such as the Russia and Ukraine conflict,\nsupply chain shortages, a recession globally or in markets in which we operate, higher inflation rates, higher interest rates, and other related global economic\nconditions, remain unknown. A deterioration in macroeconomic conditions could continue to increase the risk of lower consumer spending, merchant and\nconsumer bankruptcy, insolvency, business failure, higher credit losses, foreign currency exchange fluctuations, or other business interruption, which may\nadversely impact our business. If these conditions continue or worsen, they could adversely impact our future financial and operating results.\n48\nTable of Contents\nOVERVIEW OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table provides a summary of our condensed consolidated financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\nPercent Percent\n2024 2023 Increase/(Decrease) 2024 2023 Increase/(Decrease)\n(In millions, except percentages and per share data)\nNet revenues $ 7,847 $ 7,418 6 % $ 23,431 $ 21,745 8 %\nOperating expenses 6,456 6,250 3 % 19,547 18,445 6 %\nOperating income $ 1,391 $ 1,168 19 % $ 3,884 $ 3,300 18 %\nOperating margin 18 % 16 % ** 17 % 15 % **\nOther income (expense), net $ (80) $ 73 (210)% $ 35 $ 318 (89)%\nIncome tax expense 301 221 36 % 893 774 15 %\nEffective tax rate 23 % 18 % ** 23 % 21 % **\nNet income (loss) $ 1,010 $ 1,020 (1)% $ 3,026 $ 2,844 6 %\nNet income (loss) per diluted share $ 0.99 $ 0.93 6 % $ 2.89 $ 2.55 13 %\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 1,614 $ 1,259 28 % $ 5,056 $ 2,229 127 %\nAll amounts in tables are rounded to the nearest million, except as otherwise noted. As a result, certain amounts may not recalculate using the rounded amounts provided.\n** Not meaningful.\nTHREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND 2023\nNet revenues increased $429 million, or 6%, in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of the prior year driven primarily by\ngrowth in total payment volume (“TPV”, as defined below under “Key Metrics”) of 9%.\nTotal operating expenses increased $206 million, or 3%, in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of the prior year due\nprimarily to higher transaction expense partially offset by a reduction in transaction and credit losses.\nOperating income increased $223 million, or 19%, in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of the prior year due to net\nrevenues growing more than operating expenses. Our operating margin was 18% and 16% in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively, reflecting the positive impact of lower transaction and credit losses.\nNet income decreased $10 million, or 1%, in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of the prior year due to the previously\ndiscussed increase in operating income of $223 million, partially offset by a decrease in other income (expense), net of $153 million driven primarily by net\nlosses on strategic investments in the current period compared to net gains in the prior period and an increase in income tax expense of $80 million due\nprimarily to higher income before taxes, changes in jurisdictional mix of income, and U.S. income taxed at different rates.\nNINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND 2023\nNet revenues increased $1.7 billion, or 8%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of the prior year driven primarily by\ngrowth in TPV of 11%.\nTotal operating expenses increased $1.1 billion, or 6%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of the prior year due\nprimarily to an increase in transaction expense and, to a lesser extent, restructuring and other partially offset by a reduction in transaction and credit losses and\ncustomer support and operations expenses.\nOperating income increased $584 million, or 18%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of the prior year due to net\nrevenues growing more than operating expenses. Our operating margin was 17% and 15% in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively, reflecting the positive impact of operating efficiencies in our business and lower transaction and credit losses, partially offset by the negative\nimpact of an increase in transaction expense.\n49\nTable of Contents\nNet income increased $182 million, or 6%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of the prior year due to the previously\ndiscussed increase in operating income of $584 million partially offset by a decrease of $283 million in other income (expense), net driven primarily by net\nlosses on strategic investments in the current period compared to net gains in the prior period and an increase in income tax expense of $119 million due\nprimarily to higher income before taxes, changes in jurisdictional mix of income, and U.S. income taxed at different rates.\nIMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES\nWe have significant international operations that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound, Euro, Australian dollar, and Canadian\ndollar, subjecting us to foreign currency exchange risk which may adversely impact our financial results. The strengthening or weakening of the United States\n(“U.S.”) dollar versus foreign currencies in which we conduct our international operations impacts the translation of our net revenues and expenses generated\nin these foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar. We generated approximately 42% of our net revenues from customers domiciled outside of the U.S. in both the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 43% and 42% in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Because we\ngenerate substantial net revenues internationally, we are subject to the risks of doing business outside of the U.S. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our 2023\nForm 10-K, as supplemented and, to the extent inconsistent, superseded (if applicable) below in Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors of this Form 10-Q.\nWe calculate the year-over-year impact of foreign currency exchange movements on our business using prior period foreign currency exchange rates applied to\ncurrent period transactional currency amounts. While changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect our reported results, we have a foreign currency\nexchange exposure management program in which we use foreign currency exchange contracts, designated as cash flow hedges, intended to reduce the impact\non earnings from foreign currency exchange rate movements. Gains and losses from these foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized as a component\nof transaction revenues or operating expenses (as applicable) in the same period the forecasted transactions impact earnings.\nIn the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, year-over-year foreign currency exchange rate movements relative to the U.S. dollar had the following\nimpact on our reported results:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2024\n(In millions)\nFavorable impact to net revenues (exclusive of hedging impact) $ 12 $ 11\nHedging impact (12) 10\nFavorable impact to net revenues — 21\n(Unfavorable) favorable impact to operating expense (10) 2\nNet (unfavorable) favorable impact to operating income $ (10) $ 23\nWhile we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to help reduce the impact on earnings from foreign currency exchange rate movements, it is\nimpossible to predict or eliminate the total effects of this exposure.\nWe also use foreign currency exchange contracts, designated as net investment hedges, to reduce the foreign currency exchange risk related to our investment\nin certain foreign subsidiaries. Gains and losses associated with these instruments will remain in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the\nunderlying foreign subsidiaries are sold or substantially liquidated.\nGiven that we also have foreign currency exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our\nsubsidiaries, we have an additional foreign currency exchange exposure management program in which we use foreign currency exchange contracts to help\noffset the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency exchange gains and losses on our assets and\nliabilities are recorded in other income (expense), net, and are offset by the gains and losses on the foreign currency exchange contracts. These foreign currency\nexchange contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities.\nAdditionally, in connection with transactions occurring in multiple currencies on our payments platform, we generally set our foreign currency exchange rates\ndaily and may face financial exposure if we incorrectly set our foreign currency exchange rates or as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates\nbetween the times that we set our foreign currency exchange rates and when transactions occur. While we have processes in place to mitigate these risks, it is\nimpossible to eliminate the total effects of any possible exposure associated with setting rates on our platform.\n50\nTable of Contents\nKEY METRICS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS\nKEY METRICS\nTPV, number of payment transactions, active accounts, and number of payment transactions per active account are key non-financial performance metrics\n(“key metrics”) that management uses to measure the scale of our platform and the relevance of our products and services to our customers, and are defined as\nfollows:\n• TPV is the value of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment\nsolution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions.\n• Number of payment transactions is the total number of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments platform or\nenabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions.\n• An active account is an account registered directly with PayPal or a platform access partner that has completed a transaction on our platform, not\nincluding gateway-exclusive transactions, within the past 12 months. A platform access partner is a third party whose customers are provided access to\nPayPal’s platform or services through such third party’s login credentials, including individuals and entities that utilize Hyperwallet’s payout\ncapabilities. A user may register on our platform to access different products and may register more than one account to access a product. Accordingly,\na user may have more than one active account. The number of active accounts provides management with additional perspective on the overall scale\nof our platform, but may not have a direct relationship to our operating results.\n• Number of payment transactions per active account reflects the total number of payment transactions within the previous 12-month period, divided by\nactive accounts at the end of the period. The number of payment transactions per active account provides management with insight into the average\nnumber of times an account engages in payments activity on our payments platform in a given period. The number of times a consumer account or a\nmerchant account transacts on our platform may vary significantly from the average number of payment transactions per active account.\nAs our transaction revenue is typically correlated with TPV growth and the number of payment transactions completed on our payments platform, management\nuses these metrics to gain insights into the scale and strength of our payments platform, the engagement level of our customers, and underlying activity and\ntrends which may be indicators of current and future performance. We present these key metrics to enhance investors’ evaluation of the performance of our\nbusiness and operating results.\nOur key metrics are calculated using internal company data based on the activity we measure on our payments platform and compiled from multiple systems,\nincluding systems that are internally developed or acquired through business combinations. While the measurement of our key metrics is based on what we\nbelieve to be reasonable methodologies and estimates, there are inherent challenges and limitations in measuring our key metrics globally at our scale. The\nmethodologies used to calculate our key metrics require significant judgment.\nWe regularly review our processes for calculating these key metrics, and from time to time we may make adjustments to improve the accuracy or relevance of\nour metrics. For example, we continuously apply models, processes, and practices designed to detect and prevent fraudulent account creation on our platforms,\nand work to improve and enhance those capabilities. When we detect a significant volume of illegitimate activity, we generally remove the activity identified\nfrom our key metrics. Although such adjustments may impact key metrics reported in prior periods, we generally do not update previously reported key metrics\nto reflect these subsequent adjustments unless the retrospective impact of process improvements or enhancements is determined by management to be material.\n51\nTable of Contents\nNET REVENUES\nOur revenues are classified into the following two categories:\n• Transaction revenues: Net transaction fees charged to merchants and consumers on a transaction basis based on the TPV completed on our payments\nplatform. Growth in TPV is directly impacted by the number of payment transactions that we enable on our payments platform. We generate\nadditional revenue from merchants and consumers: on transactions where we perform currency conversion, when we enable cross-border transactions\n(i.e., transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries), to facilitate the instant transfer of funds for our customers from their\nPayPal or Venmo account to their bank account or debit card, to facilitate the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies, as contractual compensation from\nsellers that violate our contractual terms (for example, through fraud or counterfeiting), and other miscellaneous fees.\n• Revenues from other value added services: Net revenues derived primarily from revenue earned through partnerships, referral fees, subscription fees,\ngateway fees, and other services we provide to our merchants and consumers. We also earn revenues from interest and fees earned on our portfolio of\nloans receivable and interest earned on certain assets underlying customer balances.\nNet revenue analysis\nThe components of our net revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows (in millions):\nTransaction revenues\nTransaction revenues grew by $413 million, or 6%, and $1.7 billion, or 9%, in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same\nperiods of the prior year driven primarily by growth in TPV and the number of payment transactions from our Braintree products and services and, to a lesser\nextent, from our core PayPal and Venmo products and services. Transaction revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were also impacted\nunfavorably by lower net gains from hedging activities as compared to the same period of the prior year.\nAs a result of ongoing negotiations with merchants, we expect lower volume and transaction revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2024 and into 2025 from\nour Braintree products and services.\n52\nTable of Contents\nThe graphs below present the respective key metrics (in millions) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\n*Reflects active accounts at the end of the applicable period.\nNumber of payment transactions\nTPV\nThe following table provides a summary of related metrics:\nThree Months Ended September Nine Months Ended\n30, Percent September 30, Percent\nIncrease/(Decrease) Increase/(Decrease)\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNumber of payment transactions per active account 61.4 56.6 9 % 61.4 56.6 9 %\nPercent of cross-border TPV(1) 12 % 12 % ** 12 % 12 % **\n(1) Cross-border TPV occurs primarily between two PayPal accounts in different countries and includes transactions initiated through our Xoom product.\n** Not meaningful\n53\nTable of Contents\nWe had active accounts of 432 million and 428 million as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our total number of payment transactions was 6.6\nbillion and 6.3 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 6%. Our total number of payment transactions was\n19.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 18.2 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 8%. TPV\nwas $423 billion and $388 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 9%. TPV was $1.2 trillion for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 compared to $1.1 trillion in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 11%.\nTransaction revenues growth was lower than the growth in TPV in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in the\nprior year due primarily to unfavorable changes in mix from core PayPal products and services and unfavorable impact from foreign exchange fees. For the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024, these unfavorable impacts to transaction revenues growth were partially offset by favorable impact from Braintree\nproducts and services.\nRevenues from other value added services\nRevenues from other value added services increased $16 million and $6 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively,\ncompared to the same periods in the prior year due primarily to an increase in interest earned on certain assets underlying customer account balances resulting\nprimarily from higher interest rates and higher customer balances, partially offset by a decline in the revenue share earned from an independent chartered\nfinancial institution. Revenues from other value added services for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were also impacted by lower interest and fee\nrevenue on our loans receivable portfolio driven by a decrease in receivables related to PayPal Business Loan (“PPBL”) products.\nOPERATING EXPENSES\nThe following table summarizes our operating expenses and related metrics we use to assess the trends in each:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Percent Nine Months Ended September 30, Percent\nIncrease/(Decrease) Increase/(Decrease)\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(In millions, except percentages)\nTransaction expense $ 3,841 $ 3,603 7 % $ 11,700 $ 10,427 12 %\nTransaction and credit losses 352 446 (21)% 1,008 1,286 (22)%\nCustomer support and operations 427 474 (10)% 1,317 1,454 (9)%\nSales and marketing 508 442 15 % 1,375 1,343 2 %\nTechnology and development 746 739 1 % 2,206 2,203 — %\nGeneral and administrative 519 507 2 % 1,553 1,505 3 %\nRestructuring and other 63 39 62 % 388 227 71 %\nTotal operating expenses $ 6,456 $ 6,250 3 % $ 19,547 $ 18,445 6 %\nTransaction expense rate(1) 0.91 % 0.93 % ** 0.94 % 0.93 % **\nTransaction and credit loss rate(2) 0.08 % 0.12 % ** 0.08 % 0.11 % **\n(1) Transaction expense rate is calculated by dividing transaction expense by TPV.\n(2) Transaction and credit loss rate is calculated by dividing transaction and credit losses by TPV.\n** Not meaningful.\n54\nTable of Contents\nTransaction expense\nTransaction expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was as follows (in millions):\nTransaction expense increased by $238 million, or 7%, and $1.3 billion, or 12%, in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively,\ncompared to the same periods of the prior year due primarily to the increase in TPV of 9% and 11% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively, as well as unfavorable changes in product mix.\nThe decrease in the transaction expense rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of the prior year was primarily\nattributable to favorable changes in regional mix, product mix, and certain third-party pricing incentives within our core PayPal products and services as well\nas favorable changes in merchant mix associated with our unbranded card processing volume.\nThe slight increase in the transaction expense rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of the prior year was\nattributable to unfavorable changes in product mix with a higher proportion of TPV from unbranded card processing volume, which generally has higher\nexpense rates than our other products and services, largely offset by favorable changes in regional mix, product mix, and certain third-party pricing incentives\nwithin our core PayPal products and services.\nFor both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, approximately 37% of TPV was generated outside of the U.S. For both the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, approximately 36% of TPV was generated outside of the U.S.\nOur transaction expense rate is impacted by changes in product mix, merchant mix, regional mix, funding mix, and fees paid to payment processors and other\nfinancial institutions. The cost of funding a transaction with a credit or debit card is generally higher than the cost of funding a transaction from a bank or\nthrough internal sources such as a PayPal or Venmo account balance or our consumer credit products.\n55\nTable of Contents\nTransaction and credit losses\nThe components of our transaction and credit losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows (in millions):\nTransaction and credit losses decreased by $94 million, or 21%, and $278 million, or 22%, in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively, compared to the same periods of the prior year.\nTransaction losses were $264 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $329 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023,\na decrease of $65 million, or 20%. Transaction losses were $783 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $915 million in the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of $132 million, or 14%. Transaction loss rate (transaction losses divided by TPV) was 0.06% for the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.08% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in transaction losses and\nthe associated transaction loss rate in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods of the prior year was primarily due to\nhigher recoveries and lower losses resulting from fewer fraud events in the current period.\nCredit losses decreased by $29 million and $146 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods of the prior\nyear. The components of credit losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows (in millions):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023(3)\nNet charge-offs(1) $ 81 $ 163 $ 295 $ 407\nReserve (release) build(2) 7 (46) (70) (36)\nCredit losses $ 88 $ 117 $ 225 $ 371\n(1) Net charge-offs includes principal charge-offs partially offset by recoveries for consumer and merchant receivables.\n(2) Reserve (release) build represents change in allowance for principal receivables excluding foreign currency remeasurement.\n(3) Includes the reversal of allowance associated with reclassification of certain loans to held for sale.\nThe provision in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was attributable to loan originations during the period partially offset by improvement in\ncredit quality of loans outstanding. The provision in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was attributable to loan originations during the\nperiod and a deterioration in the credit quality of loans outstanding.\n56\nTable of Contents\nConsumer loan portfolio\nIn June 2023, we entered into a multi-year agreement with a global investment firm to sell up to €40 billion of United Kingdom (“U.K.”) and other European\nbuy now, pay later loan receivables, consisting of eligible loans and interest receivables, including a forward-flow arrangement for the sale of future\noriginations of eligible loans over a 24-month commitment period (collectively, “eligible consumer installment receivables”). As of September 30, 2024 and\n2023, loans and interest receivable, held for sale was $471 million and $2.2 billion, respectively, representing the portion of our installment consumer\nreceivables that we intend to sell.\nThe consumer loans and interest receivable balance as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $5.1 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively, net of participation\ninterest sold, representing an increase of 21%. The increase was driven primarily by growth in our installment credit products in Japan and our revolving credit\nproduct in the U.K., partially offset by a decline in our installment credit products in Germany due to the forward flow arrangement with the global investment\nfirm as well as a decrease in our interest-bearing installment credit product in the U.S.\nThe following table provides information regarding the credit quality of our consumer loans and interest receivable balance:\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nPercent of consumer loans and interest receivable current 95.9 % 95.4 %\nPercent of consumer loans and interest receivable > 90 days outstanding(1) 1.7 % 2.0 %\nNet charge-off rate(2) 4.6 % 7.6 %\n(1) Represents percentage of balances which are 90 days past the billing date or contractual repayment date, as applicable.\n(2) Net charge-off rate is the annualized ratio of net credit losses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, excluding fraud losses, on consumer loans as a percentage of the average\ndaily amount of consumer loans and interest receivable balance during the same period.\nThe decline in net charge-off rate for consumer receivables at September 30, 2024 as compared to September 30, 2023 was due primarily to the improvement\nin credit quality of the U.S. interest-bearing installment products.\nIn response to declining performance, a number of risk mitigation strategies were implemented in the third quarter of 2023, which reduced originations for our\nU.S. interest-bearing installment product. In response to changing portfolio performance, we continue to evaluate and modify our acceptable risk parameters.\nChanges to such parameters in the second quarter of 2024, combined with enhanced risk monitoring, have resulted in an increase of U.S. interest-bearing\ninstallment loan originations back to historical levels.\nMerchant loan portfolio\nWe offer access to merchant finance products for certain small and medium-sized businesses, which we refer to as our merchant finance offerings. Total\nmerchant loans, advances, interest, and fees receivable outstanding, net of participation interest sold, as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $1.4 billion,\nreflecting a slight decline of 4% attributable to slowed originations related to our PPBL product in the U.S. mostly offset by an increase in our PayPal Working\nCapital product portfolio across countries.\nThe following table provides information regarding the credit quality of our merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable balance:\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nPercent of merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable current 91.3 % 86.7 %\nPercent of merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable > 90 days outstanding(1) 2.8 % 6.6 %\nNet charge-off rate(2) 8.3 % 20.4 %\n(1) Represents percentage of balances which are 90 days past the original expected or contractual repayment period, as applicable.\n(2) Net charge-off rate is the annualized ratio of net credit losses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, excluding fraud losses, on merchant loans and advances as a percentage\nof the average daily amount of merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable balance during the same period.\nThe increase in the percent of current merchant receivables and decrease in percent of merchant receivables greater than 90 days outstanding and the net\ncharge-off rate for merchant receivables at September 30, 2024 as compared to September 30, 2023 was due primarily to the improvement in the credit quality\nof the PPBL portfolio.\n57\nTable of Contents\nIn response to declining performance, a number of risk mitigation strategies were implemented throughout 2023, which reduced originations for our PPBL\nproduct. In response to changing portfolio performance, we continue to evaluate and modify our acceptable risk parameters. Changes to such parameters,\ncombined with enhanced risk monitoring, have resulted in an increase in PPBL originations in 2024.\nFor additional information, see “Note 11—Loans and Interest Receivable” in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of\nthis Form 10-Q.\nCustomer support and operations\nCustomer support and operations expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows (in millions):\nCustomer support and operations expenses decreased by $47 million, or 10%, and $137 million, or 9%, in the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2024, respectively, compared to the same periods of the prior year due primarily to a decline in employee-related costs associated with headcount reduction.\nThe decline in customer support and operations expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was also impacted by a reduction in other costs\nincurred related to delivery of our products, including warehouses, shipping, and payment devices and a decrease in contractors and consulting costs, partially\noffset by an increase in card issuance costs and customer onboarding and compliance costs.\nSales and marketing\nSales and marketing expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows (in millions):\nSales and marketing expenses increased by $66 million, or 15%, and $32 million, or 2%, in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively,\ncompared to the same periods of the prior year primarily attributable to higher spend on marketing and brand advertising, including the launch of our PayPal\nEverywhere advertising campaign, partially offset by a decline in employee-related costs. The increase in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was also\nattributable to higher revenue share to our partners.\nWe expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in the fourth quarter of 2024 as we continue to invest in brand advertising and marketing campaigns.\n58\nTable of Contents\nTechnology and development\nTechnology and development expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows (in millions):\nTechnology and development expenses remained consistent in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same\nperiods of the prior year. The slight increase in technology and development expenses in the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to an\nincrease in contractor and consultant costs offset by a decline in employee-related costs associated with headcount reduction. The slight increase in technology\nand development expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by increases in cloud computing services utilized in delivering our\nproducts and services, amortization expense associated with internally developed software, and software maintenance costs offset by a decline in employee-\nrelated costs associated with headcount reduction.\nGeneral and administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows (in millions):\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $12 million, or 2%, and $48 million, or 3%, in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively, compared to the same periods of the prior year due primarily to an increase in indirect tax expense and professional services expense. The\nincrease in general and administrative expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was also attributable to a contingency reserve, partially offset by\ndeclines in facilities expense and depreciation expense.\n59\nTable of Contents\nRestructuring and other\nRestructuring and other for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows (in millions):\nRestructuring and other increased by $24 million and $161 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same\nperiods of the prior year.\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, management initiated a global workforce reduction intended to streamline operations, focus resources on core strategic\npriorities, and improve our cost structure. The associated restructuring charges during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $36 million\nand $294 million, respectively, and included employee severance and benefits costs and stock-based compensation expense, substantially all of which were\naccrued for as of September 30, 2024. The estimated reduction in annualized employee-related costs associated with the impacted workforce is approximately\n$575 million, including approximately $155 million in stock-based compensation. We expect to reinvest a portion of the reduction in annual costs associated\nwith the impacted workforce to drive business priorities.\nFor information on the associated restructuring liability, see “Note 17—Restructuring and Other” in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial\nstatements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.\nDuring the first quarter of 2023, management initiated a global workforce reduction intended to focus resources on core strategic priorities, and improve cost\nstructure and operating efficiency. The associated restructuring charges during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were $3 million and\n$120 million, respectively. We primarily incurred employee severance and benefits costs, which were substantially completed by the fourth quarter of 2023.\nWe continue to review our real estate and facility capacity requirements due to our new and evolving work models. We incurred asset impairment charges of nil\nin the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and $18 million and $61 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively,\ndue to exiting certain leased properties, which resulted in a reduction of right-of-use lease assets and related leasehold improvements. In the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, we recognized a gain of $17 million due to the sale of an owned property. We also incurred a loss of $12 million upon designation of an\nowned property as held for sale in the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately $28 million and $92 million, respectively, of losses were recorded in restructuring\nand other, which included net loss on sale of loans and interest receivable previously held for sale and fair value adjustments to measure loans and interest\nreceivable, held for sale, at the lower of cost or fair value. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, approximately $15 million and $49\nmillion, respectively, of losses were recorded in restructuring and other, which included fair value adjustments to measure loans and interest receivable, held for\nsale, at the lower of cost or fair value.\nOther income (expense), net\nOther income (expense), net decreased $153 million and $283 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the\nsame periods of the prior year due primarily to net losses on strategic investments in the current period compared to net gains in the prior period, partially offset\nby higher interest income resulting from an increase in cash balances and interest rates year-over-year.\n60\nTable of Contents\nIncome tax expense\nOur effective income tax rate was 23% and 18% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 23% and 21% for the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increases in our effective income tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024\ncompared to the same periods of the prior year were due primarily to changes in jurisdictional mix of income and U.S. income taxed at different rates.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe require liquidity and access to capital to fund our global operations, including our customer protection programs, credit products, capital expenditures,\ninvestments in our business, potential acquisitions and strategic investments, working capital, and other cash needs. We believe that our existing cash, cash\nequivalents, and investments, cash expected to be generated from operations, and our expected access to capital markets, together with potential external\nfunding through third-party sources, will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements within the next 12 months and beyond.\nSOURCES OF LIQUIDITY\nCash, cash equivalents, and investments\nThe following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\n(In millions)\nCash, cash equivalents, and investments(1),(2) $ 14,493 $ 15,493\n(1) Excludes assets related to funds receivable and customer accounts of $39.2 billion and $38.9 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n(2) Excludes total restricted cash of $1 million and $3 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and strategic investments of $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion at September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nCash, cash equivalents, and investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were $6.9 billion and $10.0 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, or\n48% and 64% of our total cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of those respective dates. At December 31, 2023, all of our cash, cash equivalents, and\ninvestments held by foreign subsidiaries were subject to U.S. taxation under Subpart F, Global Intangible Low Taxed Income or the one-time transition tax\nunder the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Subsequent repatriations to the U.S. will not be taxable from a U.S. federal tax perspective, but may be subject to\nstate income or foreign withholding tax.\nA significant aspect of our global cash management activities involves meeting our customers’ requirements to access their cash while simultaneously meeting\nour regulatory financial ratio commitments in various jurisdictions. Our global cash balances are required not only to provide operational liquidity to our\nbusinesses, but also to support our global regulatory requirements across our regulated subsidiaries. Accordingly, not all of our cash is available for general\ncorporate purposes.\nCash flows\nThe following table summarizes our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n(In millions)\nNet cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ 5,056 $ 2,229\nInvesting activities (868) 1,286\nFinancing activities (4,691) (5,993)\nEffect of exchange rates on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 103 (95)\nNet decrease in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ (400) $ (2,573)\n61\nTable of Contents\nOperating activities\nThe net cash provided by operating activities of $5.1 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due primarily to operating income of $3.9\nbillion, as well as adjustments for non-cash expenses, including provision for transaction and credit losses of $1.0 billion, stock-based compensation of\n$947 million, and depreciation and amortization of $783 million. Cash flows from operating activities was also impacted by proceeds from repayments and\nsales of loans receivable, originally classified as held for sale, of $17.2 billion and net losses from our strategic investments of $226 million. These inflows\nfrom operating activities were partially offset by originations of loans receivable, held for sale of $17.2 billion, changes in other assets and liabilities of $647\nmillion, primarily related to actual cash transaction losses incurred during the period, and accretion of discounts on investments, net of amortization of\npremiums, of $290 million.\nThe net cash provided by operating activities of $2.2 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due primarily to operating income of $3.3\nbillion, as well as adjustments for non-cash expenses, including provision for transaction and credit losses of $1.3 billion, stock-based compensation of\n$1.1 billion, and depreciation and amortization of $809 million. Cash flows from operating activities was also impacted by originations of loans receivable,\nheld for sale of $5.7 billion, changes in other assets and liabilities of $865 million, primarily related to actual cash transaction losses incurred during the period,\nchanges in deferred income taxes of $439 million, accretion of discounts on investments, net of amortization of premiums, of $265 million, and net gains from\nour strategic investments of $205 million, partially offset by proceeds from repayments of loans receivable, originally classified as held for sale, of $3.7 billion.\nIn the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cash paid for income taxes, net was $975 million and $1.1 billion, respectively.\nInvesting activities\nThe net cash used in investing activities of $868 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due primarily to purchases of investments of $20.8\nbillion, purchases and originations of loans receivable of $15.4 billion, purchases of property and equipment of $480 million, and purchases of reverse\nrepurchase agreements of $299 million, partially offset by maturities and sales of investments of $21.2 billion, proceeds from repayments and sales of loans\nreceivable, originally classified as held for investment, of $14.7 billion, and maturities of reverse repurchase agreements of $226 million. From time to time,\nwe enter into reverse repurchase agreements as a form of secured lending primarily to deploy excess cash.\nThe net cash provided by investing activities of $1.3 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due primarily to proceeds from repayments and\nsales of loans receivable, originally classified as held for investment, of $21.3 billion and maturities and sales of investments of $16.1 billion, partially offset by\npurchases and originations of loans receivable of $19.8 billion, purchases of investments of $15.0 billion, changes in funds receivable from customers of $1.0\nbillion, and purchases of property and equipment of $478 million.\nFinancing activities\nThe net cash used in financing activities of $4.7 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due primarily to the repurchase of $4.8 billion of our\ncommon stock under our stock repurchase program, changes in funds payable and amounts due to customers of $771 million, repayments of borrowings from\nrepurchase agreements of $656 million, repayments of borrowings under financing arrangements of $411 million, and tax withholdings related to net share\nsettlement of equity awards of $271 million. These cash outflows were partially offset by borrowings under financing arrangements of $1.5 billion (including\nproceeds from the issuance of fixed rate debt in May 2024) and borrowings from repurchase agreements of $656 million. From time to time, we enter into\nrepurchase agreements as a form of secured borrowing primarily to address temporary liquidity needs.\nThe net cash used in financing activities of $6.0 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due primarily to the repurchase of $4.4 billion of our\ncommon stock under our stock repurchase program, changes in funds payable and amounts due to customers of $1.3 billion, repayments of borrowings under\nfinancing arrangements of $942 million (including principal repayment of fixed rate debt that matured in June 2023 and repayment of borrowings under our\nPaidy credit agreement), and tax withholdings related to net share settlement of equity awards of $225 million. These cash outflows were partially offset by\nborrowings under financing arrangements of $829 million, including proceeds from the issuance of fixed rate debt in June 2023 and borrowings under our\nPaidy credit agreement.\n62\nTable of Contents\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\nForeign currency exchange rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 had a positive impact of $103 million and a negative impact of $95\nmillion, respectively, on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. The positive impact on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash in the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 was due primarily to the favorable impact of fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to the British pound. The negative impact\non cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due primarily to the unfavorable impact of fluctuations in the\nexchange rate of the U.S. dollar to the Australian dollar, and to a lesser extent, the Chinese yuan and Japanese yen.\nAvailable credit and debt\nIn May 2024, we issued fixed rate notes with varying maturity dates for an aggregate principal amount of $1.3 billion. Proceeds from the issuance of these\nNotes may be used for general corporate purposes, which may include funding the repayment or redemption of outstanding debt, share repurchases, ongoing\noperations, capital expenditures, and acquisitions of businesses, assets, or strategic investments. As of September 30, 2024, we had an aggregate principal\namount of $11.9 billion in fixed rate debt outstanding with varying maturity dates.\nIn February 2022, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Paidy Credit Agreement”) with Paidy as co-borrower, which provided for an unsecured revolving\ncredit facility of ¥60.0 billion, which was modified in September 2022 to increase the borrowing capacity by ¥30.0 billion for a total borrowing capacity of\n¥90.0 billion (approximately $633 million as of September 30, 2024). As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, ¥90.0 billion (approximately\n$633 million) and ¥50.0 billion (approximately $355 million), respectively, was outstanding under the Paidy Credit Agreement. At September 30, 2024, no\nborrowing capacity was available for the purposes permitted by the Paidy Credit Agreement.\nOther than as described above, there were no significant changes to the available credit and debt disclosed in our 2023 Form 10‑K. For additional information,\nsee “Note 12—Debt” in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.\nDepending on market conditions, we may from time to time issue debt, including in private or public offerings, to fund our operating activities, finance\nacquisitions, make strategic investments, repurchase shares under our stock repurchase program, or reduce our cost of capital.\nWe have a cash pooling arrangement with a financial institution for cash management purposes. The arrangement allows for cash withdrawals from the\nfinancial institution based upon our aggregate operating cash balances held within the financial institution (“Aggregate Cash Deposits”). The arrangement also\nallows us to withdraw amounts exceeding the Aggregate Cash Deposits up to an agreed-upon limit. The net balance of the withdrawals and the Aggregate Cash\nDeposits are used by the financial institution as a basis for calculating our net interest expense or income under the arrangement. As of September 30, 2024, we\nhad a total of $2.2 billion in cash withdrawals offsetting our $2.2 billion in Aggregate Cash Deposits held within the financial institution under the cash pooling\narrangement.\nCredit ratings\nAs of September 30, 2024, we continue to be rated investment grade by Standard and Poor’s Financial Services, LLC, Fitch Ratings, Inc., and Moody’s\nInvestors Services, Inc. We expect that these credit rating agencies will continue to monitor our performance, including our capital structure and results of\noperations. Our goal is to be rated investment grade, but as circumstances change, there are factors that could result in our credit ratings being downgraded or\nput on a watch list for possible downgrading. If that were to occur, it could increase our borrowing rates, including the interest rate on borrowings under our\ncredit agreements.\nCURRENT AND FUTURE CASH REQUIREMENTS\nOur material cash requirements include funds to support current and potential: operating activities, credit products, customer protection programs, stock\nrepurchases, strategic investments, acquisitions, other commitments, capital expenditures, and other future obligations.\nCredit products\nGrowth in our portfolio of loans receivable increases our liquidity needs and any inability to meet those liquidity needs could adversely affect our business. We\ncontinue to evaluate partnerships and third-party sources of funding for our credit products.\n63\nTable of Contents\nThe Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (the “CSSF”) has agreed that PayPal’s management may designate up to 50% of European\ncustomer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary to fund European, U.K., and U.S. credit activities. As of September 30, 2024, the cumulative\namount approved by PayPal to be designated to fund credit activities aggregated to $2.0 billion and represented approximately 27% of European customer\nbalances made available for our corporate use at that date, as determined by applying financial regulations maintained by the CSSF. We may periodically seek\nto change the designation of amounts of European customer balances for our credit activities, as we deem necessary, based on utilization of the approved funds\nand anticipated credit funding requirements. Under certain exceptional circumstances, corporate liquidity could be called upon to meet our obligations related\nto our European customer balances.\nIn June 2023, we entered into a multi-year agreement with a global investment firm to sell up to €40 billion of our eligible consumer installment receivables\nportfolio. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold $14.7 billion of loans and interest receivable in connection with this agreement. See\n“Note 11—Loans and Interest Receivable” in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for\nadditional information.\nWhile our objective is to expand the availability of our credit products with capital from external sources, there can be no assurance that we will be successful\nin achieving that goal.\nCustomer protection programs\nThe risk of losses from our customer protection programs are specific to individual consumers, merchants, and transactions, and may also be impacted by\nregional variations in, and changes or modifications to, the programs, including as a result of changes in regulatory requirements. For the periods presented in\nthese condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report, our transaction loss rate ranged between 0.06% and 0.08% of TPV. Historical loss\nrates may not be indicative of future results.\nStock repurchases\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased approximately $4.8 billion of our common stock in the open market under our stock\nrepurchase program authorized in June 2022. As of September 30, 2024, a total of approximately $6.1 billion remained available for future repurchases of our\ncommon stock under our June 2022 stock repurchase program.\nOther considerations\nOur liquidity, access to capital, and borrowing costs could be adversely impacted by declines in our credit rating, our financial performance, and global credit\nmarket conditions, as well as a broad range of other factors. In addition, our liquidity, access to capital, and borrowing costs could also be negatively impacted\nby the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of our 2023 Form 10-K, as\nsupplemented and, to the extent inconsistent, superseded below in Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors of this Form 10-Q, as well as “Note 13—Commitments and\nContingencies” in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for additional discussion of these\nand other risks that our business faces.\n64\nTable of Contents\nITEM 3: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nMarket risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as\ninterest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and equity investment risk. Management establishes and oversees the implementation of policies governing our\ninvesting, funding, and foreign currency derivative activities intended to mitigate market risks. We monitor risk exposures on an ongoing basis.\nINTEREST RATE RISK\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk relating to our investment portfolio and from interest-rate sensitive assets underlying the customer balances we hold on our\ncondensed consolidated balance sheets as customer accounts.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximately 50% and 59%, respectively, of our total cash, cash equivalents, and investment portfolio\n(excluding restricted cash and strategic investments) was held in cash and cash equivalents. The remaining portfolio and assets underlying the customer\nbalances that we hold on our condensed consolidated balance sheets as customer accounts are maintained in interest and non-interest bearing bank deposits,\ntime deposits, and available-for-sale debt securities. We seek to preserve principal while holding eligible liquid assets, as defined by applicable regulatory\nrequirements and commercial law in certain jurisdictions where we operate, equal to at least 100% of the aggregate amount of all customer balances. We do not\npay interest on amounts due to customers.\nInterest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash and cash equivalents, time deposits, and available-for-sale debt securities and the fair value\nof those securities. A hypothetical 100 basis points increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our cash equivalents and\navailable-for-sale debt securities investment by approximately $76 million and $122 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nChanges in the fair value of our available-for-sale debt securities resulting from such interest rate changes are reported as a component of accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (“AOCI”) and are realized only if we sell the securities prior to their scheduled maturities or the declines in fair values are due to\nexpected credit losses.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had an aggregate principal amount of $11.9 billion and $10.6 billion, respectively, in fixed rate debt\nwith varying maturity dates. Since these notes bear interest at fixed rates, they do not result in any financial statement risk associated with changes in interest\nrates. However, the fair value of these notes fluctuates when interest rates change, increasing in periods of declining interest rates and declining in periods of\nincreasing interest rates.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we also had revolving credit facilities of approximately $5.6 billion available to us. We are obligated to pay\ninterest on borrowings under these facilities as well as other customary fees, including an upfront fee and an unused commitment fee based on our debt rating.\nBorrowings under these facilities, if any, bear interest at floating rates. As a result, we are exposed to the risk related to fluctuations in interest rates to the\nextent of our borrowings. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, ¥90.0 billion (approximately $633 million) and ¥50.0 billion (approximately\n$355 million), respectively, was outstanding under these facilities. A 100 basis points hypothetical adverse change in applicable market interest rates would not\nhave resulted in a material impact to interest expense recorded in the period. For additional information, see “Note 12—Debt” in the notes to the condensed\nconsolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.\nInterest rates may also adversely impact our customers’ spending levels and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amounts owed to us. Higher interest\nrates often lead to larger payment obligations by customers of our credit products to us, or to lenders under mortgage, credit card, and other consumer and\nmerchant loans, which may reduce our customers’ ability to remain current on their obligations to us and therefore lead to increased delinquencies, charge-offs,\nand allowances for loans and interest receivable, which could have an adverse effect on our net income (loss).\n65\nTable of Contents\nFOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK\nWe have significant operations internationally that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound, Euro, Australian dollar, and Canadian\ndollar, which subject us to foreign currency exchange rate risk and may adversely impact our financial results. We transact in various foreign currencies and\nhave significant international revenues and expenses. In addition, we charge our international subsidiaries for their use of intellectual property and technology\nand for certain corporate services. Our cash flows, results of operations, and certain of our intercompany balances that are exposed to foreign currency\nexchange rate fluctuations may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses due to foreign currency fluctuations and\nrelated hedging activities. We are generally a net receiver of foreign currencies and therefore benefit from a weakening of the United States (“U.S.”) dollar, and\nare adversely affected by a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, relative to foreign currencies. We considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange\nrates and determined that it was reasonably possible that changes in exchange rates of 10% for all currencies could be experienced in the near term.\nWe have a foreign currency exchange exposure management program designed to identify material foreign currency exposures, manage these exposures, and\nreduce the potential effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated cash flows and results of operations through the execution of foreign currency\nexchange contracts. These foreign currency exchange contracts are accounted for as derivative instruments; for additional details related to our foreign currency\nexchange contracts, please see “Note 10—Derivative Instruments” in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form\n10-Q.\nWe use foreign currency exchange forward contracts to protect our forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings and our investment in foreign subsidiaries from\nadverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These hedging contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of adverse foreign currency\nexchange rate movements. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted revenues and expenses denominated in certain foreign currencies and\nnet investment hedges for accounting purposes. The derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of AOCI. Cash flow hedges are subsequently\nreclassified into revenue or expense in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. The accumulated gains and losses associated with net\ninvestment hedges will remain in AOCI until the foreign subsidiaries are sold or substantially liquidated, at which point they will be reclassified into earnings.\nIf the U.S. dollar weakened by a hypothetical 10% at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign\ncurrency exchange forward contracts, before taxes, would have been approximately $627 million and $622 million lower, respectively, before considering the\noffsetting impact of the underlying hedged item.\nWe have an additional foreign currency exchange management program in which we use foreign currency exchange contracts to help offset the foreign\ncurrency exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. These contracts are not\ndesignated as hedging instruments and reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The\nforeign currency exchange gains and losses on our assets and liabilities are recorded in other income (expense), net, and are offset by the gains and losses on\nthe foreign currency exchange contracts.\nAdverse changes in exchange rates of a hypothetical 10% for all foreign currencies would have resulted in a negative impact on income before income taxes of\napproximately $464 million and $417 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, without considering the offsetting effect of foreign\ncurrency exchange contracts. Foreign currency exchange contracts in place as of September 30, 2024 would have positively impacted income before income\ntaxes by approximately $451 million, resulting in a net negative impact of approximately $13 million. Foreign currency exchange contracts in place as of\nDecember 31, 2023 would have positively impacted income before income taxes by approximately $400 million, resulting in a net negative impact of\napproximately $17 million. These reasonably possible adverse changes in exchange rates of 10% were applied to monetary assets, monetary liabilities, and\navailable-for-sale debt securities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of our subsidiaries at the balance sheet dates to compute the\nadverse impact these changes would have had on our income before income taxes in the near term.\n66\nTable of Contents\nEQUITY INVESTMENT RISK\nOur strategic investments are subject to a variety of market-related risks that could substantially reduce or increase the carrying value of the portfolio. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our strategic investments totaled $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion, which represented approximately 11% of our total\ncash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investment portfolio at those respective dates. Our strategic investments include marketable equity\nsecurities, which are publicly traded, and non-marketable equity securities, which are primarily investments in privately held companies. We are required to\nrecord all adjustments to the value of these strategic investments through our condensed consolidated statements of income (loss). As such, we expect volatility\nto our net income (loss) in future periods due to changes in observable prices and impairment related to our non-marketable equity securities accounted for\nunder the Measurement Alternative. These changes could be material based on market conditions. Additionally, the financial success of our investments in\nprivately held companies is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering, acquisition, private sale, or other favorable market event\nproviding the ability to realize appreciation in the value of the investment. A hypothetical adverse change of 10% in the carrying value of our strategic\ninvestments as of September 30, 2024, which could be experienced in the near term, would have resulted in a decrease of approximately $171 million to the\ncarrying value of the portfolio. We review our non-marketable equity securities accounted for under the Measurement Alternative for impairment when events\nand circumstances indicate a decline in fair value of such assets below carrying value. Our analysis includes a review of recent operating results and trends,\nrecent purchases and sales of securities, and other publicly available data, for which we assess factors such as the investees’ financial condition and business\noutlook, industry performance, regulatory, economic, or technological environment, and other relevant events and factors affecting the investees.\nITEM 4: CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n(a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Rules 13a-15(e) and\n15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act), our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer have\nconcluded that as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\n(b) Changes in internal controls over financial reporting. There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting as defined in the Exchange\nAct Rule 13a-15(f) that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,\nour internal control over financial reporting.\n67\nTable of Contents\nPART II: OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1: LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nThe information set forth under “Note 13—Commitments and Contingencies—Litigation and Regulatory Matters” in the notes to the condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q is incorporated herein by reference.\nITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS\nWe are subject to various risks and uncertainties, which could materially affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, future results, and the\ntrading price of our common stock. You should read carefully the following information together with the information appearing in Part I, Item 1A, Risk\nFactors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the United States (“U.S.”) Securities and Exchange\nCommission (“SEC”) on February 8, 2024 (“2023 Form 10-K”), as updated by the information appearing in Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our subsequent\nQuarterly Reports on Form 10-Q as filed with the SEC (“Forms 10-Q”). The following information supplements and, to the extent inconsistent, supersedes\nsome of the information appearing in the Risk Factors section of our 2023 Form 10‑K and Forms 10-Q. These risk factors, as well as our condensed\nconsolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the other information appearing in this report, should be reviewed carefully for important information\nregarding risks that affect us.\nCYBERSECURITY AND TECHNOLOGY RISKS\nCyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm to our reputation, business, and financial condition.\nThe techniques used to attempt to obtain unauthorized or illegal access to systems and information (including customers’ personal data), disable or degrade\nservice, exploit vulnerabilities, or sabotage systems are constantly evolving. In some circumstances, these attempts may not be recognized or detected until\nafter they have been launched against a target. Unauthorized parties continuously attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means,\nincluding through hacking into our systems or facilities or those of our customers, partners, or vendors, and attempting to fraudulently induce users of our\nsystems (including employees, vendor and partner personnel and customers) into disclosing user names, passwords, payment card information, multi-factor\nauthentication application access or other sensitive information used to gain access to such systems or facilities. This information may, in turn, be used to\naccess our customers’ confidential personal or proprietary information and financial instrument data that are stored on or accessible through our information\ntechnology systems and those of third parties with whom we partner. This information may also be used to execute fraudulent transactions or otherwise engage\nin fraudulent actions. Numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats, including advanced and persisting cyberattacks, cyberextortion, distributed denial-of-\nservice attacks, ransomware, spear phishing and social engineering schemes, the introduction of computer viruses or other malware, and the physical\ndestruction of all or portions of our information technology and infrastructure and those of third parties with whom we partner or that are part of our\ninformation technology supply chain, are becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex, may be difficult to detect, and could compromise the\nconfidentiality, availability, and integrity of the data in our systems, as well as the systems themselves.\nWe believe that hostile actors, who may comprise individuals, coordinated groups, sophisticated organizations, or nation state supported entities may target\nPayPal due to our name, brand recognition, types of data (including sensitive payments- and identity-related data) that customers provide to us, and the\nwidespread adoption and use of our products and services. We have experienced from time to time, and may experience in the future, cybersecurity incidents,\nincluding breaches of our security measures, network breaches, and compromise of personally identifiable customer information due to human error, deception,\nmalfeasance, insider threats, system errors, defects, vulnerabilities, or other issues.\nAny cybersecurity incidents, including cyberattacks or data security breaches affecting the information technology or infrastructure of companies we acquire or\nof our customers, partners, or vendors (including data center and cloud computing providers) could have similar negative effects.\n68\nTable of Contents\nUnder payment card network rules and our contracts with our payment processors, if there is a breach of payment card information stored by us or our direct\npayment card processing vendors, we could be liable to the payment card issuing banks, including for their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses. We\nhave experienced, and may experience in the future, breaches involving customer information for which we have notified, and may notify, regulators,\ncustomers and other third parties. These or other cybersecurity breaches and other exploited security vulnerabilities have subjected us and could further subject\nus to significant costs and third-party liabilities, result in improper disclosure of data and violations of applicable privacy and other laws, require us to change\nour business practices, cause us to incur significant remediation costs, lead to loss of customer confidence in, or decreased use of, our products and services,\ndamage our reputation and brands, divert the attention of management from the operation of our business, result in significant compensation or contractual\npenalties from us to our customers and their business partners as a result of losses to or claims by them, or expose us to litigation, regulatory investigations, and\nsignificant fines and penalties. While we maintain insurance policies intended to help offset the financial impact we may experience from these risks, our\ncoverage may be insufficient to compensate us for all losses caused by security breaches and other damage to or unavailability of our systems.\nLEGAL, REGULATORY AND COMPLIANCE RISKS\nOur business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight. Our failure to comply with extensive, complex, overlapping, and frequently\nchanging rules, regulations, and legal interpretations could materially harm our business.\nPrivacy and Protection of Customer Data\nThe legal and regulatory environment relating to privacy and data protection laws continues to develop and evolve in ways we cannot predict, including with\nrespect to technologies such as cloud computing, (generative) artificial intelligence, machine learning, cryptocurrency, and blockchain technology. Any failure\nor alleged failure by us to comply with our privacy policies as communicated to customers or with privacy and data protection laws relating to our collection,\nuse, storage, transfer, or sharing of customer data with third parties could result in proceedings or actions against us by data protection authorities, other\ngovernment agencies, our customers or others, which could subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments, and negative publicity, require us to change our\nbusiness practices, increase the costs and complexity of compliance, result in reputational harm, and materially harm our business. Compliance with\ninconsistent privacy and data protection laws may also restrict or limit our ability to provide products and services to our customers.\nPayPal relies on a variety of compliance methods to transfer personal data of Europe Economic Area individuals to the U.S., including Binding Corporate\nRules for internal transfers of certain types of personal data and Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”) as approved by the European Commission for transfers\nto and from third parties. While PayPal intends to continue to rely on Binding Corporate Rules and SCCs and will evaluate the circumstances under which\nadditional mechanisms, such as the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework may be leveraged for transfers of personal data to the U.S., we may be subject to\nregulatory enforcement actions if our approach is deemed to be noncompliant.\nMany jurisdictions in which we operate globally have enacted, or are in the process of enacting, data privacy legislation or regulations aimed at creating and\nenhancing individual privacy rights. For example, numerous U.S. states have enacted or are in the process of enacting state level data privacy laws and\nregulations governing the collection, use, and retention of their residents’ personal information. The continued proliferation of privacy laws in the jurisdictions\nin which we operate is likely to result in a disparate array of privacy rules with unaligned or conflicting provisions, accountability requirements, individual\nrights, and national or local enforcement powers, which may subject us to increased regulatory scrutiny and business costs and could lead to unintended\nconsumer confusion.\nOur credit products expose us to additional risks.\nWe offer credit products to a wide range of consumers and merchants in the U.S. and various international markets. The financial success of these products\ndepends largely on the effective management of related risk. The credit decision-making process for our consumer credit products uses proprietary\nmethodologies and credit algorithms and other analytical techniques designed to analyze the credit risk of specific consumers based on, among other factors,\ntheir past purchase and transaction history with PayPal or Venmo and their credit scores. Similarly, proprietary risk models and other indicators are applied to\nassess merchants who desire to use our merchant financing offerings to help predict their ability to repay. These risk models may not accurately predict the\ncreditworthiness of a consumer or merchant due to inaccurate assumptions, including those related to the particular consumer or merchant, market conditions,\neconomic environment, or limited transaction history or other data. The accuracy of these risk models and the ability to manage credit risk related to our credit\nproducts may also be affected by legal or regulatory requirements, changes in consumer behavior, changes in the economic environment, issuing bank policies,\nand other factors.\n69\nTable of Contents\nWe generally rely on the activities and charters of unaffiliated financial institutions to provide PayPal and Venmo branded consumer credit and merchant\nfinancing offerings to our U.S. customers. As a service provider to these unaffiliated financial institutions, which are federally supervised U.S. financial\ninstitutions, we are subject from time to time to examination by their federal banking regulators. In the event of any termination or interruption in a partner\nbank’s ability or willingness to lend, our ability to offer consumer credit and merchant financing products could be interrupted or limited, which could\nmaterially and adversely affect our business. We may be unable to reach a similar arrangement with another unaffiliated financial institution on favorable terms\nor at all. Obtaining and maintaining the lending licenses required for us to originate such loans ourselves would be a costly, time-consuming and uncertain\nprocess, and would subject us to additional laws and regulatory requirements, which could significantly increase our costs and compliance obligations and\nrequire us to change our business practices.\nMerchant loans under our U.S. PayPal Working Capital (“PPWC”) and PayPal Business Loan (“PPBL”) products and certain U.S. installment loan products are\nprovided by a state-chartered industrial bank under a program agreement with us, and we acquire the receivables generated by those loans from the state-\nchartered bank after origination. In June 2020, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) approved a final rule clarifying that loans validly\noriginated by state-chartered banks or insured branches of foreign banks remain valid throughout the lifetime of the loan, reflecting a similar rule finalized by\nthe Office of the Comptroller of Currency (“OCC”) in May 2020 for nationally chartered banks. The final rule reaffirms and codifies the so-called “valid-when-\nmade doctrine,” which provides that the permissibility of an interest rate for a loan is determined when the loan is made and will not be affected by subsequent\nevents such as sale, assignment, or other transfer. While a number of state attorneys general have unsuccessfully challenged these FDIC and OCC rules, there\nremains some uncertainty whether non-bank entities purchasing loan receivables originated by FDIC-insured, state-chartered banks may rely on federal\npreemption of state usury laws and other state laws. An adverse outcome of these or similar challenges, or changes to applicable laws and regulations or\nregulatory policy, could materially impact our U.S. PPWC and PPBL products, certain installment products, and our business.\nWe are subject to the risk that account holders who use our credit products will default on their payment obligations. The non-payment rate among account\nholders may increase due to, among other factors, changes to underwriting standards, risk models not accurately predicting the creditworthiness of a user,\nworsening economic conditions, such as a recession or government austerity programs, increases in prevailing interest rates, and high unemployment rates.\nAccount holders who miss payments often fail to repay their loans, and account holders who file for protection under the bankruptcy laws generally do not\nrepay their loans. Further, laws or regulations may limit the assessment of late fees or penalties on certain credit products, which could negatively impact our\nrevenue share arrangement with an independent chartered financial institution with respect to our U.S. consumer credit products. Any deterioration in the\nperformance of loans facilitated through our platform or unexpected losses on such loans may increase the risk of potential charge-offs, increase our allowance\nfor loans and interest receivable, negatively impact our revenue share arrangement (as discussed above), and materially and adversely affect our financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nWe currently purchase receivables related to our U.S. PayPal-branded merchant financing offerings and certain U.S. consumer installment loan products and\nextend credit for our consumer and merchant products outside the U.S. through our international subsidiaries. In June 2023, we entered into a multi-year\nagreement to sell up to €40 billion of U.K. and European buy now, pay later (“BNPL”) loan receivables originated by PayPal (Europe) and PayPal U.K.,\nconsisting of the sale of a substantial majority of the U.K. and European BNPL loan portfolio held on PayPal (Europe)’s balance sheet at the closing of the\ntransaction and a forward-flow arrangement for the sale of future originations of eligible loans, and in October 2023, we began selling those receivables. The\nsale of future eligible receivables is subject to certain conditions. If these conditions are not satisfied or waived or if the parties are unable to fulfill their\nobligations under these arrangements, the sale of these receivables could be delayed and we may not realize the expected benefits of this arrangement.\nFrom time to time, we may consider other third-party sources of funding (including asset sales, warehouse facilities, forward-flow arrangements,\nsecuritizations, partnerships or other funding structures) for our credit portfolio or other receivables. The availability of such third-party funding is subject to a\nnumber of factors, including economic conditions and interest rates, and there can be no assurance that any such funding arrangements can be obtained on\nfavorable terms or at all. If we are unable to fund our credit products or the purchase of the receivables related to our credit products and offerings adequately\nor in a cost-effective manner, the growth of our credit products and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely\nimpacted.\n70\nTable of Contents\nEnvironmental, social and governance (“ESG”) issues may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and\ndamage our reputation.\nInvestors, customers, employees, regulators, legislators and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on ESG matters and related disclosures, including with\nrespect to cybersecurity, data privacy and protection, global talent and climate, and new ESG laws and regulations are expanding mandatory disclosure,\nreporting and diligence requirements. If we are unable to comply with new laws and regulations or changes to legal or regulatory requirements concerning ESG\nmatters, or fail to meet investor, industry or stakeholder expectations and standards, our reputation may be harmed, customers may choose to refrain from using\nour products and services, we may be subject to fines, penalties, regulatory or other enforcement actions, and our business or financial condition may be\nadversely affected. We may also experience additional scrutiny or criticism from investors, customers, partners, media, government entities, and other\nstakeholders if they perceive PayPal to not have acted appropriately with respect to ESG matters. If our ESG-related data, processes and reporting are\nincomplete or inaccurate, or if we fail to achieve progress with respect to ESG-related goals on a timely basis, or at all, our reputation, business, financial\nperformance and growth could be adversely affected.\nWe specifically recognize the inherent physical climate-related risks where we conduct business. Our primary locations may be vulnerable to the adverse\neffects of climate change. For example, California, where our headquarters are located, has historically experienced, and is projected to continue to experience,\nextreme weather and natural disaster events more frequently, including drought, water scarcity, flooding, heat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality impacts,\nand power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention. Such events may disrupt our business and may cause us to experience additional costs to maintain or\nresume operations and higher attrition.\n71\nTable of Contents\nITEM 2: UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS\nREPURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nIn June 2022, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program that provides for the repurchase of up to $15 billion of our common stock, with no\nexpiration from the date of authorization. Our stock repurchase program is intended to offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs\nand, subject to market conditions and other factors, may also be used to make opportunistic repurchases of our common stock to reduce outstanding share\ncount. Any share repurchases under our stock repurchase program may be made through open market transactions, block trades, privately negotiated\ntransactions including accelerated share repurchase agreements or other means at times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate, and will be\nfunded from our working capital or other financing alternatives. Moreover, any stock repurchases are subject to market conditions and other uncertainties and\nwe cannot predict if or when any stock repurchases will be made. We may terminate our stock repurchase program at any time without prior notice.\nThe stock repurchase activity under our stock repurchase program during the three months ended September 30, 2024 is summarized below:\nApproximate dollar\nTotal number of shares value of shares that\npurchased as part of may yet be purchased\nTotal number of Average price publicly announced under the plans or\nshares purchased paid per share(1) plans or programs programs\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\nBalance as of June 30, 2024 $ 7,857\nJuly 1, 2024 through July 31, 2024 15.3 $ 59.79 15.3 6,940\nAugust 1, 2024 through August 31, 2024 8.0 $ 67.01 8.0 6,401\nSeptember 1, 2024 through September 30, 2024 4.4 $ 73.46 4.4 6,081\nBalance as of September 30, 2024 27.7 27.7 $ 6,081\n(1) Average price paid per share for open market purchases includes broker commissions, but excludes excise tax.\nITEM 3: DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES\nNone.\nITEM 4: MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable.\nITEM 5: OTHER INFORMATION\nNone.\n72\nTable of Contents\nITEM 6: EXHIBITS\nINDEX TO EXHIBITS\nIncorporated by Reference\nExhibit\nNumber Exhibit Description Form Date Filed Filed Herewith\n10.01+ Amendment and Restatement of PayPal Holdings, Inc.
