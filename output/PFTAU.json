          "content": "PFIC Annual Information Statement:\nPerception Capital Corp. III\nIMPORTANT TAX NOTICE TO SHAREHOLDERS WHO ARE UNITED STATES\nPERSONS\nWe believe that Perception Capital Corp. III f/k/a Portage Fintech Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”)\nmeet the definition of “Passive Foreign Investment Corporations” (“PFICs”) for the taxable year ending\non December 31, 2023.\nThe attached PFIC Annual Information Statements are being provided for shareholders who are United\nStates persons pursuant to the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1295-1(g)(1). The PFIC\nAnnual Information Statement contains information to enable you, should you so choose based on the\nadvice of your tax advisors in light of your tax circumstances, to elect to treat the Company as a Qualified\nElecting Fund (\"QEF”).\nA United States person who makes a QEF election generally is required to annually include in his or her\nincome his or her pro rata share of the ordinary earnings and net capital gains of the Company for years in\nwhich the Company is a PFIC, whether or not the Company distributes any amounts to its shareholders.\nIf you do not elect to treat the Company as a QEF, then if the Company is a PFIC for any year during\nyour holding period, adverse tax consequences could result. In addition, in a multi-tiered PFIC structure,\nthe PFIC Annual Information Statement must also include the amount of cash and the fair market value of\nother properties distributed or deemed distributed to the shareholders during the taxable year of the PFICs\npursuant to Section 1.1295-1(g)(3).\nThe shareholder’s QEF election is generally made on Form 8621 (\"Return by a Shareholder of a Passive\nForeign Investment Company or Qualified Electing Fund”) attached to the shareholder’s federal income\ntax return that is filed on or before the due date of the return, including extensions. There are also other\nreporting options available on Form 8621, such as the mark-to-market election under Section 1296 of the\nInternal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Because the stock of the Company is traded on the\nNASDAQ stock exchange, and should be regularly traded thereon, we believe stock of the Company\nshould be treated as “marketable stock,” which would generally enable a shareholder to make this\nelection. A shareholder who makes this election generally is required to annually include in ordinary\nincome the excess amount (if any) of the fair market value of the stock as of the close of the taxable year\nover the shareholder’s adjusted basis in such stock. If instead the shareholder’s adjusted basis in such\nstock exceeds such fair market value, then in some cases that excess may be available as a deduction\nagainst other income. A mark-to-market election, or a QEF election, generally is effective for not only the\ntaxable year of the annual federal income tax return to which the Form 8621 on which the election is\nmade is attached, but for subsequent years as well. Shareholders should consult with their tax advisers to\ndetermine whether a QEF election or a mark-to-market election should be made.\nTHE INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS LETTER AND IN THE PFIC STATEMENT ATTACHED\nDOES NOT CONSTITUTE TAX ADVICE. THE U.S. TAX LAWS REGARDING PFICS ARE\nEXTREMELY COMPLEX AND SHAREHOLDERS ARE ADVISED TO CONSULT WITH THEIR\nOWN TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE OVERALL TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE\nOWNERSHIP OF UNITS ARISING IN THEIR OWN PARTICULAR SITUATIONS UNDER UNITED\nSTATES FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL OR FOREIGN LAW AS WELL AS TO DETERMINE\nAPPROPRIATE REPORTING OBLIGATIONS.\nPFIC Annual Information Statement\nThis information statement applies to Perception Capital Corp. III, a foreign corporation organized under\nthe laws of the Cayman Islands. Perception Capital Corp. III believes that it is a Passive Foreign\nInvestment Company (“PFIC”) for the tax period ending December 31, 2023 for U.S. tax purposes. If an\nelection has been made to treat this PFIC as a Qualified Electing Fund (“QEF”) by filing Form 8621, the\nfollowing information is relevant.\n1. The taxable year of Perception Capital Corp. III began on January 1, 2023 and ended on\nDecember 31, 2023 (the “Taxable Year”).\n2. Outstanding number of ordinary shares on December 31, 2023: 10,388,215.\n3. During the Taxable Year, the Company’s per-share, per-day ordinary earnings and net capital\ngain were:\nOrdinary Income: $0.001558\nNet Capital Gains: $0\n4. Cash and fair market value of other property distributed or deemed distributed per-share, per-day by the\nCompany for the Taxable Year:\nCash Distributions: $0\nProperty Distributions: $0\nThe Company will permit shareholders who are United States persons to inspect and copy its permanent\nbooks of account, records, and such other documents as may be maintained by the Company that are\nnecessary to establish that the Company’s ordinary earnings and net capital gain, as defined in Section\n1293(e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, are computed in accordance with U.S.\nincome tax principles; and to verify these amounts and the shareholder’s pro rata share thereof."
