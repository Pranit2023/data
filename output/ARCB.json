Net income was $100.3 million, or $4.23 per diluted share, including a $69.1 million after-tax benefit from the reduction in the fair value of contingent consideration related to a 2021 acquisition, compared to $34.9 million, or $1.42 per diluted share in the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, third quarter 2024 net income was $38.8 million, or $1.64 per diluted share, compared to $56.7 million, or $2.31 per diluted share in the prior year. \n\n“Over the past year, we have made substantial strides in controlling costs, improving productivity, and enhancing our service quality. These efforts contributed to ABF once again being recognized by Mastio for exceeding the industry benchmark for service,” said Judy R. McReynolds, ArcBest Chairman and CEO. “This achievement is a testament to our unwavering commitment to excellence and our strategic investments in technology, training, and network design. Thank you to our customers for this recognition and to our team for their hard work and dedication.” \n\nA 2021 truckload brokerage acquisition included a potential additional payout based on an earnout provision contingent on meeting specific targets through 2025. Due to the prolonged soft truckload market, no payments were made in 2023, and none are expected in 2024. With industry forecasts now suggesting a market recovery later in 2025, the likelihood of an earnout payment has been reduced. Consequently, in the third quarter, the estimated contingent consideration liability was reduced by $91.9 million pre-tax, or $69.1 million after-tax. This benefit is recorded as a reduction to expense in the Company’s GAAP results but has been excluded from non-GAAP results to better represent normal operations. \n\n** Results of Operations Comparisons **\n\n** Asset-Based **\n\nThird  Quarter 20 24 Versus  Third Quarter 20 23\n\n  * Revenue of $709.7 million compared to $741.2 million, a per-day decrease of 5.8 percent \n  * Total tonnage per day decrease of 11.3 percent \n  * Total shipments per day decrease of 0.7 percent \n  * Total billed revenue per hundredweight increase of 7.4 percent \n  * Operating income of $64.0 million and an operating ratio of 91.0 percent, compared to $74.8 million and an operating ratio of 89.9 percent \n  * On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $64.0 million and an operating ratio of 91.0 percent, compared to $82.8 million and an operating ratio of 88.8 percent \n\n\n\nOn a non-GAAP basis, the Asset-Based segment generated $18.8 million less operating income than third quarter 2023. Third quarter tonnage declines were driven by a 10.7 percent decrease in weight per shipment, while daily shipments were down only slightly. Prolonged manufacturing sector weakness continues to negatively impact weight per shipment metrics. Productivity improvements of 5.7 percent and other cost initiatives helped mitigate the impact of the softer market environment, higher insurance costs, and higher labor cost increases related to an annual union contract rate increase, which went into effect during the third quarter of 2024. \n\nPricing momentum continued in the quarter, driven by a 5.9 percent general rate increase put in place on September 9, 2024, and contract renewal increases of 4.6 percent. Overall, LTL industry pricing remains rational. \n\nCompared sequentially to the second quarter of 2024, third quarter 2024 revenue per day was flat, shipments per day improved by 1.4 percent, and billed revenue per hundredweight was 1.3 percent higher. However, weight per shipment deteriorated 3.2 percent and tonnage per day decreased 1.8 percent. Lower tonnage combined with higher labor and insurance costs resulted in the operating ratio deterioration of 120 basis points sequentially, which was below the average sequential quarterly changes achieved in recent years. \n\n** Asset-Light **\n\nThird Quarter 2024 Versus Third Quarter 2023\n\n  * Revenue of $385.3 million compared to $419.3 million, a per-day decrease of 9.6 percent \n  * Operating income of $84.8 million, including the $91.9 million pre-tax reduction in the fair value of contingent consideration related to an earnout, compared to operating loss of $3.7 million \n  * On a non‑GAAP basis, operating loss of $3.9 million in both periods \n  * Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”), as defined in the attached non-GAAP reconciliation tables, of negative $2.1 million compared to negative $2.0 million \n\n\n\nCompared to the third quarter of 2023, Asset-Light revenues were impacted by lower revenue per shipment associated with the soft rate environment and a higher mix of managed transportation business, which has smaller shipment sizes and lower revenue per shipment metrics. Shipments per day were slightly lower by 0.7 percent. Non-GAAP operating results were comparable to the third quarter prior year. The segment continues to benefit from productivity initiatives, as shipments per employee per day improved 19.5 percent, on a year-over-year basis, but the soft freight environment and excess truckload capacity continues to impact results. \n\nCompared sequentially to second quarter 2024, third quarter 2024 shipments per day were flat, yet daily revenue was down by 1.9 percent as revenue per shipment decreased 2.3 percent. Shipments per employee per day, improved by 3.3 percent, and total operating costs were managed lower. The $1.5 million sequential increase in non-GAAP operating loss was due primarily to the current truckload brokerage pricing environment. \n\n** Conference Call **\n\nArcBest will host a conference call with company executives to discuss the quarterly results.

However, management believes that certain non-GAAP performance measures and ratios utilized for internal analysis provide analysts, investors, and others the same information that we use internally for purposes of assessing our core operating performance and provides meaningful comparisons between current and prior period results, as well as important information regarding performance trends. Accordingly, non-GAAP results are presented on a continuing operations basis, excluding the discontinued operations of FleetNet, which sold on February 28, 2023. The use of certain non-GAAP measures improves comparability in analyzing our performance because it removes the impact of items from operating results that, in management's opinion, do not reflect our core operating performance. Other companies may calculate non-GAAP measures differently; therefore, our calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Certain information discussed in the scheduled conference call could be considered non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, our reported results. These financial measures should not be construed as better measurements than operating income, net income or earnings per share, as determined under GAAP.   \n**Three Months Ended** |  **Nine Months

Continued**  \n---  \n**Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (Adjusted EBITDA)** Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a key measure of performance and for business planning. The measure is particularly meaningful for analysis of operating performance because it excludes amortization of acquired intangibles and software of the Asset-Light segment, changes in the fair values of contingent consideration and equity investment, and lease impairment charges, which are significant expenses or gains resulting from strategic decisions or other factors rather than core daily operations. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is a primary component of the financial covenants contained in our credit agreement. The calculation of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA as presented below begins with net income from continuing operations, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. The calculation of Asset-Light Adjusted EBITDA as presented below begins with operating income (loss), as other income (costs), income taxes, and net income from continuing operations are reported at the consolidated level and not included in the operating segment financial information evaluated by management to make operating decisions.   \n**Three Months Ended** |  **Nine Months Ended**  \n**September 30** |  **September 30**  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \n**(Unaudited)**  \n($ thousands)   \n**ArcBest Corporation - Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA from Continuing Operations**  \n**Net Income from Continuing Operations** |  **$** |  **100,314** |  $  |  34,927  |  **$** |  **144,326** |  $  |  93,374   \nInterest and other related financing costs  |  **2,281** |  2,236  |  **6,587** |  6,768   \nIncome tax provision  |  **36,390** |  11,963  |  **36,928** |  25,735   \nDepreciation and amortization (10) |  **36,611** |  37,141  |  **109,720** |  107,962   \nAmortization of share-based compensation  |  **2,718** |  3,005  |  **9,040** |  8,537   \nChange in fair value of contingent consideration (3) |  **(91,910** |  **)** |  (17,840  |  )  |  **(80,740** |  **)** |  (12,800  |  )   \nLease impairment charges (4) |  **—** |  30,162  |  **—** |  30,162   \nChange in fair value of equity investment (5) |  **—** |  —  |  **28,739** |  (3,739  |  )   \nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA from Continuing Operations  |  **$** |  **86,404** |  $  |  101,594  |  **$** |  **254,600** |  $  |  255,999   \n_________________________  Note: See “Notes to Non-GAAP Financial Tables” for footnotes to this ArcBest Corporation – Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA from Continuing Operations non-GAAP table.   \n**Three Months Ended** |  **Nine Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n**September 30** |  **September 30**  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \n**(Unaudited)**  \n($ thousands)   \n**Asset-Light Adjusted EBITDA**  \n**Operating Income (Loss)** |  **$** |  **84,779** |  $  |  (3,704  |  )  |  **$** |  **60,023** |  $  |  (4,615  |  )   \nDepreciation and amortization (10) |  **5,037** |  5,097  |  **15,154** |  15,250   \nChange in fair value of contingent consideration (3) |  **(91,910** |  **)** |  (17,840  |  )  |  **(80,740** |  **)** |  (12,800  |  )   \nLease impairment charges (4) |  **—** |  14,407  |  **—** |  14,407   \nAsset-Light Adjusted EBITDA  |  **$** |  **(2,094** |  **)** |  $  |  (2,040  |  )  |  **$** |  **(5,563** |  **)** |  $  |  12,242   \n_________________________  Note: See “Notes to Non-GAAP Financial Tables” for footnotes to this Asset-Light Adjusted EBITDA non-GAAP table.   \n**ARCBEST CORPORATION** **RECONCILIATIONS OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES – Continued**  \n---  \n**Notes to Non-GAAP Financial Tables**  \nThe following footnotes apply to the non-GAAP financial tables presented in this press release.  \n1) |  Represents costs related to our customer pilot offering of Vaux and initiatives to optimize our performance through technological innovation. The 2023 period also includes costs associated with the freight handling pilot test program at ABF Freight, for which the decision was made to pause the pilot during third quarter 2023.   \n2) |  Represents the amortization of acquired intangible assets in the Asset-Light segment.   \n3) |  Represents change in fair value of the contingent earnout consideration recorded for the MoLo acquisition, as previously described in the footnotes to the Financial Statement Operating Segment Data and Operating Ratios table. As of September 30, 2024, the decrease in fair value reflects the reduction in payout assumptions projected for the earnout in 2025, due to the continued soft truckload environment and the latest industry expectations for a truckload market recovery being pushed further into 2025 than previously estimated.   \n4) |  Represents noncash lease-related impairment charges for a freight handling pilot facility reported in “Other”, an Asset‑Based service center, and Asset-Light office spaces that were made available for sublease.   \n5) |  For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, represents a noncash impairment charge to write off an equity investment in Phantom Auto, a provider of human-centered remote operation software, which ceased operations during first quarter 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, represents the increase in fair value of an investment in Phantom Auto based on observable price changes during second quarter 2023.   \n6) |  Represents recognition of the tax impact for the vesting of share-based compensation.   \n7) |  Non-GAAP amounts are calculated in total and may not equal the sum of GAAP amounts and non-GAAP adjustments due to rounding.   \n8) |  Represents costs associated with the freight handling pilot test program at ABF Freight, for which the decision was made to pause the pilot during third quarter 2023.   \n9) |  Tax rate for total “Amounts on GAAP basis” represents the effective tax rate. The tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments are calculated based on the statutory rate applicable to each item based on tax jurisdiction unless the nature of the item requires the tax effect to be estimated by applying a specific tax treatment.   \n10) |  Includes amortization of intangibles associated with acquired businesses.   \n**ARCBEST CORPORATION** **OPERATING STATISTICS**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended** |  **Nine Months Ended**  \n**September 30** |  **September 30**  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **% Change** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **% Change**  \n**(Unaudited)**  \n**Asset-Based**  \nWorkdays  |  **63.5** |  62.5  |  **191.0** |  190.0   \nBilled Revenue (1) / CWT  |  **$** |  **50.76** |  $  |  47.28  |  7.4  |  %  |  **$** |  **49.81** |  $  |  43.17  |  15.4  |  %   \nBilled Revenue (1) / Shipment  |  **$** |  **551.34** |  $  |  574.95  |  (4.1  |  %)  |  **$** |  **552.20** |  $  |  549.53  |  0.5  |  %   \nTonnage / Day  |  **10,983** |  12,389  |  (11.3  |  %)  |  **11,035** |  13,192  |  (16.4  |  %)   \nShipments / Day  |  **20,221** |  20,373  |  (0.7  |  %)  |  **19,907** |  20,727  |  (4.0  |  %)   \nShipments / DSY hour  |  **0.445** |  0.421  |  5.7  |  %  |  **0.445** |  0.423  |  5.2  |  %   \nWeight / Shipment  |  **1,086** |  1,216  |  (10.7  |  %)  |  **1,109** |  1,273  |  (12.9  |  %)   \nAverage Length of Haul (Miles)  |  **1,143** |  1,065  |  7.3  |  %  |  **1,130** |  1,096  |  3.1  |  %   \n_________________________  \n---  \n1) |  Revenue for undelivered freight is deferred for financial statement purposes in accordance with the Asset-Based segment revenue recognition policy.

Net income\nwas $100.3 million, or $4.23 per diluted share, including a $69.1 million after-tax benefit from the reduction in the\nfair value of contingent consideration related to a 2021 acquisition, compared to $34.9 million, or $1.42 per diluted\nshare in the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, third quarter 2024 net income was $38.8 million, or $1.64 per diluted\nshare, compared to $56.7 million, or $2.31 per diluted share in the prior year.\n“Over the past year, we have made substantial strides in controlling costs, improving productivity, and enhancing\nour service quality. These efforts contributed to ABF once again being recognized by Mastio for exceeding the\nindustry benchmark for service.” said Judy R. McReynolds, ArcBest Chairman and CEO. “This achievement is a\ntestament to our unwavering commitment to excellence and our strategic investments in technology, training, and\nnetwork design. Thank you to our customers for this recognition and to our team for their hard work and dedication.”\nA 2021 truckload brokerage acquisition included a potential additional payout based on an earnout provision\ncontingent on meeting specific targets through 2025. Due to the prolonged soft truckload market, no payments were\nmade in 2023, and none are expected in 2024. With industry forecasts now suggesting a market recovery later in\n2025, the likelihood of an earnout payment has been reduced. Consequently, in the third quarter, the estimated\ncontingent consideration liability was reduced by $91.9 million pre-tax, or $69.1 million after-tax. This benefit is\nrecorded as a reduction to expense in the Company’s GAAP results but has been excluded from non-GAAP results\nto better represent normal operations.\n1\nResults of Operations Comparisons\nAsset-Based\nThird Quarter 2024 Versus Third Quarter 2023\n• Revenue of $709.7 million compared to $741.2 million, a per-day decrease of 5.8 percent\n• Total tonnage per day decrease of 11.3 percent\n• Total shipments per day decrease of 0.7 percent\n• Total billed revenue per hundredweight increase of 7.4 percent\n• Operating income of $64.0 million and an operating ratio of 91.0 percent, compared to $74.8 million and an\noperating ratio of 89.9 percent\n• On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $64.0 million and an operating ratio of 91.0 percent, compared\nto $82.8 million and an operating ratio of 88.8 percent\nOn a non-GAAP basis, the Asset-Based segment generated $18.8 million less operating income than third quarter\n2023. Third quarter tonnage declines were driven by a 10.7 percent decrease in weight per shipment, while daily\nshipments were down only slightly. Prolonged manufacturing sector weakness continues to negatively impact\nweight per shipment metrics. Productivity improvements of 5.7 percent and other cost initiatives helped mitigate the\nimpact of the softer market environment, higher insurance costs, and higher labor cost increases related to an\nannual union contract rate increase, which went into effect during the third quarter of 2024.\nPricing momentum continued in the quarter, driven by a 5.9 percent general rate increase put in place on\nSeptember 9, 2024, and contract renewal increases of 4.6 percent. Overall, LTL industry pricing remains rational.\nCompared sequentially to the second quarter of 2024, third quarter 2024 revenue per day was flat, shipments per\nday improved by 1.4 percent, and billed revenue per hundredweight was 1.3 percent higher. However, weight per\nshipment deteriorated 3.2 percent and tonnage per day decreased 1.8 percent. Lower tonnage combined with\nhigher labor and insurance costs resulted in the operating ratio deterioration of 120 basis points sequentially, which\nwas below the average sequential quarterly changes achieved in recent years.\nAsset-Light\nThird Quarter 2024 Versus Third Quarter 2023\n• Revenue of $385.3 million compared to $419.3 million, a per-day decrease of 9.6 percent\n• Operating income of $84.8 million, including the $91.9 million pre-tax reduction in the fair value of contingent\nconsideration related to an earnout, compared to operating loss of $3.7 million\n• On a non-GAAP basis, operating loss of $3.9 million in both periods\n• Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”), as defined in\nthe attached non-GAAP reconciliation tables, of negative $2.1 million compared to negative $2.0 million\nCompared to the third quarter of 2023, Asset-Light revenues were impacted by lower revenue per shipment\nassociated with the soft rate environment and a higher mix of managed transportation business, which has smaller\nshipment sizes and lower revenue per shipment metrics. Shipments per day were slightly lower by 0.7 percent.\nNon-GAAP operating results were comparable to the third quarter prior year. The segment continues to benefit from\nproductivity initiatives, as shipments per employee per day improved 19.5 percent, on a year-over-year basis, but\nthe soft freight environment and excess truckload capacity continues to impact results.\nCompared sequentially to second quarter 2024, third quarter 2024 shipments per day were flat, yet daily revenue\nwas down by 1.9 percent as revenue per shipment decreased 2.3 percent. Shipments per employee per day,\nimproved by 3.3 percent, and total operating costs were managed lower. The $1.5 million sequential increase in\nnon-GAAP operating loss was due primarily to the current truckload brokerage pricing environment.\n2\nConference Call\nArcBest will host a conference call with company executives to discuss the quarterly results.

However,\nmanagement believes that certain non-GAAP performance measures and ratios utilized for internal analysis provide analysts,\ninvestors, and others the same information that we use internally for purposes of assessing our core operating performance and\nprovides meaningful comparisons between current and prior period results, as well as important information regarding\nperformance trends. Accordingly, non-GAAP results are presented on a continuing operations basis, excluding the discontinued\noperations of FleetNet, which sold on February 28, 2023. The use of certain non-GAAP measures improves comparability in\nanalyzing our performance because it removes the impact of items from operating results that, in management's opinion, do not\nreflect our core operating performance. Other companies may calculate non-GAAP measures differently; therefore, our\ncalculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Certain information discussed in the\nscheduled conference call could be considered non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in\naddition to, and not as an alternative for, our reported results. These financial measures should not be construed as better\nmeasurements than operating income, net income or earnings per share, as determined under GAAP.\nThree Mon th s Ended Nine Mon t hs Ended\nSeptember 30 September 30\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nArcBest Corporation -

The measure is particularly\nmeaningful for analysis of operating performance because it excludes amortization of acquired intangibles and software of the\nAsset-Light segment, changes in the fair values of contingent consideration and equity investment, and lease impairment\ncharges, which are significant expenses or gains resulting from strategic decisions or other factors rather than core daily\noperations. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is a primary component of the financial covenants contained in our credit agreement.\nThe calculation of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA as presented below begins with net income from continuing operations, which\nis the most directly comparable GAAP measure. The calculation of Asset-Light Adjusted EBITDA as presented below begins\nwith operating income (loss), as other income (costs), income taxes, and net income from continuing operations are reported at\nthe consolidated level and not included in the operating segment financial information evaluated by management to make\noperating decisions.\nT hree Mon th s Ended Nine Mon th s Ended\nSeptember 30 September 30\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(Unaudited)\n($ thousands)\nArcBest Corporation - Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA from\nContinuing Operations\nNet Income from Continuing Operations $ 100,314 $ 34,927 $ 144,326 $ 93,374\nInterest and other related financing costs 2,281 2,236 6,587 6,768\nIncome tax provision 36,390 11,963 36,928 25,735\nDepreciation and amortization(10) 36,611 37,141 109,720 107,962\nAmortization of share-based compensation 2,718 3,005 9,040 8,537\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration(3) (91,910) (17,840) (80,740) (12,800)\nLease impairment charges(4) — 30,162 — 30,162\nChange in fair value of equity investment(5) — — 28,739 (3,739)\nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA from Continuing Operations $ 86,404 $ 101,594 $ 254,600 $ 255,999\nNote: See “Notes to Non-GAAP Financial Tables” for footnotes to this ArcBest Corporation – Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA from Continuing\nOperations non-GAAP table.\nTh ree Mon th s Ended N ine Mon th s Ended\nSeptember 30 September 30\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(Unaudited)\n($ thousands)\nAsset-Light Adjusted EBITDA\nOperating Income (Loss) $ 84,779 $ (3,704) $ 60,023 $ (4,615)\nDepreciation and amortization(10) 5,037 5,097 15,154 15,250\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration(3) (91,910) (17,840) (80,740) (12,800)\nLease impairment charges(4) — 14,407 — 14,407\nAsset-Light Adjusted EBITDA $ (2,094) $ (2,040) $ (5,563) $ 12,242\nNote: See “Notes to Non-GAAP Financial Tables” for footnotes to this Asset-Light Adjusted EBITDA non-GAAP table.\n12\nARCBEST CORPORATION\nRECONCILIATIONS OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES – Continued\nNotes to Non-GAAP Financial Tables\nThe following footnotes apply to the non-GAAP financial tables presented in this press release.\n1) Represents costs related to our customer pilot offering of Vaux and initiatives to optimize our performance through\ntechnological innovation. The 2023 period also includes costs associated with the freight handling pilot test program at ABF\nFreight, for which the decision was made to pause the pilot during third quarter 2023.\n2) Represents the amortization of acquired intangible assets in the Asset-Light segment.\n3) Represents change in fair value of the contingent earnout consideration recorded for the MoLo acquisition, as previously\ndescribed in the footnotes to the Financial Statement Operating Segment Data and Operating Ratios table. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the decrease in fair value reflects the reduction in payout assumptions projected for the earnout in\n2025, due to the continued soft truckload environment and the latest industry expectations for a truckload market recovery\nbeing pushed further into 2025 than previously estimated.\n4) Represents noncash lease-related impairment charges for a freight handling pilot facility reported in “Other”, an Asset-Based\nservice center, and Asset-Light office spaces that were made available for sublease.\n5) For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, represents a noncash impairment charge to write off an equity investment\nin Phantom Auto, a provider of human-centered remote operation software, which ceased operations during first quarter\n2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, represents the increase in fair value of an investment in Phantom\nAuto based on observable price changes during second quarter 2023.\n6) Represents recognition of the tax impact for the vesting of share-based compensation.\n7) Non-GAAP amounts are calculated in total and may not equal the sum of GAAP amounts and non-GAAP adjustments due\nto rounding.\n8) Represents costs associated with the freight handling pilot test program at ABF Freight, for which the decision was made\nto pause the pilot during third quarter 2023.\n9) Tax rate for total “Amounts on GAAP basis” represents the effective tax rate. The tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments are\ncalculated based on the statutory rate applicable to each item based on tax jurisdiction unless the nature of the item requires\nthe tax effect to be estimated by applying a specific tax treatment.\n10) Includes amortization of intangibles associated with acquired businesses.\n13\nARCBEST CORPORATION\nOPERATING STATISTICS\nThr ee M onths E n ded Nin e M onths E nd ed\nSeptember 30 September 30\n2024 2023 % Change 2024 2023 % Change\n(Unaudited)\nAsset-Based\nWorkdays 63.5 62.5 191.0 190.0\nBilled Revenue(1) / CWT $ 50.76 $ 47.28 7.4% $ 49.81 $ 43.17 15.4%\nBilled Revenue(1) / Shipment $ 551.34 $ 574.95 (4.1%) $ 552.20 $ 549.53 0.5%\nTonnage / Day 10,983 12,389 (11.3%) 11,035 13,192 (16.4%)\nShipments / Day 20,221 20,373 (0.7%) 19,907 20,727 (4.0%)\nShipments / DSY hour 0.445 0.421 5.7% 0.445 0.423 5.2%\nWeight / Shipment 1,086 1,216 (10.7%) 1,109 1,273 (12.9%)\nAverage Length of Haul (Miles) 1,143 1,065 7.3% 1,130 1,096 3.1%\n1) Revenue for undelivered freight is deferred for financial statement purposes in accordance with the Asset-Based segment revenue\nrecognition policy.

Terms such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “foresee,”\n“intend,” “may,” “plan,” “predict,” “project,” “scheduled,” “should,” “would,” and similar expressions and the negatives of such terms are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These\nstatements are based on management’s beliefs, assumptions, and expectations based on currently available information, are not guarantees of future performance, and involve certain risks and\nuncertainties (some of which are beyond our control). Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made, we cannot provide\nassurance that our expectations will prove to be correct. Actual outcomes and results could materially differ from what is expressed, implied, or forecasted in these statements due to a number of\nfactors, including, but not limited to: the effects of a widespread outbreak of an illness or disease or any other public health crisis, as well as regulatory measures implemented in response to such\nevents; external events which may adversely affect us or the third parties who provide services for us, for which our business continuity plans may not adequately prepare us, including, but not\nlimited to, acts of war or terrorism, or military conflicts; data privacy breaches, cybersecurity incidents, and/or failures of our information systems, including disruptions or failures of services essential\nto our operations or upon which our information technology platforms rely; interruption or failure of third-party software or information technology systems or licenses; untimely or ineffective\ndevelopment and implementation of, or failure to realize the potential benefits associated with, new or enhanced technology or processes, including our customer pilot offering of Vaux; the loss or\nreduction of business from large customers or an overall reduction in our customer base; the timing and performance of growth initiatives and the ability to manage our cost structure; the cost,\nintegration, and performance of any recent or future acquisitions and the inability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition within the expected time period or at all; unsolicited takeover\nproposals, proxy contests, and other proposals/actions by activist investors; maintaining our corporate reputation and intellectual property rights; nationwide or global disruption in the supply chain\nresulting in increased volatility in freight volumes; competitive initiatives and pricing pressures; increased prices for and decreased availability of equipment, including new revenue equipment,\ndecreases in value of used revenue equipment, and higher costs of equipment-related operating expenses such as maintenance, fuel, and related taxes; availability of fuel, the effect of volatility in\nfuel prices and the associated changes in fuel surcharges on securing increases in base freight rates, and the inability to collect fuel surcharges; relationships with employees, including unions, and\nour ability to attract, retain, and upskill employees; unfavorable terms of, or the inability to reach agreement on, future collective bargaining agreements or a workforce stoppage by our employees\ncovered under ABF Freight’s collective bargaining agreement; union employee wages and benefits, including changes in required contributions to multiemployer plans; availability and cost of reliable\nthird-party services; our ability to secure independent owner-operators and/or operational or regulatory issues related to our use of their services; litigation or claims asserted against us;\ngovernmental regulations; environmental laws and regulations, including emissions-control regulations; default on covenants of financing arrangements and the availability and terms of future\nfinancing arrangements; our ability to generate sufficient cash from operations to support significant ongoing capital expenditure requirements and other business initiatives; self-insurance claims,\ninsurance premium costs, and loss of our ability to self-insure; potential impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill and intangible assets; general economic conditions and related shifts in market\ndemand that impact the performance and needs of industries we serve and/or limit our customers’ access to adequate financial resources; increasing costs due to inflation and higher interest rates;\nseasonal fluctuations, adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, and climate change; and other financial, operational, and legal risks and uncertainties detailed from time to time in ArcBest\nCorporation’s public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).\nFor additional information regarding known material factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those expressed in these forward-looking statements, please see our filings with the\nSEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and Current Reports on Form 8-K.\nReaders are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof.

However,\nmanagement believes that certain non-GAAP performance measures utilized for internal analysis provides analysts, investors, and others the\nsame information that we use internally for purposes of assessing our core operating performance and provides meaningful comparisons\nbetween current and prior period results, as well as important information regarding performance trends. Accordingly, using these measures\nimproves comparability in analyzing our performance because it removes the impact of items from operating results that, in management's\nopinion, do not reflect our core operating performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative\nfor, our reported results.
