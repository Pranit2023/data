This growth is largely due to a rise in average revenue per client in 2024, which increased from $71,830 to $89,355, and an expanded customer base that grew from 393 to 543 clients. These results are attributed to our marketing strategies and the growing demand for our services, particularly in the healthcare sector.”\n\n“While costs rose in tandem with revenue, which increased from $26.17 million to $45.77 million, this was in line with our growth strategy to scale up sales. Gross profit improved to $2.75 million, though the margin dipped slightly to 5.7% due to competitive pressures. Overall, we achieved net income of $1.29 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, up from $0.97 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023.”\n\n**Recent Developments**\n\nOn September 25, 2024, the Company announced a strategic partnership with AI platform Gauss Intelligence (Beijing) Technology Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of Global Mofy AI Ltd (Nasdaq: GMM). This collaboration aims to leverage the advanced capabilities of Gausspeed, a generative AI platform, with HAO’s application scenarios to deliver AI marketing solutions.\n\nOn September 20, 2024, the Company announced the closing of a follow-on offering underwritten by EF Hutton LLC, to raise aggregate gross proceeds of $12 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and other offering expenses.\n\n**Results of Operations for the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2024**\n\n_Revenue_\n\nThe Company generates revenue from one-stop online marketing solutions, including traffic acquisition from mainstream online media platforms, content production, data analysis and advertising campaign optimization, to advertisers through its operating entity, Beijing Haoxi Digital Technology Co. Ltd. in the People’s Republic of China.\n\nNet revenue was $28.23 million and $48.52 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively. The increase in revenue is mainly attributable to the increase in the average revenue per client from $71,830 in fiscal 2023 to $89,355 in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. The operating entity served 393 and 543 customers in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, and 2024, respectively. The higher average revenue per client in the current year is mainly attributable to higher advertisement expenditures made by our health care industry clients.\n\nThe average revenue per client under our advertisement pricing model consists of two components: 1) the average per unit-of-service price, which is the average price per click-through that we charge our advertiser customers, and 2) the quantity of services, which is the actual number of click-throughs with respect to each advertiser.\n\nThe increase in our quantity of services was because more people determined to use online services since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the strong recovery from our client base since January 2024 occurred when the COVID control measures were lifted in China. In addition we attribute the increase in services, in part to the increasing popularity of ByteDance media platforms, which we mainly collaborated with, among our advertiser customers.\n\n_Cost of revenue_\n\nOur cost of revenue(“COR”) consists primarily of the purchase of online traffic from third-party media platforms after deducting rebates, and salaries and benefits for business operation staff. The cost of revenue increased by $19.60 million, or 75%, from $26.17 million for fiscal 2023 to $45.77 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. The increase in COR was in line with the increase in revenue.\n\n_Gross profit and gross margin_\n\nOur gross profit increased by $0.69 million, from $2.06 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 to $2.75 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue (“profit margin”) was 5.7% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, lower than 7.3% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, which was mainly due to market competition. The Company needed to provide rebates to some customers, to maintain and expand the customer base.\n\n_Selling and marketing expenses_\n\nOur selling and marketing expenses primarily consist of payroll costs and office related expenses. Selling and marketing expenses increased by 30% from $32,133 in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 to $41,613 in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. This was mainly because we had a higher customer retention rate in fiscal 2024, leading to lower marketing expenses.\n\n_General and administrative expenses_\n\nOur general and administrative expenses mainly consist of salaries and bonus, as well as office related expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by $135,570, or 17%, from $775,961 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 to $911,531 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. The increase was mainly attributable to an increase in salary and bonuses of the management team and professional fees in connection with our initial public offering on January 30, 2024.\n\n_Research and development expenses_\n\nOur research and development(“R&D”) expenses mainly consist of salaries and benefits of our R&D staff for the development of Bidding Compass, our online ads bidding analysis software. R&D expenses increased by $21,824, or 38%, from $58,161 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 to $79,985 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. It was mainly attributable to the increase in salaries of R&D staff.\n\n_Income taxes_\n\nWe had income taxes of $220,653 and $443,582 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively.\n\n_Net (loss)/income_\n\nAs a result of the foregoing, we had net income of $0.97 million and $1.29 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively.\n\n_Cash and equivalents_\n\nAs of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, HAO had $6,655,734 in cash and cash equivalents as compared to $1,203,203 as of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023.\n\n**About Haoxi Health Technology Limited**\n\nHaoxi Health Technology Limited is an online marketing solution provider headquartered in Beijing, China, specializing in serving healthcare industry advertiser clients.
