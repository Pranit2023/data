Such statements may include, but are not limited to, anticipated\nfuture financial and operating results and Silicom’s outlook and prospects. Those statements are based on management’s current beliefs, expectations and assumptions, which may be affected by\nsubsequent business, political, environmental, regulatory, economic and other conditions, and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties and other factors many of which are outside\nSilicom’s control, which might cause actual results to differ materially from expectations expressed or implied in the forward looking statements, and which include, but are not limited to, Silicom’s\nincreasing dependence for substantial revenue growth on a limited number of customers, the speed and extent to which Silicom's solutions are adopted by the relevant markets, difficulty in\ncommercializing and marketing of Silicom’s products and services, maintaining and protecting brand recognition, protection of intellectual property, competition, disruptions to its manufacturing, sales &\nmarketing, development and customer support activities, the impact of the wars in Gaza and in the Ukraine, attacks on shipping by Huthis in the Red Sea, rising inflation, rising interest rates and volatile\nexchange rates, as well as any continuing or new effects resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, and the global economic uncertainty, which may impact customer demand by encouraging them to\nexercise greater caution and selectivity with their short-term IT investment plans. The factors noted above are not exhaustive. Further information about the company’s businesses, including information\nabout factors that could materially affect Silicom’s results of operations and financial condition, are discussed in our Annual Report on Form 20-F and other documents filed by the Company and that may\nbe subsequently filed by the company from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"). Therefore, there can be no assurance that actual future results will not differ\nsignificantly from anticipated results. Consequently, you are cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements.
