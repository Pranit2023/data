Dr. Bedu-Addo further noted that “based on investor feedback, discussions with key opinion leaders involved with the study and other experts, we have made minor modifications to the VERSATILE-003 trial design to reduce the overall cost and time required to achieve an interim data readout and trial completion.”\n\nWith submission of the updated Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) this week, the Company expects the FDA clearance decision by mid-December, allowing the Company to initiate site activation in the first quarter of 2025.\n\n“Elsewhere in our pipeline, we were pleased with the data from the IMMUNOCERV Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating Versamune® HPV with chemoradiation to treat locally advanced cervical cancer presented at the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) annual meeting. The presented data demonstrated promising clinical activity and a compelling safety profile. Based on continued research in various HPV-positive cancers conducted by PDS Biotech and independent researchers who recognize its potential, Versamune® HPV appears to work in combination with a variety of therapeutic agents to generate clinical responses and promote improved survival in patients with favorable toxicity. We are exploring the next steps in the development of Versamune® HPV for cervical cancer,” concluded Dr. Bedu-Addo.\n\n**Recent Developments**\n\n  * **Update to Phase 3 VERSATILE-003 Trial Design in HPV16-positive first-line recurrent and/or metastatic HNSCC**\n    * Updated trial design to include approximately 350 patients\n    * VERSATILE-002 results have shown broadly improving clinical responses across multiple parameters with increases in patient size and duration of patient follow up over the last year, demonstrating durability of the anti-tumor responses\n    * The design, which is informed by the observed durability of the clinical responses, retains statistical power and remains within the confines of our agreement with the FDA on registrational design\n    * Design maintains 2:1 randomization and median overall survival as primary endpoint\n    * Design imparts potential for earlier interim readouts and study completion\n    * Design presents potential for reduced execution costs\n    * Amended IND (updated design) submitted November 2024\n\n\n  * In September 2024, we provided updated results from our VERSATILE-002 Phase 2 clinical trial in recurrent and/or metastatic HPV16-positive HNSCC patients treated with the combination of Versamune® HPV and pembrolizumab presented at European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress 2024 by Jared Weiss, M.D., Section Chief of Thoracic and Head/Neck Oncology, Professor of Medicine at the University of North Carolina, and principal investigator of the VERSATILE-002 clinical trial.

We also believe that data from more than 350 patients, as well as ongoing clinical trials across multiple tumor types and standard treatment regimens, have validated the potential for both platforms and point to potential broad utility.\n\nFor more information, please visit [www.pdsbiotech.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=1dFkx6PDsCfYz382VITZmWpD1pD0eU5SACcKZYbGF-QGgNjzcYslwEwDZnPgZrWq-BMih2UM6AVrmz56sBfkX2UL9xr1fe0zqBv48tQ_Uq0= \"www.pdsbiotech.com\").\n\n**Forward Looking Statements** This communication contains forward-looking statements (including within the meaning of Section 21E of the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 27A of the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended) concerning PDS Biotechnology Corporation (the “Company”) and other matters.
