The notice confirmed that the Company has regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement as set forth in Nasdaq’s Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the “Bid Price Rule”).\n\nPreviously on October 23, 2023, Nasdaq notified the Company that its Common Stock failed to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 over the previous 30 consecutive business days as required by the Bid Price Rule. Nasdaq determined that for the last 10 consecutive business days, from October 2, 2024, to October 15, 2024, the closing bid price of the Company’s common stock was at $1.00 per share or greater. Accordingly, the Company has regained compliance with Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) and this matter is now closed.\n\nAndy Ross, CEO of American Rebel, stated, “We are pleased to report that Nasdaq has recognized our compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. With the resolution of this compliance issue, we can continue to build upon the great progress made during 2024 by concentrating our resources on continuing to improve and advance our Champion Safe and American Rebel Beverage business units. The recent launch of our domestic premium light lager beer, American Rebel Light, has continued to exceed expectations. Since our first production run at the end of August 2024 we have announced several shipments to our distribution partners and can proudly state that American Rebel Light Beer – America’s Patriotic, God-Fearing, Constitution-Loving, National Anthem-Singing, Stand Your Ground Beer, is now available at retail establishments within our distributor service territories and being served at several on-premise accounts. Champion Safe has continued to streamline its operations and product offerings, which has reduced the overall monthly burn and is prepared for scale around the new rightsized product mix, including the introduction of new products to satisfy market demand in Q4 and Q1 of next year. Our focus remains on capturing market share and revenue growth in order to increase stockholder value.”\n\n**About American Rebel Holdings, Inc.**\n\nAmerican Rebel Holdings, Inc.

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.**\n\nPurchase and Exchange Agreement\n\nOn November 11, 2024, the Company entered into a Purchase and Exchange Agreement among an investor (the \"Purchaser”) and Altbanq Lending LLC (the \"Seller”), pursuant to which the Purchaser agreed to purchase from the Seller a portion ($150,469.11) of a promissory note dated March 27, 2024 in the original principal amount of $1,330,000 (the \"Note”), with a current balance payable of $1,229,350 (the \"Note Balance”).\n\nContemporaneously with assignment of the assigned note portion to the Purchaser, the Company exchanged the $150,469.11 of assigned note portion for 78,615 shares of the Company’s common stock as a 3(a)(9) exchange.\n\nAt any time during the ninety days after the initial closing, the Purchaser may purchase additional portions of the Note, at one or more closing, by sending an additional closing notice in the amount set forth in the additional note notice and the Company will exchange such additional portions for shares of its common stock as a 3(a)(9) exchange. The additional shares will be calculated by dividing the relevant additional portion by 75% of the average of the three lowest bids for the Company’s common stock on its principal trading market on the five trading days prior to the closing of the purchase of the additional portion.\n\nThe Purchase and Exchange Agreement contains a beneficial ownership limitation of 4.99% of the number of the common shares outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of common shares issuable upon any closing of the purchase of an additional portion by the Purchaser. No closing of the purchase of any additional portion shall take effect nor shall the Purchaser be able to purchase any additional portion to the extent that after giving effect to such issuance after closing, the Purchaser (together with the Purchaser’s Affiliates, and any other Persons acting as a group together with the Purchaser or any of the Purchaser’s Affiliates), would beneficially own in excess of the beneficial ownership limitation.\n\nThe Company will not issue shares of common stock in excess of 19.99% of the shares outstanding as of the date of the Purchase and Exchange Agreement. In the event the previous sentence restricts the Company’s ability to completely convert the Note, the Company will seek stockholder approval to allow the issuance shares of common stock in excess of 19.99% of the shares outstanding.\n\nFor a period of ninety days after the closing, the Seller and Company shall not further amend the Note nor allow any payments to be made on account of the Note. In the event there has been a material adverse event with the Company or tother reasonable cause, upon fifteen (15) days written notice, the Seller may accelerate the termination of this period.\n\nThe foregoing descriptions of the Purchase and Exchange Agreement and of all of the parties’ rights and obligations under the Purchase and Exchange Agreement are qualified in its entirety by reference to the Purchase and Exchange Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, and of which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\nOID Note\n\nOn November 11, 2024, the Company entered into a twelve-month promissory note with an accredited investor (the \"Lender”) in the principal amount of $400,000 (the \"Note”). An original issue discount of $80,000 was applied on the issuance date and was paid through the issuance of 26,756 shares of the Company’s common stock to the Lender, resulting in net loan proceeds to the Company of $320,000. Accrued, unpaid interest and outstanding principal, subject to adjustment, is required to be paid in seven payments of $52,571.43, with the first payment due on May 11, 2025, and remaining six payments due on the 11th day of each month thereafter (a total payback to the Lender of $368,000.01).\n\nUpon the occurrence and during the continuation of any Event of Default, the Note shall become immediately due and payable and the Company will be obligated to pay to the Lender, in full satisfaction of its obligations, an amount equal to 130% times the sum of (w) the then outstanding principal amount of the Note plus (x) accrued and unpaid interest on the unpaid principal amount of the Note to the date of payment plus (y) any amounts owed to the Lender pursuant to the conversion rights referenced below.\n\n2  \n---  \n  \nAt any time after 180 days from the issuance date of the Note, the Lender may convert the outstanding unpaid principal amount of the Note into restricted shares of common stock of the Company at the lesser of (i) $2.94 per share, or (ii) the average of the three (3) lowest VWAP’s in the preceding five (5) day trading period to the conversion date. The Lender agreed to limit the amount of stock received to less than 4.99% of the total outstanding common stock. There are no warrants or other derivatives attached to this Note. The Company agreed to reserve a number of shares of common stock equal to three times the number of shares of common stock which may be issuable upon conversion of the Note at all times.\n\nThe foregoing descriptions of the Note and of all of the parties’ rights and obligations under the Note is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Note, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, and of which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n**Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation Under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.**\n\nThe information set forth above in Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n**Item 3.02 Sale of Unregistered Securities.**\n\nOn November 11, 2024, the Company authorized the issuance of 78,615 shares of common stock pursuant to the Purchase and Exchange Agreement described in Item 1.01 above.\n\nOn November 11, 2024, the Company authorized the issuance of 26,756 shares of common stock pursuant to the OID Note described in Item 1.01 above.\n\nOn November 11, 2024, the Company authorized the issuance of 44,000 shares of common stock to Charles A. Ross, Jr., the Company’s CEO and Chairman, upon the conversion of 88 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock.\n\nThe issuance of the shares of Common Stock will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, in reliance upon the exemption from the registration requirements of that Act provided by Section 4(a)(2) thereof. The recipients are accredited investors with the experience and expertise to evaluate the merits and risks of an investment in securities of the Company and the financial means to bear the risks of such an investment.\n\n**Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.**\n\nOn November 12, 2024, the Company issued a press release entitled \"American Rebel Light Debuts at Renowned Nashville Bar and Original Live Music Venue The Local Nashville and The Local Hendersonville.” A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.\n\nThe press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.

As of the date hereof $1,229,350 in principal (**“Note Balance”**) (constituting $910,000 of the original principal, $150 bounce payment fee, $15,000 late fee and $304,200 collection costs) is due and payable under the Note.\n\nWHEREAS, the Seller desires to sell a portion of the Note consisting of $150,469.11 (the “**Assigned Note Portion** ”) to the Purchaser and the Purchaser desires to purchase the Assigned Note Portion from the Seller on the terms set forth in this Agreement;\n\nWHEREAS, the Company agrees that contemporaneously with assignment of the Assigned Note Portion to the Purchaser the Company will exchange the Assigned Note Portion for 78,615 shares of the Company’s common stock (at $1.914 per share) as a 3(a)(9) exchange (the “**Exchange Shares** ”);\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, IN CONSIDERATION of the mutual covenants contained in this Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:\n\n**ARTICLE I**\n\n**PURCHASE AND SALE**\n\n1.1 _The Initial Closing_.

Any security interest arising from or securing the Note shall not be terminated at the Closing. All of the Seller’s rights under the Note and documents delivered in connection with the underlying loan shall remain in full force and effect except that the Assigned Note Portion shall be deemed satisfied.

The Additional Shares will be calculated by dividing the relevant Additional Portion by 75% of the average of the three lowest bids for the Company’s common stock on its principal trading market on the five trading days prior to the closing of the purchase of the Additional Portion. Each Additional Closing Notice shall set forth the Additional Portion being purchased, which shall also be the Purchase Price and the number of Additional Shares to be issued. At the closing of each Additional Portion the parties shall make the same deliveries as set forth in Section 1.2 (b) and 1.2(c).\n\nThe “Beneficial Ownership Limitation” shall be 4.99% of the number of the Common Shares outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of common shares issuable upon any closing of the purchase of an Additional Portion by the Purchaser.

For a period of ninety days after the Closing (the “**Standstill Period** ”), the Seller and Company shall not further amend the Note nor allow any payments to be made on account of the Note. In the event there has been a material adverse event with the Company or tother reasonable cause, upon fifteen (15) days written notice, the Seller may accelerate the termination of the Standstill Period.\n\n1.6 _Enforcement_.

In the event the Company fails to issue to the Purchaser any Exchange Shares or Additional Shares within one trading day after the relevant Closing, the Purchaser shall have the right to rescind such purchase. Upon such rescission, the Company will not be required to issue any shares of common stock, the amount owed on the Note will remain as it was had such purchase not occurred and the Seller will return the relevant purchase price.\n\n1.10 _Funds received_. Notwithstanding Section 1.5 to the extent any payments are received during the Standstill Period the Seller may apply such Payment to the outstanding amounts owed on the Note or return such funds to the Company.

The Purchaser understands and acknowledges that the Assigned Note Portion, Additional Portion, Exchange Shares or Additional Shares is being acquired from the Seller without the Company furnishing any information to the Purchaser and that the Purchaser has not had any communication with the Company or any officer, director, or representative thereof in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement except as contained herein.\n\n4  \n---  \n  \n(E) If Purchaser has chosen to do so, Purchaser has been represented by such legal and tax counsel and other professionals, each of whom has been personally selected by Purchaser, as Purchaser has found necessary to consult concerning the purchase of the Assigned Note Portion, Additional Portion, Exchange Shares or Additional Shares.\n\n(F) With respect to the United States federal, state and foreign tax aspects of Purchaser’s investment, Purchaser is relying solely upon the advice of Purchaser’s own tax advisors, and/or upon Purchaser’s own knowledge with respect thereto.\n\n(G) Purchaser has not relied, and will not rely upon, any information with respect to this Agreement other than the information contained in this Agreement. Purchaser understands that no person has been authorized to make representations or to give any information or literature with respect to this Agreement that is inconsistent with the information that is set forth in this Agreement.\n\n(H) Purchaser understands that, other than as provided in this Agreement, no covenants, representations, or warranties have been authorized by or will be binding upon the Company, with regard to this Agreement, the performance of the Company or any expectation of investment returns, including any representations, warranties or agreements contained or made in any written document or oral communication received from or had with the Company, its Affiliates, Company counsel or any of their respective representatives or agents. Purchaser has not relied upon any information or representation that may be or has been made or given except as permitted under this Agreement.\n\n(I) Purchaser understands that the Assigned Note Portion, Additional Portion, Exchange Shares or Additional Shares has not been registered under the Act, or pursuant to the provisions of the securities or other laws of any other applicable jurisdictions. The Purchaser is aware that the Assigned Note Portion, Additional Portion, Exchange Shares or Additional Shares are “restricted securities” as such term is defined in Rule 144 promulgated under the Act (“Rule 144”), and they may not be sold pursuant to Rule 144 unless all of the conditions of Rule 144 are met.\n\n(J) Purchaser has substantial investment experience and is familiar with investments of the type contemplated by this Agreement. Purchaser is aware that purchase of the Assigned Note Portion, Additional Portion, Exchange Shares or Additional Shares is a speculative investment involving a high degree of risk and there is no guarantee that Purchaser will realize any gain from Purchaser’s investment or realize any tax benefits therefrom and Purchaser is further aware that Purchaser may lose all or a substantial part of Purchaser’s investment. Purchaser understands that there are substantial restrictions on the transferability of the Assigned Note Portion, Additional Portion, Exchange Shares or Additional Shares. Purchaser affirms that Purchaser acknowledges that this investment is highly speculative, involves a high degree of risk and, accordingly, Purchaser can afford to lose its entire investment.\n\n(K) The Purchaser hereby agrees that the Company may insert the following or similar legend on the face of the Assigned Note Portion, Additional Portion, Exchange Shares or Additional Shares and any shares of the Company’s common stock issued upon exchange of the Note, if required in compliance with the Securities Act or state securities laws:\n\n“These securities have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“ _Act_ ”), or any state securities laws and may not be sold or otherwise transferred or disposed of except pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Act and any applicable state securities laws, or an opinion of counsel satisfactory to counsel to the Company that an exemption from registration under the act and any applicable state securities laws is available.”  \n---  \n  \n5  \n---  \n  \n2.3 _Consent, Representations and Warranties of the Company_. The Company hereby makes the following representations and warranties:\n\n(A) _Consent_.

Interest payable on this Note shall accrue on the Issuance Date and shall be computed on the basis of a 365-day year and actual days elapsed at a rate per annum (the “**Interest Rate** ”) equal to 15% per annum. Interest on the Principal Amount shall be payable in full on the Maturity Date, whether by acceleration or otherwise.\n\n2. _Monthly Payments_. Accrued, unpaid Interest and outstanding principal, subject to adjustment, shall be paid in seven (7) payments each in the amount of $52,571.43 (a total payback to the Holder of $368,000.01). The first payment shall be due May 11, 2025 with six (6) subsequent payments on the 11th day of each month thereafter. The Company shall have a thirty (30) day grace period with respect to each payment. The Company shall not have the right to accelerate payments or prepay this Note at any time. All payments shall be made by bank wire transfer to the Holder’s wire instructions, attached hereto as Exhibit A. For the avoidance of doubt, a missed payment shall be considered an Event of Default, subject to the cure period set forth above. Holder, at its sole option, may defer any monthly payment due hereunder pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Deferral Notice and Agreement, attached hereto as Exhibit B.\n\n3. _Borrower Redemption of Principal Amount_. Upon mutual agreement between the Borrower and Holder, the Borrower may have the option of prepaying the outstanding Principal Amount, in whole or in part, by paying to the Holder a sum of money equal to one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the Principal Amount to be redeemed, together with accrued but unpaid Interest thereon and any and all other sums due, accrued or payable to the Holder arising under this Note.\n\n1  \n---  \n  \n4. _Issuance of Replacement Note_. Upon any partial repayment, deferral or conversion of this Note, a replacement Note containing the same date and provisions of this Note shall, at the written request of the Holder, be issued by the Borrower to the Holder for the outstanding Principal Amount of this Note and accrued Interest which shall not have been paid.\n\n5. _Conversion Right_. At any time after 180 days from the Issuance Date of this Note, the Holder shall have the right to convert all or any part of the outstanding and unpaid amount of this Note into fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock, as such Common Stock exists on the Issuance Date, or any shares of capital stock or other securities of the Borrower into which such Common Stock shall hereafter be changed or reclassified at the conversion price determined as provided herein (a “**Conversion** ”); provided, however, that in no event shall the Holder be entitled to convert any portion of this Note in excess of that portion of this Note upon conversion of which the sum of (1) the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its affiliates (other than shares of Common Stock which may be deemed beneficially owned through the ownership of the unconverted portion of the Notes or the unexercised or unconverted portion of any other security of the Borrower subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitations contained herein) and (2) the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the portion of this Note with respect to which the determination of this proviso is being made, would result in beneficial ownership by the Holder and its affiliates of more than 4.99% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock. For purposes of the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence, beneficial ownership shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “**Exchange Act** ”), and Regulations 13D-G thereunder, except as otherwise provided in clause (1) of such proviso. The beneficial ownership The beneficial ownership limitations on conversion as set forth in the section may NOT be waived by the Holder. The number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon each conversion of this Note shall be determined by dividing the Conversion Amount (as defined below) by the applicable Conversion Price then in effect on the date specified in the notice of conversion, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C (the “**Notice of Conversion** ”), delivered to the Borrower by the Holder in accordance with Section 5(c) below; provided that the Notice of Conversion is submitted by facsimile or e-mail (or by other means resulting in, or reasonably expected to result in, notice) to the Borrower before 6:00 p.m., New York, New York time on such conversion date (the “**Conversion Date** ”); however, if the Notice of Conversion is sent after 6:00pm, New York, New York time the Conversion Date shall be the next business day. The term “**Conversion Amount** ” means, with respect to any conversion of this Note, the sum of (1) the principal amount plus accrued interest of this Note to be converted in such conversion plus (2) at the Holder’s option, Default Interest, if any, on the amounts referred to in the immediately preceding clauses (1) and/or (2) plus (4) at the Holder’s option, any amounts owed to the Holder pursuant to Section 5(c) hereof. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, and in addition to the limitations set forth herein, if the Borrower has not obtained Stockholder Approval, the Borrower shall not issue a number of shares of Common Stock under this Agreement, which when aggregated with all other securities that are required to be aggregated for purposes of Rule 5635(d), would exceed 19.99% of the shares of Common Stock outstanding as of the date of definitive agreement with respect to the first of such aggregated transactions (the “**Conversion Limitation** ”). For purposes of this section, “**Stockholder Approval** ” means such approval as may be required by the applicable rules and regulations of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (or any successor entity) from the stockholders of the Company with respect to the issuance of the shares under this Agreement that, when taken together with any other securities that are required to be aggregated with the issuance of the shares issued under this Agreement for purposes of Rule 5635(d) of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“**Rule 5635(d)** ”), would exceed 19.99% of the issued and outstanding common stock as of the date of definitive agreement with respect to the first of such aggregated transactions. “**Principal Market** ” means the Exchanges, the quotation platforms maintained by the OTC Markets Group or an equivalent replacement exchange, and all rules and regulations relating to such exchange. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default pursuant to Section 6 hereof, the Conversion Limitation shall no longer apply to limit the issuance of shares in conversion of this Note.\n\n2  \n---  \n  \n(a) _Conversion Price_. Subject to Nasdaq Rules limiting the conversion price to 75% of the Market Price, the Conversion Price shall mean the lesser of (i) $2.94 per share (the closing price of Borrower’s common stock on the day prior to the Issuance Date), or (ii) the Market Price (as defined herein) (subject to equitable adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends or rights offerings by the Borrower relating to the Borrower’s securities or the securities of any subsidiary of the Borrower, combinations, recapitalization, reclassifications, extraordinary distributions and similar events). If the Conversion Price is subject to adjustment based upon Nasdaq Rules, the Conversion Price shall be the set at the lowest price applicable for the conversion to comply with Nasdaq Rules. “**Market Price** ” means the average of the three (3) lowest VWAP’s in the preceding five (5) day trading period to the Conversion Date. “**VWAP** ” means, for any security as of any date, the dollar volume-weighted average price for such security on the Principal Market (or, if the Principal Market is not the principal trading market for such security, then on the principal securities exchange or securities market on which such security is then traded), during the period beginning at 9:30 a.m., New York time, and ending at 4:00 p.m., New York time, as reported by Bloomberg through its “VAP” function (set to 09:30 start time and 16:00 end time) or, if the foregoing does not apply, the dollar volume-weighted average price of such security in the over-the-counter market on the electronic bulletin board for such security during the period beginning at 9:30 a.m., New York time, and ending at 4:00 p.m., New York time, as reported by Bloomberg, or, if no dollar volume-weighted average price is reported for such security by Bloomberg for such hours, the average of the highest closing bid price and the lowest closing ask price of any of the market makers for such security as reported in The Pink Open Market (or a similar organization or agency succeeding to its functions of reporting prices). If the VWAP cannot be calculated for such security on such date on any of the foregoing bases, the VWAP of such security on such date shall be the fair market value as mutually determined by the Borrower and the Holder. All such determinations shall be appropriately adjusted for any stock dividend, stock split, stock combination, recapitalization or other similar transaction during such period.\n\n(b) _Authorized Shares_. The Borrower covenants that during the period that the Note is outstanding, the Borrower will reserve from its authorized and unissued Common Stock a sufficient number of shares, free from preemptive rights, to provide for the issuance of Common Stock upon the full conversion of this Note. The Borrower is required at all times to have authorized and reserved three times the number of shares that is actually issuable upon full conversion of the Note (based on the Conversion Price of the Note in effect from time to time initially 321,071 shares) (the “**Reserved Amount** ”). The Reserved Amount shall be increased (or decreased) from time to time (and in the case of each payment received by the Holder hereunder) in accordance with the Borrower’s obligations hereunder. The Borrower represents that upon issuance, such shares will be duly and validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. In addition, if the Borrower shall issue any securities or make any change to its capital structure which would change the number of shares of Common Stock into which the Notes shall be convertible at the then current Conversion Price, the Borrower shall at the same time make proper provision so that thereafter there shall be a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock authorized and reserved, free from preemptive rights, for conversion of the outstanding Note. The Borrower (i) acknowledges that it has irrevocably instructed its transfer agent to issue certificates for the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note, and (ii) agrees that its issuance of this Note shall constitute full authority to its officers and agents who are charged with the duty of executing stock certificates to execute and issue the necessary certificates for shares of Common Stock in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Note.\n\n3  \n---  \n  \n(c) _Method of Conversion_.\n\n(i) __Mechanics of Conversion__. As set forth in Section 5 hereof, at any time following 180 days from the Issuance Date, the balance due pursuant to this Note may be converted by the Holder in whole or in part by (A) submitting to the Borrower a Notice of Conversion (by facsimile, e-mail or other reasonable means of communication dispatched on the Conversion Date prior to 6:00 p.m., New York, New York time) and (B) subject to Section 4.5(c)(ii), surrendering this Note at the principal office of the Borrower (upon payment in full of any amounts owed hereunder).\n\n(ii) __Surrender of Note Upon Conversion__. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, upon conversion of this Note in accordance with the terms hereof, the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender this Note to the Borrower unless the entire unpaid principal amount of this Note is so converted. The Holder and the Borrower shall maintain records showing the principal amount so converted and the dates of such conversions or shall use such other method, reasonably satisfactory to the Holder and the Borrower, so as not to require physical surrender of this Note upon each such conversion.\n\n(iii) __Delivery of Common Stock Upon Conversion__. Upon receipt by the Borrower from the Holder of a facsimile transmission or e-mail (or other reasonable means of communication) of a Notice of Conversion meeting the requirements for conversion as provided in this Section 5(c), the Borrower shall issue and deliver or cause to be issued and delivered to or upon the order of the Holder certificates for the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion within three (3) business days after such receipt subject to the terms hereof and applicable rules of the Principal Market (as defined hereinbelow) (the “**Deadline** ”) (and, solely in the case of conversion of the entire unpaid principal amount hereof, surrender of this Note) in accordance with the terms hereof. Upon receipt by the Borrower of a Notice of Conversion, the Holder shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion, the outstanding principal amount and the amount of accrued and unpaid interest on this Note shall be reduced to reflect such conversion, and, unless the Borrower defaults on its obligations hereunder, all rights with respect to the portion of this Note being so converted shall forthwith terminate except the right to receive the Common Stock or other securities, cash or other assets, as herein provided, on such conversion. If the Holder shall have given a Notice of Conversion as provided herein, the Borrower’s obligation to issue and deliver the certificates for Common Stock shall be absolute and unconditional, irrespective of the absence of any action by the Holder to enforce the same, any waiver or consent with respect to any provision thereof, the recovery of any judgment against any person or any action to enforce the same, any failure or delay in the enforcement of any other obligation of the Borrower to the holder of record, or any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, limitation or termination, or any breach or alleged breach by the Holder of any obligation to the Borrower, and irrespective of any other circumstance which might otherwise limit such obligation of the Borrower to the Holder in connection with such conversion.\n\n4  \n---  \n  \n(iv) __Delivery of Common Stock by Electronic Transfer__. In lieu of delivering physical certificates representing the Common Stock issuable upon conversion, provided the Borrower is participating in the Depository Trust Company (“**DTC** ”) Fast Automated Securities Transfer (“**FAST** ”) program, upon request of the Holder and its compliance with the provisions set forth herein, the Borrower shall use its best efforts to cause its transfer agent to electronically transmit the Common Stock issuable upon conversion to the Holder by crediting the account of Holder’s Prime Broker with DTC through its Deposit and Withdrawal at Custodian (“**DWAC** ”) system.\n\n(v) __Failure to Deliver Common Stock Prior to Deadline__. Without in any way limiting the Holder’s right to pursue other remedies, including actual damages and/or equitable relief, the parties agree that if delivery of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note is not delivered by the Deadline due to willful and purposeful action and/or inaction of the Borrower, the Borrower shall pay to the Holder $500 per day in cash, for each day beyond the Deadline that the Borrower fails to deliver such Common Stock (the “**Fail to Deliver Fee** ”); provided; however that the Fail to Deliver Fee shall not be due if the failure is a result of a third party (i.e., transfer agent; and not the result of any failure to pay such transfer agent) despite the best efforts of the Borrower to effect delivery of such Common Stock. Such cash amount shall be paid to Holder by the fifteenth day of the month following the month in which it has accrued or, at the option of the Holder (by written notice to the Borrower by the first day of the month following the month in which it has accrued), shall be added to the principal amount of this Note, in which event interest shall accrue thereon in accordance with the terms of this Note and such additional principal amount shall be convertible into Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Note. The Borrower agrees that the right to convert is a valuable right to the Holder. The damages resulting from a failure, attempt to frustrate, interference with such conversion right are difficult if not impossible to qualify. Accordingly, the parties acknowledge that the liquidated damages provision contained in this Section 5(c)(v) are justified.\n\n5  \n---  \n  \n(d) _Concerning the Shares_. The shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note may not be sold or transferred unless: (i) such shares are sold pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Act or (ii) the Borrower or its transfer agent shall have been furnished with an opinion of counsel (which opinion shall be in form, substance and scope customary for opinions of counsel in comparable transactions) to the effect that the shares to be sold or transferred may be sold or transferred pursuant to an exemption from such registration (such as Rule 144 or a successor rule) (“**Rule 144** ”); or (iii) such shares are transferred to an “affiliate” (as defined in Rule 144) of the Borrower who agrees to sell or otherwise transfer the shares only in accordance with this Section 5(d) and who is an “accredited investor” as that term is defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D.\n\nAny restrictive legend on certificates representing shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note shall be removed and the Borrower shall issue to the Holder a new certificate therefore free of any transfer legend if the Borrower or its transfer agent shall have received an opinion of counsel from Holder’s counsel, in form, substance and scope customary for opinions of counsel in comparable transactions, to the effect that (i) a public sale or transfer of such Common Stock may be made without registration under the Act, which opinion shall be accepted by the Company so that the sale or transfer is effected; or (ii) in the case of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note, such security is registered for sale by the Holder under an effective registration statement filed under the Act; or otherwise may be sold pursuant to an exemption from registration.\n\n(e) _Effect of Certain Events_.\n\n(i) __Effect of Merger, Consolidation, Etc__. At the option of the Holder, the sale, conveyance or disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Borrower, the effectuation by the Borrower of a transaction or series of related transactions in which more than 50% of the voting power of the Borrower is disposed of, or the consolidation, merger or other business combination of the Borrower with or into any other Person (as defined below) or Persons when the Borrower is not the survivor shall be deemed to be an Event of Default (as defined in Section 6) pursuant to which the Borrower shall be required to pay to the Holder upon the consummation of and as a condition to such transaction an amount equal to the Default Amount (as defined in Section 6). “**Person** ” shall mean any individual, corporation, limited liability company, partnership, association, trust or other entity or organization.\n\n6  \n---  \n  \n(ii) __Adjustment Due to Merger, Consolidation, Etc__. If, at any time when this Note is issued and outstanding and prior to conversion of all of the Note, there shall be any merger, consolidation, exchange of shares, recapitalization, reorganization, or other similar event, as a result of which shares of Common Stock of the Borrower shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of another class or classes of stock or securities of the Borrower or another entity, or in case of any sale or conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of the Borrower other than in connection with a plan of complete liquidation of the Borrower, then the Holder of this Note shall thereafter have the right to receive upon conversion of this Note, upon the basis and upon the terms and conditions specified herein and in lieu of the shares of Common Stock immediately theretofore issuable upon conversion, such stock, securities or assets which the Holder would have been entitled to receive in such transaction had this Note been converted in full immediately prior to such transaction (without regard to any limitations on conversion set forth herein), and in any such case appropriate provisions shall be made with respect to the rights and interests of the Holder of this Note to the end that the provisions hereof (including, without limitation, provisions for adjustment of the Conversion Price and of the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Note) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as may be practicable in relation to any securities or assets thereafter deliverable upon the conversion hereof. The Borrower shall not affect any transaction described in this Section 5(e)(ii) unless (a) it first gives, to the extent practicable, ten (10) days prior written notice (but in any event at least five (5) days prior written notice) of the record date of the special meeting of stockholders to approve, or if there is no such record date, the consummation of, such merger, consolidation, exchange of shares, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar event or sale of assets (during which time the Holder shall be entitled to convert this Note) and (b) the resulting successor or acquiring entity (if not the Borrower) assumes by written instrument the obligations of this Note. The above provisions shall similarly apply to successive consolidations, mergers, sales, transfers or share exchanges.\n\n(iii) __Adjustment Due to Distribution__.

If it shall be found that any interest or other amount deemed interest due hereunder violates the applicable law governing usury, the applicable provision shall automatically be revised to equal the maximum rate of interest or other amount deemed interest permitted under applicable law. The Borrower covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not seek to claim or take advantage of any law that would prohibit or forgive the Borrower from paying all or a portion of the principal or interest on this Note.\n\n9  \n---  \n  \n**IN WITNESS WHEREOF** , the Borrower has caused this Note to be signed in its name effective as of this 11th day of November, 2024.\n\n**AMERICAN REBEL HOLDINGS, INC.**  \n---  \nBy: | /s/ Charles A.

(NASDAQ: AREB) (“American Rebel” or the “Company”), creator of American Rebel Light Beer ( _americanrebelbeer.com_ ), and a designer, manufacturer, and marketer of branded safes, personal security and self-defense products and apparel, is proud to announce the debut of its American Rebel Light Lager at The Local Nashville ( _localnash.com_ ) and The Local Hendersonville.\n\n“I couldn’t think of a better time than Veterans Day to bring in the truly patriotic beer that American Rebel is **,”** said Geoff Reid, owner of The Local. “It embodies everything I believe in as an American and as a business owner – the perfect match.”\n\n“I’m really excited to have American Rebel Light available at The Local,” said Andy Ross, CEO of American Rebel Holdings. “The Local is a strong supporter of original live music and is a great venue for songwriters, artist showcases, good food and now American Rebel Light! Geoff saw a need for an accessible live music room and he built it much like we saw a need for a patriotic American beer and we created it.”\n\nAs a songwriter himself, Geoff Reid has first-hand experience playing local shows around Nashville. After performing at a popular Nashville singer-songwriter venue with a limited amount of tickets to share with his friends and family, Geoff realized Nashville needed a performance space where up-and-coming as well as the top hit songwriters could not only play and audition their new original songs for top country music artists, but also hang out with friends and family in more of a relaxed atmosphere. In 2017, driven by his passion for music and love of community, Geoff opened the doors of The Local Nashville for performers and their supporters who craved a true “local” experience.\n\nAmerican Rebel Beer’s Tennessee distributor, _Best Brands, Inc_ ., arranged for American Rebel Light to be featured at The Local Nashville and The Local Hendersonville. “Great bars, live music, great people and a great community,” said Andy Ross. “A perfect home for America’s Patriotic, God-Fearing, Constitution-Loving, National Anthem-Singing, Stand Your Ground Beer.”\n\nThe Local Nashville is located at 110 28 th Avenue North near Centennial Park and Vanderbilt University just off West End Avenue in Nashville. The Local Hendersonville is located at 300 Indian Lake Blvd, Building B100, in The Street of Indian Lake development in Hendersonville, TN, just north of Nashville.\n\nAmerican Rebel Light Beer is produced in partnership with AlcSource, the largest integrated provider of beverage development, sourcing, and production solutions in the U.S. American Rebel Light Beer is a Premium Domestic Light Lager.\n\nFor an updated list of locations featuring American Rebel Light, visit americanrebelbeer.com.\n\n1  \n---  \n  \n**About American Rebel Holdings, Inc.**\n\nAmerican Rebel Holdings, Inc.
