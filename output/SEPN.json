Leading our pipeline is SEP-786, which we believe could transform hypoparathyroidism treatment by providing full-day calcium control with a convenient, disease-modifying oral therapy. With a talented team, a pioneering platform, a robust pipeline, and a strong balance sheet, we believe we are well positioned to deliver multiple novel GPCR medicines with the potential to meaningfully improve patients’ lives.”\n\nSepterna’s proprietary [Native Complex Platform™](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Cn98ICPjE13S71RMIuq9LWdR1g_KC1sHDtByUnbrqy_tr_ylEJfWCydhRWSJB7z1g1QWEBYuVtx5gS1g6no-B-jBmk4H78QyRtX6pfJ23ii82OgfxtGwbFpQwA6427aJ) is uniquely designed to enable targeting of GPCRs with a wide spectrum of pharmacologies to affect GPCR signaling in different ways to achieve desired therapeutic effects. Using this platform, Septerna aims to discover and develop a portfolio of oral small molecule GPCR-targeted medicines with novel mechanisms to treat diseases across multiple therapeutic areas.\n\n**Portfolio Overview**\n\n**SEP-786** **PTH1R Agonist Advancing in Phase 1 Clinical Trial:**\n\n  * SEP-786 is an oral small molecule Parathyroid Hormone 1 Receptor (PTH1R) agonist in development for the treatment of hypoparathyroidism. In preclinical studies, SEP-786 has been observed to be generally well-tolerated and has demonstrated potent and selective activation of PTH1R in cell-based models, and in a preclinical animal model of hypoparathyroidism, SEP-786 controlled serum calcium levels within the normal range over a 28-day dosing period. \n  * In September 2024, [Septerna initiated a Phase 1](https://ir.septerna.com/news-releases/news-release-details/septerna-announces-initiation-phase-1-clinical-trial-sep-786) randomized, placebo-controlled, single-ascending dose (SAD) and multiple-ascending dose (MAD) trial to assess preliminary safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of SEP-786 in up to 180 healthy adult participants. Data from both the SAD and MAD portions of the trial are expected in mid-2025.\n\n\n\n**SEP-631 MRGPRX2 Negative Allosteric Modulator (NAM) in IND-Enabling Studies:**\n\n  * SEP-631 is a selective oral small molecule Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor X2 (MRGPRX2) NAM in development for the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), an inflammatory skin disease. In preclinical studies, SEP-631 demonstrated potent and long-lasting inhibition of MRGPRX2, which is a highly and uniquely expressed receptor on mast cells and, when activated, is believed to be a key driver of CSU.\n  * SEP-631 is currently being evaluated in Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling studies in anticipation of submitting for regulatory clearance to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial. Due to MRGPRX2’s expression on mast cells, SEP-631 has the potential to treat other mast cell-driven diseases beyond CSU, including allergic asthma, atopic dermatitis, and prurigo nodularis.\n\n\n\n**TSHR NAM Program for Endocrine Disorders:**\n\n  * Septerna is advancing an oral small molecule thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) NAM program designed to be a disease-modifying treatment for Graves’ disease and thyroid eye disease (TED). In a novel mouse model of Graves’ disease, the TSHR NAMs have demonstrated the ability to reverse hyperthyroidism and proptosis (eye bulging effect from TED), and in cell-based assays using primary human cells, these TSHR NAMs inhibited several Graves’ disease patient TSHR autoantibodies. \n  * Septerna is progressing several TSHR NAM lead compounds towards selection of a development candidate for future IND-enabling studies.\n\n\n\n**Incretin Receptor (GLP-1R, GIPR, GCGR) Program for Metabolic Diseases:**\n\n  * Septerna is advancing a next-generation incretin receptor program aimed at discovering and developing oral small molecules as selective single- or multi-acting GLP-1, GIP, or glucagon receptor agonists for the treatment of metabolic diseases, including obesity and type 2 diabetes. Preclinical data from incretin agonist compounds with distinct single- or multi-acting profiles have demonstrated differential potency and selectivity in activating GIPR, GLP-1R, and GCGR-induced intracellular signaling. In addition, the company’s mono-GIPR agonists have shown favorable PK properties and the ability to control glucose and induce weight loss in various mouse models.\n  * Septerna is progressing several incretin receptor agonist lead compounds towards selection of one or more development candidates for future IND-enabling studies.\n\n\n\n**Business Highlights**\n\n  * In October 2024, Septerna [completed its upsized initial public offering (IPO)](https://ir.septerna.com/news-releases/news-release-details/septerna-announces-closing-3312-million-upsized-initial-public), in which it raised net proceeds of approximately $302.6 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses.\n  * In September 2024, Jae Kim, M.D., was appointed as chief medical officer [to lead an expanded team](https://ir.septerna.com/news-releases/news-release-details/septerna-marks-transition-clinical-stage-company-appointments) with the company’s transition to a clinical-stage organization.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * **Cash Position:** Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaled $137.5 million as of September 30, 2024. Together with net proceeds from the company’s IPO, Septerna expects its current cash position to support its planned operations into the second half of 2027.\n  * **R &D Expenses: **Research and development (R&D) expenses were $17.8 million for the third quarter of 2024.\n  * **G &A Expenses: **General and administrative (G&A) expenses were $4.9 million for the third quarter of 2024.\n  * **Net Loss:** Net loss totaled $20.5 million for the third quarter of 2024.\n\n\n\n**About Septerna** Septerna, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company pioneering a new era of GPCR oral small molecule drug discovery powered by its proprietary Native Complex Platform™. Its industrial-scale platform aims to unlock the full potential of GPCR therapies and has led to the discovery and development of its deep pipeline of product candidates focused initially on treating patients in three therapeutic areas: endocrinology, immunology and inflammation, and metabolic diseases.
