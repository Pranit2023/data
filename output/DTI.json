Reports 2024 Third Quarter Results\n\nNovember 13, 2024\n\n[PDF Version](/static-files/41f804cb-9e22-4a4c-8449-2ae5f559bbb4 \"DTI 3Q24 Earnings Release vFINAL1 11-13-24.pdf\") 365 KB\n\nHOUSTON, Nov. 13, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Drilling Tools International Corp., (NASDAQ: DTI) (\"DTI\" or the \"Company\"), a global oilfield services company that designs, engineers, manufactures and provides a differentiated, rental-focused offering of tools for use in onshore and offshore horizontal and directional drilling operations, as well as other cutting-edge solutions across the well life cycle, today reported its 2024 third quarter results.\n\nDTI generated total consolidated revenue of $40.1 million in the third quarter of 2024. Third quarter Tool Rental revenue was approximately $28.1 million and Product Sales revenue totaled $12.0 million. Total Operating Expenses were $35.8 million and Income from Operations was $4.3 million. Net Income and Adjusted Net Income(1) for the third quarter were $867,000 and $4.6 million, respectively. Diluted EPS and Adjusted Diluted EPS(1) for the third quarter were $0.03 and $0.14 per share, respectively. Third quarter Adjusted EBITDA(1) was $11.1 million and Adjusted Free Cash Flow(1)(2) was $7.8 million. As of September 30, 2024, DTI had approximately $12 million of cash and cash equivalents, and net debt of $32.1 million. \n\nWayne Prejean, Chief Executive Officer of DTI, stated, \"We are very pleased with the execution of our acquisition growth strategy, especially in light of the headwinds our industry has experienced. We believe acquiring high quality companies at attractive multiples positions DTI to successfully participate in the expected industry growth cycle over the next three to five years. This elevated demand should further strengthen the need for our innovative products, technological solutions and superior services globally.\"\n\nPrejean added, \"Our third quarter results improved sequentially but were less than expected due to the continuation of softer market conditions. DTI remains a market leader with a strong platform enabling future growth. We continue to enhance our cost management program to align with market conditions. Accordingly, we have revised our 2024 outlook based on our current visibility, which also includes the sequential slowdown due to anticipated holiday breaks, budget exhaustion and capital discipline being employed by our customers in the fourth quarter. We remain confident that DTI is well positioned to grow and gain share as the market recovers.\"\n\n** _Updated 2024 Full Year Outlook_**\n\n**Revenue**| **$145 million **| **-**| **$155 million**  \n---|---|---|---  \n**Adjusted Net Income(1)**| **$7.7 million **| **-**| **$9.8 million**  \n**Adjusted EBITDA(1)**| **$38 million **| **-**| **$43 million**  \n**Adjusted EBITDA Margin(1)**| **26 %**| **-**| **28 %**  \n**Adjusted Free Cash Flow(1)(2) **| **$18 million**| **-**| **$21 million**  \n  \n(1)| Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, and Adjusted Free Cash Flow are non-GAAP financial measures.

Net Debt and Adjusted Net Income measures. Each of the metrics are \"non-GAAP financial measures\" as defined in Regulation G of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that is used by management and external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of net earnings or cash flows as determined by GAAP. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net earnings (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, further adjusted for (i) goodwill and/or long-lived asset impairment charges, (ii) stock-based compensation expense, (iii) restructuring charges, (iv) transaction and integration costs related to acquisitions and (v) other expenses or charges to exclude certain items that we believe are not reflective of ongoing performance of our business.\n\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful because it allows us to supplement the GAAP measures in order to more effectively evaluate our operating performance and compare the results of our operations from period to period without regard to our financing methods or capital structure. We exclude the items listed above in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP, or as an indicator of our operating performance or liquidity. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company's financial performance, such as a company's cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are components of Adjusted EBITDA. Our computations of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\n\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure, and we define Adjusted Free Cash Flow as Adjusted EBITDA less Gross Capital Expenditures. We use Adjusted Free Cash Flow as a financial performance measure used for planning, forecasting, and evaluating our performance. We believe that Adjusted Free Cash Flow is useful to enable investors and others to perform comparisons of current and historical performance of the Company. As a performance measure, rather than a liquidity measure, the most closely comparable GAAP measure is net income (loss).\n\nNet Debt is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure, and we define Net Debt as total debt less cash and cash equivalents. We use Net Debt to determine our outstanding debt obligations that would not be readily satisfied by our cash and cash equivalents on hand. We believe this metric is useful to analysts and investors in determining our leverage position since we have the ability to, and may decide to, use a portion of our cash and cash equivalents to reduce debt.\n\nWe define Adjusted Net Income (Loss) as consolidated net income (loss) adjusted for (i) goodwill and/or long-lived asset impairment charges, (ii) restructuring charges, (iii) transaction and integration costs related to acquisitions, (iv) income taxes expense which is calculated by applying our effective tax rate on unadjusted net income to adjusted pre-tax income, and (v) other expenses or charges to exclude certain items that we believe are not reflective of the ongoing performance of our business. We believe Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is useful because it allows us to exclude non-recurring items in evaluating our operating performance.\n\nWe define Adjusted Diluted Earnings (Loss) per share as the quotient of adjusted net income (loss) and diluted weighted average common shares. We believe that Adjusted Diluted Earnings (Loss) per share provides useful information to investors because it allows us to exclude non-recurring items in evaluating our operating performance on a diluted per share basis.\n\nThe following tables present a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Net Income to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for the periods indicated:\n\n**Drilling Tools International Corp.**  \n---  \n**Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures (Unaudited)**  \n_**(In thousands of

Third quarter Tool Rental revenue was approximately $28.1 million and Product Sales revenue totaled $12.0 million. Total Operating Expenses were $35.8 million and Income from Operations was $4.3 million. Net Income and Adjusted Net Income(1) for the third quarter were $867,000 and $4.6 million, respectively.

This elevated demand should further strengthen the need for our innovative products, technological solutions and superior services globally.\"\n\nPrejean added, \"Our third quarter results improved sequentially but were less than expected due to the continuation of softer market conditions. DTI remains a market leader with a strong platform enabling future growth. We continue to enhance our cost management program to align with market conditions. Accordingly, we have revised our 2024 outlook based on our current visibility, which also includes the sequential slowdown due to anticipated holiday breaks, budget exhaustion and capital discipline being employed by our customers in the fourth quarter.

Net Debt and Adjusted Net Income measures. Each of the metrics are \"non-GAAP financial measures\" as defined in Regulation G of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that is used by management and external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of net earnings or cash flows as determined by GAAP. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net earnings (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, further adjusted for (i) goodwill and/or long-lived asset impairment charges, (ii) stock-based compensation expense, (iii) restructuring charges, (iv) transaction and integration costs related to acquisitions and (v) other expenses or charges to exclude certain items that we believe are not reflective of ongoing performance of our business.\n\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful because it allows us to supplement the GAAP measures in order to more effectively evaluate our operating performance and compare the results of our operations from period to period without regard to our financing methods or capital structure. We exclude the items listed above in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP, or as an indicator of our operating performance or liquidity. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company's financial performance, such as a company's cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are components of Adjusted EBITDA. Our computations of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\n\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure, and we define Adjusted Free Cash Flow as Adjusted EBITDA less Gross Capital Expenditures. We use Adjusted Free Cash Flow as a financial performance measure used for planning, forecasting, and evaluating our performance. We believe that Adjusted Free Cash Flow is useful to enable investors and others to perform comparisons of current and historical performance of the Company. As a performance measure, rather than a liquidity measure, the most closely comparable GAAP measure is net income (loss).\n\nNet Debt is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure, and we define Net Debt as total debt less cash and cash equivalents. We use Net Debt to determine our outstanding debt obligations that would not be readily satisfied by our cash and cash equivalents on hand. We believe this metric is useful to analysts and investors in determining our leverage position since we have the ability to, and may decide to, use a portion of our cash and cash equivalents to reduce debt.\n\nWe define Adjusted Net Income (Loss) as consolidated net income (loss) adjusted for (i) goodwill and/or long-lived asset impairment charges, (ii) restructuring charges, (iii) transaction and integration costs related to acquisitions, (iv) income taxes expense which is calculated by applying our effective tax rate on unadjusted net income to adjusted pre-tax income, and (v) other expenses or charges to exclude certain items that we believe are not reflective of the ongoing performance of our business. We believe Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is useful because it allows us to exclude non-recurring items in evaluating our operating performance.\n\nWe define Adjusted Diluted Earnings (Loss) per share as the quotient of adjusted net income (loss) and diluted weighted average common shares. We believe that Adjusted Diluted Earnings (Loss) per share provides useful information to investors because it allows us to exclude non-recurring items in evaluating our operating performance on a diluted per share basis.\n\nThe following tables present a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Net Income to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for the periods indicated:\n\n**Drilling Tools International Corp.**  \n---  \n**Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures (Unaudited)**  \n_**(In thousands of
