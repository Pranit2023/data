(“ **Payoneer** ” or the “ **Company** ”) (Nasdaq: PAYO) today announced the expiration of its offer to purchase (the “ **Offer** ”) all of its outstanding Warrants (as defined below) at a purchase price of $0.78 per Warrant in cash, without interest. Completion of the Offer, when combined with the contemplated redemption of untendered Warrants (as described below), will lead to a simplified capital structure. \n\nPayoneer’s offer to purchase 25,158,086 publicly traded warrants which were publicly issued and sold as part of the units in the initial public offering of FTAC Olympus Acquisition Corp. (“ **FTOC** ”) on August 25, 2020 (the “ **FTOC IPO** ”), and assumed by the Company on June 25, 2021, and which entitle such warrant holders to purchase one share of Payoneer’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share, at an exercise price of $11.50, subject to certain adjustments (the “ **Warrants** ”), expired at 12:00 midnight, Eastern Time, at the end of the day on September 9, 2024 (the “ **Expiration Date** ”). \n\nPayoneer has been advised that, as of the Expiration Date, 24,030,937 Warrants (including 7,267 Warrants tendered pursuant to the notice of guaranteed delivery procedures of the Offer) had been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn, representing approximately 95.5% of the outstanding Warrants. The Company expects to accept all validly tendered Warrants for purchase and expects to settle such purchase promptly. Pursuant to the terms of the Offer, holders of Warrants that were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date will receive $0.78 per share for each Warrant tendered. The Company expects to pay an aggregate of approximately $18.7 million in cash in exchange for all validly tendered Warrants. \n\nPayoneer also solicited consents (the “ **Consent Solicitation** ”) to amend the Warrant Agreement, dated August 25, 2020, by and between FTOC and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company (“ **Continental** ”), as amended by the Assignment, Assumption and Amendment Agreement, dated June 25, 2021, by and between the Company, FTOC and Continental (as amended, the “ **Warrant Agreement** ”), which governs all of the Warrants, to permit Payoneer to redeem each outstanding Warrant not tendered in the Offer for $0.70 in cash, without interest, which is approximately 10% less than the price applicable to the Offer (such amendment, the “ **Warrant Amendment** ”). Pursuant to the terms of the Warrant Agreement, the adoption of the Warrant Amendment required the consent of holders of at least 65% of the then outstanding Warrants. \n\nAs of the Expiration Date, parties representing holders of approximately 95.5% of the outstanding Warrants consented to the Warrant Amendment in the Consent Solicitation. Accordingly, because holders of more than 65% of the outstanding Warrants have agreed to consent to the Warrant Amendment in the Consent Solicitation, the Warrant Amendment was adopted. The Warrant Amendment was executed and the Company will exercise its right, in accordance with the terms of the Warrant Amendment, to redeem all remaining Warrants not tendered in the Offer in exchange for $0.70 per Warrant, without interest (unless exercised prior to the redemption date), and has fixed September 25, 2024 as the redemption date, following which no Warrants will remain outstanding. \n\nThe Offer and Consent Solicitation were made pursuant to an Offer to Purchase, initially dated August 12, 2024, and joint Schedule TO/Schedule 13e-3 (the “ **Schedule TO** ”), initially dated August 12, 2024, each as amended and supplemented from time to time, and each of which have been filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“ **SEC** ”) and more fully set forth in the terms and conditions of the Offer and Consent Solicitation. Payoneer will file a final amendment to its Schedule TO to disclose the final results of the Offer. \n\nThe Company’s common stock and Warrants are listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC under the symbols “PAYO” and “PAYOW,” respectively. \n\nCitigroup Global Markets Inc. was the Dealer Manager for the Offer and Consent Solicitation. Sodali & Co. (“Sodali”) was the Information Agent for the Offer and Consent Solicitation, and Continental was the Warrant Agent for the Offer and Consent Solicitation. All questions concerning tender procedures and requests for additional copies of the offer materials, including the letter of transmittal and consent, should be directed to Sodali at (800) 662-5200 (toll free). \n\n**Disclaimer**\n\nThis announcement is for informational purposes only and shall not constitute an offer to purchase or a solicitation of an offer to sell the Warrants. The Offer and Consent Solicitation were made only through the Schedule TO and Offer to Purchase, and the complete terms and conditions of the Offer and Consent Solicitation are set forth in the Schedule TO and Offer to Purchase. This announcement does not constitute a notice of redemption with respect to the Warrants that remain outstanding after the settlement. \n\n**About Payoneer:**\n\nPayoneer is the financial technology company empowering the world’s small and medium-sized businesses to transact, do business, and grow globally.

Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or Payoneer’s future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may,” “should,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “will,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “predict,” “potential” or “continue,” or the negatives of these terms or variations of them or similar terminology. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based upon estimates and assumptions that, while considered reasonable by Payoneer and its management, as the case may be, are inherently uncertain. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, but are not limited to: (1) changes in applicable laws or regulations; (2) the possibility that Payoneer may be adversely affected by geopolitical events and conflicts, such as the current conflict between Israel and Hamas, and other economic, business and/or competitive factors; (3) changes in the assumptions underlying our financial estimates; (4) the outcome of any known and/or unknown legal or regulatory proceedings; and (5) other risks and uncertainties set forth in Payoneer’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2023 and future reports that Payoneer may file with the SEC from time to time. Nothing in this press release should be regarded as a representation by any person that the forward-looking statements set forth herein will be achieved or that any of the contemplated results of such forward-looking statements will be achieved. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. Payoneer does not undertake any duty to update these forward-looking statements. \n\n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20240910237111r1&sid=q4-prod&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\n**Investor Contact:** Michelle Wang investor@payoneer.com  **Media Contact:** Alison Dahlman PR@payoneer.com\n\nSource: Payoneer\n\n[View All News](https://investor.payoneer.com/news-events/news/default.aspx)\n\n[![Payoneer Logo](//s28.q4cdn.com/543571417/files/design/Payoneer_Master_Logo_OnDark_RGB.png)](https://www.payoneer.com/)\n\n## Quick Links\n\n  * [SEC Filings](https://investor.payoneer.com/financials/sec-filings/default.aspx)\n  * [Investor FAQs](https://investor.payoneer.com/resources/investor-faqs/default.aspx)\n\n\n\n### Contact Us\n\ninvestor@payoneer.com\n\n### Investor Email Alerts\n\nTo opt-in for investor email alerts, please enter your email address in the field below and select at least one alert option.

We have increased our growth rate for ICPs for four consecutive quarters to 11% year-over-year, and for ARPU excluding interest income for five consecutive quarters to 20%. We are at the beginning of our growth trajectory and are focused on consistent execution to capture the opportunity ahead of us.”  _John Caplan, Chief Executive Officer_  \n---  \n  \n** Third Quarter 2024 Business Highlights **\n\n  * 25% volume growth year-over-year reflects: \n    * B2B volume of $2.8 billion increased 57% year-over-year, driven by continued strong customer acquisition and increased average transaction sizes \n    * SMBs that sell on marketplaces volume of $12 billion increased 17% year-over-year led by strong performance with large ecommerce sellers \n    * Merchant Services (Checkout) volume of $153 million increased 142% year-over-year \n    * Enterprise payouts volume of $5.5 billion increased 29% year-over-year \n  * 11% active ICP growth year-over-year, including 2% growth in larger ICPs who have on average over $10,000 per month in volume. Both volume and revenue growth from $10K+ ICPs are accelerating and increased more than 25% year-over-year as we acquire and grow volumes from larger customers \n  * $1.4 billion of spend on Payoneer cards, up 41% year-over-year, as customers increasingly use our card product for their global accounts payable needs and as we continue to drive adoption across all regions \n  * $6.1 billion of customer funds (including both short-term and long-term funds) as of September 30, 2024, up 13% year-over-year \n  * $21 million of share repurchases at a weighted average price of $5.67 \n  * Completed repurchase and redemption of all 25 million outstanding public warrants for $21 million \n\n\n\n** 2024 Guidance **\n\n“Payoneer is building on the significant momentum across our business with another record quarter of financial results. We have delivered seven consecutive quarters of accelerating volume growth and in the third quarter accelerated revenue growth excluding interest income to 24%. We are increasing our 2024 guidance to reflect our strong third quarter performance as well as higher expectations for both growth and profitability for the final quarter of the year. We are executing on our strategic priorities. Our repurchase of the 25 million outstanding public warrants, which had a strike price of $11.50, underscores our conviction in our ability to create long term value for shareholders.”  _Bea Ordonez, Chief Financial Officer_  \n---  \n  \n2024 guidance is as follows: \n\nRevenue  |  $950 million - $960 million   \n---|---  \nTransaction costs  |  ~16.0% of revenue   \nAdjusted EBITDA (1) |  $255 million to $265 million   \n(1) Guidance for fiscal year, where adjusted, is provided on a non-GAAP basis, which Payoneer will continue to identify as it reports its future financial results. The Company cannot reconcile its expected adjusted EBITDA to expected net income under “2024 Guidance” without unreasonable effort because certain items that impact net income and other reconciling metrics are out of the Company's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted at this time, which unavailable information could have a significant impact on the Company’s GAAP financial results. Please refer to “Financial Information; Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for a description of the calculation of adjusted EBITDA.   \n  \n** Webcast **\n\nPayoneer will host a live webcast of its earnings on a conference call with the investment community beginning at 8:30 a.m. ET today, November 5, 2024. To access the webcast, go to the investor relations section of the Company’s website at [https://investor.payoneer.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.payoneer.com&esheet=54146974&newsitemid=20241105351426&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.payoneer.com&index=1&md5=3697b32d1c6bf2a9d599b44ed9d48f02).

Payoneer was founded in 2005 with the belief that talent is equally distributed, but opportunity is not. It is our mission to enable any entrepreneur and business anywhere to participate and succeed in an increasingly digital global economy. Since our founding, we have built a global financial stack that removes barriers and simplifies cross-border commerce. We make it easier for millions of SMBs, particularly in emerging markets, to connect to the global economy, pay and get paid, manage their funds across multiple currencies, and grow their businesses. \n\n** Forward-Looking Statements **\n\nThis press release includes, and oral statements made from time to time by representatives of Payoneer, may be considered “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or Payoneer’s future financial or operating performance. For example, projections of future revenue, transaction cost and adjusted EBITDA are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may,” “should,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “will,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “predict,” “potential” or “continue,” or the negatives of these terms or variations of them or similar terminology. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based upon estimates and assumptions that, while considered reasonable by Payoneer and its management, as the case may be, are inherently uncertain. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, but are not limited to: (1) changes in applicable laws or regulations; (2) the possibility that Payoneer may be adversely affected by geopolitical events and conflicts, such as Israel’s ongoing conflicts in the region, and other economic, business and/or competitive factors; (3) changes in the assumptions underlying our financial estimates; (4) the outcome of any known and/or unknown legal or regulatory proceedings; and (5) other risks and uncertainties set forth in Payoneer’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2023 and future reports that Payoneer may file with the SEC from time to time. Nothing in this press release should be regarded as a representation by any person that the forward-looking statements set forth herein will be achieved or that any of the contemplated results of such forward-looking statements will be achieved. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. Payoneer does not undertake any duty to update these forward-looking statements. \n\n** Financial Information; Non-GAAP Financial Measures **\n\nSome of the financial information and data contained in this press release, such as adjusted EBITDA, have not been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Payoneer uses these non-GAAP measures to compare Payoneer’s performance to that of prior periods for budgeting and planning purposes. Payoneer believes these non-GAAP measures of financial results provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to Payoneer’s results of operations. Payoneer's method of determining these non-GAAP measures may be different from other companies' methods and, therefore, may not be comparable to those used by other companies and Payoneer does not recommend the sole use of these non-GAAP measures to assess its financial performance. Payoneer management does not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in Payoneer’s financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which expense and income are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. In order to compensate for these limitations, management presents non-GAAP financial measures in connection with GAAP results. You should review Payoneer’s financial statements, which are included in Payoneer’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and its subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate Payoneer’s business. \n\nNon-GAAP measures include the following item: \n\nAdjusted EBITDA : We provide adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure that represents our net income (loss) adjusted to exclude, as applicable: M&A related expense (income), stock-based compensation expenses, restructuring charges, share in losses (gain) of associated company, loss (gain) from change in fair value of warrants and warrant repurchase/redemption, other financial expense (income), net, taxes on income, and depreciation and amortization. \n\nOther companies may calculate the above measure differently, and therefore Payoneer’s measures may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. \n\nIn addition, in this earnings release, we reference volume, which is an operational metric. Volume refers to the total dollar value of transactions successfully completed or enabled by our platform, not including orchestration transactions. For a customer that both receives and later sends payments, we count the volume only once.

Our repurchase of the 25 million outstanding public warrants, which had a\nstrike price of $11.50, underscores our conviction in our ability to create long term value for\nshareholders.”\nBea Ordonez, Chief Financial Officer\n2024 guidance is as follows:\nRevenue $950 million - $960 million\nTransaction costs ~16.0% of revenue\nAdjusted EBITDA (1) $255 million to $265 million\n(1) Guidance for fiscal year, where adjusted, is provided on a non-GAAP basis, which Payoneer will continue to identify as it\nreports its future financial results. The Company cannot reconcile its expected adjusted EBITDA to expected net income\nunder “2024 Guidance” without unreasonable effort because certain items that impact net income and other reconciling\nmetrics are out of the Company's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted at this time, which unavailable\ninformation could have a significant impact on the Company’s GAAP financial results. Please refer to “Financial Information;\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures” below for a description of the calculation of adjusted EBITDA.\nWebcast\nPayoneer will host a live webcast of its earnings on a conference call with the investment community\nbeginning at 8:30 a.m. ET today, November 5, 2024. To access the webcast, go to the investor\nrelations section of the Company’s website at https://investor.payoneer.com.

Payoneer was founded in 2005 with the belief\nthat talent is equally distributed, but opportunity is not. It is our mission to enable any entrepreneur\nand business anywhere to participate and succeed in an increasingly digital global economy. Since\nour founding, we have built a global financial stack that removes barriers and simplifies cross-border\ncommerce. We make it easier for millions of SMBs, particularly in emerging markets, to connect to the\nglobal economy, pay and get paid, manage their funds across multiple currencies, and grow their\nbusinesses.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release includes, and oral statements made from time to time by representatives of\nPayoneer, may be considered “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor”\nprovisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking\nstatements generally relate to future events or Payoneer’s future financial or operating performance.\nFor example, projections of future revenue, transaction cost and adjusted EBITDA are forward-looking\nstatements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may,”\n“should,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “will,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “predict,” “potential” or\n“continue,” or the negatives of these terms or variations of them or similar terminology. Such forward-\nlooking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors which could cause actual\nresults to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These\nforward-looking statements are based upon estimates and assumptions that, while considered\nreasonable by Payoneer and its management, as the case may be, are inherently uncertain. Factors\nthat may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, but are not limited\nto: (1) changes in applicable laws or regulations; (2) the possibility that Payoneer may be adversely\naffected by geopolitical events and conflicts, such as Israel’s ongoing conflicts in the region, and other\neconomic, business and/or competitive factors; (3) changes in the assumptions underlying our\nfinancial estimates; (4) the outcome of any known and/or unknown legal or regulatory proceedings;\nand (5) other risks and uncertainties set forth in Payoneer’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period\nended December 31, 2023 and future reports that Payoneer may file with the SEC from time to time.\nNothing in this press release should be regarded as a representation by any person that the forward-\nlooking statements set forth herein will be achieved or that any of the contemplated results of such\nforward-looking statements will be achieved. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking\nstatements, which speak only as of the date they are made. Payoneer does not undertake any duty to\nupdate these forward-looking statements.\nFinancial Information; Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nSome of the financial information and data contained in this press release, such as adjusted EBITDA,\nhave not been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles\n(“GAAP”). Payoneer uses these non-GAAP measures to compare Payoneer’s performance to that of\nprior periods for budgeting and planning purposes. Payoneer believes these non-GAAP measures of\nfinancial results provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial\nand business trends relating to Payoneer’s results of operations. Payoneer's method of determining\nthese non-GAAP measures may be different from other companies' methods and, therefore, may not\nbe comparable to those used by other companies and Payoneer does not recommend the sole use\nof these non-GAAP measures to assess its financial performance. Payoneer management does not\nconsider these non-GAAP measures in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined\nin accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they\n3Q 2024 Earnings Press Release | 3\nexclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in Payoneer’s\nfinancial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of\njudgments by management about which expense and income are excluded or included in\ndetermining these non-GAAP financial measures. In order to compensate for these limitations,\nmanagement presents non-GAAP financial measures in connection with GAAP results. You should\nreview Payoneer’s financial statements, which are included in Payoneer’s Annual Report on Form 10-\nK for the year ended December 31, 2023 and its subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and\nnot rely on any single financial measure to evaluate Payoneer’s business.\nNon-GAAP measures include the following item:\nAdjusted EBITDA: We provide adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure that represents our\nnet income (loss) adjusted to exclude, as applicable: M&A related expense (income), stock-based\ncompensation expenses, restructuring charges, share in losses (gain) of associated company, loss\n(gain) from change in fair value of warrants and warrant repurchase/redemption, other financial\nexpense (income), net, taxes on income, and depreciation and amortization.\nOther companies may calculate the above measure differently, and therefore Payoneer’s measures\nmay not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nIn addition, in this earnings release, we reference volume, which is an operational metric. Volume\nrefers to the total dollar value of transactions successfully completed or enabled by our platform, not\nincluding orchestration transactions. For a customer that both receives and later sends payments, we\ncount the volume only once. We also reference ARPU (Average Revenue Per User), which is defined\nas the Revenue from Active Customers divided by the number of Active Customers over the period in\nwhich the Revenue was earned. Active Customers for these purposes are defined as Payoneer\naccountholders with at least 1 financial transaction over the period. Revenue from Active Customers\nrepresents revenue attributed to Active Customers based on their use of the Payoneer platform,\nincluding interest income earned from their balances, and excluding revenues unrelated to their\nactivities.\nInvestor Contact:\nMichelle Wang\ninvestor@payoneer.com\nMedia Contact:\nAlison Dahlman\nPR@payoneer.com\n3Q 2024 Earnings Press Release | 4\nTABLE - 1\nPAYONEER GLOBAL INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (UNAUDITED)\n(U.S. dollars in thousands, except share and per share data)\n(Unaudited)\nThree months ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nRevenues $ 2 48,274 $ 2 08,035\nTransaction costs (Exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below and\ninclusive of $401 and $437 in interest expense and fees associated with related party\ntransactions during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively) 3 8,058 30,393\nOther operating expenses 44,892 40,301\nResearch and development expenses 3 4,616 26,950\nSales and marketing expenses 5 2,311 48,664\nGeneral and administrative expenses 29,725 25,112\nDepreciation and amortization 1 3,510 7 ,116\nTotal operating expenses 2 13,112 1 78,536\nOperating income 3 5,162 2 9,499\nFinancial income (expense):\nLoss from change in fair value of Warrants — (7,799)\nLoss on Warrants repurchase/redemption (14,746) —\nOther financial income, net 1 ,674 1 ,137\nFinancial expense, net ( 13,072) ( 6,662)\nIncome before taxes on income 2 2,090 2 2,837\nTax benefit (expense) on income 1 9,484 ( 10,012)\nNet income $ 4 1,574 $ 1 2,825\nOther comprehensive income\nUnrealized gain on available-for-sale debt securities, net 12,256 -\nTax expense on unrealized gains on available-for-sale debt securities, net (2,816) -\nUnrealized gain on cash flow hedges, net 1,168 -\nTax expense on unrealized gains on cash flow hedges, net (211) -\nOther comprehensive income, net of tax 10,397 -\nComprehensive income $ 5 1,971 $ 1 2,825\nPer Share Data\nNet income per share attributable to common stockholders — Basic earnings per share $ 0 .12 $ 0 .04\n— Diluted earnings per share $ 0.11 $ 0.03\nWeighted average common shares outstanding — Basic 3 57,297,824 3 57,429,113\nWeighted average common shares outstanding — Diluted 3 74,303,470 381,845,099\n3Q 2024 Earnings Press Release | 5\nDisaggregation of revenue\nThe following table presents revenue recognized from contracts with customers as well as revenue\nfrom other sources:\nThree months ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nRevenue recognized at a point in time $ 1 79,641 $ 144,665\nRevenue recognized over time 719 537\nRevenue from contracts with customers $ 1 80,360 $ 145,202\nInterest income on customer balances $ 6 5,162 $ 6 0,416\nCapital advance income 2 ,752 2 ,417\nRevenue from other sources $ 6 7,914 $ 6 2,833\nTotal revenues $ 2 48,274 $ 208,035\nThe following table presents the Company’s revenue disaggregated by primary regional market,\nwith revenues being attributed to the country (in the region) in which the billing address of the\ntransacting customer is located, with the exception of global bank transfer revenues, where revenues\nare disaggregated based on the billing address of the transaction funds source.\nThree months ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nPrimary regional markets\nGreater China(1) $ 8 5,111 $ 7 2,513\nEurope(2) 4 8,666 4 2,378\nAsia-Pacific(2) 3 7,770 2 9,145\nNorth America(3) 2 5,162 2 2,358\nSouth Asia, Middle East and North Africa(2) 2 6,809 2 2,181\nLatin America(2) 2 4,756 1 9,460\nTotal revenues $ 2 48,274 $ 208,035\n1.

Guidance for fiscal year, where adjusted, is provided on a non-GAAP basis, which Payoneer will continue to identify as it reports its future financial results. The\nCompany cannot reconcile its expected adjusted EBITDA to expected net income under “2024 Guidance” without unreasonable effort because certain items that impact net income and other reconciling metrics are out of the Company's control\nand/or cannot be reasonably predicted at this time, which unavailable information could have a significant impact on the Company’s GAAP financial results.\n22\nOur roadmap to profitable growth\n.\nMedium-term Long-term\n(Through 2026) (Beyond 2026)\nMid-teens 20%+\nRevenue growth Revenue growth\n25% 25%\nAdjusted EBITDA margin Adjusted EBITDA margin\n23\nAppendix\n24\nVolume and revenue trends\nVolume ($M) 3Q23 4Q23 1Q24 2Q24 3Q24 YoY QoQ\nSMBs that sell on marketplaces $10,261 $11,777 $11,002 $11,403 $11,983 17% 5%\nB2B SMBs 1,781 2,156 2,232 2,467 2,802 57% 14%\nFurther acceleration in B2B volume growth\nMerchant services 63 102 92 119 153 142% 28%\nSMB customer volume $12,106 $14,035 $13,327 $13,989 $14,938 23% 7%\nEnterprise payouts 4,229 5,010 5,129 4,724 5,467 29% 16%\nTotal volume $16,335 $19,045 $18,455 $18,713 $20,404 25% 9%\nRevenue as a % of volume (\"Take Rate\") 3Q23 4Q23 1Q24 2Q24 3Q24 YoY QoQ\nSMBs that sell on marketplaces 0.94% 0.87% 0.97% 0.98% 0.94% 0 bps -4 bps\nB2B SMBs 1.67% 1.59% 1.55% 1.54% 1.58% -9 bps 4 bps\nMerchant services 3.84% 3.88% 3.95% 3.90% 3.85% 1 bps -5 bps\nSMB customer take rate 1.07% 1.00% 1.08% 1.11% 1.09% 2 bps -2 bps\nContinued take rate expansion with SMB customers\nEnterprise payouts 0.37% 0.31% 0.30% 0.34% 0.30% -7 bps -4 bps\nTotal take rate 1.27% 1.18% 1.24% 1.28% 1.22% -5 bps -6 bps\nRevenue ($M) 3Q23 4Q23 1Q24 2Q24 3Q24 YoY QoQ\nBy source:\nSMBs that sell on marketplaces $97 $103 $106 $112 $113 17% 1%\nB2B SMBs 30 34 35 38 44 49% 17%\nMerchant services 2 4 4 5 6 143% 27%\nSMB customer revenue $129 $141 $144 $155 $163 27% 5%\n>25% revenue growth with SMB customers\nEnterprise payouts 16 15 15 16 16 4% 3%\nRevenue recognized at a point in time $145 $156 $160 $171 $180 24% 5%\nRevenue recognized over time 1 1 1 0 1 34% 46%\nRevenue from contracts with customers $145 $157 $160 $171 $180 24% 5%\nInterest income on customer balances $60 $65 $65 $66 $65 8% -1%\nCapital advance income 2 3 2 2 3 14% 12%\nRevenue from other sources $63 $68 $68 $68 $68 8% -1%\nTotal revenue $208 $224 $228 $240 $248 19% 4%\nMemo:\nRevenue ex. interest income and onboarding fees from an enterprise client $148 $159 $163 $174 $183 24% 5%\n% YoY growth 8% 14% 21% 21% 24% Underlying business continues to accelerate\nNote: Revenue by source represents revenue recognized from contracts with customers as well as revenue from other sources.\n25\nICP and revenue by region trends\nActive ICPs ('000s) 3Q23 4Q23 1Q24 2Q24 3Q24 YoY QoQ\nBy size:\n$500-$10K/month 449 461 473 492 503 12% 2%\n$10K+/month 53 55 57 55 54 2% -1%\nTotal 502 516 530 547 557 11% 2%\nYear-over-year volume growth by customer size:\n$500-$10K/month 2% 5% 8% 10% 11% 900 bps 100 bps\n$10K+/month 10% 15% 18% 21% 26% 1,600 bps 500 bps Accelerating volume growth\nwith $10K+ ICPs\nBy primary regional market:\nAPAC 114 121 127 130 133 17% 2%\nEurope 102 100 102 101 101 -1% 0%\nSAMEA 98 101 104 105 105 7% 0%\nChina 97 98 98 107 110 14% 3%\nLATAM 63 67 69 72 75 19% 4%\nN.
