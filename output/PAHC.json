They were invited to spend three days to discuss and debate **hydrogen** topics from a variety of perspectives, including the challenges involved in **scaling up hydrogen production and use, discovering new ways hydrogen could serve as a clean energy carrier, and explore policies that could help build a sustainable hydrogen energy economy.**\n\nThe Symposium’s 3-day format permitted ample discussion time where all participants engaged discussing many technical issues or expressing different points of view.\n\nThe Erice venue, along with the Symposium’s lunches and dinners, provided an opportunity for participants to discuss issues more informally and get to know each other. \n\nOverall, the collective experience led to an insightful discussion of **hydrogen** policy and energy security. \n\n### **Session: Producing Hydrogen**\n\nPresentation of: [**Simon Greenshields**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simon-greenshields/), Chairman [**Wabash Valley Resources**](https://www.wvresc.com) and CEO [**Phibro**](https://www.phibro.com)\n\n## [**_Carbon-free hydrogen from hydrocarbons and biomass_**](Carbon-free hydrogen from hydrocarbons and biomass)\n\n[ ![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/55e64431e4b0cbb3aed909a7/96cae67f-2a5d-43e4-8152-5676ee27b959/Clean+Hydrogen+Production) ](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1liyZNv-TXx2TC2rWpfbwNmOk6U5W0XuM/edit#slide=id.p1)\n\n[ Learn more ](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1liyZNv-TXx2TC2rWpfbwNmOk6U5W0XuM/edit#slide=id.p1)\n\n#  [How to produce Hydrogen Gas via gasifier](/news/2022/7/8/gasificationprocess)\n\n[June 8, 2022](/news/2022/7/8/gasificationprocess) [simon greenshields](/news?author=55e843e1e4b014628051c6ec)\n\nThis video, made by Logan Greenshields, explains the gasification process through different animations.\n\nThe purpose of the video is to understand why we should increase the percentage of biomass in order to get a Carbon negative Hydrogen energy. \n\n#  [Phibro Group Acquires Coal Gasification Plant to Repurpose it for Fertilizer Production](/news/coal-gasification-plant)\n\n[June 1, 2016](/news/coal-gasification-plant) [simon greenshields](/news?author=55e843e1e4b014628051c6ec)\n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/55e64431e4b0cbb3aed909a7/1656087949163-CXX09YAMKLY5YBTJJA91/Phibro+Group+Acquires+Coal+Gasification+Plant+to+Repurpose+it+for+Fertilizer+Production.png)\n\n## _Transaction will save and create jobs while providing an affordable, environmentally friendly, secure supply of essential fertilizer to the region._\n\n## _Phibro Group to invest $450 million to innovatively convert the plant to an ammonia fertilizer production facility._\n\nSTAMFORD, Conn., May 17, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Phibro LLC, an independent commodity merchant company, today announced that its affiliate, Philipp Brothers Fertilizer, together with a group of investors (\"The Phibro Group\"), have acquired SG Solutions' Gasification Plant, a clean coal gasification plant located outside of West Terre Haute, Indiana, that until recently produced synthetic gas and steam to fuel the adjacent Wabash River Combined Cycle Plant owned by Wabash Valley Power Association. The Phibro Group will repurpose the plant to produce ammonia fertilizer for use in the region.\n\nFollowing the conversion, the plant will use petroleum coke (\"petcoke\") sourced from Midwest refineries as a feedstock to produce ammonia. **Petcoke** is more economical than the natural gas many other ammonia plants use as a feedstock and will enable the plant to offer local farmers more affordable fertilizer. The gasification plant's clean coal technology, which was first funded by the Department of Energy more than two decades ago, allows for repurposing it into a world-scale ammonia production plant. There are very few plants in the U.S. with similar technology. The acquisition and conversion of the plant, which had been scheduled to be decommissioned, will not only save existing jobs but also create roughly 100 permanent local manufacturing jobs.\n\n**Simon Greenshields** , President and Chief Executive Officer of **Phibro LLC,** commented on the transaction, \"We are thrilled to be able to put this plant's technology, which has outlived its viability in an era of reduced coal-fired power generation, to a more productive economic use, manufacturing much needed ammonia fertilizer for the region. This transaction benefits numerous stakeholder groups as it will create and save manufacturing jobs, provide the most affordable fertilizer for farmers in the area and reduce our nation's reliance on imported ammonia fertilizer. We would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr. Jay Bartlett, C.E.O. of SG Solutions and Wabash Valley Power Association, and his entire team for their support and assistance throughout this process. We look forward to commencing work on this project with our partner Quasar Energy Partners.\"\n\nThe Phibro Group plans to invest approximately $450 million into the plant to convert it to produce ammonia and is targeting a mid-2018 completion date.\n\nNalin Gupta, the Managing Partner of Quasar Energy Partners LLC, commented, \"We are proud to partner with the State of Indiana and other local constituents to creatively repurpose and expand existing infrastructure.\"\n\nAndrews Kurth LLP and Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP provided the legal advice and services to facilitate the acquisition.\n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/55e64431e4b0cbb3aed909a7/95a4cba5-7bd6-43ab-bb4c-9dd2c499336f/17.png)\n\n[ ](https://www.linkedin.com/company/phibro-llc/mycompany/)\n\n­\n\n­\n"
