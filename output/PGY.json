(NASDAQ: PGY) (“Pagaya”, the “Company” or “we”), a global technology company delivering artificial intelligence infrastructure for the financial ecosystem, today announced financial results for the third quarter and nine months ended 2024.\n\nFor additional information, view Pagaya's third quarter 2024 letter to shareholders [here](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.pagaya.com%2Fstatic-files%2Fada8ce4b-83f8-4535-911d-bf9d74b724d7&esheet=54151034&newsitemid=20241111271660&lan=en-US&anchor=here&index=1&md5=119c5c97c0cf427f7075368ffd88875c).\n\n\"We delivered another set of strong results, with a laser-focus on profitable, sustainable growth,” said Gal Krubiner, co-founder and CEO of Pagaya Technologies. “With successful execution of our 2024 strategy, we are well on the way to reaching GAAP profitability and cash flow generation during 2025. We have built a franchise that we believe can deliver long-term value for our shareholders, lending and funding partners, and U.S. consumers.\"\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Highlights**\n\n _All comparisons are made versus the same period in 2023 and on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise stated._\n\n  * **Network volume of $2.4 billion (in line with outlook of $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion)** grew by 11% year-over-year.\n  * **Continued to grow volumes with existing partners and advance our sales pipeline.** Growth of existing partners led topersonal loan network volume growth of 15% and point-of-sale (“POS”) network volume growth of 67% year-over-year. The onboarding of a top 5 bank by total assets in our POS vertical continues to progress. Elavon, U.S. Bank’s POS business, is now live on the Pagaya network.\n  * **Record total revenue and other income of $257 million (in line with outlook of $250 million to $260 million)** increased by 21% year-over-year, driven by a 24% increase in revenue from fees.\n  * **GAAP operating income of $22 million** grew by $22 million year-over-year.\n  * **Record fee generation and operating leverage as we drive profitable growth.** FRLPC as a % of network volume reached a record 4.3%, reflecting the growing value we are delivering for our lending partners. Ongoing operating leverage is enhancing flow-through of fees to our bottom-line, with core operating expenses as a % of FRLPC reaching its lowest level since the Company went public, at 52%.\n  * **Net loss attributable to Pagaya shareholders of $67 million **was impacted by non-cash items such as fair value adjustments and share-based compensation expense.\n  * **Record adjusted EBITDA of $56 million** **(in line with outlook of $50 million to $60 million)** grew $28 million year-over-year, with Adjusted EBITDA margin up 846 basis points to 21.8%.\n  * **Adjusted net income of $33 million**, which excludes the impact of non-cash items such as share-based compensation expense and fair value adjustments, grew by $19 million year-over-year.\n  * **Reached our lowest risk retention level in 2 years,** at 2-3% of network volume by the end of the third quarter, as the result of structural improvements in our ABS program and broadening our funding sources to capital-efficient channels such as forward flow, pass-through certificate programs, and managed funds.\n  * **Announced transactions to de-risk the balance sheet and reduce interest expense,** byrefinancing high-cost borrowings and unlocking additional balance sheet liquidity of up to $100 million in the form of excess cash and the release of high-quality collateral.\n  * **Cash flow from operating activities of($2) million** was impacted by one-time items.\n\n\n\n**Full Year 2024 Outlook**\n\n**FY24**  \n---  \nNetwork Volume| Expected to be between $9.5 billion and $9.7 billion  \nTotal Revenue and Other Income| Expected to be between $1,010 million and $1,025 million  \nAdjusted EBITDA| Expected to be between $195 million and $205 million  \n  \n**Webcast**\n\nThe Company will hold a webcast and conference call today, November 12, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.

These forward-looking statements reflect the Company's views with respect to future events as of the date hereof and are based on assumptions and subject to risks and uncertainties. Given these uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements are made as of the date hereof, reflect the Company’s current beliefs and are based on information currently available as of the date they are made, and the Company assumes no obligation and does not intend to update these forward-looking statements.\n\n**Financial Information; Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nSome of the unaudited financial information and data contained in this press release and Form 8-K, such as Fee Revenue Less Production Costs (“FRLPC”), FRLPC as a percentage of network volume (or FRLPC %), Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (Loss), have not been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). To supplement the unaudited consolidated financial statements prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management uses the non-GAAP financial measures FRLPC, FRLPC as a percentage of network volume (or FRLPC %), Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA to provide investors with additional information about our financial performance and to enhance the overall understanding of the results of operations by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of our business. Management believes these non-GAAP measures provide an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our core financial performance over multiple periods. However, non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in their usefulness to investors because they have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplementing, and not as an alternative or substitute for, our unaudited consolidated financial statements prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. To address these limitations, management provides a reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) attributable to Pagaya’s shareholders and a calculation of FRLPC and FRLPC as a percentage of network volume (or FRLPC %). Management encourages investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure and to view Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with its respective related GAAP financial measures.\n\nNon-GAAP financial measures include the following items:\n\nFee Revenue Less Production Costs (“FRLPC”) is defined as revenue from fees less production costs. FRLPC as a percentage of network volume (or FRLPC %) is defined as FRLPC divided by Network Volume.\n\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) is defined as net income (loss) attributable to Pagaya Technologies Ltd.’s shareholders excluding share-based compensation expense, change in fair value of warrant liability, impairment, including credit-related charges, restructuring expenses, transaction-related expenses, and non-recurring expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) attributable to Pagaya Technologies Ltd.’s shareholders excluding share-based compensation expense, change in fair value of warrant liability, impairment, including credit-related charges, restructuring expenses, transaction-related expenses, non-recurring expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions, interest expense, depreciation expense, and income tax expense (benefit).\n\nThese items are excluded from our Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA measures because they are noncash in nature, or because the amount and timing of these items is unpredictable, is not driven by core results of operations and renders comparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful.\n\nWe believe FRLPC, FRLPC as a percentage of network volume (or FRLPC %), Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations, as well as providing a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business performance. Moreover, we have included FRLPC, FRLPC as a percentage of network volume (or FRLPC %), Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA because these are key measurements used by our management internally to make operating decisions, including those related to operating expenses, evaluate performance, and perform strategic planning and annual budgeting. However, this non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The tables below provide reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Loss Attributable to Pagaya Technologies Ltd., its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP amount.\n\nIn addition, Pagaya provides outlook for the fourth quarter of 2024 and the fiscal year 2024 on a non-GAAP basis. The Company cannot reconcile its expected Adjusted EBITDA to expected Net Loss Attributable to Pagaya under “Full-Year 2024 Financial Outlook” without unreasonable effort because certain items that impact net income (loss) and other reconciling items are out of the Company's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted at this time, which unavailable information could have a significant impact on the Company’s U.S. GAAP financial results.\n\n**PAGAYA TECHNOLOGIES LTD.**  \n---  \n**CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS (UNAUDITED)**  \n**(In thousands, except share and per share
