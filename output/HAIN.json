A beneficial shareholder is a shareholder who enjoys the benefits of ownership even though the title is kept in the name of a brokerage house or mutual fund. When shares are kept in this manner, the term is often referred to as keeping the shares in \"street name”.\n\nWhat are Direct Registration Shares or \"book-entry\" shares, also known as DRS?\n\nIn the Direct Registration System, physical stock certificates are not issued to shareholders. Instead, shareholders receive a statement detailing the number of shares they own. These shares are held electronically by the transfer agent. This system prevents the loss of certificates. At any time, a shareholder can request a physical stock certificate to be issued at no charge.\n\nRequest Email Alerts\n\n[Back to Top](#)\n"
