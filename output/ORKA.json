(“Oruka”) (Nasdaq: ORKA), a biotechnology company developing novel biologics designed to set a new standard for the treatment of chronic skin diseases including plaque psoriasis, today reported third quarter 2024 financial results and provided a corporate update.\n\n“We had a highly eventful third quarter which included going public, closing on over $475 million in proceeds across two transactions and continuing to progress our very promising co-lead programs,” said Lawrence Klein, PhD, Chief Executive Officer of Oruka. “We are excited to soon transition to a clinical stage company and show the potential of our programs to raise the bar on what is possible in psoriatic disease.”\n\n**Third Quarter Business and Pipeline Updates**\n\n**_Corporate_**\n\n  * Oruka consummated its go-public transaction and began trading on the Nasdaq under the ticker ORKA.\n  * The Company raised over $475 million, including a $275 million private placement previously announced in April that closed concurrently with the merger and an additional $200 million private placement shortly thereafter from a group of new and existing investors.\n\n\n\n**_ORKA-001: a novel half-life extended IL-23p19 monoclonal antibody_**\n\n  * Oruka plans to initiate a Phase 1 trial of ORKA-001 in the first quarter of 2025, which was accelerated from the first half of 2025. The Company expects to share interim data from the first-in-human trial in healthy volunteers, including initial pharmacokinetic data, in the second half of 2025 and initial efficacy data in psoriasis patients in the second half of 2026.\n  * Data presented at the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) Congress showed that ORKA-001 has a half-life in NHP of more than 30 days, over three times longer than risankizumab and one of the longest NHP half-lives observed for an extended half-life antibody. In addition, the data showed that ORKA-001 binds to a similar epitope as risankizumab and displays similar binding affinity and potency across a variety of _in vitro_ assays.\n  * These findings support the potential for ORKA-001 to achieve extended dosing intervals of once every six months or even once a year while maintaining high antibody exposures and further derisk its development path.\n\n\n\n**_ORKA-002: a novel half-life extended IL-17A/F monoclonal antibody_**\n\n  * Oruka plans to initiate a Phase 1 trial of ORKA-002 in the third quarter of 2025, which was accelerated from the second half of 2025. The Company expects to share interim data from the first-in-human trial in healthy volunteers, including initial pharmacokinetic data, in the first half of 2026.\n  * A precursor antibody to ORKA-002 showed a half-life in NHP of approximately 20 days, double that seen with bimekizumab, supporting the potential to achieve significantly longer dosing intervals than currently marketed agents targeting IL-17. This extended half-life could enable a dosing interval of once every four to six months for ORKA-002.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n**Cash Position:** As of September 30, 2024, Oruka had available cash and cash equivalents of $410.9 million. Net cash used in operating activities was $27.8 million for the third quarter of 2024. The Company expects this cash to provide runway through 2027.\n\n**Research and Development (R &D) expenses:** R&D expenses totaled $25.7 million for the third quarter of 2024. This expense includes $7.8 million of non-cash stock-based compensation. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company incurred $11.8 million and $4.1 million on the development of ORKA-001 and ORKA-002, respectively.\n\n**General and Administrative (G &A) expenses:** G&A expenses totaled $3.8 million for the third quarter of 2024. This expense includes $2.4 million of personnel-related costs, including $1.2 million of non-cash stock-based compensation related to equity awards to employees and service providers, and $1.3 million for professional, consulting, and other costs to operate a public company and support R&D activities.\n\n**Other income (expense):** Other income, net for the third quarter of 2024 was $0.8 million. Interest earned on the Company’s investment in money market funds was $1.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, partly offset by interest expense of $0.5 million on convertible notes before their conversion to common stock.\n\n**Net loss:** Net loss totaled $28.6 million for the third quarter of 2024, which includes non-cash stock-based compensation of $9.0 million.\n\n**Shares Outstanding:** Oruka has approximately 55.1 million shares of the Company’s Common Stock and Common Stock equivalents issued and outstanding, including shares of Common Stock underlying pre-funded warrants and Series A and Series B non-voting convertible preferred stock.\n\n**About Oruka Therapeutics**\n\nOruka Therapeutics is developing novel biologics designed to set a new standard for the treatment of chronic skin diseases.
