(NASDAQ: FLGT) (“Fulgent,” or the “Company”), a technology-based company with a well-established laboratory services business and a therapeutic development business, today announced financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Results:**\n\n  * Total Revenue of $71.7 million\n  * Core Revenue1 grew 9% year-over-year to $71.7 million\n  * GAAP loss of $14.6 million, or ($0.48) per share \n  * Non-GAAP income of $9.4 million, or $0.31 per share \n  * Adjusted EBITDA income of $0.4 million\n  * Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and investments in marketable securities of $815.4 million as of September 30, 2024\n\nNote:  \n---  \n1) Core Revenue is revenue calculated in accordance with GAAP minus revenue from COVID-19 testing products and services including COVID-19 NGS testing revenue, each as calculated in accordance with GAAP.   \n  \nNon-GAAP income (loss), non-GAAP income (loss) per share, adjusted EBITDA income (loss), non-GAAP gross profit and margin, and non-GAAP operating income (loss) and margin, are described below under “Note Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, GAAP income (loss), GAAP gross profit and margin, and GAAP operating income (loss) and margin, in the accompanying tables. \n\nMing Hsieh, Chairperson of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, said, “We continue to see good momentum in our business, with Laboratory Services fueling our initiatives and exhibiting sequential growth in all three areas of our Laboratory Services business for the quarter. In Therapeutics Development, we are encouraged by the preliminary results we are seeing from initial patients being treated in our Phase 2 clinical trial of FID-007 in Head and Neck Cancer, and we continue to move our next candidate, FID-022, through preclinical studies toward an Investigational New Drug (IND) application.” \n\nPaul Kim, Chief Financial Officer, said, “We are pleased with our financial performance in the third quarter and our trajectory for the remainder of 2024, as we continue to grow core revenue and improve operations.” \n\n**Outlook** : \n\nFor the full year 2024, Fulgent expects: \n\n  * Core Revenue of approximately $280 million\n  * GAAP loss improvement from approximately ($1.95) per share to approximately ($1.70) per share \n  * Non-GAAP loss improvement from approximately ($0.30) loss per share to approximately $0.33 income per share \n  * Cash, cash equivalents, and investments in marketable securities of approximately $800 million as of December 31, 2024* \n\n\n\n*Cash expenditures may be higher or lower than currently estimated due to a variety of factors and circumstances, including as a result of the Company’s ongoing stock repurchase program or other expenditures outside the ordinary course of business. \n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nFulgent will host a conference call for the investment community today at 8:30 AM ET (5:30 AM PT) to discuss its third quarter 2024 results. The call may be accessed through a live audio webcast in the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website, [http://ir.fulgentgenetics.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fir.fulgentgenetics.com&esheet=54149483&newsitemid=20241107037183&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Fir.fulgentgenetics.com&index=1&md5=ce9137bb18855f8826958c7e115c6446). An audio replay will be available at the same location. \n\n**Note Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nCertain information set forth in this press release and/or to be discussed on the Company’s earnings call, including non-GAAP income (loss), non-GAAP income (loss) per share, adjusted EBITDA income (loss), non-GAAP gross profit and margin, and non-GAAP operating income (loss) and margin are non-GAAP financial measures. Fulgent believes this information is useful to investors because it provides a basis for measuring the performance of the Company’s business, excluding certain income or expense items that management believes are not directly attributable to the Company’s operating results. Fulgent defines non-GAAP income (loss) as net income (loss) calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, plus amortization of intangible assets, plus equity-based compensation expenses, plus impairment of available-for-sale debt securities, plus or minus the non-GAAP tax effect, and plus or minus other charges or gains, as identified, that management believes are not representative of the Company’s operations. The non-GAAP tax effect was calculated by excluding from the GAAP provision the impact of the amortization of intangible assets, equity-based compensation expenses, and impairment of available-for-sale debt securities. Fulgent defines adjusted EBITDA income (loss) as GAAP income (loss) plus or minus interest (expense) income, plus or minus provisions (benefits) for income taxes, plus equity-based compensation expenses, plus depreciation and amortization, plus impairment of available-for-sale debt securities, and plus or minus other charges or gains, as identified, that management believes are not representative of the Company’s operations. Fulgent defines non-GAAP gross profit as gross profit calculated in accordance with GAAP plus equity-based compensation included in cost of revenue as shown in the table below. Fulgent defines non-GAAP gross margin by taking non-GAAP gross profit and dividing it by GAAP revenue. Fulgent defines non-GAAP operating profit (loss) by taking GAAP operating profit (loss) and adding equity-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. Non-GAAP operating margin is calculated by taking non-GAAP operating profit (loss) and dividing by GAAP revenue. Fulgent may continue to incur expenses similar to the items added to or subtracted from GAAP income (loss) to calculate non-GAAP income (loss) and adjusted EBITDA income (loss); accordingly, the exclusion of these items in the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an implication that these items are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures along with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure of net income (loss), gross profit and margin, and operating income (loss) and margin, in evaluating the Company’s operating performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in conformity with GAAP, and non-GAAP financial measures as reported by Fulgent may not be comparable to similarly titled metrics reported by other companies. \n\n**About Fulgent**\n\nFulgent is a technology-based company with a well-established laboratory services business and a therapeutic development business. Fulgent’s laboratory services business, which was formerly referred to as the clinical diagnostic business, includes technical laboratory services and professional interpretation of laboratory results by licensed physicians.

(NASDAQ: FLGT) (“Fulgent,” or the “Company”), a technology-based company with a well-established laboratory services business and a therapeutic development business, today announced it has been awarded a five-year contract by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to provide hereditary cancer, pharmacogenetic and other genetic testing to Veterans. \n\nA leader in clinical molecular diagnostic testing, Fulgent has been periodically providing genetic testing services to the members of the VA since 2017. These have included both clinical and research-based services. This new award enables Fulgent to provide hereditary cancer tests to individuals with cancer or a family history of certain cancers, enhancing the services available to the VA community. In addition, the contract includes pharmacogenetic testing. Pharmacogenetics uses genomic information to determine how patients will respond to certain medications--an important component of delivering personalized medicine. \n\n“We are honored to receive this award to provide high-quality testing to those who have served our country and to their family members,” said Brandon Perthuis, Fulgent’s Chief Commercial Officer. “Understanding the germline drivers is an important part of treating cancer, as it provides valuable information to patients, family members, and physicians. Our business development team has a long history of working with the VA and has proven to be successful in representing our strengths in bioinformatics, quality, and turnaround time to position Fulgent as a strong partner.” \n\n“We are excited to leverage our flexible testing options to serve the VA community and provide VA physicians the tools to practice genomic medicine,” said Dr. Harry Gao, Fulgent’s Chief Scientific Officer. “Our comprehensive suite of germline tests enables us to build custom solutions tailored to the VA’s needs. PGx testing, in particular, has become increasingly important for patient care. Our PGx test utilizes next-generation sequencing, offering higher resolution and greater coverage to ensure the delivery of accurate and actionable data.” \n\nThe award is for up to $99M over five years, including both hereditary cancer testing and pharmacogenetic testing. \n\n1 The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) does not approve or endorse any statements, claims, or language included in this press release.
