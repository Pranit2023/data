          "content": "[Galapagos](https://www.glpg.com/)\n\n05 November 2024\n\n# Galapagos to Present Results of Pioneering Innovation in Cancer Cell Therapy at ASH 2024\n\n  * **New Phase 1/2 data support the potential of our CAR T-cell therapy candidates, GLPG5101 and GLPG5201, in addressing unmet needs for patients with poor prognoses.**\n  * **Our innovative decentralized cell therapy manufacturing platform delivers fresh, fit cells within a median vein-to-vein time of seven days, with potentially encouraging patient outcomes.**\n  * **Three abstracts, including one oral presentation for GLPG5101 in relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and a company showcase, will spotlight our cutting-edge cell therapy innovations in blood cancers and solid tumors.**\n\n\n\n**Mechelen, Belgium; November 5, 2024, 22:01 CET; Galapagos NV (Euronext & NASDAQ: GLPG) today announced that it will present new data from its CAR T- and TCR T-cell therapy pipeline at the 66****th****American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition in San Diego, CA, 7-10 December 2024.**\n\nThree abstracts, including one oral presentation, will feature new data from our proprietary cell therapy programs in relapsed/refractory (R/R) non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and R/R chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and Richter transformation (RT), in addition to preclinical data in head & neck (H&N) cancer, developed in partnership with Adaptimmune. Galapagos will also host a company showcase, titled _: Fresh, Fit, and Fast: Pioneering the Future of Cell Therapy through Decentralized Manufacturing_. \n\n“We are committed to advancing breakthrough innovations to expand the reach of cell therapies for patients with rapidly progressing cancers,” said Jeevan Shetty, MD, Head of Clinical Development Oncology at Galapagos. “We are excited to present promising new clinical data for our CD19 CAR T-cell therapy candidates, which continue to support the hypothesis that delivering fresh, fit cells quickly could improve outcomes for patients. Additionally, the preclinical proof-of-concept data we will present with our partner Adaptimmune highlight the potential of our innovative approach in treating solid tumors, expanding our reach to critically-ill patients beyond hematological cancers.”\n\n**The data to be presented are summarized below:**\n\n  * The oral presentation for GLPG5101, our CD19 CAR-T candidate in relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma, including R/R large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), will feature new safety, efficacy, and longer follow-up data for 45 patients in the ongoing Phase 1/2 ATALANTA-1 study (data cut-off: April 25, 2024). The presentation will also demonstrate the feasibility of our decentralized manufacturing platform, delivering a fresh, stem-like early memory cell therapy with a median vein-to-vein time of seven days, robust _in vivo_ expansion, and durable persistence.\n  * The poster presentation for GLPG5201, our CD19 CAR-T candidate in relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (R/R CLL) and Richter transformation (RT), will include additional safety, efficacy, and translational data from 15 patients (cut-off date: February 21, 2024) in the ongoing Phase 1/2 EUPLAGIA-1 study, consistent with previously disclosed findings. The presentation will also highlight that decentralized manufacturing of GLPG5201, delivered as fresh cells in a median vein-to-vein time of seven days, results in an increase in stem-like early memory phenotypes versus starting material, robust _in vivo_ expansion, and durable persistence. \n  * The poster presentation for uza-cel, a MAGE-A4 directed TCR T-cell therapy candidate in head & neck (H&N) cancer, in partnership with Adaptimmune, will highlight preclinical proof-of-concept data demonstrating that Galapagos’ innovative decentralized cell therapy manufacturing platform can produce uza-cel with features that may result in improved efficacy and durability of response in the clinic compared with the existing manufacturing procedure.\n\n\n\n**The dates and times for accepted abstracts, presentations and our company showcase are as follows:**\n\n**Abstract title** |  **Authors (_Presenter_)** |  **Presentation date/time**  \n---|---|---  \n**Galapagos-driven original abstracts**  \nATALANTA-1: A Phase 1/2 Trial of GLPG5101, a Fresh, Stem-Like, Early Memory CD19 CAR T-Cell Therapy with a 7-Day Vein-to-Vein Time, for the Treatment of Relapsed/Refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma  |  _Marie José Kersten,_ Kirsten Saevels, Evelyne Willems, Marte C.

This is the first-ever FDA clearance for a clinical study in the U.S. with a fresh CAR-T product candidate delivered in a median vein-to-vein time of seven days. We remain focused on advancing our clinical pipeline in 11 indications and our potential best-in-class early-stage programs across multiple modalities and indications.” \n\n“With more than 20 active cell therapy and small molecule programs in oncology and immunology, we are accelerating our internal pipeline while we continue to assess business development opportunities. We reaffirm our 2024 cash burn guidance in the range of €370-410 million,” Thad Huston, Galapagos’ CFO and COO, added.\n\n**Third quarter and recent business highlights and anticipated milestones****Regulatory and pipeline:**\n\n  * The investigational new drug (IND) application for the Phase 1/2 ATALANTA-1 study of our CD19 candidate, GLPG5101, in R/R NHL has been cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and our goal is to activate clinical study sites and start enrolling patients in the U.S. before the end of 2024.\n  * We expect to submit an IND in early 2025 for the Phase 1/2 EUPLAGIA-1 study in relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (R/R CLL) and Richter transformation (RT) of our CD19 CAR-T candidate, GLPG5201.\n  * Following the submission of a Clinical Trial Application (CTA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the Phase 2 dose expansion study of GLPG5201 in R/R CLL and RT, we aim to start enrolling patients in 2025.\n  * We resumed enrolment in the Phase 1/2 PAPILIO-1 study of our BCMA CAR-T candidate, GLPG5301, in R/R MM.\n  * We will present new data from the ATALANTA-1 and EUPLAGIA-1 studies along with pre-clinical data for uza-cel, our TCR-T cell therapy candidate produced on our decentralized manufacturing platform in collaboration with Adaptimmune, at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting in December.\n  * We continued enrolling patients in the ongoing Phase 2 GALARISSO study in dermatomyositis (DM) and the Phase 2 GALACELA study in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with our oral small molecule TYK2 inhibitor, GLPG3667.\n  * We further advanced our early-stage proprietary pipeline and progressed a next-generation armed, bispecific CAR-T candidate in hemato-oncology and a potential best-in-class small molecule candidate in immunology into IND-enabling studies, targeting clinical development in 2025-2026.\n  * We are accelerating our early-stage pipeline of more than 15 programs in oncology and immunology with the objective of launching at least four IND/CTA-enabling studies in 2025 across different modalities and indications. From 2026 onward, our ambition is to fuel the clinical pipeline with at least two new clinical assets annually in various indications and across our cell therapy and small molecule portfolio.\n\n\n\n**Operational:**\n\n  * As part of our collaboration agreement with Blood Centers of America (BCA), we selected Excellos in the San Diego area as the first decentralized manufacturing unit (DMU) within BCA’s nationwide network to manufacture GLPG5101 for the ATALANTA-1 study sites in the region.\n  * We continue to expand our DMU network in Europe and the U.S. to manufacture our cell therapy candidates for clinical development and to support pivotal and commercial readiness.\n\n\n\n**External innovation:**\n\n  * We are exploring strategic partnerships, early-stage research collaborations, licensing, and bolt-on acquisitions in areas of high unmet medical need to accelerate our cell therapy and small molecule pipeline in oncology and immunology.\n\n\n\n**Corporate:**\n\n  * The Board of Directors appointed Mr. Oleg Nodelman as Non-Executive Non-Independent Director by way of co-optation effective October 7, 2024, replacing Dr. Dan Baker who stepped down on October 6, 2024.\n\n\n\n**Financial performance****Key figures for the first nine months of 2024 (consolidated)**_(€ millions, except basic & diluted earnings per share)_\n\n**Nine months ended September 30** |  **% Change**  \n---|---  \n**2024** |  **2023**  \nSupply revenues  |  19.1  |  –   \nCollaboration revenues  |  181.0  |  179.8  |  +1%   \n**Total net revenues** |  **200.1** |  **179.8** |  **+11%**  \nCost of sales  |  (19.1)  |  –   \nR&D expenses  |  (238.2)  |  (167.2)  |  +42%   \nG&Aii and S&Miii expenses  |  (93.2)  |  (87.4)  |  +7%   \nOther operating income  |  24.8  |  32.9  |  -25%   \n**Operating****loss** |  **(125.6)** |  **(41.9)**  \nFair value adjustments and net exchange differences  |  31.8  |  36.3  |  -12%   \nNet other financial result  |  71.7  |  54.0  |  +33%   \nIncome taxes  |  1.7  |  (12.2)   \n**Net profit/loss (-) from continuing operations** |  **(20.4)** |  **36.2**  \nNet profit from discontinued operations, net of tax  |  69.2  |  17.9   \n**Net profit of the period** |  **48.8** |  **54.1**  \nBasic and diluted earnings per share (€)  |  0.7  |  0.8   \n**Current financial investments, cash & cash equivalents** |  **3,338.8** |  **3,811.7**  \n  \n**DETAILS OF THE FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2024** As a consequence of the transfer of our Jyseleca® business to Alfasigma, the revenues and costs related to Jyseleca® for the first nine months of 2024 are presented separately from the results of our continuing operations in the line ‘Net profit from discontinued operations, net of tax’ in our consolidated income statement. The comparative first nine months of 2023 have been restated accordingly for the presentation of the results related to the Jyseleca® business. \n\n**_Results from our continuing operations_****Total operating loss from continuing operations** for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was €125.6 million, compared to an operating loss of €41.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n  * **Total net revenues** for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, amounted to €200.1 million, compared to €179.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The revenue recognition related to the exclusive access rights granted to Gilead for our drug discovery platform amounted to €172.7 million for the first nine months of both 2024 and 2023. Our deferred income balance on September 30, 2024, includes €1.1 billion allocated to our drug discovery platform that is recognized linearly over the remaining period of our 10-year collaboration. \n  * **Cost of sales** for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, amounted to €19.1 million and related to the supply of Jyseleca® to Alfasigma under the transition agreement. The related revenues are reported in total net revenues.\n  * **R &D expenses** in the first nine months of 2024 amounted to €238.2 million, compared to €167.2 million for the first nine months of 2023. This increase was primarily explained by higher costs for cell therapy and small molecule programs in oncology.\n  * **G &A and S&M expenses** amounted to €93.2 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to €87.4 million in the first nine months of 2023. This increase was primarily due to an increase in legal and professional fees, mainly related to business development activities and due to an increase in S&M expenses due to investments in strategic marketing for oncology. Both increases were partly offset by a decrease in G&A personnel expenses, mainly due to a decreased cost for our subscription rights plans.\n  * **Other operating income** amounted to €24.8 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to €32.9 million for the same period last year. This decrease is mainly driven by lower grants and R&D incentives.\n\n\n\n**Net financial income** in the first nine months of 2024 amounted to €103.5 million, compared to net financial income of €90.3 million for the first nine months of 2023. \n\n  * **Fair value adjustments and net currency exchange results** in the first nine months of 2024 amounted to €31.8 million, compared to fair value adjustments and net currency exchange gains of €36.3 million for the first nine months of 2023, and were primarily attributable to €3.1 million of unrealized currency exchange losses on our cash and cash equivalents and current financial investments at amortized cost in U.S. dollars, and to €35.7 million of positive changes in fair value of current financial investments.\n  * **Net other financial income** in the first nine months of 2024 amounted to €71.7 million, compared to net other financial income of €54.0 million for the first nine months of 2023, and was primarily attributable to €70.6 million of interest income, which increased significantly due to the increase in interest rates.\n\n\n\n**Net tax income** in the first nine months of 2024 amounted to €1.7 million, compared to net tax expenses of €12.2 million for the first nine months of 2023. The net tax expenses in 2023 were primarily due to the re-assessment of net deferred tax liabilities and corporate income tax payables as a result of a one-off intercompany transaction. \n\n**Net loss** **from continuing operations** for the first nine months of 2024 was €20.4 million, compared to a net profit from continuing operations of €36.2 million for the first nine months of 2023.\n\n**_Results from discontinued operations_**\n\n_(€ millions)_\n\n**Nine months ended September 30** |  **% Change**  \n---|---  \n**2024** |  **2023**  \nProduct net sales  |  11.4  |  82.1  |  -86%   \nCollaboration revenues  |  26.0  |  187.0  |  -86%   \n**Total net revenues** |  **37.4** |  **269.1** |  **-86%**  \nCost of sales  |  (2.2)  |  (13.5)  |  -84%   \nR&D expenses  |  (13.6)  |  (145.0)  |  -91%   \nG&A and S&M expenses  |  (10.8)  |  (94.7)  |  -89%   \nOther operating income  |  55.2  |  7.1   \n**Operating****profit** |  **66.0** |  **23.0**  \nNet financial result  |  3.3  |  (3.7)   \nIncome taxes  |  (0.1)  |  (1.4)   \n**Net profit from discontinued operations** |  **69.2** |  **17.9**  \n  \n**Total operating profit from discontinued operations** amounted to €66.0 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to an operating profit of €23.0 million in the same period last year.\n\n  * **Product net sales** of Jyseleca® in Europe were €11.4 million for the first nine months of 2024 consisting of sales to customers in January 2024.

As from February 1, 2024, all remaining G&A and S&M expenses relating to Jyseleca® are recharged to Alfasigma.\n  * **Other operating income** for the first nine months of 2024 amounted to €55.2 million (€7.1 million for the same period last year) and comprised €52.3 million related to the gain on the sale of the Jyseleca® business to Alfasigma.

the effect of exchange rate differences on cash and cash equivalents), minus:• the net proceeds, if any, from share capital and share premium increases included in the net cash flows generated from/used in (-) financing activities• the net proceeds or cash used, if any, related to the acquisitions or disposals of businesses; the acquisition of financial assets held at fair value through other comprehensive income; the movement in restricted cash and movement in current financial investments, if any, the cash advances and loans given to third parties, if any, included in the net cash flows generated from/used in (-) investing activities• the cash used for other liabilities related to the acquisition or disposal of businesses, if any, included in the net cash flows generated from/used in (-) operating activities.This alternative liquidity measure is in our view an important metric for a biotech company in the development stage. The operational cash burn for the first nine months of 2024 amounted to €321.3 million and can be reconciled to our cash flow statement by considering the decrease in cash and cash equivalents of €111.8 million, adjusted by (i) the net sale of current financial investments amounting to €260.2 million, (ii) the cash-out related to the sale of subsidiaries of €13.8 million, and (iii) the acquisition of financial assets held at fair value through other comprehensive income of €36.9 million.ii General and administrativeiii Sales and marketing\n\n**Attachment**\n\n  * [Galapagos Reports Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results and Provides Business Update](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=_92bDG3oKHzb-xYJ4JxCfYyYhjdmSr-T1GY2x8QQSxoMoUCPj_eo-YFgT_8ptYjzobsZ07aNUPUSEBLcAuUj5bIM-2qYu5u2H0wLqLQh_p17q_v9f3HMPJjnepbCU6s6OVONL5jRk6Dh8Uh0JAtIkXcFaAu7pUOTh0Xp5Ok6eFDfcMWNLTHpKyEptrQlEs1FV1KyUqWsy_CLo8ijWOEpJYdvvyM4Pq1O_VUcTbTw-d9lyvPKowjvxWWxbX9zvucv \"Galapagos Reports Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results and Provides Business Update\")\n\n\n\n![](https://ml-eu.globenewswire.com/media/Mjk5YTU3ZGQtYWM5NC00YTU0LWJhN2QtZDQ0Y2YzZDliZTBlLTEwMTE4NTc=/tiny/Galapagos-NV.png)\n"
