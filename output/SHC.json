Management will take questions from a live audience during two question-and-answer sessions.\n\n“The management team is looking forward to the Company’s inaugural Investor Day since going public in 2020,” said Michael J. Petras, Jr., Chair and CEO. “During the past four years, we have achieved top- and bottom-line growth with strong margins, generated significant operating cash flow, demonstrated disciplined capital deployment, and maintained durable customer relationships. I’m proud of what we’ve accomplished and look forward to the team sharing more about future growth drivers at today’s investor event.”\n\nDuring today’s presentation, management will:\n\n  * Demonstrate the strength and durability of Sotera Health while fulfilling our mission of Safeguarding Global Health®;\n  * Provide a detailed perspective of the markets served by the Company and growth opportunities, including our serviceable addressable market of $18 billion;\n  * Share customer feedback, which will continue to guide capital investment decisions and the Company’s growth outlook;\n  * Provide a long-term financial outlook that highlights the focus on Free Cash Flow generation and supports a compelling investment thesis; and\n  * Outline our 2025-2027 financial plan to achieve an organic compound annual revenue growth rate of 5% to 7%, expand Adjusted EBITDA margins by at least 50 basis points, drive an organic compound annual Adjusted EBITDA growth rate of 5% to 8%, and generate cumulative Free Cash Flow of more than $500 million.\n\n\n\nThe Company does not provide a reconciliation for non-GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking basis where it is unable to provide a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of reconciling items without unreasonable effort. The Company cannot reconcile its expected Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margins, Adjusted EBITDA growth rate and Free Cash Flow without unreasonable effort because certain items that impact net income, earnings per share and other reconciling metrics are out of the Company’s control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted at this time, including uncertainties caused by changes to the regulatory landscape, restructuring items and certain fair value measurements, all of which are potential adjustments for future earnings.\n\n**Investor Day** A live webcast of the event will be accessible at [_Presentation & Events | Sotera Health_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=G9_H7QFcu4N_PUpG3Drh_ctVSVJ8vqutoddJwwimB3SWvXn4c6hvYSlnGiKK870LJMYXwxrplHYvtsLPB_3nX23vffxRPntqTXNo4mT_3hJcc8W1KdFj-jPLaigD3muZAYjPHmy6bHrQuGlfm7gFN2SdHHoEXHGh1MotPqFNa1W7kMiHINJCpGbShVFw_7RU).

Net revenues increased 8.9% on a constant currency basis. Net income was $17 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $14 million, or $0.05 per diluted share in the third-quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA for the third-quarter 2024 increased 9.0% to $146 million compared to $134 million in the third-quarter 2023. Third-quarter 2024 Adjusted Earnings Per Diluted Share (“Adjusted EPS”) increased by $0.01 to $0.17, compared to $0.16 in the third-quarter of 2023.\n\nFor the first nine months of 2024, net revenues increased 9.6% to $810 million, compared to $739 million for the same period in 2023. Net revenues increased approximately 9.8% on a constant currency basis. Net income was $32 million, or $0.11 per diluted share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with net income of $13 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, for the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA for the first nine months of 2024 increased 9.5% to $396 million, compared to $361 million in the first nine-months of 2023. Adjusted EPS of $0.49 remained flat compared to the first nine months of 2023.\n\n“I am pleased we achieved both top- and bottom-line growth for the third-quarter,” said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Michael B. Petras, Jr. “Our performance was largely in line with expectations, with an additional benefit at Nordion tied to the timing of cobalt-60 shipments. With most of the year behind us, we are reaffirming the 2024 revenue and EBITDA outlook ranges previously provided.”\n\n“We are also excited to host our inaugural investor day on November 20th, which will take place in New York City,” Petras continued. “During the event, the management team will present a business and financial review, including future growth plans, while highlighting how we fulfill our mission of Safeguarding Global Health®.”\n\n_______________(1) This is non-GAAP financial measure used throughout this press release; please refer to the section “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for explanations of our Non-GAAP financial measures and the schedules provided later in this release for reconciliations of reported GAAP to Non-GAAP financial measures. \n\n** _Third-Quarter and Year-to-Date 2024 Highlights by Business Segment_**\n\n**Sterigenics**\n\nFor the third-quarter 2024, Sterigenics net revenues were $176 million, an increase of 4.3% compared to the third quarter a year ago. Third-quarter 2024 segment income was $96 million, an increase of 3.0%. For the first nine months of 2024, Sterigenics net revenues were $518 million, an increase of 4.7% compared to the same period in 2023. Segment income increased 4.2% to $279 million.\n\nNet revenue growth for the third-quarter 2024 was driven by favorable pricing, volume and mix, partially offset by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nThe increase in segment income for the third-quarter 2024 was driven by favorable customer pricing as well as volume and mix. Increases in employee compensation costs negatively impacted segment income and segment income margin.\n\n**Nordion**\n\nFor the third-quarter 2024, Nordion net revenues were $51 million, an increase of 28.0% compared to the third-quarter a year ago. Third-quarter 2024 segment income increased 31.9% to $32 million. For the first nine months of 2024, Nordion net revenues were $117 million, an increase of 44.6% compared to the same period in 2023. Segment income increased 52.1% to $66 million.\n\nThe timing of reactor harvest schedules resulted in favorable changes in volume and mix, which was the primary driver for net revenue, segment income and segment income margin growth for the quarter. Favorable pricing also drove improvement, partially offset by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\n\n**Nelson Labs**\n\nFor the third-quarter 2024, Nelson Labs net revenues were $59 million, an increase of 7.0% compared to the third-quarter a year ago. Third-quarter 2024 segment income increased by 9.0% to $19 million. For the first nine months of 2024, Nelson Labs net revenues were $175 million, an increase of 7.2% compared to the same period in 2023. Segment income increased 1.3% to $51 million.\n\nNet revenue increase for the third-quarter 2024 was driven by favorable changes in volume and mix as well as pricing.\n\nSegment income and segment income margin increases for the third-quarter 2024 were driven by favorable customer pricing, volume and mix, as well as labor productivity improvements, partially offset by increases in employee compensation costs.\n\n**_Balance Sheet and Liquidity_**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, Sotera Health had $2.3 billion of total debt and $307 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, compared to $2.3 billion in total debt and $296 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had no balance outstanding on its revolving credit facility. Sotera Health’s Net Leverage Ratio(2) as of September 30, 2024 was 3.6x.\n\n_______________(2) This is non-GAAP financial measure used throughout this press release; please refer to the section “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for explanations of our Non-GAAP financial measures and the schedules provided later in this release for reconciliations of reported GAAP to Non-GAAP financial measures. \n\n** _2024 Outlook_**\n\nToday, Sotera Health is reaffirming the following 2024 outlook ranges previously provided:\n\n  * Net revenues and Adjusted EBITDA growth in the range of 4.0% to 6.0%,\n  * Interest Expense in the range of $165 million to $175 million,\n  * Tax rate applicable to Adjusted Net Income(3) in the range of 31.5% to 34.5%,\n  * Adjusted EPS in the range of $0.67 to $0.75,\n  * A weighted-average fully diluted share count in the range of 283 million to 285 million shares, and\n\n\n\nThe following range in the 2024 outlook is being updated:\n\n  * Capital expenditures are now expected to be in the range of $175 million to $185 million, from previous guidance of $205 million to $225 million\n\n\n\nThe Company does not provide a reconciliation for non-GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking basis where it is unable to provide a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of reconciling items without unreasonable effort. The Company cannot reconcile its expected Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income Tax Rate, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS without unreasonable effort because certain items that impact net income, earnings per share and other reconciling metrics are out of the Company’s control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted at this time, including uncertainties caused by changes to the regulatory landscape, restructuring items and certain fair value measurements, all of which are potential adjustments for future earnings.\n\nThe outlook provided above contains a number of assumptions, including, among others, the Company’s current expectations regarding supply chain continuity, particularly for the supply of ethylene oxide (“EO”) and Cobalt-60, the impact of inflationary trends including their impact on energy prices and the supply of labor, and the expectation that exchange rates as of September 30, 2024 remain constant for the remainder of 2024.

These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, a disruption in the availability or supply of, or increases in the price of, EO, Cobalt-60 (“Co-60”) or our other direct materials, services and supplies, including as a result of geopolitical instability and/or sanctions against Russia by the United States, Canada, United Kingdom and/or the European Union; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; changes in environmental, health and safety regulations or preferences, and general economic, social and business conditions; health and safety risks associated with the use, storage, transportation and disposal of potentially hazardous materials such as EO and Co-60; the impact and outcome of current and future legal proceedings and liability claims, including litigation related to the use, emissions and releases of EO from our facilities in California, Georgia, Illinois and New Mexico and the possibility that additional claims will be made in the future relating to these or other facilities; allegations of our failure to properly perform services and potential product liability claims, recalls, penalties and reputational harm; compliance with the extensive regulatory requirements to which we are subject, the related costs, and any failures to receive or maintain, or delays in receiving, required clearances or approvals; adverse changes in industry trends; competition we face; market changes, including inflationary trends, that impact our long-term supply contracts with variable price clauses and increase our cost of revenues; business continuity hazards, including supply chain disruptions and other risks associated with our operations; the risks of doing business internationally, including global and regional economic and political instability and compliance with numerous laws and sometimes inconsistent laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions; our ability to increase capacity at existing facilities, build new facilities in a timely and cost-effective manner and renew leases for our leased facilities; our ability to attract and retain qualified employees; severe health events or environmental events; cybersecurity breaches, unauthorized data disclosures, and our dependence on information technology systems; an inability to pursue strategic transactions, find suitable acquisition targets, or integrate strategic acquisitions into our business successfully; our ability to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting; our reliance on intellectual property to maintain our competitive position and the risk of claims from third parties that we have infringed or misappropriated, or are infringing or misappropriating, their intellectual property rights; our ability to comply with rapidly evolving data privacy and security laws and regulations in various jurisdictions and any ineffective compliance efforts with such laws and regulations; our ability to maintain profitability in the future; impairment charges on our goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, as well as other long-lived assets and intangible assets with definite lives; the effects of unionization efforts and labor regulations in countries in which we operate; adverse changes to our tax positions in U.S. or non-U.S. jurisdictions or the interpretation and application of recent U.S. tax legislation or other changes in U.S. or non-U.S. taxation of our operations; and our significant leverage and how this significant leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital, limit our ability to react to challenges confronting our Company or broader changes in our industry or the economy, limit our flexibility in operating our business through restrictions contained in our debt agreements and/or prevent us from meeting our obligations under our existing and future indebtedness. For additional discussion of these risks and uncertainties, please refer to the Company’s filings with the SEC, such as its annual and quarterly reports. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements, except as otherwise required by law.\n\n**_Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures_**\n\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, we consider Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS, Net Debt and Net Leverage Ratio and constant currency, financial measures that are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP.\n\nWe define Adjusted Net Income as net income (loss) before amortization and certain other adjustments that we do not consider in our evaluation of our ongoing operating performance from period to period.\n\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted Net Income before interest expense, depreciation (including depreciation of Co-60 used in our operations) and income tax provision applicable to Adjusted Net Income.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA margin is equal to Adjusted EBITDA divided by net revenues.\n\nSegment income margin is equal to segment income divided by net segment revenues.\n\nWe define Adjusted EPS as Adjusted Net Income divided by the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding.\n\nOur Net Debt is equal to our total debt net of unamortized debt issuance costs and debt discounts, less cash and cash equivalents.\n\nOur Net Leverage Ratio is equal to Net Debt divided by Adjusted EBITDA.\n\nConstant currency is a non-GAAP financial measure we use to assess performance excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes. We calculate constant currency net revenues by translating prior year net revenues in local currency at the average exchange rates applicable for the current period. The translated results are then used to determine year-over-year percentage increases or decreases. We generally refer to such amounts calculated on a constant currency basis as excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not measures of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\nWe use these non-GAAP financial measures as the principal measures of our operating performance. Management believes these measures allow management to more effectively evaluate our operating performance and compare the results of our operations from period to period without the impact of certain non-cash items and non-routine items that we do not expect to continue at the same level in the future and other items that are not core to our operations. We believe that these measures are useful to our investors because they provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained without these measures and their disclosure. In addition, we believe these measures will assist investors in making comparisons to our historical operating results and analyzing the underlying performance of our operations for the periods presented. Our management also uses these measurements in their financial analysis and operational decision-making and Adjusted EBITDA serves as the key metric for the attainment of our primary annual incentive program. These measures may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, a similarly titled measure used by other companies.\n\n**_About Sotera Health_**\n\nSotera Health Company is a leading global provider of mission-critical end-to-end sterilization solutions and lab testing and advisory services for the healthcare industry.
