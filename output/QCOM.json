Business\nWe incorporated in California in 1985 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1991. We operate and report using a 52-53\nweek fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in September. Our 52-week fiscal years consist of four equal fiscal quarters of 13\nweeks each, and our 53-week fiscal years consist of three 13-week fiscal quarters and one 14-week fiscal quarter. The\nfinancial results for our 53-week fiscal years and our 14-week fiscal quarters will not be exactly comparable to our 52-week\nfiscal years and our 13-week fiscal quarters. Our fiscal years for 2024, 2023 and 2022 included 53 weeks, 52 weeks and 52\nweeks, respectively. Our fiscal year for 2025 will include 52 weeks.\nOverview\nWe are a global technology leader, helping to bring intelligent computing everywhere through the development and\ncommercialization of foundational technologies, including 3G (third generation), 4G (fourth generation) and 5G (fifth\ngeneration) wireless connectivity, high-performance and low-power computing and on-device artificial intelligence (AI). Our\ntechnologies and products have helped power the growth in smartphones and other connected devices. We are scaling our\ninnovations across industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, driving digital transformation with our ecosystem\npartners in areas including automotive and the internet of things (IoT). In automotive, our Snapdragon® Digital Chassis™\nplatforms, including connectivity, digital cockpit and advanced driver assistance and automated driving (ADAS/AD), are\nhelping to connect the car to its environment and the cloud, creating unique in-cabin experiences and enabling a\ncomprehensive assisted and automated driving solution. In IoT, our inventions have helped power growth in industries and\napplications such as consumer (including personal computers (PCs), tablets, voice and music and extended reality (XR)),\nedge networking (including mobile broadband and wireless access points) and industrial (including handhelds, retail, tracking\nand logistics and utilities). We derive revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit products, including our\nSnapdragon® family of highly-integrated, system-based solutions, and licensing of our intellectual property, including\npatents and other rights.\nThe foundational technologies we invent help power modern digital experiences. We share these inventions broadly\nthrough our licensing programs enabling wide ecosystem access to technologies at the core of mobile innovation, and through\nthe sale of our integrated circuit platforms (also known as integrated circuit products, chips, chipsets or modules) and other\nproducts. We innovate and collaborate across many ecosystems, including with manufacturers, operators, developers, system\nintegrators, cloud providers, test tool vendors, service providers, governments and industry standards organizations, to enable\nnext-generation digital transformation. For nearly 40 years, we have been a leader in setting industry standards and creating\nera-defining technology breakthroughs, and we continue to play a leading role in developing system-level inventions that\nserve as the foundation for multiple generations of advanced wireless technologies. This includes technologies such as\nCDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) and OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access) families of\ntechnologies, with the latter encompassing LTE (Long-Term Evolution) and 5G NR (New Radio), which are the primary\ndigital technologies currently used to transmit voice or data over radio waves using a public or private cellular wireless\nnetwork.\n6\nWe own significant intellectual property, including patents, patent applications and trade secrets, applicable to products\nthat implement any version of CDMA and/or OFDMA technologies. We also develop and commercialize numerous other key\ntechnologies used in mobile and other devices and services, and we own substantial intellectual property related to these\ntechnologies. Some of these inventions are contributed to and commercialized as industry standards, such as for certain video\nand audio codecs, Wi-Fi, position location, UWB (ultra-wideband), Bluetooth®, memory and component interconnect. We\nhave also developed other technologies that are used by wireless and other devices that are not related to industry standards,\nsuch as operating systems, user interfaces, graphics and camera processing functionality, RF (radio frequency), RFFE (radio\nfrequency front-end) and antenna designs, AI and machine learning techniques and application processor architectures,\namong other technologies.\nWe are organized on the basis of products and services and have three reportable segments. We conduct business\nprimarily through our QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) semiconductor business and our QTL (Qualcomm\nTechnology Licensing) licensing business. QCT develops and supplies integrated circuit platforms and system software with\nadvanced connectivity and high-performance, low-power computing technologies for use in mobile devices; automotive\nsystems for connectivity, digital cockpit and ADAS/AD; and IoT including consumer electronic devices, industrial devices\nand edge networking products. QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property\nportfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless\nproducts. Our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic investments. We also have\nnonreportable segments, including QGOV (Qualcomm Government Technologies) and our cloud computing processing\ninitiative.\nIndustry Trends\nAs the largest technology platform in the world, mobile has transformed the way we connect, compute and communicate.\nAdvanced connectivity and high-performance, low-power computing technologies from mobile are also impacting many\nindustries beyond wireless, empowering new services, new business models, and new ways to engage and interact with\ncustomers. Our breakthrough inventions and licensing programs have been integral to the demand and evolution of the\nmobile industry.\nArtificial Intelligence. Advancements in processor technologies have enabled the distribution and coordination of\ncomplex workloads across the cloud and edge devices to provide enhanced performance and efficiency across use cases.\nGiven the proximity to raw data, edge device computing allows for more context-aware processing, reducing response time,\nimproving privacy and security, and enabling greater personalization. With increased processing power, mobile handsets and\nPCs are becoming pervasive AI platforms, with complex large generative AI algorithms running on-device, enabling on-\ndemand and contextual AI use cases at a fraction of the energy required by cloud-based applications. As wireless connectivity\ncomplements on-device generative AI, edge devices enable enhanced productivity use cases, while intelligently processing\nand sharing data with cloud-based applications as needed. Building on the smartphone and PC foundation, we envision\ngenerative AI becoming ubiquitous, continuing to expand into industries and applications such as IoT, XR and automotive.\nSignificant investment continues across many industries in the development of complex large language models (LLMs),\nmore tailored small language models (SLMs), large vision models (LVMs), large multimodal models (LMMs) and other\ngenerative AI models, which are beginning to change the landscape of the user experience. LLMs and SLMs (e.g., GPT-4o\nand Llama3) are used for text-based natural language processing applications such as answering queries, document\nsummarization and creation, LVMs (e.g., Stable Diffusion and ControlNet) are used for image and video processing, and\nLMMs are used to understand and process multiple types of data inputs or modalities such as text and images. They are\ndisrupting traditional methods of search, content creation, recommendation systems and personalized digital assistants,\noffering significant enhancements in consumer utility and productivity. While these generative AI models are developed\nprimarily for use in the cloud, we believe that the variety of innovative enterprise and consumer use cases that have emerged\nand will continue to emerge from generative AI must run on-device to maximize their utility, and bring the benefits of\nimmediacy, privacy, security and personalization to consumers. We expect continued advancement in the generative AI\ncapabilities of edge devices and increased adoption of generative AI capable technologies in handsets and other edge devices.\nFor example, analysts estimate that 46% of smartphones sold in 2027 will be generative AI capable, up from 19% in 2024\n(Counterpoint, October 2024).\nAdvancing Connectivity. 3G technology introduced the world to the potential of the mobile internet, and the ability to\naccess the internet virtually anytime and anywhere. 4G brought mobile broadband speeds that helped fuel the smartphone era,\nforever changing the way we work, live and connect with others. 4G has served as the technology foundation for many of the\napplications and services used today, including e-commerce, video streaming, video calling, social media and gaming.\nBuilding on foundational innovations developed for 3G and 4G, the mobile industry continues to transition to 5G\ntechnology as 5G network deployments and device launches continue, particularly in emerging regions. 5G is designed to\nsupport multi-gigabit data rates, low latency and greater capacity than previous generations of mobile technology to enable\nenhanced mobile broadband experiences, including ultra-high definition (4K) video streaming and sharing, near-\ninstantaneous access to cloud services, immersive cloud gaming and XR, which includes augmented reality (AR), virtual\nreality (VR) and mixed reality (MR). 5G’s performance and capacity improvements are also enabling operators to offer new\nconsumer and enterprise services. 5G Advanced builds upon the initial 5G standards to enhance system capabilities and\nexpand into new use cases. It introduces key improvements for continued 5G commercialization, supports a range of services\n7\nbeyond mobile broadband, and lays the groundwork for the upcoming 6G platform. 5G Advanced is a transformative step,\nintegrating features like wireless AI to drive innovation across the 5G ecosystem.\nConsumer Demand for Smartphones. For calendar year 2024, we estimate that consumer demand for 3G, 4G, and 5G\nhandset volumes will increase by a low-to-mid-single digit percentage relative to calendar year 2023. This estimate includes\nexpected high single-digit to low double-digit percentage growth in 5G handsets.\nConsumer demand for new experiences, combined with the needs of mobile operators and device manufacturers to\nprovide differentiated features and services, is driving continued innovation within the smartphone across connectivity,\nprocessing, AI, multimedia, imaging, audio and more. As a result, the smartphone continues to be the go-to device for social\nnetworking, music and video streaming, photography and video capture, e-commerce, gaming, email, web browsing and\nmore. We believe that the combination of 5G and AI will enable these experiences to be more immersive, intuitive and\ninteractive.\nAutomotive. Digitalization of the automotive cockpit including wireless connectivity continues to transform the in-\nvehicle experience, enabling greater personalization of content and settings for both drivers and passengers as automakers\nrespond to growing interest from consumers to bring their digital lifestyles into the vehicle. Car-to-cloud platforms are\ndesigned to help automakers improve cost efficiencies, create new service opportunities throughout the lifecycle of a vehicle\nwith over-the-air (OTA) update capabilities and gather valuable vehicle and usage analytics. This is driving the development\nof a new architecture for the software-defined vehicle. According to analyst data, 67% of new vehicles produced in 2030 are\nprojected to have embedded cellular connectivity, with 48% of new vehicles featuring 5G connectivity compared to 11% of\nnew vehicles featuring 5G connectivity in 2024 (TechInsights, September 2024). In addition, high-performance, low-power\ncomputing technologies, with added security and safety required for automotive products, are being used to improve vehicles\nwith advanced driver assistance and automated driving features that we expect to scale across vehicle tiers and continue the\nprogression toward higher levels of autonomy, safety and convenience. Analysts estimate that 39% of new light duty vehicles\nsold globally in 2027 will have Level 2 (i.e., partial driving automation) or higher autonomy, compared to an estimated 20%\nof new light duty vehicles sold globally in 2024 (TechInsights, September 2024).\nIoT. Industry demand for IoT devices is expected to remain strong across consumer, edge networking and industrial\napplications, in part due to expanded use cases enabled by 5G and AI technologies, including generative AI.\nConsumer. Consumer IoT products, including personal computing (e.g., tablets and PCs), voice and music and XR,\ncontinue to adopt the latest mobile connectivity, processing and intelligence technologies including on-device AI capabilities.\nThis enables new services, applications and experiences that can be run directly on the device, driving improvements in\nlatency, cost and privacy. For example, a new class of AI-focused PCs, including those powered by our Snapdragon X Series\nplatforms, launched in 2024, allowing for increased productivity and enhanced use cases enabled by on-device AI processing\nat low power. By 2027, analysts expect that at least 50% of PCs sold will be AI capable, compared to 22% of PCs in 2024\n(consensus of certain third party analysts as of October 1, 2024).\nEdge Networking. Advances in wireless technology are helping to drive demand for edge networking products (including\nmobile broadband and wireless access points). 5G provides the flexibility to support both mobile and fixed wireless users\nwith the delivery of high-speed, low-latency connections, enabling operators to replace traditional “last-mile” wired\nbroadband connections. Additionally, advancements in Wi-Fi are driving consumer and enterprise demand for the latest Wi-\nFi 6, 6E, and 7 access point technologies that leverage increased network speed, capacity and efficiency to support the\nincreased number of connected devices at home and at work.\nIndustrial. The combination of IoT devices with connectivity, computing, on-device AI and power-optimized and precise\nlocation tracking along with the cloud are helping to bring near real-time data and insights in industries such as retail,\ntracking and logistics and energy. This allows companies to gain new knowledge and insights about their products and\nservices, manufacturing and logistics processes and more, which can help to transform and optimize their businesses.\nTechnology Overview\nThe worldwide demand for intelligent computing everywhere requires continuous innovation to improve user\nexperiences, support new services, expand on-device processing and AI capabilities at low power, and increase wireless\nconnectivity capacity and performance. To meet these requirements, different foundational technologies, including wireless\ncommunications, computing (including on-device AI), multimedia and location, continue to evolve. We have a long history\nof investing heavily in research and development and have developed many of these foundational technologies that help drive\nthe continued evolution in mobile, automotive and IoT. We have also developed and acquired (and continue to develop and\nacquire) significant related intellectual property. This intellectual property has been incorporated into the most widely\naccepted and deployed cellular wireless communications technology standards, and we have licensed it to several hundred\nlicensees, including all of the leading handset manufacturers.\n8\nCellular Wireless Technologies. Relevant cellular wireless technologies can be grouped into the following categories.\nCDMA-based. CDMA-based technologies are characterized by their access method allowing several users to share the\nsame frequency and time by allocating different orthogonal codes to individual users. Most of the CDMA-based technologies\nare classified as 3G technology. CDMA-based connections worldwide continue to decline as consumers migrate to OFDMA-\nbased technologies, which comprise the majority of cellular connections today.\nOFDMA-based. OFDMA-based technologies are characterized by their access method allowing several users to share the\nsame frequency band and time by allocating different subcarriers to individual users. 5G heavily leverages OFDMA-based\ntechnologies, while most of the OFDMA-based technologies deployed prior to 2020 are classified as 4G technology. The 4G\nspecifications were defined within 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project), a global organization that develops technical\nspecifications, including the specification of the radio component (LTE) and the core network component (Enhanced Packet\nCore or EPC). 3GPP has been developing the 5G system through the specification of the radio component (NR) and the core\nnetwork component (5G Core or 5GC). Unlike 4G that has fixed Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)\nparameterization, 5G has multiple OFDM parameterizations to address a wide range of spectrum and use cases.\nThe first 5G specification, 3GPP Release 15, was initially completed in 2018. 5G is designed to transform the role of\nwireless technologies and incorporates advancements on 3G/4G features, including device-to-device capabilities and the use\nof all different types of spectrum (including licensed, unlicensed and shared spectrum). 3GPP specifications also provide\nenhancements specifically for C-V2X (cellular vehicle-to-everything), which includes both direct communication (vehicle-to-\nvehicle, vehicle-to-infrastructure and vehicle-to-pedestrian) in dedicated spectrum that is independent of a cellular network\nand cellular communications with networks in traditional mobile broadband licensed spectrum. Many of our inventions at the\ncore of 3G and 4G serve as the foundational technologies for 5G, and we continue to play a significant role in driving\nadvancements in 5G, including contributing to 3GPP standardization activities that are defining the continued evolution of\n5G NR and 5G Core standards into 5G Advanced, as well as establishing the requirements for 6G.\n5G has the ability to target diverse services with very different technical requirements (from enhanced mobile broadband\nto massive IoT to mission critical services), utilize diverse types of spectrum (from low bands to millimeter wave (mmWave)\nbands) and support diverse types of deployment scenarios. Predominant technological components of 5G include ultra-\nreliable, low-latency communication, very wide channel bandwidth and new channel coding schemes to efficiently support\nlarge data blocks, MIMO (multiple input, multiple output) to increase coverage and network capacity and mobile mmWave to\nincrease the data rate offered to users. As with previous cellular generations, 5G is designed to support seamless compatibility\nwith 3G/4G technologies through multimode devices.\nFollowing the initial specification of 5G, 3GPP has completed three additional releases. Release 16 introduced\nenhancements to 5G mobile broadband experiences (e.g., more capacity, improved coverage, mobility and better device\npower efficiency), expanded 5G technologies into new use cases and industries (native positioning support, 5G-based C-\nV2X, 5G Broadcast) and began supporting different spectrum types by expanding 5G into unlicensed spectrum with 5G NR\nUnlicensed (NR-U). Release 17 became the third major release of the global 5G NR standard expanding the 5G technology\nfoundations for coverage, power, reliability and spectrum range, which are designed to provide efficient support for lower\ncomplexity 5G devices (e.g., reduced capacity (RedCap) devices) including wearables, industrial sensors, and new\ndeployments, including non-terrestrial networks and mmWave private networks on unlicensed 60 GHz spectrum band.\nRelease 18 marked the start of 5G Advanced, with projects designed to strengthen the end-to-end 5G system foundation (such\nas advanced downlink and uplink MIMO, enhanced mobility, mobile integrated access and backhaul, smart repeater, evolved\nduplexing, AI and machine learning data-driven designs and green networks) and to proliferate 5G to virtually all devices and\nuse cases (such as boundless XR, RedCap evolution, expanded sidelink, expanded positioning, drones and expanded satellite\ncommunication and multicast). Release 19, which is currently under development, builds on the 5G Advanced standards to\ndeliver new 5G advancements through continued system enhancements (e.g., sub-band full-duplex (SBFD), multi-hop\nsidelink relays), further use case diversification (e.g., Ambient IoT), and new advanced capabilities, including standardized\nwireless AI framework and potential applications, and ultra-low power receiver. Release 19 will establish the technical\nfoundation for 6G.\nComputing. Our processors are purpose-built to power mobile experiences, automobiles and the IoT. We have developed\nSystem-on-Chip (SoC) architecture with heterogeneous computing features, which uses our central processing unit (CPU)\nand different types of specialized engines (graphics processing unit (GPU) and neural processing unit (NPU)) to enable high-\nperformance and low-power computing and other optimization techniques. Our Qualcomm Oryon™ and Qualcomm®\nKryo™ CPU processors deliver enhanced security, AI and connectivity solutions, all designed to enable the next generation\nof high-tech devices and apps. Qualcomm Oryon CPU core technology is custom-designed to deliver a new level of\nperformance and efficiency and developed to be integrated across a wide portfolio of Snapdragon powered products starting\nwith certain PC and smartphone products and expanding to certain automotive and IoT products. Our Qualcomm® Adreno™\nGPUs are designed to deliver high quality graphics performance for visually rich 3D gaming and user interfaces.\nThe Qualcomm® AI Engine, featured in our Snapdragon platforms and many of our other products, includes dedicated\nhardware capable of running complex AI use cases at high-performance and low-power on device, while also enhancing\nprivacy and security. Our Qualcomm® Hexagon™ NPU is a key processor in our AI Engine and is designed for sustained,\nhigh-performance AI inference, enabling leading on-device AI capabilities with very low power consumption.

Our technology roadmap delivers the\nlatest network technologies across multiple product tiers, devices and industries. This roadmap is the result of extensive\ncollaboration with manufacturers, operators, developers, systems integrators, cloud providers, tool vendors, service providers,\ngovernments and industry standards organizations, as well as our years of research into emerging network standards and the\ndevelopment of integrated circuits. Our roadmap takes advantage of new standards, while maintaining backward\ncompatibility with existing standards. We have leveraged and expect to continue to leverage the foundational technologies\ninitially developed and commercialized for use in mobile handset devices, such as our core baseband modem and processor\ntechnologies and our other wireless connectivity products including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and precise positioning technologies, to\nextend into product categories, industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, such as automotive and IoT (which\nincludes the industries and applications of consumer, industrial and edge networking).\nThe Snapdragon family of highly integrated, system-based solutions include the Snapdragon mobile, compute, sound and\nautomotive platforms. Each platform consists of application processors and wireless connectivity capabilities, including our\ncellular modem that provides core baseband modem functionality for voice and data communications, non-cellular wireless\nconnectivity (such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth) and global positioning functions. Our Snapdragon application processor functions\ninclude AI, security, graphics, display, audio, video, camera and other compute processing. Our Qualcomm Oryon and Kryo\nCPUs are designed to deliver high levels of compute performance with optimized power consumption. Our Hexagon NPUs\nare designed to support a variety of AI processing tasks for superior performance-per-watt, thermal efficiency and battery\nlife. Our Qualcomm® Adreno™ GPUs are designed to deliver high quality graphics performance for visually rich 3D gaming\nand user interfaces. In addition to the highly integrated core SoC, we also design and supply supporting components,\n10\nincluding the RF transceiver, PM (power management), audio, codecs, speaker amps and additional wireless connectivity\nintegrated circuits. These supporting components, in addition to our cellular modems and application processors comprising\nour core SoC, are also sold as individual components. The combination of the Snapdragon SoC, system software and\nsupporting components provides an overall platform with optimized performance and efficiency, enabling manufacturers to\ndesign and deliver powerful, slim and power-efficient devices ready for integration with complex cellular networks\nworldwide.\nOur portfolio of RF products includes Qualcomm® RFFE components that are designed to simplify the RF front-end\ndesign for 5G, including sub-6 GHz and mmWave, as well as, for 4G LTE multimode devices, to reduce power consumption\nand to improve radio performance. We provide comprehensive RFFE product offerings with system level performance from\nthe modem and transceiver to the antenna that include complex 4G/5G transmit and receive modules, power tracking, tuning\nsystems, multimode-multiband power amplification, low noise amplifiers and mmWave antenna solutions, in addition to\ndiscrete filtering products, for devices and applications across the mobile handsets, automotive and IoT industries. We have\nalso integrated our Snapdragon platform with our RFFE components to create our Snapdragon 5G modem-RF products, a\nmodem-to-antenna platform integrating AI to maximize data speeds and performance, support superior call connectivity and\ncoverage and extend battery life.\nOur wireless connectivity products also consist of integrated circuits and system software for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and\nfrequency modulation, as well as technologies that support location data and services. Our wireless connectivity products\nprovide additional connectivity for mobile devices, tablets, PCs, XR headsets, voice and music devices, wearable devices,\nalong with other IoT devices and applications, automotive connectivity, digital cockpit and ADAS/AD, utility meters and\nlogistic trackers and industrial sensors. QCT also offers standalone Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, applications processor and Ethernet\nproducts utilized within these devices and systems. Our networking products include Wi-Fi, Ethernet and passive optical\nnetwork (PON) chips, network processors, wireless access points and routers, broadband gateway equipment and software.\nThese products help enable home and business networks to support the growing number of connected devices, digital media\nand data services.\nOther than for certain of our RFFE modules and RF filter products, QCT utilizes a fabless production model, which\nmeans that we do not own or operate foundries for the production of silicon wafers from which our integrated circuits are\nmade. Therefore, we primarily rely on third parties to perform the manufacturing and assembly, and most of the testing, of\nour integrated circuits based primarily on our proprietary designs and test programs. Our suppliers also are responsible for the\nprocurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our integrated circuits. Integrated circuits are die cut from\nsilicon wafers that have completed the package assembly and test manufacturing processes. The semiconductor package\nsupports the electrical contacts that connect the integrated circuit to a circuit board. Die cut from silicon wafers are the\nessential components of all our integrated circuits and a significant portion of the total integrated circuit cost. We employ\nboth turnkey and two-stage manufacturing models to purchase our integrated circuits. Under the turnkey model, our foundry\nsuppliers are responsible for delivering fully assembled and tested integrated circuits. Under the two-stage manufacturing\nmodel, we purchase die in singular or wafer form from semiconductor manufacturing foundries and contract with separate\nthird parties for manufacturing services such as wafer bump, probe, assembly and the majority of our final test requirements.\nThe primary foundry suppliers for our various digital, analog/mixed-signal, RF and PM integrated circuits include Taiwan\nSemiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), Global Foundries, Samsung Electronics and Semiconductor\nManufacturing International Corporation (SMIC). Our primary semiconductor assembly and test suppliers are Advanced\nSemiconductor Engineering, Amkor Technology, Siliconware Precision Industries and STATSChipPAC. The majority of our\nfoundry and semiconductor assembly and test suppliers are located in the Asia-Pacific region.\nQCT primarily uses internal fabrication facilities to manufacture certain RFFE modules and RF filter products, and our\nmanufacturing operations consist of front-end and back-end processes. The front-end processes primarily take place at\nmanufacturing facilities located in Germany and Singapore and involve the imprinting of substrate wafers with the structure\nand circuitry required for the products to function (also known as wafer fabrication). The back-end processes include the\nassembly, packaging and test of RFFE modules and RF filter products and their preparation for distribution. Our back-end\nmanufacturing facilities are located in China and Singapore.\nQCT's marketing strategy aims to promote Qualcomm as the leader of enabling intelligent computing everywhere, and\nSnapdragon as the preferred platform brand powering premium experiences across handsets, automotive and IoT. Through\ndirect marketing efforts, partnerships and collaborations (including marketing programs with customers), products powered\nby Snapdragon and Qualcomm technologies are marketed to expand the reach of both brands to drive awareness and\npreference.\nQCT’s sales are primarily made through supply terms which implement a purchase order and order confirmation process\nfor delivery of products. QCT generally allows customers to reschedule delivery dates within a defined time frame and to\ncancel orders prior to shipment with or without payment of a cancellation fee, depending on when the order is canceled. The\nindustries in which QCT operates are intensely competitive. QCT competes worldwide with a number of U.S. and\ninternational designers and manufacturers of semiconductors. As a result of global expansion by foreign and domestic\ncompetitors, technological changes, device manufacturer concentrations, limited global supply capacity, vertical integration\nand the potential for further industry consolidation, we anticipate the industry to remain very competitive. We believe that the\nprincipal competitive factors for our products include performance, level of integration, quality, compliance with industry\nstandards, price, time-to-market, system cost, design and engineering capabilities, new product innovation, growth and\n11\nscaling of distribution channels, desire by certain customers to use multiple suppliers and customer support. QCT also\ncompetes in both single-mode and multimode environments against alternative communications technologies. Additional\ncompetitive factors exist for QCT product offerings that have expanded into industries and applications beyond mobile\nhandsets, including automotive and IoT. The automotive industry is subject to long design-in time frames, long product life\ncycles and a high degree of regulatory and safety requirements, necessitating suppliers to the industry to comply with\nstringent qualification processes, very low defect rates and high reliability standards, all of which results in a significant\nbarrier to entry and may result in increased costs.\nQCT’s current competitors include, but are not limited to, companies such as Broadcom, HiSilicon, MediaTek,\nMobileye, Nvidia, NXP Semiconductors, Qorvo, Samsung, Skyworks, Texas Instruments and UNISOC. QCT also faces\ncompetition, which may intensify in the future, from products internally developed by our customers, including some of our\nlargest customers, such as Apple and Samsung, to early-stage companies. Our competitors devote significant amounts of their\nfinancial, technical and other resources to develop and market competitive products and, in some cases, to develop and adopt\ncompetitive digital communication or signal processing technologies, and those efforts may materially and adversely affect\nus. Although we have attained a significant position in the semiconductor industry, many of our current and potential\ncompetitors may have advantages over us. These and other risks related to competition are more fully described in the Risk\nFactors entitled “Our industry is subject to intense competition in an environment of rapid technological change. Our success\ndepends in part on our ability to adapt to such change and compete effectively; and such change and competition could result\nin decreased demand for our products and technologies or declining average selling prices for our products or those of our\ncustomers or licensees” and “Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers\nvertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).”\nQTL Segment. QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio,\nwhich, among other rights, includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture, sale and/or use of\ncertain wireless products, including, without limitation, products implementing WCDMA (Wideband CDMA), LTE and/or\nOFDMA-based 5G standards and their derivatives. We grant licenses or otherwise provide rights to use our cellular standard-\nessential patents (including 3G, 4G and 5G) for both single-mode and multimode devices on a worldwide basis. We also offer\nlicenses to our cellular standard-essential patents together with other Qualcomm patents that may be useful to such licensed\nproducts for licensees that desire to obtain the commercial benefits of receiving such broad patent rights from us. While we\noffer license rights to patents that we do not have a duty or obligation to grant, those rights may be negotiated at our\ndiscretion. A significant portion of QTL’s licensing revenues is derived from licensees that have entered into license\nagreements that grant licenses under Qualcomm’s cellular standard-essential patents. Our licensees manufacture wireless\ncellular products such as mobile devices (including handsets), other consumer devices (e.g., tablets and PCs), plug-in end\nuser data modem cards and embedded modules for incorporation into machine-to-machine devices and certain other devices,\nconnected vehicle units and connected vehicle modules used in automobiles, wireless access points and small cell wireless\nproducts.\nSince our founding in 1985, we have focused heavily on technology development and innovation. These efforts have\nresulted in a leading intellectual property portfolio related to foundational, system level technologies for the wireless industry.\nWe have an extensive portfolio of United States and foreign patents, and we continue to pursue patent applications around the\nworld. Our patents have broad coverage in many countries, including Brazil, China, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, the\nUnited States and countries in Europe (including European patents with unitary effect). A substantial portion of our patents\nand patent applications relate to digital wireless communications technologies, including patents that are essential or may be\nimportant to the commercial implementation of CDMA2000, WCDMA (UMTS), LTE and/or OFDMA-based 5G products.\nOur patent portfolio is the most widely and extensively licensed in the industry, including more than 200 5G license\nagreements to date. Additionally, we have a substantial patent portfolio related to key technologies used in communications\nand other devices and/or related services, some of which are covered by industry standards. These include certain video\ncodecs, audio codecs, Wi-Fi, memory interfaces, wireline interfaces, wireless power, position location, broadcast and\nstreaming protocols, and short-range communication functionalities, including Bluetooth. Our patents cover a wide range of\ntechnologies across connectivity (including wireless devices and network infrastructure equipment), computing and AI\napplications in diverse end-markets, not just the portion of such patented technologies incorporated into chipsets. Over the\nyears, a number of companies have challenged our patent position, but the mobile communications industry generally\nrecognizes that any company seeking to develop, manufacture and/or sell certain wireless products that use 3G, 4G and/or 5G\ntechnologies requires a license or other rights to use our patents.\nWe have licensed or otherwise provided rights to use our patents to hundreds of companies on industry-accepted terms.\nOur strategy to make our patented technologies broadly available has been a catalyst for industry growth, helping to enable a\nwide range of companies offering a broad array of wireless products and features while increasing the capabilities of and/or\ndriving down average and low-end selling prices for handsets and other wireless devices. By licensing or otherwise providing\nrights to use our patents to a wide range of equipment manufacturers, encouraging innovative applications, supporting\nequipment manufacturers with integrated chipset and software products and focusing on improving the efficiency of the\nairlink for wireless operators, we have helped multimode device capabilities evolve, grow demand and reduce device pricing.\n5G network deployments and commercial 3G/4G/5G multimode device sales began in 2019 and have continued. By licensing\nor otherwise providing rights to use our patents to a wide range of equipment manufacturers, we are supporting the global\nrollout and availability of 5G technology. We believe that 5G will continue to encourage innovative applications through\n12\nenhanced mobile broadband services with lower latency and multi-gigabit user data speeds and bring more capacity and\nefficiency to wireless networks.\nUpon the initial deployment of OFDMA-based networks, the products implementing such technologies generally have\nbeen multimode and implement OFDMA-based and CDMA-based technologies. The licenses granted under our existing\nlicense agreements generally cover multimode CDMA/OFDMA (3G/4G/5G) devices, and our licensees are obligated to pay\nroyalties under their license agreements for their sales of such devices.\nStandards bodies have been informed that we hold patents that might be essential for all 3G standards that are based on\nCDMA, patents that are potentially essential for 4G technologies and patents and pending patent applications that are\npotentially essential for 5G technologies. We have committed to such standards bodies that we will offer to license our\nessential patents for these standards consistent with our commitments to those bodies. We have made similar commitments\nwith respect to certain other technologies implemented in industry standards.\nQTL licensing revenues include per-unit royalties and, to a lesser extent, lump sum payments (i.e., license fees,\nsubstantially all of which were recognized prior to fiscal 2024). Licensees pay quarterly royalties based on their sales of\nproducts incorporating or using our licensed intellectual property. Per-unit royalties are generally based upon a percentage of\nthe wholesale (i.e., licensee’s) selling price of complete licensed products, net of certain permissible deductions (including\ntransportation, insurance, packing costs and other items), with certain products subject to per unit minimums and/or per unit\ncaps. Certain products may also have a fixed royalty amount per unit.\nThe vast majority of QTL revenues have been generated through our licensees’ sales of OFDMA-based products\n(including 3G/4G and 3G/4G/5G multimode devices), such as smartphones and other devices. We have invested in both the\nacquisition and development of, and continue to invest in the development of, OFDMA technology and intellectual property\nand have generated the industry leading patent portfolio applicable to LTE, LTE Advanced, LTE Advanced Pro and 5G NR.\nSome of our inventions that serve as foundational technologies for 3G and 4G also serve as foundational technologies for 5G.\nWe have invested and continue to invest in the development of 5G and continue to play a significant role in driving\nadvancements of 5G. Nevertheless, we face competition in the development of intellectual property for future generations of\ndigital wireless communications technologies and services.\nOur license agreements also may provide us with rights to use certain of our licensees’ technology and intellectual\nproperty to manufacture, sell and/or use certain components (e.g., application-specific integrated circuits) and related\nsoftware, cellular devices and/or infrastructure equipment.\nWe have been in the past, currently are, and may in the future be subject to certain legal proceedings and/or\ngovernmental investigations challenging our patent licensing practices, including certain matters described in this Annual\nReport under the heading “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.” Such\ngovernmental investigations and/or legal proceedings could require us to change our patent licensing practices, as described\nherein in “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” under the heading “Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to\ngovernmental investigations, legal challenges or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations.”\nQSI Segment. QSI makes strategic investments primarily through our Qualcomm Ventures arm that are focused on\nexpanding or opening new opportunities for our technologies as well as supporting the design and introduction of new\nproducts and services (or enhancing existing products or services). Many of these strategic investments are in early-stage\ncompanies in a variety of industries and applications, including but not limited to 5G, AI, automotive, consumer, enterprise,\ncloud, IoT and XR. Investments primarily include non-marketable equity securities and, to a lesser extent, marketable equity\nsecurities and convertible debt instruments. In addition, QSI segment results include revenues and related costs associated\nwith certain development contracts with one of our investees. As part of our strategic investment activities, we generally\nintend to pursue various exit strategies for each of our QSI investments in the foreseeable future.\nOther Businesses. Nonreportable segments include our QGOV business and our cloud computing processing initiative.\nQGOV provides development and other services and sells related products to U.S. government agencies and their contractors.\nSeasonality. Information regarding seasonality is provided in this Annual Report in “Part II, Item 7. Management’s\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the “Our Business and Operating Segments”\nsection under the heading “Seasonality.”\nCorporate Structure\nWe operate our businesses through our parent company, QUALCOMM Incorporated, and multiple direct and indirect\nsubsidiaries. We have developed our corporate structure in order to address various legal, regulatory, tax, contractual\ncompliance, operational and other matters. Substantially all of our products and services businesses, including QCT, and\nsubstantially all of our engineering and research and development functions, are operated by Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.\n(QTI), a subsidiary of QUALCOMM Incorporated, and QTI’s subsidiaries. QTL is operated by QUALCOMM Incorporated,\nwhich owns the vast majority of our patent portfolio. Snapdragon and Qualcomm branded products are products of QTI and/\nor its subsidiaries. Qualcomm patents are licensed by QUALCOMM Incorporated. Neither QTI nor any of its subsidiaries has\nany right, power or authority to grant any licenses or other rights under or to any patents owned by QUALCOMM\nIncorporated.\n13\nRevenue Concentrations and Significant Customers\nA small number of customers/licensees historically have accounted for a significant portion of our consolidated\nrevenues. In fiscal 2024, revenues from Apple, Samsung and Xiaomi each comprised 10% or more of our consolidated\nrevenues. Additional information regarding revenue concentrations is provided in this Annual Report in “Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements, Note 2. Composition of Certain Financial Statement Items” and “Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements, Note 8. Segment Information.”\nResearch and Development\nWe compete in industries that are characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and frequent\nnew product introductions, requiring a continuous effort to enhance existing products and technologies and to develop new\nproducts and technologies.

We support Android, Windows, Linux and other client software environments in our chipsets.\nWe develop innovations that are integrated into our product portfolio to expand the opportunity for wireless\ncommunications and enhance the value of our products and services. These innovations are expected to enable our customers\nto improve the performance or value of their existing services, offer these services more affordably and introduce revenue-\ngenerating broadband data services ahead of their competition.\nWe have research and development centers in various locations throughout the world that support our global\ndevelopment activities. We continue to use our substantial engineering resources and expertise to develop new technologies,\napplications and services and make them available to licensees to help grow the wireless communications industry and\ngenerate new or expanded licensing opportunities.\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Human Capital\nWe believe that our innovations help transform industries, enhance people’s lives and address some of society’s biggest\nchallenges. With the world becoming increasingly connected, we have an opportunity to shape a better future. We believe in\nthe power of technology. As such, our corporate responsibility vision is to be a facilitator of innovation for a sustainable\nworld, connected wirelessly.\nWe have integrated corporate responsibility throughout our business, from our daily operations to our executive\nleadership and our Board of Directors (Board). The Governance Committee of our Board provides oversight on ESG matters\nnot delegated to other Board committees, including ESG policies, programs and initiatives. The HR and Compensation\nCommittee of our Board provides oversight on our human capital initiatives and our workforce diversity, equity and inclusion\npolicies, programs and initiatives, while the Audit Committee of our Board provides oversight of certain ESG disclosure\ncontrols and procedures. Our ESG Leadership Committee, composed of executives, provides guidance on global corporate\nresponsibility issues. Our ESG Working Group implements directives from the ESG Leadership Committee, measures\nprogress on achieving our goals and reports to management on accomplishments and challenges.\nESG\nWe center our ESG efforts around purposeful innovation, focusing on three strategic areas where we believe we can have\nthe biggest impact:\n• Empowering Digital Transformation.

During fiscal 2024, our voluntary turnover rate was approximately 5%.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion. We believe that a diverse workforce is important to our success, and we continue to\nfocus on making Qualcomm a great place to work for everyone, including women and underrepresented populations. Our\nrecent efforts have been focused in three areas: inspiring innovation through an inclusive and diverse culture; expanding our\nefforts to recruit world-class diverse talent; and identifying strategic partners to accelerate our programs.\nWe have employee networks that enhance our inclusive and diverse culture, including global network groups focused on\nsupporting women, LGBTQ+ employees and employees with disabilities, in addition to U.S.-based employee networks that\nfocus on Asian American and Pacific Islander employees, Black and African American employees, Hispanic and Latinx\nemployees and U.S. military members and veterans.\nWe continue to recruit technical talent in diverse communities, engaging as a high-level sponsor of professional\nconferences, such as the Grace Hopper Conference for women and non-binary technologists, the Society of Hispanic\nProfessional Engineers National Convention and the Richard Tapia Conference. We also continue to recruit from a variety of\ncolleges with diverse student populations, including Hispanic-Serving Institutions and Historically Black Colleges and\nUniversities.\nOur continued engagement with organizations that work with diverse communities has been vital to our efforts. We\njoined the Global Catalyst Community that helps organizations build workplaces that work for women with thought\nleadership and actionable solutions to advance women into leadership. We are also endorsed as a great employer for women\n15\nby Work180 in the UK and have been recognized by Avtar and Seramount as a Best Company for Women in India. We,\nalongside other top technology companies, helped form the Reboot Representation Tech Coalition, which aims to double the\nnumber of Black, Latinx and Native American women receiving computing degrees by 2025. We have also been named a\n‘Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion’ by Disability:IN for ten years in a row, underscoring our commitment to an\ninclusive work environment for people with disabilities.\nWe publish our most recent Consolidated EEO-1 reports on our website to provide additional transparency into our\nworkforce.\nHealth, Safety and Wellness. The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people.\nAccordingly, we are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our employees. Through our Live+Well, Work+Well\nprograms, we provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of innovative, flexible and convenient health\nand wellness programs, including benefits that provide protection and security related to events that may require time away\nfrom work or that impact their financial well-being; that support their physical and mental health by providing tools and\nresources to help them improve or maintain their health status and encourage engagement in healthy behaviors; and that offer\nchoice where possible so they can customize their benefits to meet their needs and the needs of their families.\nCompensation and Benefits. We provide robust compensation and benefits programs to help meet the needs of our\nemployees. In addition to salaries, these programs may include (depending on country/region) annual bonuses, stock awards,\nan employee stock purchase plan, retirement and savings plans, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible\nspending accounts, paid time off, family leave, family care resources, flexible work schedules, adoption and surrogacy\nassistance, employee assistance programs, tuition assistance, and on-site services such as health and fitness centers, among\nothers. In addition to our broad-based equity award programs, we have used targeted equity awards with vesting conditions to\nfacilitate retention of personnel, particularly those with critical engineering skills and experience.\nTalent Development. We invest significant resources to develop the talent needed to remain a world-leading innovator in\nwireless technologies and high-performance and low-power computing, including AI. We deliver numerous training\nopportunities, provide rotational assignment opportunities, focus on continuous learning and development and have\nimplemented what we believe are industry-leading methodologies to manage performance, provide feedback and develop\ntalent.\nOur talent development programs are designed to provide employees with the resources they need to help achieve their\ncareer goals, build management skills and lead their organizations. We provide a series of employee workshops around the\nglobe that support professional growth and development. Additionally, our manager and employee forum programs provide\nan ongoing opportunity for employees to practice and apply learning around conversations aligned with our annual review\nprocess. We also have an employee development website that provides quick access to learning resources that are\npersonalized to the individual’s development needs.\nBuilding Connections - With Each Other and our Communities. We believe that building connections between our\nemployees, their families and our communities creates a more meaningful, fulfilling and enjoyable workplace. Through our\nengagement programs, our employees can pursue their interests and hobbies, connect to volunteering and giving\nopportunities and enjoy unique recreational experiences with family members. Leveraging our partnerships with various local\narts and culture organizations, we have created numerous unique experiences for employees and their families around the\nworld.\nSince our employees are passionate about many causes, our corporate giving and volunteering programs support and\nencourage employees by engaging with those causes. In our offices around the world, our employee-led Giving Committees\nselect local organizations to support, often in the form of grants that are primarily funded by the Qualcomm Foundation\n(which was established in 2011 to support charitable giving and volunteerism). We also frequently collaborate with these\norganizations on volunteer activities for our employees. Additionally, during fiscal 2024, thousands of our employees around\nthe world utilized our charitable match program, benefiting more than 1,300 charitable organizations.\nHuman Capital Advancements Linked to our Executive Compensation. The HR and Compensation Committee of our\nBoard will consider human capital advancements in determining our executives’ fiscal 2024 bonus. For fiscal 2024, progress\ntowards human capital advancements serves as a non-financial performance modifier that can adjust the executives’ bonus\npayout by a multiple of 0.9 to 1.1.\nThe foregoing discussion includes information regarding Human Capital matters that we believe may be of interest to\nstockholders generally. We recognize that certain other stakeholders (such as customers, employees and non-governmental\norganizations), as well as certain of our stockholders, may be interested in more detailed information on these topics.

Risk Factors\nYou should consider each of the following factors in evaluating our business and our prospects, any of which could\nnegatively impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and require significant management\ntime and attention. Further, the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and\nuncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also negatively impact our business,\nresults of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and require significant management time and attention. In such\ncases, the trading price of our common stock could decline. You should also consider the other information set forth in this\nAnnual Report in evaluating our business and our prospects, including but not limited to our financial statements and the\nrelated notes, and “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations.” References to “and,” “or” and “and/or” should be read to include the others, as appropriate.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATING BUSINESSES\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from\ntheir sale of premium tier handset devices. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of\nsuch revenues fluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from\ntheir sale of premium tier handset devices, and we expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future. The mobile industry\nis experiencing and may continue to experience concentration of device share among a few companies, particularly at the\npremium tier, contributing to this trend. Certain Chinese original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) have increased and may\ncontinue to increase their device share in China and in certain regions outside of China, and we derive a significant portion of\nour revenues from a small number of these OEMs as well. See also “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 2.\nComposition of Certain Financial Statement Items - Concentrations.”\nIn addition, a number of our largest customers have developed, are developing or may develop their own integrated\ncircuit products, or may choose our competitors’ integrated circuit products, which they have in the past utilized, currently\nutilize and may in the future utilize in some or all of their devices, rather than our products, which could significantly reduce\nthe revenues we derive from these customers. See also the Risk Factor titled “Our business, particularly our semiconductor\nbusiness, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit\nproducts).”\nFurther, political actions, including trade and/or national security protection policies, or other actions by governments,\nparticularly the U.S. and Chinese governments, have in the past, currently are and could in the future limit or prevent us from\ntransacting business with certain of our customers, limit, prevent or discourage those customers from transacting business\nwith us, or make it more expensive to do so, any of which could also significantly reduce the revenues we derive from these\ncustomers. See also the Risk Factor titled “A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of\nsuch concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions.”\nIn addition, we spend a significant amount of engineering and development time, funds and resources in understanding\nour key customers’ feedback and/or specifications and attempt to incorporate such input into our product launches and\ntechnologies. These efforts may not require or result in purchase commitments from such customers or we may have lower\npurchases from such customers than expected, and consequently, we may not achieve the anticipated revenues from these\nefforts, or these efforts may result in non-recoverable costs.\nThe loss of any one of our significant customers, a reduction in the purchases of our products by any of these customers\nor the cancellation of significant purchases by any of these customers, whether due to the use of their own integrated circuit\nproducts or our competitors’ integrated circuit products, government restrictions, a decline in global, regional or local\neconomic conditions, a decline in consumer demand (or a shift in consumer demand away from new devices in favor of\nrefurbished or secondhand devices), elevated inventory levels at our customers or otherwise, would reduce our revenues and\ncould harm our ability to achieve or sustain expected results of operations. A delay of significant purchases, even if only\ntemporary, would reduce our revenues in the period of the delay. Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash\nresources available for other purposes, such as research and development.\nFurther, the concentration of device share among a few companies, and the corresponding purchasing power of these\ncompanies, may result in lower prices for our products, which could have an adverse effect on our revenues and margins. In\naddition, the timing and size of purchases by our significant customers may be impacted by the timing of such customers’\nnew or next generation product introductions, over which we have no control, and the timing and success of such\nintroductions may cause our revenues and results of operations to fluctuate.\nApple purchases our MDM (or thin modem) products, which do not include our integrated application processor\ntechnology, and which have lower revenue and margin contributions than our combined modem and application processor\n18\nproducts. Consequently, to the extent Apple takes device share from our customers who purchase our integrated modem and\napplication processor products, our revenues and margins may be negatively impacted.\nThe mobile industry has also experienced slowing growth in the premium-tier device segment due to, among other\nfactors, a maturing premium-tier smartphone industry in which demand is increasingly driven by new product launches and\ninnovation cycles. A reduction in sales of premium-tier devices, a reduction in sales of our premium-tier integrated circuit\nproducts (which have a higher revenue and margin contribution than our lower-tier integrated circuit products), a shift in\nshare away from OEMs that utilize our premium-tier products, or a shift in consumer demand in favor of refurbished or\nsecondhand devices, would reduce our revenues and margins and may harm our ability to achieve or sustain expected\nfinancial results. Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as\nresearch and development.\nFurther, while we derive a portion of our revenues from areas outside of mobile handsets, e.g., from industries such as\nautomotive and IoT, certain product categories within those industries may in themselves be subject to high levels of\ncustomer concentration.\nAlthough we have more than 300 licensees, we derive a significant portion of our licensing revenues from a limited\nnumber of licensees, which includes a number of Chinese OEMs. In the event that one or more of our significant licensees\nfail to meet their reporting and payment obligations, or we are unable to renew or modify one or more of their license\nagreements under similar terms as their existing agreements, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows would be\nadversely impacted. Moreover, the success of our core licensing business depends in part on the ability of our licensees to\ncontinue to develop, introduce and deliver high-volume products that achieve and sustain customer acceptance. We do not\nhave control over the product development, sales efforts or pricing of products by our licensees, and our licensees might not\nbe successful in these efforts. Reductions in sales of our licensees’ products, or reductions in the average selling prices of\nsuch products without a sufficient increase in the volumes sold, would generally have an adverse effect on our licensing\nrevenues.\nOur business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e.,\ndeveloping their own integrated circuit products).\nCertain of our largest customers (for example, Samsung) develop their own integrated circuit products, which they have\nin the past utilized, and currently utilize, in certain of their devices and we expect will in the future utilize in some or all of\ntheir devices, rather than our products (and they have and may continue to sell their integrated circuit products to third\nparties, discretely or together with certain of their other products, in competition with us).\nApple has utilized modem products of one of our competitors in some of its devices rather than our products, and solely\nutilized one of our competitors’ products in several of its prior device launches. In December 2019, Apple acquired Intel’s\nmodem assets and is developing its own modem products using those assets. Accordingly, we expect Apple to use its own\nmodem products, rather than our products, in some or all of its future devices.\nSimilarly, we derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs. Certain of our customers in China have\ndeveloped, and others may in the future develop, their own integrated circuit products and use such integrated circuit products\nin their devices rather than our integrated circuit products, including due to pressure from or policies of the Chinese\ngovernment (whose Made in China 2025 campaign, announced in 2015, targeted 70% semiconductor self-sufficiency by\n2025), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or\nChinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons. See also the\nRisk Factor titled “A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are\nexacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions.”\nIn addition, periodic supply/capacity constraints within the semiconductor industry may further incentivize our\ncustomers to vertically integrate in an effort to secure additional control over their supply chains.\nIf our customers begin using their own integrated circuit products rather than our products in some or all of their devices,\nor increase their use of their own integrated circuit products from current levels, our business, revenues, results of operations,\ncash flows and financial position could be materially adversely impacted. See also the Risk Factor titled “We derive a\nsignificant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of\npremium tier handset devices. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues\nfluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected.”\nA significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by\nU.S./China trade and national security tensions.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs, and from non-Chinese OEMs that utilize our\nintegrated circuit products in devices they sell into China, which has the largest number of smartphone users in the world. We\nalso source certain critical integrated circuit products from suppliers in China.\nDue to various factors, including pressure, encouragement or incentives from, or policies of, the Chinese government\n(such as its Made in China 2025 campaign), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of\nactual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security\npolicies, or other reasons, some of our customers in China have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own\n19\nintegrated circuit products and use such integrated circuit products in their devices, or use our competitors’ integrated circuit\nproducts in their devices, rather than our products, which could materially harm our business, revenues, results of operations,\ncash flows and financial position. See also the Risk Factor titled “Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may\nsuffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).”\nPolitical actions, including trade protection and national security policies of the U.S. and Chinese governments, such as\ntariffs, bans or placing companies on restricted entity lists, have in the past, currently are and could in the future limit or\nprevent us from transacting business with certain of our Chinese customers or suppliers, limit, prevent or discourage certain\nof our Chinese customers or suppliers from transacting business with us, or make it more expensive to do so. Given our\nrevenue concentration in China, if, due to actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies: we\nwere further limited in, or prohibited from, selling our integrated circuit products to Chinese customers; our non-Chinese\nOEM customers were limited in, or prohibited from, selling devices that incorporate our integrated circuit products into\nChina; Chinese OEMs develop and use their own integrated circuit products or use our competitors’ integrated circuit\nproducts in some or all of their devices rather than our integrated circuit products; Chinese tariffs on our integrated circuit\nproducts or on devices which incorporate our integrated circuit products made purchasing such products or devices more\nexpensive to our Chinese customers or Chinese consumers; or our Chinese licensees delay or cease making payments of\nlicense fees they owe us, our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially\nharmed. Similarly, if, due to U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, we were limited in or prohibited from obtaining\ncritical integrated circuit products from our suppliers in China, or we or our customers were limited in or prohibited from\nselling in the United States products containing technologies with Chinese-origin content, our business, revenues, results of\noperations, cash flows and financial position could be materially harmed. See also the Risk Factors titled “We derive a\nsignificant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of\npremium tier handset devices. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues\nfluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected” and “Our business, particularly our\nsemiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated\ncircuit products).”\nFor example, we previously sold 4G and other integrated circuit products, including Wi-Fi products, but excluding 5G\nproducts, to Huawei under export licenses from the U.S. Department of Commerce. On May 7, 2024, the U.S. Department of\nCommerce informed us that it was revoking our license to export 4G and certain other integrated circuit products to Huawei,\neffective immediately, and we implemented procedures to immediately comply. Accordingly, we do not expect to receive any\nfurther product revenues from Huawei. Product revenues from Huawei in fiscal 2024, prior to our license being revoked on\nMay 7, 2024, were approximately $560 million. Additionally, to the extent that Huawei’s devices take share from Chinese\nOEMs that utilize our products or from non-Chinese OEMs that utilize our products in devices they sell into China, our\nrevenues, results of operations and cash flows could be further impacted.\nFinally, government policies in China that regulate the amount and timing of funds that may flow out of the country have\nimpacted and may continue to impact the timing of our receipt of, and/or ability to receive, payments from our customers and\nlicensees in China, which may negatively impact our cash flows.\nRISKS RELATED TO NEW INITIATIVES\nOur growth depends in part on our ability to extend our technologies and products into new and expanded product areas,\nand industries and applications beyond mobile handsets. Our research, development and other investments in these new\nand expanded product areas, industries and applications, and related technologies and products, as well as in our existing\ntechnologies and products, and new technologies, may not generate operating income or contribute to future results of\noperations that meet our expectations.\nWhile we continue to invest significant resources toward advancements of foundational technologies, including wireless\nconnectivity, high-performance and low-power computing and on-device artificial intelligence (AI), we also invest in new\nand expanded product areas, and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, by utilizing our existing technical and\nbusiness expertise and through acquisitions or other strategic transactions.\nIn particular, our future growth depends in part on new and expanded product areas, and industries and applications\nbeyond mobile handsets, such as automotive and IoT; our ability to develop leading and cost-effective technologies and\nproducts for these new and expanded product areas, industries and applications; and third parties incorporating our\ntechnologies and products into devices used in these product areas, industries and applications. Accordingly, we intend to\ncontinue to make substantial investments in these new and expanded product areas, industries and applications, and in\ndeveloping related products and technologies. Our growth also depends significantly on our ability to develop and patent 5G\nand next-generation wireless technologies, and to develop and commercialize products using these technologies.\nHowever, our research, development and other investments in these new and expanded product areas, industries and\napplications, and corresponding technologies and products, as well as in our existing technologies and products and new\ntechnologies in mobile handsets, may not succeed because, among other reasons: we may not be issued patents on the\ntechnologies we develop; the technologies we develop may not be incorporated into relevant standards; new and expanded\nproduct areas, industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, and consumer demand therein, may not develop or grow\nas anticipated; we may be unable to attract or retain employees with the necessary skills in such new and expanded product\nareas, industries and applications; our strategies or the strategies of our customers, licensees or partners may not be\n20\nsuccessful; alternate technologies or products may be better or may reduce the advantages we anticipate from our\ninvestments; competitors’ technologies or products may be more cost effective, have more capabilities or fewer limitations or\nbe brought to market faster than our new technologies or products; we may not be able to develop, or our competitors may\nhave more established and/or stronger, customer, vendor, distributor or other channel relationships; and competitors may\nhave longer operating histories in industries and applications that are new to us. We may also underestimate the costs of, or\noverestimate the future revenues or margins that could result from, these investments, and these investments may not, or may\ntake many years to, generate material returns.\nFor example, the automotive industry is subject to long design-in time frames, long product life cycles and a high degree\nof regulatory and safety requirements, necessitating suppliers to the industry to comply with stringent qualification processes,\nvery low defect rates and high reliability standards, all of which results in significant barriers to entry and increased costs.\nAdditionally, certain customers have adopted, and other customers may adopt, policies that require us to achieve certain\nsustainability, climate or other environmental, social and governance (ESG)-related targets, such as our 2040 net-zero global\nGHG emissions commitment and our interim GHG emissions reduction goals. If we fail to achieve ESG-related targets that\nmeet our customers’ requirements or expectations, these customers may not purchase products or services from us.\nIf our products fail to perform to specifications, compete with the product quality of our competitors or meet quality or\nregulatory standards (including product safety and information security standards, which may differ by region, geography and\nindustry, and which are particularly stringent in the automotive industry) or other standards (including sustainability or other\nESG-related standards) of a particular industry or application, we may be unable to successfully expand our business in that\nindustry or application, and our growth could be limited.\nIn addition, in order to successfully extend our technologies and products into new and expanded product areas, and\nindustries and applications beyond mobile handsets, we may need to transition to new business models or transform aspects\nof our organization, and we may not be successful in doing so.\nIf we are not successful in extending our technologies and products into new and expanded product areas, and industries\nand applications beyond mobile handsets, if our new technologies and products are not successful, or if we are not successful\nin the time frames we anticipate, we may incur significant costs and asset impairments, our business and revenues may not\ngrow or grow as anticipated, our revenues and margins may be negatively impacted, our stock price may decline and our\nreputation may be harmed.\nWe may engage in acquisitions and other strategic transactions or make investments, or be unable to consummate\nplanned strategic acquisitions, which could adversely affect our results of operations or fail to enhance stockholder value.\nWe engage in acquisitions and other strategic transactions, including joint ventures, and make investments, which we\nbelieve are important to the future of our business. We routinely acquire businesses and other assets, including patents,\ntechnology and other intangible assets, enter into joint ventures or other strategic transactions, and purchase minority equity\ninterests in or make loans to companies, including those that may be private and early-stage. Our strategic activities are\ngenerally focused on opening or expanding opportunities for our products and technologies, supporting the design and\nintroduction of new products (or enhancing existing products) for mobile handsets, and furthering our growth and\ndiversification strategy in industries and applications beyond mobile handsets. Many of our strategic activities entail a high\ndegree of risk and require the use of significant amounts of capital, and investments may not become liquid for several years\nafter the date of the investment, if at all. Our strategic activities may not be successful, generate financial returns or result in\nincreased adoption or continued use of our technologies or products. We may underestimate the costs or overestimate the\nbenefits, including product, revenue, cost and other synergies and growth opportunities that we expect to realize, and we may\nnot achieve those benefits. In some cases, we may be required to consolidate or record our share of the earnings or losses of\ncompanies in which we have acquired ownership or variable interests. In addition, we have in the past recorded, and may in\nthe future record, impairment or other charges related to our strategic activities. Any losses or impairment charges that we\nincur related to strategic activities will have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition, and we\nmay continue to incur new or additional losses related to strategic assets or investments that we have not fully impaired or\nexited.\nAchieving the anticipated benefits of business acquisitions depends in part upon our ability to integrate the businesses in\nan efficient and effective manner and achieve anticipated synergies, and we may not be successful in these efforts. Such\nintegration is complex and time consuming and involves significant challenges, including, among others: retaining key\nemployees; successfully integrating new employees, facilities, technology, products, processes, operations (including supply\nand manufacturing operations), sales and distribution channels, business models and business systems; retaining customers\nand suppliers of the businesses; consolidating research and development operations; minimizing the diversion of\nmanagement’s attention from ongoing business matters; consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures; and\nmanaging the increased scale, complexity and globalization of our business, operations and employee base. We may not\nderive any commercial value from acquired technologies or products or from future technologies or products based on these\ntechnologies, and we may become subject to liabilities, including liabilities arising as a result of litigation, that are not\ncovered by any indemnification protection that we may obtain. Additionally, we may not be successful in entering or\nexpanding into new sales or distribution channels, business or operational models, geographic regions, industries and\napplications served by or adjacent to the associated businesses or in addressing potential new opportunities that may arise out\nof our strategic acquisitions.\n21\nMany of our acquisitions and other strategic investments require approval by the United States and/or foreign\ngovernment agencies. Certain agencies in the past have, and may in the future, deny the transaction or fail to approve in a\ntimely manner, resulting in us not realizing the anticipated benefits of the proposed transaction. Future acquisitions or other\nstrategic investments may be more difficult, complex or expensive to the extent that our reputation for our ability to\nconsummate acquisitions has been or is in the future harmed. Further, if U.S./China relations remain strained, our ability to\nconsummate any transaction that would require approval from the relevant regulatory agency(ies) in China may be severely\nimpacted. In addition, acquisitions that we have completed could subsequently be reviewed and/or challenged by government\nagencies, which could result in fines, penalties or other liability, or requirements to divest all or a portion of an acquired\nbusiness.\nIf we do not achieve the anticipated benefits of business acquisitions or other strategic activities, or if we are unable to\nconsummate acquisitions or strategic investments that we consider important to the future of our business, our business and\nresults of operations may be adversely affected, our growth and diversification strategy may not be successful, our stock price\nmay decline and our reputation may be harmed.\nRISKS RELATED TO SUPPLY AND MANUFACTURING\nWe depend on a limited number of third-party suppliers for the procurement, manufacture, assembly and testing of our\nproducts manufactured in a fabless production model. If we fail to execute supply strategies that provide supply\nassurance, technology leadership and reasonable margins, our business and results of operations may be harmed. We are\nalso subject to order and shipment uncertainties that could negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe primarily utilize a fabless production model, which means that we do not own or operate foundries for the production\nof silicon wafers from which our integrated circuits are made. Other than the facilities we own that manufacture certain of our\nRFFE modules and RF (radio frequency) filter products, we rely on third-party suppliers to perform the manufacturing and\nassembly, and most of the testing, of our integrated circuits. Our suppliers are also responsible for the procurement of most of\nthe raw materials used in the production of our integrated circuits. There are a limited number of such third-party suppliers,\nand even fewer who are capable of manufacturing at the leading process technology nodes, or who are willing to operate at\nolder process technology nodes necessary for certain of our integrated circuit products. The semiconductor manufacturing\nfoundries that supply our products are primarily located in Asia, as are the primary warehouses where we store finished goods\nfor fulfillment of customer orders.\nThe following issues related to our third-party suppliers could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer\ndemand and negatively impact our revenues, business operations, profitability and cash flows:\n• our suppliers’ failure or inability to react to shifts in product demand, including situations where demand for\nintegrated circuits exceeds suppliers’ capacity to meet that demand;\n• a failure or inability by our suppliers to procure raw materials or allocate adequate raw materials for our products, or\nan increase in prices for raw materials or components;\n• an inability to procure or utilize raw materials, components or products from our suppliers due to government\nprohibitions or restrictions on transactions with certain countries and/or companies, and alternative suppliers, raw\nmaterial sources or raw materials are not available or not available in acceptable time frames or upon acceptable\nterms;\n• a failure by our suppliers to allocate adequate manufacturing, assembly or test capacity for our products;\n• our suppliers’ failure or inability to develop or maintain, or a delay in developing or building out, manufacturing\ncapacity for leading process technologies, including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies;\n• the loss of a supplier or the failure or inability of a supplier to meet performance, quality or yield specifications or\ndelivery schedules;\n• additional expense or production delays as a result of qualifying a new supplier and commencing volume production\nor testing in the event of a loss of, or a decision to add or change, a supplier;\n• natural disasters, the effects of climate change, acts of war or other geopolitical conflicts impacting the regions in\nwhich our suppliers and their manufacturing foundries or assembly, test or other facilities are located;\n• health crises, including epidemics or pandemics, and government and business responses thereto, which impact our\nsuppliers, including as a result of quarantines or closures;\n• cyber-attacks on our suppliers’ information technology (IT) systems, including those related to their manufacturing\nfoundries or assembly, test or other facilities;\n• trade or national security protection policies, particularly U.S. or Chinese government policies, that limit or prevent\nus from transacting business with suppliers of critical integrated circuit products, or that limit or prevent such\nsuppliers from transacting business with us or from procuring materials, machinery or technology necessary to\nmanufacture goods for us; and\n• any other reduction, interruption, delay or limitation in our product supply sources.\n22\nWe rely on sole- or limited-source suppliers for certain products, which may exacerbate the risks identified above, and\nsubject us to other significant risks, including poor product performance and reduced control over delivery schedules,\nmanufacturing capability and yields, quality assurance, quantity and costs. While we have established and may in the future\nestablish alternate suppliers for certain products, these suppliers may require significant amounts of time and levels of support\nto bring such products to production, both of which may increase for complex or leading process technologies. As a result,\nwe may invest a significant amount of effort and resources and incur higher costs to support and maintain such alternate\nsuppliers. Further, the elimination or limitation of a foundry supplier’s ability to manufacture components or products for us\ndue to trade or national security protection policies could increase our vulnerability to sole- or limited-source arrangements\nand limit or prevent us from procuring critical components or products from those suppliers. Future consolidation of foundry\nsuppliers could also increase our vulnerability to sole- or limited-source arrangements and reduce our suppliers’ willingness\nto negotiate pricing, which could negatively impact our ability to achieve cost reductions, increase our manufacturing costs\nand limit the amount of capacity available to us. Our arrangements with our suppliers may obligate us to incur costs to\nmanufacture, assemble and test our products that do not decrease at the same rate as decreases in pricing to our customers.\nOur ability, and that of our suppliers, to develop or maintain leading process technologies, including transitions to smaller\ngeometry process technologies (which adds risk to manufacturing yields and reliability), and to effectively compete with the\nmanufacturing processes and performance of our competitors, could impact our ability to introduce new products and meet\ncustomer demand, could increase our costs (possibly decreasing our margins) and could subject us to the risk of excess\ninventories. Any of the above could negatively impact our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nAlthough we have long-term contracts with our suppliers, some of these contracts do not provide for long-term capacity\ncommitments. To the extent we do not have firm commitments from our suppliers over a specific time period or for any\nspecific quantity, our suppliers may allocate, and in the past have allocated, capacity to the manufacture, assembly and testing\nof products for their other customers (including our competitors) while reducing or limiting capacity to manufacture,\nassemble or test our products, and such capacity may be limited based on our suppliers’ ability and willingness to invest in\nthe capital required to manufacture in the leading process technologies. Our suppliers or potential alternate suppliers may also\nmanufacture their own integrated circuits that compete with our products. Such suppliers have in the past allocated and may\nagain allocate raw materials and manufacturing capacity to their own products and reduce or limit the production of our\nproducts. To the extent we do obtain long-term capacity commitments, we may incur additional costs related to those\ncommitments or make non-refundable payments for capacity commitments that are not used. Further, certain of our suppliers\nhave in the past attempted, and may in the future attempt, to unilaterally reduce their capacity commitments to us.\nAccordingly, capacity for our products may not be available when we need it. Finally, we may not receive reasonable pricing,\nmanufacturing or delivery terms from our suppliers, and our ability to obtain favorable terms may be diminished during times\nof high demand and/or limited manufacturing capacity for integrated circuit products.\nWe cannot guarantee that the actions of our suppliers will not cause disruptions in our operations that could harm our\nability to meet our delivery obligations to our customers or increase our cost of sales. To the extent we are unable to obtain\nadequate supply to meet our delivery obligations, we may be obligated to make payments to our customers for such\nshortfalls. From time to time, the global semiconductor industry experiences demand for integrated circuits that exceeds the\nindustry’s capacity to meet that demand. Our ability to meet increased demand for our products has been in the past and may\nin the future be limited due to the inability to obtain the additional manufacturing, assembly and test capacity necessary to\nfully meet such demand. If we are unable to fully meet customer demand, this could result in lost sales opportunities, reduced\nrevenue growth and harm to our customer relationships. These issues may be exacerbated if customers overstate their\nexpected demand requirements in order to procure additional supply, which could negatively impact our ability to forecast\nand to allocate supply appropriately among our customers. The above issues may also be exacerbated with respect to our\nplatform solutions, which already entail a great deal of complexity due to differing lead-times, technologies and suppliers for\neach integrated circuit product included in such solutions. Additionally, our suppliers have in the past and may in the future\nincrease their prices during periods of capacity constraints, or for other reasons, thus increasing our costs. We expect\ntransitions to new generations of leading process technology nodes to continue to drive product cost increases from certain of\nour key semiconductor wafer suppliers, which may negatively impact our margins.\nWe place orders with our suppliers using our and our customers’ forecasts of demand for our products, which are based\non a number of assumptions and estimates. As we move to smaller geometry process technologies, the manufacturing lead-\ntime increases. As a result, the orders we place with our suppliers are generally only partially covered by commitments from\nour customers. If we, or our customers, overestimate demand, or if demand is impacted by factors outside of our or our\ncustomers’ control, and such demand is not covered by a binding commitment from our customers, we may experience\nincreased excess or obsolete inventory or reserve charges, which would negatively impact our results of operations. Further,\nto the extent our customers procure supply of our integrated circuit products beyond their current needs (i.e., build up\ninventory of our integrated circuit products), whether due to concerns over supply, overestimating demand and/or a decline in\nmacroeconomic conditions, or otherwise, they may not purchase expected quantities of our products in subsequent quarters,\nwhich may negatively impact our revenues, results of operations and cash flows in such quarters.\nSee also the Risk Factor below titled “There are numerous risks associated with the operation and control of our\nmanufacturing facilities, including a higher portion of fixed costs relative to a fabless model; environmental compliance and\nliability; impacts related to climate change; exposure to natural disasters, health crises, geopolitical conflicts and cyber-\nattacks; timely supply of equipment and materials; and various manufacturing issues” as similar risks may be applicable to\n23\nour third-party suppliers’ manufacturing facilities, which could result in disruptions to our business or additional costs to us,\nand negatively impact our results of operations.\nThere are numerous risks associated with the operation and control of our manufacturing facilities, including a higher\nportion of fixed costs relative to a fabless model; environmental compliance and liability; impacts related to climate\nchange; exposure to natural disasters, health crises, geopolitical conflicts and cyber-attacks; timely supply of equipment\nand materials; and various manufacturing issues.\nWe operate various facilities that manufacture certain of our RFFE modules and RF filter products. Our manufacturing\nfacilities are characterized by a higher portion of fixed costs relative to a fabless model. We may be faced with a decline in\nthe utilization rates of our manufacturing facilities due to decreases in demand for our products, including in less favorable\nindustry or macroeconomic environments, or due to our failure to win and/or retain designs with OEMs. As a result, from\ntime to time our manufacturing facilities operate at lower capacity levels, while the fixed costs associated with such facilities\ncontinue to be incurred, resulting in lower gross profit.\nWe are subject to many complex environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and rules in each jurisdiction in\nwhich we operate our manufacturing and other facilities. The regulatory landscape in these areas continues to evolve, and we\nanticipate additional laws, regulations and rules in the future. In particular, new, or changes in, environmental and climate\nchange laws, regulations or rules, including relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could lead to new or additional investments\nin production processes and could increase environmental compliance expenditures. In addition, certain environmental laws\nimpose strict, and in certain circumstances joint and several, liability on current or previous owners or operators of real\nproperty, or parties who arranged for hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities, for the cost of\ninvestigation, removal or remediation of hazardous substances. As a result, we may incur clean-up costs in connection with\nany such removal or remediation efforts, as well as other third-party claims in connection with contaminated sites. In\naddition, we could be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or other\nenvironmental damage. If we, or companies or facilities we acquire or have acquired, in the past failed or in the future fail to\ncomply with any such laws and regulations, then we could incur regulatory penalties, fines and legal liabilities; suspension of\nproduction; significant compliance requirements; alteration of our manufacturing, assembly or test processes; restriction on\nour ability to modify or expand our facilities; damage to our reputation; and restrictions on our operations or sales. We are\nalso required to obtain and maintain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations. We\ncannot make assurances that we will at all times be in compliance with such laws, regulations, rules and permits. See also the\nrisk factor titled “Our business may suffer due to the impact of, or our failure to comply with, the various existing, new or\namended laws, regulations, policies or standards to which we are subject.”\nClimate change concerns and the potential resulting environmental impact may result in new environmental, health and\nsafety laws and regulations that may affect us, our suppliers and our customers. Such laws or regulations could cause us to\nincur additional direct costs for compliance, including costs associated with changes to manufacturing processes or the\nprocurement of raw materials used in manufacturing processes, as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our\ncustomers, suppliers or both incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. These costs may adversely impact\nour results of operations and financial condition. In addition, climate change could cause certain natural disasters, such as\ndrought, wildfires, storms, flooding or rising sea levels, to occur more frequently or with greater intensity, which could pose\nphysical risks to our manufacturing facilities or our suppliers’ facilities, could disrupt the availability of water necessary for\nthe operation of such facilities, and could increase or decrease temperatures resulting in increased operating costs and/or\nbusiness disruption.\nWe have manufacturing facilities in Asia and Europe, and the primary warehouses where we store finished goods are\nlocated in Asia. If tsunamis, flooding, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, drought or other natural disasters, effects of climate\nchange, acts of war or other geopolitical conflicts were to damage, destroy or disrupt any of these facilities, it could disrupt\nour operations, cease or delay production and shipments of inventory and result in costly repairs, replacements or other costs\nand lost business. In addition, natural disasters, effects of climate change, acts of war or other geopolitical conflicts may\nresult in disruptions in transportation, distribution channels and supply chains and significant increases in the prices of raw\nmaterials. Further, health crises, including epidemics or pandemics, and government and business responses thereto, could\naffect our manufacturing facilities, including by resulting in quarantines and/or closures, which could result in disruptions to\nand potential closures of our manufacturing operations. Our manufacturing operations could also be disrupted by cyber-\nattacks on our IT systems, as described in the Risk Factor below titled “Our business and operations could suffer in the event\nof security breaches of our IT systems, or other misappropriation of our technology, intellectual property or other\nproprietary or confidential information.”\nOur manufacturing operations depend on securing raw materials, equipment and other supplies in adequate quality and\nquantity in a timely manner from multiple suppliers, and in some cases, we rely on a limited number of suppliers, including in\nsome cases sole suppliers, particularly in Asia. There may be cases where supplies of raw materials, equipment and other\nproducts are interrupted or limited by natural disaster, geopolitical conflict, accident or some other event affecting a supplier\nor source of raw materials; supply is suspended due to quality or other issues; there is a shortage of supply due to a rapid\nincrease in demand; and/or we or our suppliers are prohibited from utilizing certain raw materials, or products or components\nthat incorporate such raw materials, due to government restrictions related to the countries from which such raw materials\noriginate, and acceptable alternative suppliers, raw materials or raw materials sources are not available or not available in\nacceptable time frames or upon acceptable terms, among others, which could impact production and prevent us from\n24\nsupplying our products to our customers. If the supply-demand balance is disrupted, it may considerably increase costs of\nmanufacturing due to increased prices we pay for raw materials. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit\namounts supplied to us or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. Additionally, supply and costs of raw\nmaterials, equipment and other products may be negatively impacted by trade and/or national security protection policies,\nsuch as tariffs, or actions by governments that limit or prevent us from transacting business with certain countries or\ncompanies or that limit or prevent certain companies from transacting business with us, or trade tensions, particularly with\ncountries in Asia. Further, it may be difficult or impossible to substitute one piece of equipment for another or replace one\ntype of material with another. A failure by our suppliers to deliver our requirements could result in disruptions to our\nmanufacturing operations.\nOur manufacturing processes are highly complex, require advanced and costly equipment and must be continuously\nmodified to improve yields and performance. Difficulties in the production process can reduce yields or interrupt production,\nand as a result, we may not be able to deliver our products or do so in a timely, cost-effective or competitive manner. Further,\nto remain competitive and meet customer demand, we may be required to improve our facilities and process technologies and\ncarry out extensive research and development, each of which may require investment of significant amounts of capital and\nmay have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we purchase equipment to meet expected customer demand in advance of any purchase orders or\nlong-term purchase commitments. Further, we typically begin manufacturing our products using our or our customers’\nforecasts of demand for our products, which are based on a number of assumptions and estimates and may not be covered by\nlong-term purchase commitments. As a result, we may incur increased inventory and manufacturing costs and/or record\nimpairment charges to the extent anticipated sales ultimately do not materialize or are lower than expected. If we or our\ncustomers overestimate demand, or if demand is impacted by factors outside of our or our customers’ control, and such\ndemand is not covered by a binding commitment from our customers, we may experience higher inventory carrying and\noperating costs and/or increased excess or obsolete inventory or reserve charges, which would negatively impact our results\nof operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO CYBERSECURITY OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF OUR CRITICAL INFORMATION\nOur business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches of our IT systems, or other misappropriation of\nour technology, intellectual property or other proprietary or confidential information.\nThe successful operation of various functions within our business, as well as the protection of our intellectual property\nand other proprietary or confidential information, depend in part on the security and functionality of our IT systems. Third\nparties regularly attempt to gain unauthorized access to our IT systems, and many such attacks are increasingly more\nsophisticated. These attacks, which might be related to industrial, corporate or other espionage, criminal hackers or state-\nsponsored intrusions, include trying to covertly introduce malware to our computers and networks, including those in our\nmanufacturing operations, exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware, software or other IT infrastructure and impersonating\nauthorized users, among others. We are also subject to ransom-style cyber-attacks, which could expose our confidential or\nproprietary information, demand payment of money and/or impact our IT systems and cause widespread disruption to our\nbusiness, including our manufacturing operations. Third parties that store and/or process our confidential information, or that\nprovide products, software or services used in our IT infrastructure, are subject to similar attacks, which could also result in\nmalware being introduced into our IT infrastructure, e.g., through the third parties’ software and/or software updates. Such\nattacks could result in the misappropriation, theft, misuse, disclosure, loss or destruction of the technology, intellectual\nproperty, or the proprietary, confidential or personal information, of us or our employees, customers, licensees, suppliers or\nother third parties, as well as damage to or disruptions in our IT systems. Any damage to or disruptions in our IT systems as a\nresult of cyber-attacks or for other reasons, such as issues related to third-party software or services used in our IT\ninfrastructure, could significantly disrupt our business operations.\nAlthough we maintain a cybersecurity program to manage cybersecurity risks, as more fully described in the\n“Cybersecurity” section of this Annual Report, we cannot anticipate, detect, repel or implement fully effective preventative\nmeasures against all cybersecurity threats, particularly because the techniques used are increasingly sophisticated and\nconstantly evolving. For example, as AI continues to evolve, cyber-attackers could also use AI to develop malicious code and\nincreasingly sophisticated phishing attempts. As part of our cybersecurity program, we seek to identify and remediate\nvulnerabilities in our IT systems and software (including third party software used in our IT systems) that could be exploited\nby hackers or other malicious actors. However, we may not be aware of all such vulnerabilities, and we may fail to identify\nand/or remediate such vulnerabilities before they are exploited. Attempts to gain unauthorized access to our IT systems or\nother attacks have in the past, in certain instances and to certain degrees, been successful (but have not caused significant\nharm), and may in the future be successful, and in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and\neffects.\nIn addition, employees and former employees, in particular former employees who become employees of our\ncompetitors, customers, licensees or other third parties, including state actors, have in the past and may in the future\nmisappropriate, wrongfully use, publish or provide to our competitors, customers, licensees or other third parties, including\nstate actors, our technology, intellectual property or other proprietary or confidential information. This risk is exacerbated as\ncompetitors for talent, particularly engineering talent, increasingly attempt to hire our employees. See also the Risk Factor\ntitled “We may not be able to attract or retain qualified employees.” Similarly, we provide access to certain of our\ntechnology, intellectual property and other proprietary or confidential information to our direct and indirect customers and\n25\nlicensees and certain of our consultants, who have in the past and may in the future wrongfully use such technology,\nintellectual property or information, or wrongfully disclose such technology, intellectual property or information to third\nparties, including our competitors or state actors. We also provide access to certain of our technology, intellectual property\nand other proprietary or confidential information to certain of our joint venture partners, including those affiliated with state\nactors and including in foreign jurisdictions where ownership restrictions may require us to take a minority ownership interest\nin the joint venture. Such joint venture partners may wrongfully use such technology, intellectual property or information, or\nwrongfully disclose such technology, intellectual property or information to third parties, including our competitors or state\nactors. Our technology, intellectual property and other proprietary or confidential information that we have provided to\ncustomers, licensees or other business partners could also be wrongfully obtained by third parties through cyber-attacks on\nsuch customers’, licensees’ or other business partners’ IT systems.\nThe misappropriation, theft, misuse, disclosure, loss or destruction of the technology, intellectual property, or the\nproprietary, confidential or personal information, of us or our employees, customers, licensees, suppliers or other third\nparties, could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other\nstrategic initiatives, cause us to lose business, damage our reputation, subject us to legal or regulatory proceedings, cause us\nto incur other loss or liability and otherwise adversely affect our business. We expect to continue to devote significant\nresources to the security of our IT systems, and our technology, intellectual property and proprietary and confidential\ninformation.\nFurther, certain countries in which we operate have implemented, and other countries or regions may implement,\ncybersecurity laws that require our overall IT security environment to meet certain standards and/or be certified. Such laws\nmay be complex, ambiguous and subject to interpretation, which may create uncertainty regarding compliance. As a result,\nour efforts to comply with such laws may be expensive and may fail, which could adversely affect our business, results of\noperations and cash flows. In addition, our contracts with certain of our customers require us to obtain cybersecurity\ncertifications for our IT systems. Failure to obtain or maintain the necessary cybersecurity certifications could result in loss of\nfuture revenues, damage to our customer relationships and reputation, and a shift of business to our competitors.\nRISKS RELATED TO HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\nWe may not be able to attract or retain qualified employees.\nOur future success depends upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical\npersonnel, and on our ability to continue to identify, attract, retain and motivate them. Implementing our business strategy\nrequires specialized engineering and other talent, as our revenues are highly dependent on technological and product\ninnovations. In addition, in order to extend our business into certain new and expanded product areas and industries and\napplications beyond mobile handsets, we need to attract, retain and motivate engineering and other technical personnel with\nspecialized skills in these areas, and these skills are in high demand among our competitors. The market for employees in our\nindustry is extremely competitive, and competitors for talent, particularly engineering talent, increasingly attempt to hire, and\nto varying degrees have been successful in hiring, our employees or employment candidates, including by establishing or\nexpanding local offices near our headquarters in San Diego, California. Further, the increased availability of remote working\narrangements has expanded the pool of companies that can compete for our employees and employment candidates. A\nnumber of such competitors for talent are significantly larger than us and/or offer compensation in excess of what we offer or\nother benefits that we do not offer, including remote work policies that may be perceived as more favorable than ours.\nFurther, existing immigration laws make it more difficult for us to recruit and retain highly skilled foreign national graduates\nof universities in the United States, making the pool of available talent even smaller. If we are unable to attract or retain\nqualified employees or fail to maintain employee productivity due to any of the factors described above or for other reasons,\nour business could be adversely impacted.\nRISKS SPECIFIC TO OUR LICENSING BUSINESS\nThe continued and future success of our licensing programs requires us to continue to evolve our patent portfolio and to\nrenew or renegotiate license agreements that are expiring.\nWe own a very strong portfolio of issued and pending patents related to 3G, 4G, 5G and other technologies. It is critical\nthat we continue to evolve our patent portfolio, particularly in 5G and next-generation technologies. If we do not maintain a\nstrong portfolio that is applicable to current and future standards, products and services, our future licensing revenues could\nbe negatively impacted.\nThe patent license agreements that generate a significant portion of our licensing revenues are effective for a specified\nterm. To receive royalties after the expiration date of the specified term, we will need to extend or modify such license\nagreements or enter into new license agreements with the applicable licensees. We might not be able to extend or modify\nlicense agreements, or enter into new license agreements, in the future without negatively affecting the material terms and\nconditions of our license agreements with such licensees, and such modifications or new agreements may negatively impact\nour revenues. In some circumstances, we may extend, modify or enter into new license agreements as a result of arbitration or\nlitigation, and terms imposed by arbitrators or courts may be less favorable to us than existing terms, and may impact the\nfinancial or other terms of license agreements not subject to the litigation or arbitration. If there is a delay in extending,\nmodifying or entering into a new license agreement with a licensee, there would be a delay in our ability to recognize\nrevenues related to that licensee’s product sales. Further, if we are unable to reach agreement on such modifications or new\nagreements, it could result in patent infringement and/or other litigation with such licensees. Finally, certain of our license\n26\nagreements contain binding renewal provisions which provide that if the parties are unable to agree upon the terms and\nconditions of a new license agreement by a specified date, either party may initiate binding arbitration proceedings to\nestablish such terms and conditions, which would become effective immediately after the expiration of the prior agreement.\nNonetheless, in either event, we may not be able to recognize some or any revenues related to that licensee’s product sales\nuntil such new license agreement is finalized.\nEfforts by some OEMs to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalties for the use of our intellectual property may require\nthe investment of substantial management time and financial resources and may result in legal decisions or actions by\ngovernments, courts, regulators or agencies, Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) or other industry\norganizations that harm our business.\nFrom time to time, companies initiate various strategies to attempt to negotiate, renegotiate, reduce and/or eliminate their\nneed to pay royalties to us for the use of our intellectual property. These strategies have included: (i) litigation, often alleging\ninfringement of patents held by such companies, patent misuse, patent exhaustion, patent invalidity or unenforceability of our\npatents or licenses, alleging that we do not license our patents on fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory (FRAND) terms, or\nalleging some form of unfair competition or competition law violation; (ii) taking positions contrary to our understanding\n(and/or the plain language) of their contracts with us; (iii) appeals to governmental authorities; (iv) collective action,\nincluding working with wireless operators, standards bodies, other like-minded companies and organizations, on both formal\nand informal bases, to adopt intellectual property policies and practices that could have the effect of limiting returns on\nintellectual property innovations; (v) lobbying governmental regulators and elected officials for the purpose of seeking the\nreduction of royalty rates or the base on which royalties are calculated, seeking to impose some form of compulsory licensing\nor weakening a patent holder’s ability to enforce its rights or obtain a fair return for such rights; and (vi) attempts by licensees\nto shift their royalty obligation to their suppliers in order to make royalty collection more difficult or reduce the amount of\nroyalties collected.\nIn addition, certain licensees have disputed, underreported, underpaid, not reported or not paid royalties owed to us under\ntheir license agreements or reported to us in a manner that is not in compliance with their contractual obligations, and certain\ncompanies have yet to enter into or have delayed entering into or renewing license agreements with us for their use of our\nintellectual property, and they or others may engage in such behavior in the future. The fact that one or more licensees\ndispute, underreport, underpay, do not report or do not pay royalties owed to us may encourage other licensees to take similar\nactions or not renew their existing license agreements, and may encourage other licensees or unlicensed companies to delay\nentering into, or to not enter into, new license agreements. Further, to the extent such licensees and companies increase their\ndevice share, the negative impact of their underreporting, underpayment, non-payment or non-reporting on our business,\nrevenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition will be exacerbated.\nWe have been in the past and are currently subject to various litigation and/or governmental investigations and\nproceedings. Certain of these matters are described in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\nNote 7. Commitments and Contingencies.” We may become subject to other litigation or governmental investigations or\nproceedings in the future. Additionally, certain of our direct and indirect customers and licensees have pursued, and others\nmay in the future pursue, litigation or arbitration against us related to our business. Unfavorable resolutions of one or more of\nthese matters have had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, results of operations,\ncash flows and financial condition. See also the Risk Factors below titled “Changes in our patent licensing practices,\nwhether due to governmental investigations, legal challenges or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results\nof operations” and “Our business may suffer as a result of adverse rulings in governmental investigations or proceedings or\nother legal proceedings.”\nIn addition, in connection with our participation in SDOs, we, like other patent owners, generally have made contractual\ncommitments to such organizations to license those of our patents that would necessarily be infringed by standard-compliant\nproducts as set forth in those commitments (referred to as standard-essential patents). Some manufacturers and users of\nstandard-compliant products advance interpretations of these commitments that are adverse to our licensing business,\nincluding interpretations that would limit the amount of royalties that we could collect on the licensing of our standard-\nessential patent portfolio.\nFurther, some third parties have proposed significant changes to existing intellectual property policies for\nimplementation by SDOs and other industry organizations with the goal of significantly devaluing standard-essential patents.\nFor example, some have put forth proposals which would require a maximum aggregate intellectual property royalty rate for\nthe use of all standard-essential patents owned by all of the member companies to be applied to the selling price of any\nproduct implementing the relevant standard. They have further proposed that such maximum aggregate royalty rate be\napportioned to each member company with standard-essential patents based upon the number of standard-essential patents\nheld by such company. Others have proposed that injunctions should not be an available remedy for infringement of\nstandard-essential patents and have made proposals that could severely limit damage awards and other remedies by courts for\npatent infringement (e.g., by limiting the base upon which the royalty rate may be applied). A number of these strategies are\npurportedly based on interpretations of the policies of certain SDOs concerning the licensing of patents that are or may be\nessential to industry standards and on our (or other companies’) alleged failure to abide by these policies.\nSome SDOs, courts and governmental agencies have adopted, and may in the future adopt, some or all of these\ninterpretations or proposals in a manner adverse to our interests, including in litigation to which we may not be a party.\nFurther, SDOs in certain countries may attempt to modify widely accepted standards and claim the resulting standard as their\n27\nown. In addition, governments may enact policies concerning standard-essential patents, such as the European Commission’s\nproposed regulations which would create a new regulatory scheme for standard-essential patents, that may have various\nconsequences, some of which may be detrimental, such as by devaluing standard-essential patents or disrupting worldwide\ntechnology standards. Other jurisdictions may adopt similar regulatory schemes, which could also have such effects.\nWe expect that such proposals, interpretations and strategies will continue in the future, and if successful, our business\nmodel would be harmed, either by limiting or eliminating our ability to collect royalties (or by reducing the royalties we can\ncollect) on all or a portion of our standard-essential patent portfolio, limiting our return on investment with respect to new\ntechnologies, limiting our ability to seek injunctions against infringers of our standard-essential patents, constraining our\nability to make licensing commitments when submitting our technologies for inclusion in future standards (which could make\nour technologies less likely to be included in such standards) or forcing us to work outside of SDOs or other industry groups\nto promote our new technologies, and our revenues, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. In\naddition, the legal and other costs associated with asserting or defending our positions have been and may in the future be\nsignificant. We expect that such challenges, regardless of their merits, will continue into the foreseeable future and will\nrequire the investment of substantial management time and financial resources.\nDue to the higher margin contribution of our licensing business relative to our chipset business, any reduction in\nlicensing revenues could have a disproportionate impact on the cash resources we have available for other purposes, such as\nresearch and development.\nChanges in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations, legal challenges or otherwise,\ncould adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nAs described in the Risk Factor below titled “Our business may suffer as a result of adverse rulings in governmental\ninvestigations or proceedings or other legal proceedings,” we have been in the past, currently are and may in the future be\nsubject to various governmental investigations and/or legal proceedings challenging our patent licensing practices. Certain of\nthese matters are described in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and\nContingencies.” We believe that one intent of certain of these governmental investigations and legal proceedings has been to\nreduce the amount of royalties that licensees are required to pay to us for their use of our intellectual property.\nIf we were required to reduce the royalty rates in our patent license agreements, our revenues, earnings and cash flows\nwould be negatively impacted absent a sufficient increase in the volume of sales of devices upon which royalties are paid.\nSimilarly, if we were required to reduce the base on which our royalties are calculated (e.g., license at the chipset level rather\nthan at the device level), our revenues, earnings and cash flows would be negatively impacted unless there was a sufficient\nincrease in the volume of sales of devices upon which royalties are paid or we were able to increase our royalty rates to offset\nthe decrease in revenues resulting from such lower royalty base.\nIf we were required to grant patent licenses to chipset manufacturers or other component suppliers (which could lead to\nimplementing a more complex, multi-level licensing structure in which we license certain portions of our patent portfolio to\nchipset manufacturers or other component suppliers and other portions to OEMs), we would incur additional transaction\ncosts, which may be significant, and we could incur delays in recognizing revenues until license negotiations were completed.\nIn addition, our licensing revenues and earnings would be negatively impacted if we were not able to obtain, in the aggregate,\nequivalent revenues under such a multi-level licensing structure.\nIf we were required to sell chipsets to OEMs that do not have a license to our patents, our licensing programs could be\nnegatively impacted by patent exhaustion claims raised by such unlicensed OEMs (i.e., claims that our sale of chipsets to\nsuch OEMs forecloses us from asserting any patents substantially embodied by the chipsets against such OEMs). Such sales\ncould provide OEMs with a defense in the event we asserted our patents against them to obtain licensing revenue for those\npatents. Moreover, such a requirement could negatively impact our ability to maintain our licensing program for products that\ndo not use our chipsets. This could have a material adverse effect on our licensing programs and our results of operations,\ncash flows and financial condition.\nTo the extent that we were required to implement any of these licensing and/or business practices, including by\nmodifying or renegotiating our existing license agreements or pursuing other commercial arrangements, we would incur\nadditional transaction costs, which may be significant, we could incur delays in recognizing revenues until license\nnegotiations were completed, and our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be\nharmed. The impact of any such changes to our licensing practices could vary widely and by jurisdiction, depending on the\nspecific outcomes and the geographic scope of such outcomes. In addition, if we were required to make modifications to our\nlicensing practices in one jurisdiction, licensees or governmental agencies in other jurisdictions may attempt to obtain similar\noutcomes for themselves or for such other jurisdictions, as applicable, which could result in increased legal costs and further\nharm to our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n28\nRISKS RELATED TO REGULATORY AND LEGAL CHALLENGES\nOur business may suffer as a result of adverse rulings in governmental investigations or proceedings or other legal\nproceedings.\nWe have been in the past and currently are subject to various governmental investigations and/or legal proceedings.\nCertain of these matters are described in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7.\nCommitments and Contingencies.” Key allegations or findings in those matters include or have in the past included, among\nothers: that we violate FRAND licensing commitments by refusing to grant licenses to chipset manufacturers; that our royalty\nrates are too high; that the base on which our royalties are calculated should be something less than the wholesale (i.e.,\nlicensee’s) selling price of the applicable device (minus certain permitted deductions); that we unlawfully require customers\nto execute a patent license before we sell them cellular modem chipsets; that we have entered into exclusive agreements with\nchipset customers that foreclose competition; that we leverage our position in baseband chipsets in the RFFE space; and that\nwe violate antitrust laws and engage in anticompetitive conduct and unfair methods of competition. We may become subject\nto other litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings in the future.\nUnfavorable resolutions of one or more of these matters have had and could in the future have a material adverse effect\non our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Depending on the matter, various\nremedies that could result from an unfavorable resolution include, among others: the loss of our ability to enforce one or\nmore of our patents; injunctions; monetary damages, fines or other orders to pay money; the issuance of orders to cease\ncertain conduct or modify our business practices, such as requiring us to reduce our royalty rates, reduce the base on which\nour royalties are calculated, grant patent licenses to chipset manufacturers or other component suppliers, sell chipsets to\nunlicensed OEMs or modify or renegotiate some or all of our existing license agreements; and determinations that some or all\nof our license agreements are invalid or unenforceable. In addition, a governmental body in a particular country or region\nmay successfully assert and impose remedies with effects that extend beyond the borders of that country or region. If some or\nall of our license agreements are declared invalid or unenforceable and/or we are required to renegotiate these license\nagreements, we may not receive, or may not be able to recognize, some or any licensing or royalty revenues under the\nimpacted license agreements unless and until we enter into new license agreements; and even licensees whose license\nagreements are not impacted may demand to renegotiate their agreements or invoke the dispute resolution provision in their\nagreements, and we may not be able to recognize some or any revenues under such agreements. The renegotiation of license\nagreements could result in terms that are less favorable to us than existing terms, or lead to arbitration or litigation to resolve\nthe licensing terms, which could also be less favorable to us than existing terms, and each of which could take months or\nyears. Licensees may underreport, underpay, not report or not pay royalties owed to us pending the conclusion of such\nnegotiations, arbitration or litigation. In addition, we may be sued for alleged overpayments of past royalties paid to us,\nincluding private antitrust actions seeking treble damages under U.S. antitrust laws. The occurrence of any of the above could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and our\nstock price could decline, possibly significantly, in which case we may have to significantly cut costs and other uses of cash,\nincluding in research and development, significantly impairing our ability to maintain product and technology leadership and\ninvest in next generation technologies. Further, depending on the breadth and severity of the circumstances above, we may\nhave to reduce, suspend or eliminate our capital return programs, and our ability to timely pay our indebtedness may be\nimpacted.\nThese challenges have required, and may in the future require, the investment of significant management time and\nattention and have resulted, and may in the future result, in significant legal costs.\nRISKS RELATED TO INDUSTRY DYNAMICS AND COMPETITION\nOur revenues depend on our customers’ and licensees’ sales of products and services based on CDMA, OFDMA and\nother communications technologies, including 5G, and customer demand for our products based on these technologies.\nWe develop, patent and commercialize technology and products based on CDMA, OFDMA and other communications\ntechnologies, which are primarily wireless. We depend on our customers and licensees to develop devices and services based\non these technologies to drive consumer demand for such devices, and to establish the selling prices for such devices (which\nimpact the amount of royalties we receive for certain devices). Further, the timing of our shipments of our products is\ndependent on the timing of our customers’ and licensees’ deployments of new devices and services based on these\ntechnologies. Increasingly, we also depend on operators of wireless networks, our customers and licensees and other third\nparties to incorporate these technologies into new device types and into industries and applications beyond mobile handsets,\nsuch as automotive and IoT, among others.\nOur revenues and growth in revenues could be negatively impacted, our business may be harmed and our substantial\ninvestments in these technologies may not provide us an adequate return, if: our customers’ and licensees’ sales of products,\nparticularly premium-tier handset products, and services using these technologies, or average selling prices of such products,\ndecline due to, for example, the maturity of smartphone penetration in developed regions, including China; we do not\ncontinue to maintain our intellectual property and technical leadership in 5G, including in ongoing 5G standardization efforts,\nor we fail to establish such leadership in future generations of wireless technology; we are unable to drive the adoption of our\nproducts into networks and devices, including devices beyond mobile handsets; consumers’ rates of replacement of\nsmartphones and other devices decline; or there is a shift in consumer demand away from new devices in favor of refurbished\nor secondhand devices.\n29\nOur industry is subject to intense competition in an environment of rapid technological change. Our success depends in\npart on our ability to adapt to such change and compete effectively; and such change and competition could result in\ndecreased demand for our products and technologies or declining average selling prices for our products or those of our\ncustomers or licensees.\nOur products and technologies face significant competition. Competition may intensify as our current competitors\nexpand their product offerings, improve their products or reduce the prices of their products as part of a strategy to maintain\nexisting business and customers or attract new business and customers, as new opportunities develop, and as new competitors\nenter the industry. Competition in the semiconductor industry is affected by various factors that include, among others: OEM\nconcentrations; vertical integration; competition in certain geographic regions; government intervention or support of national\nindustries or competitors; the ability to maintain product differentiation in light of evolving industry standards and speed of\ntechnological change (including the transition to smaller geometry process technologies, the demand for always on, always\nconnected capabilities, the increasing use of AI and machine learning technologies and the need to run complex AI-based\napplications on devices); access to capacity in the supply chain; and value-added features that drive selling prices and\nconsumer demand for new devices.\nWe anticipate that additional competitors will introduce products as a result of growth opportunities in the industries in\nwhich we operate, the trend toward global expansion by foreign and domestic competitors, and technological and public\npolicy changes. Additionally, the semiconductor industry has experienced and may continue to experience consolidation,\nwhich could result in significant changes to the competitive landscape. For example, if any key supplier of technologies and\nintellectual property to the semiconductor industry was sold to one of our competitors, it could negatively affect our ability to\nprocure or license such technologies and intellectual property in the future, at all or upon acceptable terms, which could have\nwide-ranging impacts on our business and operations.\nWe expect that our future success will depend on, among other factors, our ability to:\n• differentiate our integrated circuit products with innovative technologies across multiple products and features (e.g.,\nmodem, RFFE including millimeter wave (mmWave), graphics and other processors, camera, connectivity and on-\ndevice AI) and with smaller geometry process technologies that drive both performance and lower power\nconsumption;\n• develop and offer integrated circuit products at competitive cost and price points and to effectively cover all\ngeographic regions and all device tiers;\n• continue to be a leader in mobile, and drive the adoption of our technologies and integrated circuit products into the\nmost popular device models and across a broad spectrum of devices in mobile, such as smartphones, tablets, PCs\nand other mobile computing devices;\n• increase or accelerate adoption of our technologies and products in industries and applications outside of mobile\nhandsets, including automotive and IoT;\n• maintain or accelerate demand for our integrated circuit products at the premium device tier, while also driving the\nadoption of our products into high, mid- and low-tier devices across all regions;\n• remain a leader in 5G technology development, standardization, intellectual property creation and licensing, and\ndevelop, commercialize and remain a leading supplier of 5G integrated circuit products, including RFFE products;\n• maintain access to sufficient capacity in the supply chain relative to our competitors to meet customer demand;\n• create standalone value and contribute to the success of our existing businesses through acquisitions, joint ventures\nand other strategic transactions, and by developing customer, licensee, vendor, distributor and other channel\nrelationships in new industries and applications;\n• identify potential acquisition targets that will grow or sustain our business or address strategic needs, reach\nagreement on terms acceptable to us, close the transactions and effectively integrate these new businesses, products,\ntechnologies and employees;\n• provide leading products and technologies to OEMs, high level operating systems (HLOS) providers, operators,\ncloud providers and other industry participants as competitors, new industry entrants and other factors continue to\naffect the industry landscape;\n• be a preferred partner and sustain preferred relationships providing integrated circuit products that support multiple\noperating system and infrastructure platforms to industry participants that effectively commercialize new devices\nusing these platforms; and\n• continue to develop brand recognition to effectively compete against better known companies in computing and\nother consumer driven segments and to deepen our presence in significant emerging regions.\nWe compete with many different semiconductor companies, ranging from multinational companies with integrated\nresearch and development, manufacturing, sales and marketing organizations across a broad spectrum of product lines, to\ncompanies that are focused on a single application, industry or standard product, including those that produce products for\n30\nmobile handsets, automotive or IoT, among others. Most of these competitors compete with us with respect to some, but not\nall, of our businesses or product lines. Companies that design integrated circuits based on CDMA, OFDMA, Wi-Fi or their\nderivatives are generally competitors or potential competitors. Examples (some of which are strategic partners of ours in\nother areas) include Broadcom, HiSilicon, MediaTek, Mobileye, Nvidia, NXP Semiconductors, Qorvo, Samsung, Skyworks,\nTexas Instruments and UNISOC. Some of these current and potential competitors may have advantages over us that include,\namong others: motivation by our customers in certain circumstances to use our competitors’ integrated circuit products, to\nutilize their own internally-developed integrated circuit products and/or sell such products to others, or to utilize alternative\ntechnologies; lower cost structures or a willingness and ability to accept lower prices or lower margins for their products,\nparticularly in China; foreign government support of other technologies, competitors or OEMs that sell devices that do not\ncontain our integrated circuit products; better known brand names; ownership and control of manufacturing facilities and\ngreater expertise in manufacturing processes; the development and sale of infrastructure equipment for wireless networks,\nwhich may enable such competitors to better optimize their integrated circuit products for performance on those networks;\nmore extensive relationships with local distribution companies and OEMs in certain geographic regions (such as China);\nmore experience in industries and applications beyond mobile handsets (such as automotive and IoT); and a more established\npresence in certain regions.\nIn addition, certain of our largest customers have in the past utilized, currently utilize and may in the future utilize our\ncompetitors’ integrated circuit products in some or all of their devices, rather than our products. Further, certain of those\ncustomers, such as Apple and Samsung, have developed, are developing or may develop their own integrated circuit products\n(effectively making them competitors), which they have in the past utilized, currently utilize or may in the future utilize in\nsome or all of their devices, rather than our products. See also the Risk Factor titled “Our business, particularly our\nsemiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated\ncircuit products).”\nFurther, political actions, including trade and/or national security protection policies, or other actions by governments,\nparticularly the U.S. and Chinese governments, have in the past, currently are and could in the future limit or prevent us from\ntransacting business with certain of our customers or suppliers; limit, prevent or discourage certain of our customers or\nsuppliers from transacting business with us; or make it more expensive to do so. This could advantage our competitors by\nenabling them with increased sales, economies of scale, operating income and/or cash flows, and/or enabling critical\ntechnology transfer, allowing them to increase their investments in technology development, research and development, and\ncommercialization of products. See also the Risk Factor titled “A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China,\nand the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions.”\nCompetition in any or all product areas or device tiers may result in the loss of business or customers, which would\nnegatively impact our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Such competition may\nalso reduce average selling prices for our chipset products or the products of our customers and licensees. Certain of these\ndynamics are particularly pronounced in emerging regions and China where competitors may have lower cost structures or\nmay have a willingness and ability to accept lower prices or lower margins on their products. Reductions in the average\nselling prices of our chipset products, without a corresponding increase in volumes, would negatively impact our revenues,\nand without corresponding decreases in average unit costs, would negatively impact our margins. In addition, reductions in\nthe average selling prices of our licensees’ products, unless offset by an increase in volumes, would generally decrease total\nroyalties payable to us, negatively impacting our licensing revenues.\nRISKS RELATED TO PRODUCT DEFECTS OR SECURITY VULNERABILITIES\nFailures in our products, or in the products of our customers or licensees, including those resulting from security\nvulnerabilities, defects or errors, could harm our business.\nOur products are complex and may contain defects, errors or security vulnerabilities, or experience failures or\nunsatisfactory performance, due to any number of issues, including issues in materials, design, fabrication, packaging and/or\nuse within a system. Development of products in new domains of technology, and the migration to integrated circuit\ntechnologies with smaller geometric feature sizes, increases complexity and adds risk to manufacturing yields and reliability,\nand increases the likelihood of product defects, errors or security vulnerabilities. Defects, errors, security vulnerabilities or\nother unintended functionality could also be introduced into our products by cyber-attacks or other actions by malicious\nactors, either directly or through third-party products or software used in our products or IT infrastructure. Further, because of\nthe complexity of our products, defects, errors or security vulnerabilities might only be detected when the products are in use.\nRisks associated with product or technology defects, errors or security vulnerabilities are exacerbated by the fact that our\ncustomers typically integrate our products into consumer and other devices, including motor vehicles or motor vehicle\nsystems. We routinely monitor for and assess security vulnerabilities in our products and offer remediation measures if\nappropriate. However, we may not be aware of all such vulnerabilities, and we may fail to identify and/or provide\nremediation measures for vulnerabilities (or our customers may fail to implement remediation measures) before they are\nexploited.\nOur products may be used in devices that interact with untrusted systems or otherwise access untrusted content, which\ncreates a risk of exposing the system hardware and software in those devices to malicious attacks. Further, security\nvulnerabilities in our products or the technologies we use could expose our customers, or end users of our customers’\nproducts, to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy malware that could attack our products or\nour customers’ products or IT infrastructure. Such attacks could result in the disruption of our customers’ businesses or the\n31\nmisappropriation, theft, misuse, disclosure, loss or destruction of the technology or intellectual property, or the proprietary,\nconfidential or personal information, of our customers, their employees or the end users of our customers’ devices. While we\ncontinue to focus on this issue and take measures to safeguard our products from cybersecurity threats, device capabilities\ncontinue to evolve, enabling more elaborate functionality and applications, and increasing the risk of security failures, and\ntechniques used to perpetrate cybersecurity attacks are increasingly sophisticated and constantly evolving. See also the Risk\nFactor titled “Our business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches of our IT systems, or other\nmisappropriation of our technology, intellectual property or other proprietary or confidential information.”\nOur products may be responsible for critical functions in our customers’ products and networks. Failure of our products\nto perform to specifications, meet certain regulatory or industry standards (including product safety and information security\nstandards, which may differ by region, geography and industry, and which are particularly stringent in the automotive\nindustry), or other product defects, errors or security vulnerabilities, could lead to substantial damage to the products we sell\nto our customers, the devices into which our products are integrated and the end users of such devices, and potentially to our\ncustomers’ IT infrastructure. Such defects, errors or security vulnerabilities could give rise to significant costs, including\ncosts related to developing solutions, recalling products or participating in customer recalls (for example, in the automotive\nindustry), repairing or replacing defective products, writing down defective inventory or indemnification obligations under\nour agreements, and could result in the loss of sales and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product\ndevelopment efforts. In addition, defects, errors or security vulnerabilities in our products could result in failure to achieve\nmarket acceptance, a loss of design wins, a shifting of business to our competitors, and litigation or regulatory actions against\nus, and could harm our reputation, our relationships with customers and partners and our ability to attract new customers, as\nwell as the perceptions of our brand. Other potential adverse impacts of product defects, errors or security vulnerabilities\ninclude shipment delays, write-offs of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, and losses on unfavorable\npurchase commitments. In addition, defects, errors or security vulnerabilities in the products of our customers or licensees\ncould cause a delay or decrease in demand for the products into which our products are integrated, and thus for our products.\nIn addition, the occurrence of defects, errors or security vulnerabilities may give rise to product liability or other\ncommercial claims, particularly if such defects, errors or security vulnerabilities in our products or the technology we use, or\nthe products into which they are integrated, result in personal injury or death, or customer field actions (for example, in the\nautomotive industry, where such term means automotive product-related service actions or repairs for defects, whether\nsafety-related or not). If a product liability or other commercial claim is brought against us, the cost of defending the claim\ncould be significant, and could divert the attention of our technical and management personnel and harm our business, even if\nwe are successful. We may be named in product liability claims even if there is no evidence that our products caused the\ndamage in question, and even though we may have indemnity from our customers, and such claims could result in significant\ncosts and expenses. We may also be required to indemnify and/or defend our customers from product liability claims relating\nto our products. Further, our business liability insurance may be inadequate, may not cover the claims, and future coverage\nmay be unavailable on acceptable terms, which could adversely impact our financial results. The above is exacerbated by the\nfact that our products may be used, and perform critical functions, in various high-risk applications such as: automobiles,\nincluding ADAS/AD functions; cameras and artificial intelligence, including home and enterprise security; home automation,\nincluding smoke and noxious gas detectors; medical condition monitoring; location and asset tracking and management,\nincluding wearables for child safety and elderly health; robotics, including public safety drones and autonomous municipality\nvehicles; and XR for treatment of phobias or PTSD, early detection of disorders or special needs, among others.\nAccordingly, defects, errors or security vulnerabilities in our products or the technologies we use could have an adverse\nimpact on us, on our customers and the end users of our customers’ products. If any of these risks materialize, there could be\na material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRISKS RELATED TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nThe enforcement and protection of our intellectual property may be expensive, could fail to prevent misappropriation or\nunauthorized use of our intellectual property, could result in the loss of our ability to enforce one or more patents, and\ncould be adversely affected by changes in patent laws, by laws in certain foreign jurisdictions that may not effectively\nprotect our intellectual property and by ineffective enforcement of laws in such jurisdictions.\nWe rely primarily on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality\nagreements, international treaties and other methods, to protect our intellectual property, including our patent portfolio.\nPolicing unauthorized use of our products, technologies and intellectual property is difficult and time consuming. The steps\nwe have taken have not always prevented, and we cannot be certain the steps we take in the future will prevent, the\nmisappropriation or unauthorized use of our products, technologies or intellectual property, particularly in foreign countries\nwhere the laws may not protect our rights as fully or as readily as U.S. laws or where the enforcement of such laws may be\nlacking or ineffective. See also the Risk Factor titled “Our business and operations could suffer in the event of security\nbreaches of our IT systems, or other misappropriation of our technology, intellectual property or other proprietary or\nconfidential information.”\nSome industry participants who have a vested interest in devaluing patents in general, or standard-essential patents in\nparticular, have mounted attacks on certain patent systems, increasing the likelihood of changes to established patent laws.\nWe cannot predict with certainty the long-term effects of any potential changes. In the United States, Europe (including the\nUnited Kingdom), India, China and elsewhere, there is continued discussion regarding potential patent law changes, and there\nis current and potential future litigation regarding patents, the outcomes of which could be detrimental to our licensing\n32\nbusiness. Some proposed changes would apply to only standard-essential patents, and such changes may substantially alter\nthe incentives to participate in standardization or develop standards-compliant products. See also the Risk Factor entitled\n“Efforts by some OEMs to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalties for the use of our intellectual property may require the\ninvestment of substantial management time and financial resources and may result in legal decisions or actions by\ngovernments, courts, regulators or agencies, Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) or other industry organizations\nthat harm our business.”\nFurther, the laws in certain foreign countries in which our patents are or may be licensed, or our products are or may be\nmanufactured or sold, including certain countries in Asia, may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent\nas the laws in the United States. In addition, we cannot be certain that the laws and policies of any country or the practices of\nany standards bodies, foreign or domestic, with respect to intellectual property enforcement or licensing or the adoption of\nstandards, will not be changed in the future in ways that are detrimental to our licensing programs or to the sale or use of our\nproducts or technologies.\nWe have had and may in the future have difficulty in certain circumstances in protecting or enforcing our intellectual\nproperty and contracts, including collecting royalties for use of our patent portfolio due to, among others: refusal by certain\nlicensees to report and pay all or a portion of the royalties they owe to us; policies or political actions of governments,\nincluding trade protection and national security policies; challenges to our licensing practices under competition laws;\nadoption of mandatory licensing provisions by foreign jurisdictions; failure of foreign courts to recognize and enforce\njudgments of contract breach and damages issued by courts in the United States; and challenges before competition agencies\nto our licensing business or the pricing and integration of additional features and functionality into our chipset products. See\nalso the Risk Factors titled “Efforts by some OEMs to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalties for the use of our\nintellectual property may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resources and may result in\nlegal decisions or actions by governments, courts, regulators or agencies, Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) or\nother industry organizations that harm our business” and “Our business may suffer as a result of adverse rulings in\ngovernmental investigations or proceedings or other legal proceedings.”\nWe have engaged in litigation and arbitration in the past, are currently engaged in litigation, and may need to further\nlitigate or arbitrate in the future to enforce our contract and/or intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or\ndetermine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others. As a result of such litigation or arbitration, we could lose our\nability to enforce one or more patents, portions of our license agreements could be determined to be invalid or unenforceable\n(which may in turn result in other licensees either not complying with their existing license agreements or initiating litigation\nor arbitration), license terms (including but not limited to royalty rates for the use of our intellectual property) could be\nimposed that are less favorable to us than existing terms, and we could incur substantial costs. Actions we take to enforce our\ncontract or intellectual property rights could be costly and could absorb significant management time and attention, which, in\nturn, could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows. Further, even a positive resolution to our enforcement\nefforts may take time to conclude, which may reduce our revenues and cash resources available for other purposes, such as\nresearch and development, in the periods prior to conclusion.\nAdditionally, although our license agreements generally provide us with the right to audit the books and records of\nlicensees, audits can be expensive, time consuming, incomplete and subject to dispute. Further, certain licensees may not\ncomply with the obligation to provide full access to their books and records. To the extent we do not aggressively enforce our\nrights under our license agreements, licensees may not comply with their existing license agreements, and to the extent we do\nnot aggressively pursue unlicensed companies to enter into license agreements with us for their use of our intellectual\nproperty, other unlicensed companies may not enter into license agreements.\nSee also the Risk Factors titled “Efforts by some OEMs to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalties for the use of our\nintellectual property may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resources and may result in\nlegal decisions or actions by governments, courts, regulators or agencies, Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) or\nother industry organizations that harm our business” and “Our business and operations could suffer in the event of security\nbreaches of our IT systems, or other misappropriation of our technology, intellectual property or other proprietary or\nconfidential information.”\nClaims by other companies that we infringe their intellectual property could adversely affect our business.\nFrom time to time, companies have asserted, and may again assert, patent, copyright, trademark or other intellectual\nproperty claims against us relating to our technologies or products, including those we have acquired from other companies.\nThese claims have resulted and may again result in our involvement in litigation, and we are currently involved in such\nlitigation, including certain matters described in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7.\nCommitments and Contingencies.” We may not prevail in such litigation given, among other factors, the complex technical\nissues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If any of our products were found to infringe another\ncompany’s intellectual property, we could be subject to an injunction or be required to redesign our products, or to license\nsuch intellectual property or pay damages or other compensation to such other company (any of which could be costly). If we\nare unable to redesign our products, license such intellectual property used in our products or otherwise distribute our\nproducts (e.g., through a licensed supplier), we could be prohibited from making and selling our products. Similarly, our\nsuppliers could be found to infringe another company’s intellectual property, and such suppliers could then be enjoined from\nproviding products or services to us.\n33\nIn any potential dispute involving us and another company’s patents, copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual\nproperty, our chipset foundries, semiconductor assembly and test providers and customers could also become the targets of\nlitigation. We are contingently liable under certain product sales, services, license and other agreements to indemnify certain\ncustomers, chipset foundries and semiconductor assembly and test service providers against certain types of liability and\ndamages arising from qualifying claims of patent infringement by products sold by us, or by intellectual property provided by\nus to our chipset foundries and semiconductor assembly and test service providers. Reimbursements under indemnification\narrangements could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, litigation could severely\ndisrupt the supply of our products and the businesses of our chipset customers and their customers, which in turn could harm\nour relationships with them and could result in a decline in our chipset sales or a reduction in our licensees’ sales, causing a\ncorresponding decline in our chipset or licensing revenues. Any claims, regardless of their merit, could be time consuming to\naddress, result in costly litigation, divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, cause product release or\nshipment delays and/or damage to our customer relationships, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of\noperations and cash flows.\nWe may continue to be involved in litigation and may have to appear in front of administrative bodies (such as the\nUnited States International Trade Commission) to defend against patent assertions against our products by companies, some\nof whom are attempting to gain competitive advantage or leverage in licensing negotiations. We may not be successful in\nsuch proceedings, and if we are not, the range of possible outcomes is very broad and may include, for example, monetary\ndamages or fines or other orders to pay money, royalty payments, injunctions on the sale of certain of our integrated circuit\nproducts (or on the sale of our customers’ devices using such products) or the issuance of orders to cease certain conduct or\nmodify our business practices. Further, a governmental body in a particular country or region may assert, and may be\nsuccessful in imposing, remedies with effects that extend beyond the borders of that country or region. In addition, a negative\noutcome in any such proceeding could severely disrupt the business of our customers and their wireless operator customers,\nwhich in turn could harm our relationships with them and could result in a decline in our chipset sales or a reduction in our\nlicensees’ sales, causing corresponding declines in our chipset or licensing revenues.\nOur use of open source software may harm our business.\nCertain of our software and our suppliers’ software may contain or may be derived from “open source” software, and we\nhave seen, and believe that we will continue to see, customers request that we develop products, including software\nassociated with our integrated circuit products, that incorporate open source software elements and operate in an open source\nenvironment, which, under certain open source licenses, may offer accessibility to a portion of our products’ source code and\nmay expose our related intellectual property to adverse licensing conditions. Licensing of such open source software may\nimpose certain obligations on us if we were to distribute derivative works of that software. For example, these obligations\nmay require us to make source code for the derivative works available to our customers in a manner that allows them to make\nsuch source code available to their customers, or to license such derivative works under a particular type of license that is\ndifferent than what we customarily use to license our software. Furthermore, in the course of product development, we may\nmake contributions to third-party open source projects that could subject our intellectual property to adverse licensing\nconditions. For example, to encourage the growth of a software ecosystem that is interoperable with our products, we may\nneed to contribute certain implementations under the open source licensing terms that govern such projects, which may\nadversely impact our associated intellectual property. Developing open source products, while adequately protecting the\nintellectual property upon which our licensing programs depend, may prove burdensome and time-consuming under certain\ncircumstances, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage, and we may not adequately protect our intellectual property.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nWe operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry, which is subject to significant downturns. We are also\nsusceptible to declines in global, regional and local economic conditions generally. Our stock price and financial results\nare subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations due to these dynamics, among others.\nThe semiconductor industry is highly cyclical, volatile, subject to downturns and characterized by constant and rapid\ntechnological change, price erosion, evolving technical standards, frequent new product introductions, short product life\ncycles and fluctuations in product supply and demand. Periods of downturns have been characterized by diminished demand\nfor end-user products, high inventory levels, excess or obsolete inventory adjustments or reserves, underutilization of\nmanufacturing capacity, changes in revenue mix and erosion of average selling prices. During such downturns, our revenues\nhave declined, and our results of operations and financial condition have been adversely impacted. We expect our business to\ncontinue to be subject to such cyclical downturns.\nA decline in global, regional or local economic conditions, or a slow-down in economic growth, particularly in\ngeographic regions with high concentrations of wireless voice and data users or high concentrations of our customers or\nlicensees, could also have adverse, wide-ranging effects on our business and financial results, including: a decrease in\ndemand for our products and technologies; a decrease in demand for the products and services of our customers or licensees;\nthe inability of our suppliers to deliver on their supply commitments to us, our inability to supply our products to our\ncustomers and/or the inability of our customers or licensees to supply their products to end users; the insolvency of key\nsuppliers, customers or licensees; delays in reporting or payments from our customers or licensees; failures by counterparties;\nand/or negative effects on wireless device inventories. In addition, our customers’ and licensees’ ability to purchase or pay\nfor our products and intellectual property and network operators’ ability to upgrade their wireless networks could be\n34\nadversely affected, potentially leading to a reduction, cancellation or delay of orders for our products. Further, inflationary\npressure may increase our costs, including employee compensation costs, reduce demand for our products or those of our\ncustomers or licensees due to increased prices of those products, or result in employee attrition to the extent our\ncompensation does not keep up with inflation, particularly if our competitors’ compensation does.\nOur stock price and financial results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. Factors that may\nhave a significant impact on the market price of our stock and our financial results include those identified above and\nthroughout this Risk Factors section, as well as: volatility of the stock market in general and technology and semiconductor\ncompanies in particular; announcements concerning us, our suppliers, our competitors or our customers or licensees,\nincluding any announcement concerning the initiation of, or any developments in, any lawsuit or governmental investigation\nor proceeding against us; and variations between our actual financial results or guidance and expectations of securities\nanalysts or investors, among others. In the past, securities class action litigation has been brought against companies\nfollowing periods of volatility in the market price of their securities, among other reasons. We are and may in the future be\nthe target of securities litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial uninsured costs and divert management’s\nattention and our resources. Certain legal matters, including certain securities litigation brought against us, are described in\nthis Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.”\nGeopolitical conflicts, natural disasters, pandemics and other health crises, and other factors outside of our control, could\nsignificantly disrupt our business.\nWe have operations and facilities in the United States and many other countries throughout the world. We derive a\nsignificant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs and from non-Chinese OEMs that utilize our integrated circuit\nproducts in devices they sell into China (which has the largest number of smartphone users in the world); our key suppliers\nand their manufacturing foundries and assembly, test and other facilities are primarily located in Taiwan and Korea; our\nmanufacturing facilities for RFFE and RF products are located in China, Germany and Singapore; the primary warehouses\nwhere we store finished goods for fulfillment of customer orders are located in Singapore; and a significant portion of our\nworkforce (including engineering and other technical personnel) is based in India. Acts of war, terrorism, geopolitical\nconflicts, political instability or tensions such as the current geopolitical tensions involving China and Taiwan, natural\ndisasters, the effects of climate change, pandemics or other health crises affecting any of the regions in which we operate, and\nparticularly those in which our customers, suppliers, manufacturing facilities and/or significant portions of our workforce are\nconcentrated, could significantly disrupt our business by, among others: reducing demand for our products and services or\nend-user devices incorporating our products or intellectual property; impairing our customers’ or licensees’ ability to\npurchase or pay for our products, services or intellectual property; delaying or preventing our suppliers from providing us\nwith critical components or raw materials; delaying or preventing our foundry or semiconductor assembly and test providers\nfrom manufacturing, assembling or testing our products; preventing us from manufacturing products or shipping finished\nproducts; damaging or destroying inventory; delaying or preventing network operators from upgrading their wireless\nnetworks to meet new technology standards; or preventing a significant number of our employees, or employees who perform\ncritical functions, from performing their duties for us. For example, our business depends on our ability to receive consistent\nand reliable chipset supply from our foundry partners, particularly in Taiwan. Consequently, a significant or prolonged\nmilitary or other geopolitical conflict involving China and Taiwan could severely limit or prevent us from receiving chipset\nsupply from Taiwan, which would have a material adverse impact on our business (and likely on the semiconductor industry\nas a whole). In addition, acts of war, terrorism, geopolitical conflicts, political instability or tensions, natural disasters, the\neffects of climate change, pandemics or other health crises impacting any of these regions could also result in a decline in\nglobal, regional or local economic conditions generally, or increased volatility in financial markets, which could have adverse\neffects on our business and financial results. See also the Risk Factor titled “We operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor\nindustry, which is subject to significant downturns. We are also susceptible to declines in global, regional and local\neconomic conditions generally. Our stock price and financial results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual\nfluctuations due to these dynamics, among others.” Any such events may also have the effect of exacerbating the other risks\ndiscussed in this “Risk Factors” section.\nOur business may suffer due to the impact of, or our failure to comply with, the various existing, new or amended laws,\nregulations, policies or standards to which we are subject.\nOur business and products, and those of our customers and licensees, are subject to various laws, rules and regulations\nglobally, as well as government policies and the specifications of international, national and regional communications\nstandards bodies (collectively, Regulations). These include, among others, Regulations related to: patent licensing practices;\nantitrust, competition and competitive business practices; protection of intellectual property; cybersecurity; privacy and data\nprotection; AI technologies; imports and exports, such as the U.S. Export Administration Regulations administered by the\nU.S. Department of Commerce; trade and trade protection including tariffs; foreign policy and national security; the flow of\nfunds out of certain countries (e.g., China); automotive industry safety, security and quality standards; environmental\nprotection (including climate change), health and safety; supply chain, responsible sourcing (including the use of conflict\nminerals) and human rights; spectrum availability and license issuance; adoption of standards; taxation; labor, employment\nand human capital; corporate governance; public disclosure and reporting (including reporting of ESG-related data); and\nbusiness conduct. Compliance with, or changes in the interpretation of, existing Regulations, the adoption of new\nRegulations, changes in the oversight of our activities by governments or standards bodies, or rulings in court, regulatory,\nadministrative or other proceedings relating to such Regulations, among others, could have an adverse effect on our business\nand results of operations. See also the Risk Factors titled “Our business may suffer as a result of adverse rulings in\n35\ngovernmental investigations or proceedings or other legal proceedings,” “Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether\ndue to governmental investigations, legal challenges or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of\noperations,” “A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are\nexacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions,” “There are numerous risks associated with the operation\nand control of our manufacturing facilities, including a higher portion of fixed costs relative to a fabless model;\nenvironmental compliance and liability; impacts related to climate change; exposure to natural disasters, health crises,\ngeopolitical conflicts and cyber-attacks; timely supply of equipment and materials; and various manufacturing issues,” and\n“Tax liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations.”\nRegulations are complex and changing (which may create uncertainty regarding compliance), are subject to varying\ninterpretations, and their application in practice may evolve over time. In addition, and especially in developing regulatory\nareas (for example, AI, privacy and data protection, and ESG-related reporting), Regulations may differ by country or by\nstate within the United States, and may be conflicting in certain cases. As a result, our efforts to comply with Regulations\nmay fail, particularly if there is ambiguity as to how they should be applied in practice. Failure to comply with any\nRegulation may adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. New Regulations, or evolving\ninterpretations thereof, may cause us to incur higher costs as we revise current practices, policies or procedures; may divert\nmanagement time and attention to compliance activities; and may negatively impact our ability to conduct business in certain\njurisdictions.\nThere are risks associated with our debt.\nOur outstanding debt and any additional debt we incur may have negative consequences on our business, including,\namong others: requiring us to use cash to pay the principal of and interest on our debt, thereby reducing the amount of cash\navailable for other purposes; limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures,\nacquisitions, stock repurchases, dividends, general corporate or other purposes; and limiting our flexibility in planning for, or\nreacting to, changes in our business, industries or the market. Our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our\ndebt depends upon our future performance, which is subject to economic and political conditions, industry cycles and\nfinancial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow\nfrom operations to service our debt, we may be required to, among others: refinance or restructure all or a portion of our debt;\nreduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures; reduce, suspend or eliminate our dividend payments and/or our\nstock repurchase program; or sell selected assets. Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt. In\naddition, any such refinancing, restructuring or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms or at all,\nand if prevailing interest rates at the time of any such refinancing or restructuring are higher than our current rates, interest\nexpense related to such refinancing or restructuring would increase. Further, if there are adverse changes in the ratings\nassigned to our debt securities by credit rating agencies, our borrowing costs, our ability to access debt financing in the future\nand the terms of such debt could be adversely affected.\nTax liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required\nin determining our provision for income taxes. We regularly are subject to examination of our tax returns and reports by\ntaxing authorities in the United States federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions, most notably in\ncountries where we earn a routine return and the tax authorities believe substantial value-add activities are performed, as well\nas countries where we own intellectual property. The final determination of tax audits and any related legal proceedings could\nmaterially differ from amounts reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals. In such case, our income tax provision,\nresults of operations and cash flows in the period or periods in which that determination is made could be negatively affected.\nTax rules may change in a manner that adversely affects our future reported results of operations or the way we conduct\nour business. Most of our income is taxable in the United States with a significant portion qualifying for preferential\ntreatment as FDII (foreign-derived intangible income). Beginning in fiscal 2027, the effective tax rate for FDII increases from\n13% to 16%. Further, if U.S. tax rates increase and/or the FDII deduction is eliminated or reduced, both of which have been\nproposed by the current U.S. presidential administration, our provision for income taxes, results of operations and cash flows\nwould be adversely (potentially materially) affected. Also, if our customers move manufacturing operations to the United\nStates, our FDII deduction may be reduced. Further, if the requirement to capitalize certain research and development\nexpenditures for federal income tax purposes is changed, as has been proposed by Congress, this would negatively affect our\nprovision for income taxes and results of operations (although it would have a favorable impact on our cash flows from\noperations due to lower cash tax payments).\nFurther changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting\n(BEPS) project that was undertaken by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The OECD,\nrepresenting a coalition of member countries, has made certain changes, including the Pillar Two framework, which imposes\na minimum tax of 15% in each taxing jurisdiction. The OECD is contemplating additional changes to numerous long-\nstanding tax principles. These changes, if and as adopted by countries, may increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect\nour provision for income taxes, results of operations and cash flows.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\n36\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nRisk Management and Strategy\nTo identify, assess and manage cybersecurity risks, we maintain an IT security/cybersecurity program (Cybersecurity\nProgram) that is informed in part by international frameworks as well as our specific security requirements and cybersecurity\nrisk profile. We have implemented policies, procedures, processes and administrative, physical and technical controls\ndesigned to protect, defend and mitigate effects to us from cybersecurity threats and incidents. For example, we provide\nrecurring employee cybersecurity training to help our employees better understand cybersecurity threats, our policies, actions\nand approach to managing this type of risk and how they can help increase our security posture.\nOur Cybersecurity Program also includes an incident response process that is overseen by our Vice President of\nCybersecurity and supported by an internal team of cybersecurity specialists, with involvement from business, legal and\nsenior management as appropriate. In the event of a cybersecurity incident, a technical cybersecurity team investigates and\naddresses the threat, while a cross-functional team assesses the incident to inform criticality determinations and response\nefforts, including escalations of the incident to senior management as appropriate.\nWe evaluate and update our cybersecurity risk profile through ongoing assessment of the cybersecurity threat landscape\nand security monitoring. Our cybersecurity risk profile is used as an input to identify, assess and update our Cybersecurity\nProgram, and associated priorities are updated as new risk information becomes available. Information security, including\ncybersecurity, is also incorporated into our overall Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program. Our ERM Operating\nCommittee includes members in senior leadership positions across various functional areas that evaluate enterprise risks and\ndevelop and monitor associated mitigation plans. Cybersecurity related risks are included in the risk universe that the\ncommittee evaluates to assess top risks to the enterprise. As part of our ERM program, our executive leadership team receives\nannual updates on enterprise risks, including cybersecurity risks, as well as their potential impact, likelihood, potential\nmitigation plans and status.\nOur Cybersecurity Program, and portions thereof, are periodically reviewed by third-party assessors, consultants,\nauditors or other firms. For example, we periodically conduct penetration tests and tabletop exercises to simulate attacks\nagainst our infrastructure, systems, or portions thereof, in order to validate the efficacy of our security controls and response\ncapabilities. Such exercises are typically conducted with assistance from third-party advisors and experts. Incident response\nefforts are also supported by external resources such as legal advisors, cybersecurity forensic firms, communications\nspecialists, and other outside advisors and experts as well as law enforcement support, as appropriate. We benefit from\nengaging third parties to provide specialized skills, knowledge, tools and resources, and such third parties may also help\nreduce costs, increase efficiency and/or improve the quality of our Cybersecurity Program.\nOur supplier community (including suppliers of IT services and other third-party service providers) plays a large role in\nQualcomm’s success, and we believe in engaging with our suppliers to help them protect against cybersecurity threats. We\noperate a supplier cybersecurity assurance program, which is integrated with our procurement processes and supported by the\nrelevant groups within the legal organization, to assess and attempt to mitigate potential cybersecurity risks across our\nsupplier community commensurate with their cybersecurity risk. Specifically, based on a risk classification of the supplier,\nour third-party risk management process includes steps such as the evaluation of a supplier’s security controls, posture and\nmaturity as well as the identification and treatment of cybersecurity-related risks.\nNotwithstanding our Cybersecurity Program as described above, we cannot anticipate, detect, repel or implement fully\neffective preventative measures against all cybersecurity threats, particularly because the techniques used are increasingly\nsophisticated and constantly evolving. Like many companies, we have encountered intrusions and attempts to gain\nunauthorized access to our IT systems or other attacks and incidents, and we have had third-party service providers who have\nencountered intrusions. However, during fiscal 2024, we did not identify any risks from cybersecurity threats that materially\naffected or are reasonably anticipated to materially affect our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition.\nFor additional information about the cybersecurity risks we face, including how such risks could affect us in the future, see\nPart I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report, including the Risk Factors titled “Our business and operations could\nsuffer in the event of security breaches of our IT systems, or other misappropriation of our technology, intellectual property\nor other proprietary or confidential information” and “Failures in our products, or in the products of our customers or\nlicensees, including those resulting from security vulnerabilities, defects or errors, could harm our business.”\nGovernance\nOur Board of Directors has primary responsibility for oversight of our risk management efforts, with support from its\nstanding committees. In particular, the Audit Committee of our Board assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight\nresponsibilities with respect to our Cybersecurity Program. As part of its oversight of IT security/cybersecurity matters, the\nAudit Committee receives cybersecurity updates on a quarterly basis and an IT security/cybersecurity briefing from\nmanagement, typically including our Vice President of Cybersecurity, on at least a semi-annual basis. At least annually, the\nfull Board also receives updates on the Cybersecurity Program and cybersecurity risks. In addition to this regular reporting,\nsignificant cybersecurity threats or incidents may also be escalated on an as-needed basis through our organizational structure\nin accordance with our incident response process.\nKey elements of our Cybersecurity Program, including defending against key cybersecurity threats and risks, are\noverseen by our Vice President of Cybersecurity, the Information Security and Risk Management (ISRM) organization, and\n37\ncertain legal functions under the office of the General Counsel, which includes subject matter experts focused on identifying\nand managing cybersecurity threats and consequences where technically feasible and commensurate with risk. Our Vice\nPresident of Cybersecurity has over 20 years of experience in cybersecurity gained across numerous leadership roles in\nQualcomm’s IT and Cybersecurity organization, including security architecture, risk and compliance, incident response,\nsecurity operations and identity management. That experience is supplemented by the collective experience and expertise\nacross the ISRM organization, which includes the Cyber Security Operations Center, Cyber Defense Engineering Services,\nCyber Identity and Architecture, Cyber Governance Risk and Compliance, and Threat Intelligence teams, among others. The\nCybersecurity Program is also supported by additional members of senior management, including our Chief Financial Officer\nand Chief Operating Officer, Chief Technology Officer, Chief Human Resources Officer and General Counsel, through\nregular reporting and review.\nItem 2. Properties\nAt September 29, 2024, we occupied the following facilities (square footage in millions):\nOther\nUnited States Countries Total\nOwned facilities 4.5 1.3 5.8\nLeased facilities 0.8 7.5 8.3\nTotal 5.3 8.8 14.1\nOur headquarters and certain of our research and development and network management hub operations are located in\nSan Diego, California. We also operate owned and leased manufacturing facilities in China, Germany and Singapore, and we\nown and lease properties around the world for use as sales and administrative offices and research and development centers,\nprimarily in the United States, India and China. Our facility leases expire at varying dates through 2038, not including\nrenewals that are at our option. Several other owned and leased facilities are under construction totaling approximately 0.8\nmillion additional square feet, primarily related to the construction of new facilities in India. We do not identify or allocate\nfacilities by operating segment.\nInformation related to our additional capital requirements is provided in this Annual Report in “Part II, Item 7.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the “Liquidity and Capital\nResources” section under the heading “Additional Capital Requirements.” Additional information on net property, plant and\nequipment by geography is provided in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 8.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity\nSecurities\nMarket Information and Dividends\nOur common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (NASDAQ) under the symbol “QCOM.” At\nNovember 4, 2024, there were 5,848 holders of record of our common stock.\nWe currently intend to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends, subject to capital availability and our view that cash\ndividends are in the best interests of our stockholders. Future dividends may be affected by, among other items, our views on\npotential future capital availability and requirements, including those relating to research and development, creation and\nexpansion of sales and distribution channels, investments and acquisitions, legal and regulatory risks, withholding of\npayments by one or more of our significant licensees and/or customers, fines and/or adverse rulings by government agencies,\ncourts or arbitrators in legal or regulatory matters, stock repurchase programs, debt issuances, changes in federal, state or\nforeign income tax law, trade and/or national security protection policies, volatility in economies and financial markets or\nother macroeconomic conditions, and changes to our business model.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nOur purchases of our common stock in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 were:\nTotal Number of Approximate Dollar\nShares Purchased Value of Shares that\nAverage as Part of May Yet Be\nPrice Paid Publicly Purchased Under the\nTotal Number of Per Share Announced Plans Plans or Programs\nShares Purchased (1) or Programs (2)\n(In thousands) (In thousands) (In millions)\nJune 24, 2024 to July 21, 2024 1,090 $ 202.29 1,090 $ 2,108\nJuly 22, 2024 to August 25, 2024 3,006 170.63 3,006 1,595\nAugust 26, 2024 to September 29, 2024 3,406 167.02 3,406 1,026\nTotal 7,502 7,502\n(1) Average Price Paid Per Share excludes cash paid for commissions.\n(2) On October 12, 2021, we announced a $10.0 billion stock repurchase program. At September 29, 2024, $1.0 billion remained\nauthorized for repurchase under this stock repurchase program. On November 6, 2024, we announced a new $15.0 billion stock\nrepurchase authorization, which is in addition to the aforementioned program. The stock repurchase programs have no expiration date.\nShares withheld to satisfy statutory tax withholding requirements related to the vesting of share-based awards are not issued or\nconsidered stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program and, therefore, are excluded from the table above.\nStock Performance Graph\nThe following graph compares the cumulative total stockholder return on our common stock, the Standard & Poor’s 500\nStock Index (S&P 500) and the NASDAQ-100 Index (NASDAQ-100) for the five years ended September 29, 2024. The S&P\n500 tracks the aggregate price performance of the equity securities of 500 United States companies selected by Standard &\nPoor’s Index Committee to include companies in leading industries and to reflect the United States stock market. The\nNASDAQ-100 tracks the aggregate price performance of the 100 largest domestic and international non-financial securities\nlisted on the NASDAQ Stock Market based on market capitalization. Our common stock is a component of each of the S&P\n500 and the NASDAQ-100.\nThe total return for our stock and for each index assumes that $100 was invested at the market close on the last trading\nday for our fiscal year ended September 29, 2019 and that all dividends were reinvested. All returns are reported as of our\nfiscal year end, which is the last Sunday in September. Stockholder returns over the indicated period are based on historical\ndata and should not be considered indicative of future stockholder returns.\n39\nCOMPARISON OF 5 YEAR CUMULATIVE TOTAL RETURN\nAmong QUALCOMM Incorporated, the S&P 500 Index and the NASDAQ-100 Index\n$350\n$300\n$250\n$200\n$150\n$100\n$50\n$0\n09/29/19 09/27/20 09/26/21 09/25/22 09/24/23 09/29/24\nQUALCOMM Incorporated S&P 500 NASDAQ-100\nItem 6.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction\nwith our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and\nSupplementary Data” of this Annual Report.\nThe following section generally discusses fiscal 2024 and 2023 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2024\nand 2023. Discussions of fiscal 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2023 and 2022 that are not included\nin this Annual Report can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2023.\nOur Business and Operating Segments\nWe develop and commercialize foundational technologies and products used in mobile devices and other wireless\nproducts. We derive revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit products and licensing our intellectual property,\nincluding patents and other rights.\nWe are organized on the basis of products and services and have three reportable segments. We conduct business\nprimarily through our QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) semiconductor business and our QTL (Qualcomm\nTechnology Licensing) licensing business. Our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic\ninvestments. We also have nonreportable segments, including QGOV (Qualcomm Government Technologies) and our cloud\ncomputing processing initiative.\nFurther information regarding our business and operating segments is provided in “Part I, Item 1. Business” of this\nAnnual Report.\nSeasonality. Many of our products and much of our intellectual property are incorporated into consumer wireless\ndevices, which are subject to seasonality and other fluctuations in demand. Our revenues have historically fluctuated based on\nconsumer demand for devices, as well as on the timing of customer/licensee device launches and/or innovation cycles (such\nas the transition to the next generation of wireless technologies). This has resulted in fluctuations in QCT revenues in advance\nof and during device launches incorporating our products and in QTL revenues when licensees’ sales occur. These trends\nmay or may not continue in the future. Further, the trends for QTL have been, and may in the future be, impacted by disputes\nand/or resolutions with licensees and/or governmental investigations or proceedings.\n40\nFiscal 2024 Overview\nRevenues were $39.0 billion, an increase of 9% compared to revenues of $35.8 billion in fiscal 2023, with net income of\n$10.1 billion, an increase of 40% compared to net income of $7.2 billion in fiscal 2023. Our fiscal 2024 results included:\n• QCT revenues increased by 9% in fiscal 2024 compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher handsets and\nautomotive revenues, partially offset by lower IoT revenues.\n• QTL revenues increased by 5% in fiscal 2024 compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase in estimated\nsales of 3G/4G/5G-based multimode products.\n• We recorded other expenses of $179 million in fiscal 2024 compared to $862 million in fiscal 2023, both of which\nprimarily consisted of restructuring and restructuring-related charges.\n• Investment and other income, net increased by $613 million in fiscal 2024 compared to the prior year, primarily due\nto higher interest rates earned on higher balances of interest-bearing securities.\nResults of Operations\nRevenues (in millions)\n2024 2023 Change\nEquipment and services $ 32,791 $ 30,028 $ 2,763\nLicensing 6,171 5,792 379\n$ 38,962 $ 35,820 $ 3,142\n2024 vs. 2023\nThe increase in revenues in fiscal 2024 was primarily due to:\n+ $2.7 billion in higher equipment and services revenue from our QCT segment\n+ $266 million in higher licensing revenues from our QTL segment\nCosts and Expenses (in millions, except percentages)\n2024 2023 Change\nCost of revenues $ 17,060 $ 15,869 $ 1,191\nGross margin 56% 56%\n2024 vs. 2023\nGross margin percentage remained flat in fiscal 2024.\n2024 2023 Change\nResearch and development $ 8,893 $ 8,818 $ 75\n% of revenues 23% 25%\n2024 vs. 2023\nThe increase in research and development expenses in fiscal 2024 was due to:\n+ $113 million increase in share-based compensation expense\n+ $66 million increase in expenses driven by revaluation of our deferred compensation obligation (which resulted in a\ncorresponding increase in net gains on deferred compensation plan assets within investment and other income, net\ndue to the revaluation of the related assets)\n- $104 million decrease driven by lower costs related to the development of wireless and integrated circuit\ntechnologies (including 5G and application processor technologies). This was primarily driven by a decrease in\nemployee-related costs as a result of certain restructuring actions taken to fund continued investments in key growth\nand diversification opportunities, partially offset by higher employee cash incentive program costs.\n41\n2024 2023 Change\nSelling, general and administrative $ 2,759 $ 2,483 $ 276\n% of revenues 7% 7%\n2024 vs. 2023\nThe increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2024 was primarily due to:\n+ $99 million increase in sales and marketing expenses\n+ $42 million increase in expenses driven by revaluation of our deferred compensation obligation\n+ $39 million increase in share-based compensation expense\n2024 2023 Change\nOther expenses $ 179 $ 862 $ (683)\n2024 vs. 2023\nOther expenses in fiscal 2024 consisted primarily of $107 million in restructuring and restructuring-related charges\n(substantially all of which related to severance costs) and a $75 million charge related to the settlement of the securities class\naction lawsuit.\nOther expenses in fiscal 2023 consisted of $712 million in total restructuring and restructuring-related charges (substantially\nall of which related to severance costs, resulting from certain cost reduction actions committed to in fiscal 2023 and a $150\nmillion intangible asset impairment charge related to in-process research and development.\nInterest Expense and Investment and Other Income, Net (in millions)\n2024 2023 Change\nInterest expense $ 697 $ 694 $ 3\nInvestment and other income, net\nInterest and dividend income $ 675 $ 313 $ 362\nNet gains on marketable securities 14 75 (61)\nNet gains on other investments 175 21 154\nNet gains on deferred compensation plan assets 198 86 112\nImpairment losses on other investments (79) (132) 53\nOther (21) (14) (7)\n$ 962 $ 349 $ 613\n2024 vs. 2023\nThe increase in interest and dividend income in fiscal 2024 was primarily due to higher interest rates earned on higher\nbalances of interest-bearing securities.

Substantially all of our income is taxed in the\nU.S., of which a significant portion qualifies for preferential treatment as FDII at a 13% effective tax rate. Additional\ninformation regarding our annual effective tax rate (including discussion related to the impact of the requirement to capitalize\nresearch and development expenditures for federal income tax purposes, and the benefit related to the transfer of intellectual\nproperty between foreign subsidiaries) is provided in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\nNotes 3.

Certain\ncountries have implemented or are in the process of implementing the Pillar Two legislation, which will apply to us\nbeginning in fiscal year 2025. While we do not currently expect this to materially impact our consolidated financial\nstatements, we continue to monitor the impact as countries implement legislation and the OECD provides additional\nguidance.\nDiscontinued Operations (in millions)\n2024 2023 Change\nDiscontinued operations, net of income taxes $ 32 $ (107) $ 139\n2024 vs. 2023\nDiscontinued operations in fiscal 2024 and 2023 primarily related to the Non-Arriver businesses. Fiscal 2023 also included a\ngain on the sale of the Active Safety business and certain write-down charges related to the Restraint Control Systems\nbusiness, the individual and aggregate amounts of which were not material. Information regarding the Non-Arriver\nbusinesses is provided in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 2. Composition of Certain\nFinancial Statement Items.”\n43\nSegment Results\nThe following should be read in conjunction with the fiscal 2024 and 2023 results of operations for each reportable\nsegment included in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 8. Segment Information.”\nQCT Segment (in millions, except percentages)\n2024 2023 Change\nRevenues\nHandsets $ 24,863 $ 22,570 $ 2,293\nAutomotive 2,910 1,872 1,038\nIoT (internet of things) 5,423 5,940 (517)\nTotal revenues (1) $ 33,196 $ 30,382 $ 2,814\nEBT (2) $ 9,527 $ 7,924 $ 1,603\nEBT as a % of revenues 29% 26% 3 points\n(1) Descriptions of our three QCT revenue streams can be found in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\nNote 2. Composition of Certain Financial Statement Items.”\n(2) Earnings (loss) before income taxes.\nSubstantially all of QCT’s revenues consist of equipment and services revenues, which were $32.6 billion and $29.9\nbillion in fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. QCT handsets, automotive and IoT revenues mostly relate to sales of our\nSnapdragon platforms (which include processors and modems), stand-alone Mobile Data Modems, radio frequency\ntransceiver, power management and wireless connectivity integrated chipsets as well as sales of 4G, 5G sub 6 and 5G\nmillimeter wave RFFE products.\n2024 vs. 2023\nThe increase in QCT revenues in fiscal 2024 was primarily due to:\n+ higher handsets revenues, due to $2.8 billion in higher chipset shipments driven by certain major OEMs (primarily\ndriven by the normalization of customer inventory levels, which were elevated in the prior year), partially offset by\n$533 million in lower revenues per chipset primarily driven by unfavorable mix\n+ higher automotive revenues, primarily driven by an increase in demand from new vehicle launches with our\nSnapdragon digital cockpit and connectivity products\n- lower IoT revenues, due to $834 million in lower revenues per unit primarily driven by unfavorable mix, partially\noffset by a $317 million increase in demand (primarily in consumer products, partially offset by edge networking\nproducts as customers continued drawing down on their elevated inventory levels)\nQCT EBT as a percentage of revenues increased in fiscal 2024 primarily due to higher revenues.\nGross margin percentage remained flat in fiscal 2024.\nQTL Segment (in millions, except percentages)\n2024 2023 Change\nLicensing revenues $ 5,572 $ 5,306 $ 266\nEBT 4,027 3,628 399\nEBT as a % of revenues 72% 68% 4 points\n2024 vs. 2023\nThe increase in QTL licensing revenues in fiscal 2024 was primarily due to:\n+ $402 million increase in estimated sales of 3G/4G/5G-based multimode products\n- $90 million decrease in estimated revenues per unit\n- $68 million decrease in revenues from the ending of the recognition of certain upfront license fee consideration in\nthe first quarter of fiscal 2023 from our long-term license agreement with Nokia\nQTL EBT as a percentage of revenues increased in fiscal 2024 primarily due to:\n+ lower cost of sales driven by a decrease in amortization expense related to acquired patents\n+ higher revenues\n44\nQSI Segment (in millions)\n2024 2023 Change\nEquipment and services revenues $ 18 $ 28 $ (10)\nEBT 104 (12) 116\n2024 vs. 2023\nQSI EBT increased in fiscal 2024 primarily due to net gains on certain of our non-marketable equity investments.\nLooking Forward\nWe believe that 5G combined with high-performance, low-power computing and on-device artificial intelligence will\ncontinue to drive adoption of certain technologies that are already commonly used in smartphones by industries and\napplications beyond mobile handsets, such as automotive and IoT. We believe it is important that we remain a leader in 5G\ntechnology development, standardization, intellectual property creation and licensing, and a leading developer and supplier of\n5G integrated circuit products in order to sustain and grow our business long-term.\nAs we look forward to the next several quarters:\n• We expect transitions to new generations of leading process technology nodes to continue to drive product cost\nincreases from certain of our key semiconductor wafer suppliers.\n• We expect continued intense competition, including from vertical integration by certain of our customers (e.g.,\nApple).\n• Current U.S./China trade relations and/or national security protection policies may negatively impact our business,\ngrowth prospects and results of operations. See “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report, including the Risk Factor\ntitled “A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are\nexacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions.”\nIn fiscal 2024, we extended, renewed or entered into license agreements with several key OEMs. We are currently\npursuing negotiations with other key OEMs whose agreements expire in early fiscal 2025 (including Huawei). In addition, in\nfiscal 2024, we entered into a license agreement with Shenzhen Transsion Holdings Limited (a growing, China-headquartered\nOEM that sells primarily in developing regions) for its 5G products. While we continue to engage in negotiations toward a\ncomprehensive resolution, we have initiated litigation against Transsion in multiple jurisdictions to enforce our intellectual\nproperty rights against certain of its unlicensed products. See “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report, including the Risk\nFactors titled “The continued and future success of our licensing programs requires us to continue to evolve our patent\nportfolio and to renew or renegotiate license agreements that are expiring” and “The enforcement and protection of our\nintellectual property may be expensive, could fail to prevent misappropriation or unauthorized use of our intellectual\nproperty, could result in the loss of our ability to enforce one or more patents, and could be adversely affected by changes in\npatent laws, by laws in certain foreign jurisdictions that may not effectively protect our intellectual property and by\nineffective enforcement of laws in such jurisdictions.”\nWe are also involved in other legal proceedings, including those described in this Annual Report in “Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.” Litigation is inherently uncertain, and, while\nwe intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves in such matters, the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these\nmatters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nIn addition to the foregoing business and market-based matters, we continue to devote resources to working with and\neducating participants in the wireless industry and governments as to the benefits of our licensing programs and our extensive\ntechnology investments in promoting a highly competitive and innovative wireless industry. However, we expect that certain\ncompanies may be dissatisfied with the need to pay reasonable royalties for the use of our technologies and not welcome the\nsuccess of our licensing programs in enabling new, highly cost-effective competitors to their products. Accordingly, such\ncompanies, and/or governments or regulators, may continue to challenge our business model in various forums throughout\nthe world.\nFurther discussion of risks related to our business is provided in “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” included in this Annual\nReport.\n45\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from\noperations and cash provided by our debt programs, which we believe will satisfy our working and other capital requirements\nfor at least the next 12 months based on our current business plans.\nThe following table presents selected financial information related to our liquidity as of and for the years ended\nSeptember 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023 (in millions):\nSeptember 29, September 24,\n2024 2023 Change\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities\nCash and cash equivalents (1) $ 7,849 $ 8,450 $ (601)\nMarketable securities 5,451 2,874 2,577\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 13,300 $ 11,324 $ 1,976\nDebt (2) $ 14,634 $ 15,398 $ (764)\n(1) Excludes $77 million of cash and cash equivalents classified as held for sale at September 24, 2023.\n(2) Includes our issued debt reported as long-term and short-term.\n2024 2023 Change\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 12,202 $ 11,299 $ 903\nNet cash (used) provided by investing activities (3,623) 762 (4,385)\nNet cash used by financing activities (9,269) (6,663) (2,606)\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The net increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities\nin fiscal 2024 was primarily due to net cash provided by operating activities and $383 million in proceeds from the issuance\nof common stock (primarily under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan), partially offset by $4.1 billion in payments to\nrepurchase shares of our common stock, $3.7 billion in cash dividends paid, $1.0 billion in capital expenditures, $932 million\nin payments of tax withholdings related to the vesting of share-based awards and $914 million in repayments of notes that\nmatured in May 2024.\nDuring fiscal 2024, income taxes paid were in excess of our provision, negatively impacting net cash provided by\noperating activities. This was primarily driven by the adverse impact of the requirement to capitalize and amortize research\nand development expenditures for federal income tax purposes, our payment of $1.0 billion related to certain previously\npostponed U.S. federal income tax payments from fiscal 2023 and an installment payment for a one-time U.S. repatriation tax\naccrued in fiscal 2018 of $414 million.\nNet changes in our operating assets and liabilities positively impacted our operating cash flows in fiscal 2024 primarily\nfrom an increase in accrued customer incentives, which included the impact of timing of related payments, and an increase in\naccounts payable due to timing and amount of inventory purchases, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable due\nto higher revenues.\nDebt. At September 29, 2024, we had $15.0 billion of principal fixed-rate notes outstanding, $1.4 billion of which\nmatures in May 2025. The remaining debt has maturity dates in 2027 through 2053.\nWe have an unsecured commercial paper program, which provides for the issuance of up to $4.5 billion of commercial\npaper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. At September 29, 2024, we had no amounts\nof commercial paper outstanding. On August 8, 2024, we entered into a Revolving Credit Facility, replacing our prior\nAmended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility provides for unsecured revolving facility\nloans, swing line loans and letters of credit in an aggregate amount of up to $4.0 billion, which expires on August 8, 2029. At\nSeptember 29, 2024, no amounts were outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nWe expect to issue new debt in the future. The amount and timing of any such new debt will depend on a number of\nfactors, including but not limited to maturities of our existing debt, acquisitions and strategic investments, favorable and/or\nacceptable interest rates and changes in corporate income tax law. Additional information regarding our outstanding debt at\nSeptember 29, 2024 is provided in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 6. Debt.”\nIncome Taxes. At September 29, 2024, our remaining future payments were $1.0 billion for a one-time U.S. repatriation\ntax accrued in fiscal 2018, after application of certain tax credits, which is payable in installments over the next two years. At\nSeptember 29, 2024, other current liabilities included $530 million for the next installment due in January 2025. Beginning in\nfiscal 2023, for federal income tax purposes, we are required to capitalize and amortize domestic research and development\nexpenditures over five years and foreign research and development expenditures over fifteen years (such expenditures were\npreviously deducted as incurred). As a result, our cash flows from operations are adversely affected due to significantly\nhigher cash tax payments. However, the adverse cash flow impact will diminish in future years as capitalized research and\n46\ndevelopment expenditures continue to amortize. Additional information regarding our income taxes is provided in this\nAnnual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 3. Income Taxes.”\nCapital Return Program. The following table summarizes stock repurchases and dividends paid during fiscal 2024 and\n2023 (in millions, except per-share amounts):\nStock Repurchase Program Dividends Total\nAverage Price\nShares Paid Per Share Amount Per Share Amount Amount\n2024 25 $ 161.37 $ 4,121 $ 3.30 $ 3,687 $ 7,808\n2023 25 117.93 2,973 3.10 3,462 6,435\nOn October 12, 2021, we announced a $10.0 billion stock repurchase program. At September 29, 2024, $1.0 billion\nremained authorized for repurchase under this stock repurchase program. On November 6, 2024, we announced a new $15.0\nbillion stock repurchase authorization, which is in addition to the aforementioned program. The stock repurchase programs\nhave no expiration date. The timing of stock repurchases and the number of shares of common stock to be repurchased will\ndepend upon prevailing market conditions and other factors. Repurchases may be made in the open market, through 10b5-1\nprograms, through accelerated share repurchase programs, in privately negotiated transactions or through the use of\nderivative instruments. Our stock repurchase programs are subject to periodic evaluations to determine when and if\nrepurchases are in the best interests of our stockholders, and we may accelerate, suspend, delay or discontinue repurchases at\nany time.\nOn October 16, 2024, we announced a cash dividend of $0.85 per share on our common stock, payable on December 19,\n2024 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 5, 2024. We currently intend to continue to use cash\ndividends as a means of returning capital to stockholders, subject to capital availability and our view that cash dividends are\nin the best interests of our stockholders, among other factors.\nAdditional Capital Requirements. Recent and expected working and other capital requirements, in addition to the above\nmatters, also include the items described below:\n• Our purchase obligations at September 29, 2024, which primarily relate to purchase commitments with certain\nsuppliers of our integrated circuit products, including those under multi-year capacity commitments, totaled $12.8\nbillion, of which, $9.6 billion is expected to be paid in the next 12 months.\n• Our research and development expenditures were $8.9 billion in fiscal 2024 and $8.8 billion in fiscal 2023.\n• Cash outflows for capital expenditures were $1.0 billion in fiscal 2024 and $1.5 billion in fiscal 2023. We expect\ncapital expenditures to increase from fiscal 2024 in the near term to support our production and testing needs related\nto our growth and diversification initiatives.\n• Amounts related to future lease payments for operating lease obligations at September 29, 2024 totaled $1.1 billion,\nwith $136 million expected to be paid within the next 12 months.\n• We expect to continue making strategic investments and acquisitions, the amounts of which could vary significantly.\nFurther, regulatory authorities in certain jurisdictions have investigated our business practices and instituted proceedings\nagainst us in the past, and they or other regulatory authorities may do so in the future. Additionally, certain of our direct and\nindirect customers and licensees have pursued, and others may in the future pursue, litigation or arbitration against us related\nto our business. Unfavorable resolutions of one or more of these matters have had and could in the future have a material\nadverse effect on our business, revenues, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. See “Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies” and “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this\nAnnual Report.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in\nthe United States requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues\nand expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical and anticipated results\nand trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions\nas to future events. By their nature, estimates are inherently subject to a degree of uncertainty. Although we believe that our\nestimates and the assumptions supporting our assessments are reasonable, actual results could differ materially from our\nestimates and assumptions, and could be material to our consolidated financial statements.\nIn addition to our critical accounting estimates and policies below, refer to “Note 1. Significant Accounting Policies” and\n“Note 2. Composition of Certain Financial Statement Items” included in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements” for further information. If the impact of changes in our critical accounting estimates are material or\nconsidered necessary to understand our results of operations for the periods presented, then such information is disclosed\nwithin this Annual Report in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations.”\n47\nRevenue Recognition. We grant licenses or otherwise provide rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio,\nwhich, among other rights, includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture, sale or use of certain\nwireless products. We estimate and recognize sales-based royalties on such licensed products in the period in which the\nlicensees’ sales occur, which is based largely on preliminary royalty estimates provided by our licensees. For fiscal 2024 and\n2023, actual amounts for sales-based royalties have been materially consistent with such estimates, and no significant\nreversals of revenues have been required as a result of adjustments to prior period royalty estimates.\nImpairment of Non-marketable Equity Investments. We monitor our investments for events or circumstances that could\nindicate impairment, including those that result from observable price adjustments. Key considerations in this assessment\ninclude the investee’s financial and liquidity position and business forecasts (including their ability to respond to any\nsignificant deterioration), industry performance, development and/or market acceptance of the investee’s products or\ntechnologies, as well as considering any appreciation in fair value that has not been recognized in the carrying values of such\ninvestments and other relevant events and factors. In fiscal 2024 and 2023, there were no significant impairment losses or\nadjustments to our previous judgments and estimates recorded.\nInventories. We measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value considering judgments and estimates\nrelated to future customer demand and other market conditions, such as the impact of the macroeconomic environment in\nfiscal 2023, which negatively impacted consumer demand for smartphones and other devices that incorporate our products\nand technologies. Although we believe these estimates are reasonable, any significant changes in customer demand that are\nless favorable than our previous estimates may require additional inventory write-downs and would be reflected in cost of\nsales resulting in a negative impact to our gross margin in that period. For fiscal 2024 and 2023, the net effect from changes\nin this estimate and related reserves was less than 2% of cost of revenues during each period.\nImpairment of Goodwill, Other Indefinite-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets. We monitor our goodwill, other\nindefinite-lived assets and long-lived assets for the existence of impairment indicators and apply judgments in the valuation\nmethods and underlying assumptions utilized in such assessments. During fiscal 2024, there were no material impairment\ncharges for long-lived or indefinite-lived assets. During fiscal 2023, we recorded total impairment charges of approximately\n$400 million related to certain long-lived and other indefinite-lived assets. Such impairments (and the related remaining asset\nvalues) were not individually material. Additionally, the estimated fair values of our QCT and QTL reporting units, based on\nour qualitative assessment, were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values at September 29, 2024.\nLegal and Regulatory Proceedings. We record our best estimate of a loss related to pending legal and regulatory\nproceedings when the loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. We face difficulties in\nevaluating or estimating likely outcomes and/or the amount of possible loss in certain legal and regulatory proceedings.\nIncome Taxes. We make significant judgments and estimates in determining our provision for income taxes, including\nour assessment of our income tax positions given the uncertainties involved in the interpretation and application of complex\ntax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nInformation regarding recent accounting pronouncements and the impact of those pronouncements, if any, on our\nconsolidated financial statements is provided in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1.\nSignificant Accounting Policies.”\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nMarketable Securities\nWe have made investments in marketable securities of companies of varying size, style, industry and geography and\nchanges in investment allocations may affect the price volatility of our investments.\nInterest Rate Risk. We invest a portion of our cash in a number of diversified fixed- and floating-rate securities\nconsisting of cash equivalents, marketable debt securities and time deposits that are subject to interest rate risk. At\nSeptember 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023, a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 100 basis points across the entire\nyield curve on our holdings would have resulted in an immaterial decrease in the fair value of our holdings.\nOther Investments\nEquity Price Risk. We hold investments in non-marketable equity instruments in privately held companies that may be\nimpacted by equity price risks. Volatility in the equity markets could negatively affect our investees’ ability to raise\nadditional capital as well as our ability to realize value from our investments through initial public offerings, mergers or\nprivate sales. Consequently, we could incur impairment losses or realized losses on all or part of the values of our non-\nmarketable equity investments. At September 29, 2024, our non-marketable equity investments (including those accounted\nfor under the equity method) consisted of investments in over 150 companies with an aggregate carrying value included in\nother assets of $1.3 billion.\n48\nDebt and Interest Rate Swap Agreements\nInterest Rate Risk. At September 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023, all of our issued debt was comprised of unsecured\nfixed-rate notes. From time to time, we issue commercial paper for which our exposure to interest rate risk is negligible based\non the original maturities of approximately three months or less.\nWe manage our exposure to certain interest rate risks related to our long-term debt through the use of interest rate swaps.\nWe enter into these agreements to manage interest rate risk associated with our cash equivalents and marketable securities, in\naddition to changes in the fair value of our outstanding debt. At September 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023, we had an\naggregate notional amount of $2.1 billion in interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedges to effectively convert\ncertain fixed-rate interest payments into floating-rate payments on our outstanding debt. At September 29, 2024 and\nSeptember 24, 2023, a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 100 basis points would not cause a material loss in earnings as\nan increase in interest expense related to these interest rate swaps agreements would be offset by an increase in interest\nincome from our cash equivalents and marketable securities portfolio.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nWe manage our exposure to foreign exchange market risks, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative and\nnon-derivative financial instruments, including foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial counterparties\nand net investment hedges. We utilize such derivative financial instruments for hedging or risk management purposes rather\nthan for speculative purposes. Counterparties to these derivative contracts are all major banking institutions. In the event of\nthe financial insolvency or distress of a counterparty to our derivative financial instruments, we may be unable to settle\ntransactions if the counterparty does not provide us with sufficient collateral to secure its net settlement obligations to us,\nwhich could have a negative impact on our results.\nGains or losses on hedged foreign currency transactions and investments, including certain royalties earned from\nlicensees, operating expenses and net investments in foreign subsidiaries, are generally offset by corresponding losses or\ngains on the related hedging instrument.\nFunctional Currency. Financial assets and liabilities held by consolidated subsidiaries that are not denominated in the\nfunctional currency of those entities are subject to the effects of currency fluctuations and may affect reported earnings. As a\nglobal company, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. We may hedge currency\nexposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and certain anticipated\nnonfunctional currency transactions. As a result, we could experience unanticipated gains or losses on anticipated foreign\ncurrency cash flows, as well as economic loss with respect to the recoverability of investments. While we may hedge certain\ntransactions with non-U.S. customers, declines in currency values in certain regions may, if not reversed, adversely affect\nfuture product sales because our products may become more expensive to purchase in the countries of the affected currencies.\nWe have experienced fluctuations in our effective tax rate as a result of foreign currency gains or losses related to our Korean\nwithholding tax receivable (which was $2.2 billion as of September 29, 2024), which is described further in this Annual\nReport in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Notes 3. Income Taxes.” Based on the balance of such foreign\nwithholding tax receivable, an assumed 10% adverse change to foreign exchange rates would result in losses of\napproximately $222 million and $200 million as of September 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023, respectively. Other gains\nand losses from foreign currency transactions were not material/significant for any of the periods presented in this Annual\nReport.\nOur analysis methods used to assess and mitigate the risks discussed above should not be considered projections of\nfuture risks. Additional information regarding the financial instruments mentioned above is provided in this Annual Report in\n“Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1. Significant Accounting Policies,” “Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements, Note 2. Composition of Certain Financial Statement Items,” “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note\n6. Debt,” “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 9. Fair Value Measurements and Marketable Securities.”\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nThe information required by this item is included in this Annual Report on pages F-1 through F-28.\nItem 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\nConclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and our\nprincipal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such terms are defined\nunder Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Based on this\nevaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and\nprocedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report.\n49\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as\nsuch term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management,\nincluding our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness\nof our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under this\nframework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 29,\n2024.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our consolidated financial\nstatements included in this Annual Report, has also audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting\nas of September 29, 2024, as stated in its report which appears on pages F-1 through F-2 in this Annual Report.\nInherent Limitations over Internal Controls\nOur internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures\nthat:\ni. pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and\ndispositions of our assets;\nii. provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated\nfinancial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and\nexpenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and\niii. provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or\ndisposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\nInternal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives\nbecause of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and circumvention by collusion or overriding of\ncontrols. Accordingly, even an effective internal control system may not prevent or detect material misstatements on a timely\nbasis. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become\ninadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 that have\nmaterially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nItem 9B. Other Information\nOn September 12, 2024, Cristiano Amon, our President and Chief Executive Officer, acting as trustee on behalf of his\nfamily trust, terminated the trust’s Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K), which\nprovided for the sale of up to 75,000 shares of our common stock and was previously scheduled to terminate on September\n30, 2025, and adopted a new Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement. The new plan provides for the sale of up to 60,000 shares of\nour common stock and is scheduled to terminate on September 30, 2025.\nItem 9C.

Vinciquerra\n57\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of QUALCOMM Incorporated\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of QUALCOMM Incorporated and its subsidiaries (the\n“Company”) as of September 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations,\ncomprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 29,\n2024, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2)\n(collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of September 29, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial\nposition of the Company as of September 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash\nflows for each of the three years in the period ended September 29, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective\ninternal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control -\nIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal\ncontrol over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,\nincluded in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility\nis to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over\nfinancial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting\nOversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance\nwith the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform\nthe audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in\nall material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond\nto those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the\nconsolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant\nestimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our\naudit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial\nreporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness\nof internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered\nnecessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures\nthat (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and\ndispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to\npermit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and\nexpenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the\ncompany; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial\nstatements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or\ndisclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective,\nor complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated\nF-1\nfinancial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate\nopinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRevenue Recognition – Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (QCT) Customer Incentive Arrangements\nAs described in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s QCT segment, which recorded\nrevenues of $33.2 billion in fiscal 2024, records reductions to revenues for customer incentive arrangements, including\nvolume-related and other pricing rebates and cost reimbursements for marketing and other activities involving certain\nproducts and technologies, in the period that the related revenues are earned. For certain QCT customer incentive\narrangements, there is complexity in applying certain contractual terms to determine the amount recorded as a reduction to\nrevenues. The amounts accrued for customer incentive arrangements are recorded as a reduction to accounts receivable, net\nor as other current liabilities based on whether the Company has the intent and contractual right of offset. Certain amounts\nrecorded as a reduction to revenues for customer incentive arrangements are considered variable consideration and are\nincluded in the transaction price primarily based on estimating the most likely amount expected to be provided to the\ncustomer.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition of QCT\ncustomer incentive arrangements is a critical audit matter are a high degree of auditor effort in performing procedures and\nevaluating audit evidence obtained related to the completeness and accuracy of reductions to revenues and accruals for QCT\ncustomer incentives arrangements recorded in the consolidated financial statements.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall\nopinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to\nmanagement’s review of and accounting for QCT customer incentive arrangements as well as controls relating to\nmanagement’s review over the completeness and accuracy of reductions to revenues in fiscal 2024 and accruals for QCT\ncustomer incentive arrangements as of the balance sheet date. These procedures also included, among others, testing the\ncompleteness and accuracy of reductions to revenues and accruals for QCT customer incentive arrangements recorded in the\nconsolidated

Significant Accounting Policies\nWe are a global technology leader, helping to bring intelligent computing everywhere through the development and\ncommercialization of foundational technologies, including 3G (third generation), 4G (fourth generation) and 5G (fifth\ngeneration) wireless connectivity, high-performance and low-power computing and on-device artificial intelligence (AI). Our\ntechnologies and products have helped power the growth in smartphones and other connected devices. We are scaling our\ninnovations across industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, including automotive and the internet of things (IoT).\nWe derive revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit products and through the licensing of our intellectual property,\nincluding patents and other rights.\nPrinciples of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities and operating results of\nQualcomm, its subsidiaries and any variable interest entities for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary (Note 2).\nIntercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\nFinancial Statement Preparation. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the reported amounts and the disclosure of contingent amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the\naccompanying notes. Examples of our significant accounting estimates and policies that may involve a higher degree of\njudgment and complexity than others include: the estimation of sales-based royalty revenues; the impairment of non-\nmarketable equity investments; the valuation of inventories; the impairment of goodwill, other indefinite-lived assets and\nlong-lived assets; the recognition, measurement and disclosure of loss contingencies related to legal and regulatory\nproceedings; and the calculation of our income tax provision, including the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax\npositions. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to\nthe current year presentation.\nFiscal Year. We operate and report using a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in September. Fiscal 2024\nincluded 53 weeks, and fiscal years 2023 and 2022 included 52 weeks. Our fiscal year for 2025 will include 52 weeks.\nCash Equivalents. We consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less to be cash\nequivalents. Cash equivalents may be comprised of money market funds, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate\nbonds and notes and certain bank time deposits, U.S. Treasury securities and government-related securities. The carrying\namounts approximate fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments.\nMarketable Securities. Marketable securities include marketable equity securities, available-for-sale debt securities and,\nfrom time-to-time, certain time deposits. We classify marketable securities as current or noncurrent based on the nature of the\nsecurities and their availability for use in current operations. Marketable securities are stated at fair value with all realized and\nunrealized gains and losses on investments in marketable equity securities and realized gains and losses on available-for-sale\ndebt securities recognized in investment and other income (expense), net. Debt securities are classified as available-for-sale\nor held-to-maturity at the time of purchase and reevaluated at each balance sheet date. The realized and unrealized gains and\nlosses on marketable securities are determined using the specific identification method.\nIf a debt security has an unrealized loss and we either intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will\nbe required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery, we record an impairment charge to investment and other\nincome (expense), net for the entire amount of the unrealized loss and adjust the amortized cost basis of the security. For the\nremaining debt securities, if an unrealized loss exists, we separate the impairment into the portion of the loss related to credit\nfactors and the portion of the loss that is not related to credit factors. Unrealized gains or unrealized losses that are not related\nto credit factors on available-for-sale debt securities are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive\nincome (loss), net of income taxes. Unrealized losses that are related to credit loss factors on available-for-sale debt securities\nand subsequent adjustments to the credit loss are recorded as an allowance for credit losses, which is included in investment\nand other income (expense), net. In evaluating whether a credit loss exists, we consider a variety of factors, including the\nsignificance of the decline in value as compared to the cost basis; underlying factors contributing to a decline in the prices of\nsecurities in a single asset class; the security’s relative performance versus its peers, sector or asset class; the market and\neconomy in general; views of external investment managers; news or financial information that has been released specific to\nthe investee; and the outlook for the overall industry in which the investee operates.\nEquity Method and Non-marketable Equity Investments. Equity investments in common stock or in-substance common\nstock for which we have significant influence, but not control, over the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the\ninvestee’s activities are accounted for under the equity method. Our share of gains and losses in equity method investments\nare recorded in investment and other income (expense), net. We eliminate unrealized profit or loss related to transactions with\nequity method investees in relation to our ownership interest in the investee, which is recorded as a component of equity in\nnet earnings (losses) in investees in investment and other income (expense), net. Non-marketable equity investments (for\nwhich we do not have significant influence or control) are investments without readily determinable fair values that are\ngenerally recorded based on initial cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus adjustments resulting from observable price\nchanges in orderly transactions for identical or similar securities, if any. All gains and losses on investments in non-\nmarketable equity securities, realized and unrealized, are recognized in investment and other income (expense), net. We\nmonitor equity method and non-marketable equity investments for events or circumstances that could indicate the\ninvestments are impaired, such as a deterioration in the investee’s financial condition and business forecasts and lower\nF-8\nQUALCOMM Incorporated\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nvaluations in recently completed or anticipated financings, and recognize a charge to investment and other income (expense),\nnet for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value. For equity method investments, we record\nimpairment losses in earnings only when impairments are considered other-than-temporary.\nDerivatives. Our primary objectives for holding derivative instruments are to manage foreign exchange risk for certain\nforeign currency revenues, operating expenses, receivables and payables and to manage interest rate risk associated with our\ncash equivalents, marketable securities and long-term debt. Derivative instruments are recorded at fair value and included in\nother current or noncurrent assets or liabilities based on their maturity dates. Counterparties to these derivative instruments\nare all major banking institutions. At September 29, 2024, the aggregate fair value of our derivative instruments recorded in\ntotal assets and in total liabilities were $30 million and $138 million, respectively. At September 24, 2023, the aggregate fair\nvalue of our derivative instruments recorded in total assets and in total liabilities were $32 million and $317 million,\nrespectively.\nForeign Currency Hedges: We manage our exposure to foreign exchange market risks, when deemed appropriate,\nthrough the use of derivative instruments, including foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial\ncounterparties, that may or may not be designated as hedging instruments. These derivative instruments generally have\nmaturity dates between one and 24 months. Gains and losses arising from such contracts that are designated as cash flow\nhedging instruments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as gains and losses on\nderivative instruments, net of income taxes. The hedging gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\nare subsequently reclassified to revenues or costs and expenses, as applicable, in the consolidated statements of operations in\nthe same period in which the underlying transactions affect our earnings. For foreign currency forward contracts not\ndesignated as hedging instruments, the changes in fair value are recorded in investment and other income (expense), net in\nthe period of change.\nThe cash flows associated with such derivative instruments are classified as cash flows from operating activities in the\nconsolidated statements of cash flows, which is the same category as the hedged transaction.\nInterest Rate Swaps: From time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements that allow us to effectively convert\nfixed-rate payments into floating-rate payments on portions of our outstanding long-term debt. We enter into these\nagreements to manage interest rate risk associated with our cash equivalents and marketable securities, in addition to changes\nin the fair value of our outstanding debt. These transactions are designated as fair value hedges, and the gains and losses\nrelated to changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps substantially offset changes in the fair value of the hedged\nportion of the underlying debt that are attributable to changes in the market interest rates. The net gains and losses on the\ninterest rate swaps, as well as the offsetting gains or losses on the related fixed-rate debt attributable to the hedged risks, are\nrecognized as interest expense in the current period. The interest settlement payments associated with the interest rate swap\nagreements are classified as cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nFrom time to time, we also enter into forward-starting interest rate swaps to hedge the variability of forecasted interest\npayments on certain anticipated debt issuances. These swaps are designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions.\nThe gains and losses arising from such contracts are recorded as a component in accumulated other comprehensive income\n(loss) as gains and losses on derivative instruments. When the anticipated debt is issued, any associated swaps are terminated,\nand the hedging gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are recorded to interest expense over the\nterm of the hedged portions of the related debt issued.\nGross Notional Amounts: The gross notional amounts of our foreign currency and interest rate derivatives by instrument\ntype were as follows (in millions):\nSeptember 29, September 24,\n2024 2023\nForwards $ 2,723 $ 2,432\nOptions 792 667\nSwaps 2,050 2,050\n$ 5,565 $ 5,149\nThe gross notional amounts of our derivatives by currency were as follows (in millions):\nSeptember 29, September 24,\n2024 2023\nChinese renminbi $ 1,456 $ 1,333\nIndian rupee 1,373 1,151\nUnited States dollar 2,205 2,181\nOther 531 484\n$ 5,565 $ 5,149\nF-9\nQUALCOMM Incorporated\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFair Value Measurements. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to\ntransfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants as of the measurement date. Applicable accounting guidance provides an established\nhierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of\nunobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that\nmarket participants would use in valuing the asset or liability and are developed based on market data obtained from sources\nindependent of us. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our assumptions about the factors that market participants\nwould use in valuing the asset or liability. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:\n• Level 1 includes financial instruments for which quoted market prices for identical instruments are available in\nactive markets.\n• Level 2 includes financial instruments for which there are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1\nthat are observable for the instrument.\n• Level 3 includes financial instruments for which fair value is derived from valuation techniques in which one or\nmore significant inputs are unobservable, including our own assumptions.\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair\nvalue measurement. We review the fair value hierarchy classification on a quarterly basis. Changes in the observability of\nvaluation inputs may result in a reclassification of levels for certain securities within the fair value hierarchy. We recognize\ntransfers into and out of levels within the fair value hierarchy at the end of the fiscal month in which the actual event or\nchange in circumstances that caused the transfer to occur.\nCash Equivalents and Marketable Securities: We obtain pricing information from quoted market prices, pricing vendors\nor quotes from brokers/dealers. We conduct reviews of our primary pricing vendors to determine whether the inputs used in\nthe vendor’s pricing processes are deemed to be observable. Contractual sale restrictions are not considered in measuring the\nfair value of marketable equity securities. The fair value for interest-bearing securities includes accrued interest. The fair\nvalue of U.S. Treasury securities and government-related securities, corporate bonds and notes and common stock is\ngenerally determined using standard observable inputs, including reported trades, market based quotes, matrix pricing,\nbenchmark yields, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets and/or benchmark securities. The fair value of\nmortgage- and asset-backed securities is derived from the use of matrix pricing (prices for similar securities) or, in some\ncases, cash flow pricing models with observable inputs, such as contractual terms, maturity, credit rating and/or securitization\nstructure to determine the timing and amount of future cash flows.\nDerivative Instruments: Derivative instruments that are traded on an exchange are valued using quoted market prices and\nare included in Level 1. Derivative instruments that are not traded on an exchange are valued using conventional calculations/\nmodels that are primarily based on observable inputs, such as foreign currency exchange rates, volatilities and interest rates,\nand therefore, such derivative instruments are included in Level 2.\nOther Investments and Other Liabilities: Other investments and other liabilities included in Level 1 are comprised of our\ndeferred compensation plan liabilities and related assets, which consist of mutual funds and are included in other current\nassets and other assets. Gains and losses on the revaluation of our deferred compensation plan assets are recorded in\ninvestment and other income (expense), net. Corresponding offsetting amounts related to the revaluation of our deferred\ncompensation plan liabilities are included in operating expenses. Other investments included in Level 3 are comprised of\nconvertible debt instruments issued by private companies. The inputs we use to estimate the fair values of these instruments\nare generally unobservable, and therefore, they are included in Level 3.\nNonrecurring Fair Value Measurements: We measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.\nThese assets and liabilities include equity method and non-marketable equity investments, assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed in an acquisition or in a nonmonetary exchange, and property, plant and equipment and intangible assets that are\nwritten down to fair value when they are held for sale or determined to be impaired, all of which are generally measured\nbased on unobservable inputs using an income or market approach.\nInventories. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value using the first-in, first-out method.\nRecoverability of inventories is assessed based on review of future customer demand that considers multiple factors,\nincluding committed purchase orders from customers as well as purchase commitment projections provided by customers and\nour own forecasts of customer demand, among other factors. This valuation also requires us to make judgments and\nassumptions based on information currently available about market conditions, including competition, anticipated\ntechnological changes, internal product life cycle and development plans, product pricing and other broader market\nconditions that may impact customer demand, such as the impact of the macroeconomic environment in fiscal 2022 and 2023.\nWe generally place binding purchase orders with our suppliers in advance of receiving contractually binding forecasts and/or\npurchase orders from our customers. The time period between placing purchase orders with our suppliers and receiving\ncontractually binding forecasts and/or purchase orders from our customers has increased and may continue to increase as a\nresult of extended manufacturing lead-times, driven in part by a continued transition to leading-edge technologies and/or\nincreased complexity in the manufacturing process of our products. If we overestimate demand for our products, the amount\nof our loss will be impacted by our ability to reduce inventory purchases from our suppliers. Further, if our customers cancel\npurchase orders or alter forecasts this may result in excess inventory on hand. Our assumptions of future product demand are\nF-10\nQUALCOMM Incorporated\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\ninherently uncertain, and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to record additional write-downs in the\nfuture if demand forecasted for specific products is greater than actual demand.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment. Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated or amortized using\nthe straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Upon the retirement or disposition of property, plant and\nequipment, the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed, and a gain or loss is recorded, when\nappropriate. Buildings on owned land are depreciated over 30 years, and building improvements are depreciated over 15\nyears. Leasehold improvements and buildings on leased land are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives, not\nto exceed 15 years and 30 years, respectively, or the remaining term of the related lease. Other property, plant and equipment\nhave useful lives ranging from 2 to 15 years. Maintenance, repairs and minor renewals or betterments are charged to expense\nas incurred.\nOperating Leases. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized for leases with lease terms greater than 12 months\nbased on the present value of the future lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. Operating leases are\nincluded in other assets, other current liabilities and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Our lease terms may\ninclude options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such option. We account\nfor substantially all lease and related non-lease components together as a single lease component. Operating lease expense is\nrecognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the value assigned to the\nnet tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired. Acquired intangible assets other than goodwill are\namortized over their useful lives unless the lives are determined to be indefinite. For intangible assets purchased in a business\ncombination, the estimated fair values of the assets acquired are used to establish their recorded values. Valuation techniques\nconsistent with the market approach, income approach and/or cost approach are used to measure fair value. An estimate of\nfair value can be affected by many assumptions that require significant judgment. For example, the income approach\ngenerally requires us to use assumptions to estimate the present value of future cash flows including those related to total\naddressable market, pricing and share forecasts, competition, technology obsolescence, future tax rates and discount rates.\nOur estimate of the fair value of certain assets may differ materially from that determined by others who use different\nassumptions or utilize different business models and from the future cash flows actually realized.\nImpairment of Goodwill, Other Indefinite-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived\nintangible assets are tested annually for impairment in the fourth fiscal quarter, and in interim periods if events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. If a qualitative assessment is used and we determine that the fair\nvalue of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50%) less\nthan its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test will be performed. If goodwill is quantitatively assessed for\nimpairment and a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, the difference is recorded as an impairment. Other\nindefinite-lived intangible assets are quantitatively assessed for impairment, if necessary, by comparing their estimated fair\nvalues to their carrying values. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, the difference is recorded as an impairment. Our\njudgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to goodwill, other indefinite-lived\nassets and long-lived assets may be based on operational performance of our businesses, market conditions, expected selling\nprice and/or other factors. Although there are inherent uncertainties in this assessment process, the estimates and assumptions\nwe use, including estimates of future cash flows and discount rates, are consistent with our internal planning, when\nappropriate. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record an impairment\ncharge on a portion or all of such assets. Furthermore, we cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment-triggering\nevents nor the impact such events might have on our reported asset values.\nLong-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for\nimpairment when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or\nasset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying\namount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset\ngroup. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is\nrecognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the\nasset or asset group. Long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of their carrying amounts or their\nestimated fair values less costs to sell and are not depreciated.\nRevenue Recognition. We derive revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit products and licensing of our\nintellectual property. We also generate revenues from licensing system software and by performing development and other\nservices and from other product sales. The timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized in\neach case depends upon a variety of factors, including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our\nperformance obligations.\nRevenues from sales of our products are recognized upon transfer of control to the customer, which is generally at the\ntime of shipment. Revenues from providing services are typically recognized over time as our performance obligation is\nsatisfied. Revenues from providing services and licensing system software were each less than 5% of total revenues for all\nperiods presented.\nWe grant licenses or otherwise provide rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which, among other\nrights, includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture, sale or use of certain wireless products.\nF-11\nQUALCOMM Incorporated\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nLicense agreements contain a single performance obligation that represents ongoing access to a portfolio of intellectual\nproperty over the license term since such agreements provide the licensee the right to access a portfolio of intellectual\nproperty that exists at inception of the license agreement and to updates and new intellectual property that is added to the\nlicensed portfolio during the term of the agreement that are highly interdependent or interrelated.\nLicensees pay per-unit royalties based on their sales of products incorporating or using our licensed intellectual property\nand, to a lesser extent, lump sum payments (license fees, substantially all of which were recognized prior to fiscal 2024).\nLicense fees are recognized as revenues on a straight-line basis over the estimated period of benefit of the license to the\nlicensee. Per-unit royalties are generally based upon a percentage of the wholesale (i.e., licensee’s) selling price of complete\nlicensed products, net of certain permissible deductions (including transportation, insurance, packing costs and other items),\nwith certain products subject to per unit minimums and/or per unit caps. Certain products may also have a fixed royalty\namount per unit. We estimate and recognize sales-based royalties on such licensed products in the period in which the\nassociated sales occur, considering all relevant information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to\nus. Our estimates of sales-based royalties are based largely on preliminary royalty estimates provided by our licensees and, to\na lesser extent, an assessment of the volume of devices supplied into the market that incorporate or use our licensed\nintellectual property, combined with an estimate of the mix of such sales on a licensee-by-licensee basis, as well as the\nlicensees’ average wholesale prices of such products. In the periods presented, we have recognized immaterial differences\nbetween preliminary royalty estimates provided to us by licensees and actual amounts reported and paid by licensees, which\nare generally received the following quarter, as licensees have not completed their royalty reporting process at the time\nestimates are provided to us, and in certain cases, they do not provide all necessary information in order for us to calculate an\nestimate of royalties due, which requires us to independently estimate certain information. We also consider in our estimates\nof sales-based royalties any changes in pricing we plan or expect to make and certain constraints on our ability to estimate\nsuch royalties. As a result of recognizing revenues in the period in which the licensees’ sales occur using estimates,\nadjustments to revenues are required in subsequent periods to reflect changes in estimates as new information becomes\navailable, primarily resulting from actual amounts reported by our licensees.\nWe account for a contract with a customer/licensee when it is legally enforceable, the parties are committed to perform\ntheir respective obligations, the rights of the parties regarding the goods and/or services to be transferred are identified,\npayment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of substantially all of the consideration\nis probable, which for product sales, is generally when a customer purchase order is executed and for licensing revenues, is\ngenerally upon execution of a license agreement. If all such conditions are not met, revenues and any associated receivables\nare generally not recognized until such time that the required conditions are met. Cash collected from customers prior to a\ncontract existing is recorded to other customer-related liabilities in other current liabilities.\nFrom time to time, companies initiate various strategies in an attempt to negotiate, renegotiate, reduce and/or eliminate\ntheir need to pay royalties to us for the use of our intellectual property, which may include disputing, underreporting,\nunderpaying, not reporting and/or not paying royalties owed to us under their license agreements with us, or reporting to us in\na manner that is not in compliance with their contractual obligations. In such cases, we estimate and recognize licensing\nrevenues only when we have a contract, as defined in the revenue recognition guidance, which includes, among other items,\nevaluating whether our license agreements remain valid and enforceable and evaluating licensees’ conduct and whether they\nremain committed to perform their respective obligations. We also estimate and recognize licensing revenues only to the\nextent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenues recognized will not occur, which includes, among other\nitems, determining the expected impact, if any, to revenues of any license agreements that may be renegotiated and/or are\nnewly entered into. We analyze the risk of a significant revenue reversal considering both the likelihood and magnitude of the\nreversal and, if necessary, constrain the amount of estimated revenues recognized in order to mitigate this risk, which may\nresult in recognizing revenues less than amounts contractually owed to us. These aforementioned estimates may require\nsignificant judgment.\nWe measure revenues (including our estimates of sales-based royalties) based on the amount of consideration we expect\nto receive in exchange for products or services. We record reductions to revenues for customer incentive arrangements,\nincluding volume-related and other pricing rebates and cost reimbursements for marketing and other activities involving\ncertain of our products and technologies, in the period that the related revenues are earned. For certain QCT (Qualcomm\nCDMA Technologies) customer incentive arrangements, there is complexity in applying certain contractual terms to\ndetermine the amount recorded as a reduction to revenues. For the periods presented, no significant reversals of revenues\nhave been made related to such amounts previously recorded. The amounts accrued for customer incentive arrangements are\nrecorded as a reduction to accounts receivable, net or as other current liabilities based on whether we have the intent and\nenforceable right of offset. Certain amounts recorded as a reduction to revenues for customer incentive arrangements are\nconsidered variable consideration and are included in the transaction price primarily based on estimating the most likely\namount expected to be provided to the customer/licensee.\nAdjustments made to revenues in subsequent periods to reflect changes in estimates as new information becomes\navailable are included in our disclosure of revenues recognized from previously satisfied performance obligations (Note 2).\nRevenues recognized from sales of our products and sales-based royalties are generally included in accounts receivable,\nnet (including unbilled receivables) based on our unconditional right to payment for satisfied or partially satisfied\nF-12\nQUALCOMM Incorporated\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nperformance obligations. Our payment terms are generally short-term in duration, with payment due shortly after delivery for\nproduct sales and within the following quarter for QTL sales-based royalties.\nShare-Based Compensation. Share-based compensation expense for equity-classified awards, principally related to\nrestricted stock units (RSUs), is measured at the grant date, or at the acquisition date for awards assumed in business\ncombinations, based on the estimated fair value of the award and is recognized over the employee’s requisite service period.\nThe fair values of RSUs are estimated based on the fair market values of the underlying stock on the dates of grant or dates\nthe RSUs are assumed. Share-based compensation expense is adjusted to exclude amounts related to share-based awards that\nare expected to be forfeited.\nLegal and Regulatory Proceedings. We are currently involved in certain legal and regulatory proceedings. Litigation\nand investigations are inherently uncertain, and we face difficulties in evaluating or estimating likely outcomes or ranges of\npossible loss in antitrust and trade regulation investigations in particular. Investigations by antitrust and trade regulation\nagencies are not conducted in a consistent manner across jurisdictions. Further, each country and agency has different sets of\nlaws, rules and regulations, both substantive and procedural, as well as different legal principles, theories and potential\nremedies, and some agencies may seek to use the investigation to advance domestic policy goals. Depending on the\njurisdiction, these investigations can involve non-transparent procedures under which we may not receive access to evidence\nrelied upon by the enforcement agency or that may be exculpatory and may not be informed of the specific legal theories or\nevidence considered or relied upon by the agency. Unlike in civil litigation in the United States, in foreign proceedings, we\nmay not be entitled to discovery or depositions, allowed to cross-examine witnesses or confront our accusers. As a result, we\nmay not be aware of, and may not be entitled to know, all allegations against us, or the information or documents provided to,\nor discovered or prepared by, the agency. Accordingly, we may have little or no idea what an agency’s intent is with respect\nto liability, penalties or the timing of a decision. In many cases the agencies are given significant discretion, and any available\nprecedent may have limited, if any, predictive value in their jurisdictions or other jurisdictions. Accordingly, we cannot\npredict the outcome of these matters. A broad range of remedies with respect to our business practices that are deemed to\nviolate applicable laws are potentially available. These remedies may include, among others, injunctions, monetary damages\nor fines or other orders to pay money and the issuance of orders to cease certain conduct and/or to modify our business\npractices.\nIf there is at least a reasonable possibility that a material loss may have been incurred associated with pending legal and\nregulatory proceedings, we disclose such fact, and if reasonably estimable, we provide an estimate of the possible loss or\nrange of possible loss. We record our best estimate of a loss related to pending legal and regulatory proceedings when the loss\nis considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Where a range of loss can be reasonably estimated with\nno best estimate in the range, we record the minimum estimated liability. As additional information becomes available, we\nassess the potential liability related to pending legal and regulatory proceedings and revise our estimates and update our\ndisclosures accordingly. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to\nwhether a loss is reasonably estimable. Our legal costs associated with defending ourselves are recorded to expense as\nincurred.\nForeign Currency. Certain foreign subsidiaries use a local currency as the functional currency. Resulting translation\ngains or losses are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Transaction gains or losses\nrelated to balances denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity involved are recognized in the\nconsolidated statements of operations.\nIncome Taxes. The asset and liability approach is used to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected\nfuture tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities.\nTax law and rate changes are reflected in income in the period such changes are enacted. We record a valuation allowance to\nreduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We include interest and penalties related\nto income taxes, including unrecognized tax benefits, within income tax expense. We classify all deferred tax assets and\nliabilities as noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheets. We recognize excess tax benefits and shortfall tax detriments\nassociated with share-based awards in the consolidated statements of operations, as a component of income tax expense,\nwhen realized.\nOur income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the Internal\nRevenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with\nuncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a\ntwo-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available\nevidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related\nappeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than\n50% likely of being realized upon settlement. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and\nadjust the income tax provision, income taxes payable and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a\nrevision become known.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions, and the assessment of our\nincome tax positions involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various\ntaxing jurisdictions. In addition, the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation,\njudgment and uncertainty. Tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy,\nchanges in legislation, the evolution of regulations and court rulings. Significant judgments and estimates are required in\nF-13\nQUALCOMM Incorporated\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\ndetermining our provision for income taxes, including those related to special deductions such as FDII (foreign-derived\nintangible income), tax incentives, intercompany research and development cost-sharing arrangements, transfer pricing, tax\ncredits and the realizability of deferred tax assets. While we believe we have appropriate support for the positions we have\ntaken or that we plan to take on our tax returns, we regularly assess the potential outcomes of examinations by taxing\nauthorities in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Therefore, the actual liability for U.S. or foreign\ntaxes may be materially different from our estimates, which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or\npotentially reverse previously recorded tax liabilities. For tax years prior to fiscal 2021, we are participating in the IRS\nCompliance Assurance Process program whereby we endeavor to agree with the IRS on the treatment of all issues prior to\nfiling our federal return.\nStock Repurchases. To reflect share repurchases in the consolidated balance sheet, we (i) reduce common stock for the\npar value of the shares, (ii) reduce paid-in capital for the amount in excess of par to zero during the quarter in which the\nshares are repurchased and (iii) record the residual amount, if any, to retained earnings.\nEarnings Per Share. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of\ncommon shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by\nthe combination of the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding and the weighted-average number of dilutive\ncommon share equivalents, comprised of shares issuable under our share-based compensation plans, during the reporting\nperiod, using the treasury stock method. The following table provides information about the diluted earnings per share\ncalculation (in millions):\n2024 2023 2022\nDilutive common share equivalents included in diluted shares 14 9 14\nShares of common stock equivalents not included because the effect would be anti-\ndilutive or certain performance conditions were not satisfied at the end of the period 4 7 1\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted.\nSegment Reporting Disclosures: In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new\nrequirements to disclose certain incremental segment information on an annual and interim basis, including (among other\nitems) additional disclosure about significant segment expenses. We will adopt the new requirements for our annual periods\nstarting in fiscal 2025 (and interim periods thereafter) on a retrospective basis.\nIncome Tax Disclosures: In December 2023, the FASB issued new requirements to disclose annually certain additional\ndetailed income tax information related to the effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid, among other items. We\nwill adopt the new requirements starting in fiscal 2026 on a retrospective basis.\nIncome Statement - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures: In November 2024, the FASB issued new requirements to\ndisclose certain additional expense information on an annual and interim basis, including (among other items) the amounts of\npurchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation and intangible asset amortization included within each income\nstatement expense caption, as applicable. We will adopt the new requirements starting in fiscal 2028 on a prospective basis.\nNote 2.

We allocate goodwill to our reporting units for impairment testing purposes. The\nfollowing table presents the goodwill allocated to our segments, as described in Note 8, as well as the changes in the carrying\namounts of goodwill during fiscal 2024 and 2023 (in millions):\nQCT QTL Total\nBalance at September 25, 2022 $ 9,777 $ 731 $ 10,508\nAcquisitions 76 — 76\nForeign currency translation adjustments 56 2 58\nBalance at September 24, 2023 (1) 9,909 733 10,642\nAcquisitions 126 — 126\nForeign currency translation adjustments 30 1 31\nBalance at September 29, 2024 (1) $ 10,065 $ 734 $ 10,799\n(1) Cumulative goodwill impairments were $812 million at both September 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023.\nThe components of other intangible assets, net were as follows (in millions):\nSeptember 29, 2024 September 24, 2023\nWeighted- Weighted-\naverage average\nGross amortization Gross amortization\nCarrying Accumulated period Carrying Accumulated period\nAmount Amortization (years) Amount Amortization (years)\nTechnology-based $ 2,498 $ (1,275) 9 $ 4,292 $ (2,912) 12\nOther 69 (48) 11 70 (42) 11\n$ 2,567 $ (1,323) 9 $ 4,362 $ (2,954) 11\nAll of these intangible assets are subject to amortization, other than acquired in-process research and development which\nhad a carrying value of $188 million and $435 million at September 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023, respectively.\nAmortization expense related to these intangible assets was $311 million, $418 million and $482 million for fiscal 2024, 2023\nand 2022, respectively. At September 29, 2024, amortization expense related to other intangible assets, including acquired in-\nprocess research and development beginning upon the completion of the underlying projects, is expected to be $290 million,\n$274 million, $187 million, $156 million and $129 million for each of the five years from fiscal 2025 through 2029,\nrespectively, and $208 million thereafter.\nF-15\nQUALCOMM Incorporated\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nEquity Method and Non-marketable Equity Investments.

We disaggregate our revenues by segment (Note 8), by products and services (as presented on our\nconsolidated statements of operations), and for our QCT segment, by revenue stream, which is based on the industry and\napplication in which our products are sold (as presented below). In certain cases, the determination of QCT revenues by\nindustry and application requires the use of certain assumptions. Substantially all of QCT’s revenues consist of equipment\nrevenues that are recognized at a point in time, and substantially all of QTL’s revenues represent licensing revenues that are\nrecognized over time and are principally from royalties generated through our licensees’ sales of mobile handsets. QCT\nrevenue streams were as follows (in millions):\n2024 2023 2022\nHandsets (1) $ 24,863 $ 22,570 $ 28,815\nAutomotive (2) 2,910 1,872 1,509\nIoT (internet of things) (3) 5,423 5,940 7,353\nTotal QCT revenues $ 33,196 $ 30,382 $ 37,677\n(1) Includes revenues from products sold for use in mobile handsets.\n(2) Includes revenues from products sold for use in automobiles, including connectivity, digital cockpit and ADAS/AD.\n(3) Primarily includes products sold for use in the following industries and applications: consumer (including PCs, tablets, voice and music\nand XR), edge networking (including mobile broadband and wireless access points) and industrial (including handhelds, retail, tracking\nand logistics and utilities).\nRevenues recognized from performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in previous periods generally include\ncertain QCT sales-based royalty revenues related to system software, certain amounts related to QCT customer incentives and\nQTL royalty revenues recognized related to devices sold in prior periods (including adjustments to prior period royalty\nestimates, which includes the impact of the reporting by our licensees of actual royalties due) and were as follows (in\nmillions):\n2024 2023 2022\nRevenues recognized from previously satisfied performance obligations $ 558 $ 598 $ 788\nUnearned revenues (which are considered contract liabilities) consist primarily of certain customer contracts for which\nQCT received fees upfront and QTL license fees for intellectual property with continuing performance obligations\n(substantially all of which were recognized prior to fiscal 2024). In fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, we recognized revenues of\n$312 million and $355 million, respectively, that were recorded as unearned revenues at September 24, 2023 and\nSeptember 25, 2022, respectively.\nRemaining performance obligations, which are primarily included in unearned revenues (as presented on our\nconsolidated balance sheet), represent the aggregate amount of the transaction price of certain customer contracts yet to be\nrecognized as revenues as of the end of the reporting period and exclude revenues related to (a) contracts that have an original\nexpected duration of one year or less and (b) sales-based royalties (i.e., future royalty revenues) pursuant to our license\nF-16\nQUALCOMM Incorporated\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nagreements. Our patent license agreements with key OEMs are generally long-term, with terms expiring at varying dates\nbetween fiscal 2025 and 2031. We generally seek to renew or renegotiate such license agreements prior to expiration.\nConcentrations. A significant portion of our revenues are concentrated with a small number of customers/licensees of\nour QCT and QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) segments. The comparability of customer/licensee concentrations for\nthe periods presented are impacted by the timing of customer/licensees device launches and/or innovation cycles and other\nseasonal trends, among other fluctuations in demand. Revenues from each customer/licensee that were 10% or greater of total\nrevenues were as follows:\nSeptember 29, September 24, September 25,\n2024 2023 2022\nCustomer/licensee (x) 22% 27% 21%\nCustomer/licensee (y) 19 21 21\nCustomer/licensee (z) 12 * *\n* Less than 10%\nWe rely on sole- or limited-source suppliers for some products, particularly products in our QCT segment, subjecting us\nto possible shortages of raw materials or manufacturing capacity. The loss of a supplier or the inability of a supplier to meet\nperformance or quality specifications or delivery schedules could harm our ability to meet our delivery obligations and/or\nnegatively impact our revenues, business operations and ability to compete for future business.\nOther Income, Costs and Expenses. Other expenses in fiscal 2024 consisted primarily of restructuring and restructuring-\nrelated charges (substantially all of which related to severance costs) and a charge related to the settlement of the securities\nclass action lawsuit (Note 7).\nOther expenses in fiscal 2023 consisted of $712 million in total restructuring and restructuring-related charges\n(substantially all of which related to severance costs, resulting from certain cost reduction actions committed to in fiscal\n2023) and a $150 million intangible asset impairment charge related to in-process research and development.\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2022, the General Court of the European Union issued a ruling annulling a decision made by\nthe European Commission (EC) in fiscal 2018. As a result of the court’s decision, we recorded a $1.1 billion benefit to other\nincome in fiscal 2022 resulting from the reversal of the previously accrued EC fine.\nDiscontinued Operations. In fiscal 2022, we and SSW Partners, a New York-based investment partnership, entered into\nand closed a definitive agreement to acquire Veoneer, Inc. (Veoneer). Total cash consideration paid in the transaction was\n$4.7 billion. We acquired Veoneer’s Arriver business and SSW Partners retained Veoneer’s Tier-1 automotive supplier\nbusinesses, primarily consisting of the Active Safety and the Restraint Control Systems businesses (the Non-Arriver\nbusinesses), with the intent to sell such businesses in multiple transactions. In exchange for us funding substantially all of the\ncash consideration payable in the transaction, we obtained the right to receive a majority of the proceeds upon the sale of the\nNon-Arriver businesses by SSW Partners. On June 1, 2023, SSW Partners completed the sale of Veoneer’s Active Safety\nbusiness to Magna International Inc. for net cash proceeds of $1.5 billion. On March 1, 2024, SSW Partners completed the\nsale of Veoneer’s Restraint Control Systems (RCS) business to American Industrial Partners Capital Fund VII.\nAlthough we did not own or operate the Non-Arriver businesses, we were the primary beneficiary, within the meaning of\nthe FASB accounting guidance related to consolidation (ASC 810), of these businesses under the variable interest model,\nuntil sold by SSW. Factors considered in reaching this conclusion included, among others: (i) our involvement in the design\nof and our funding of substantially all of the total cash consideration payable in the transaction and (ii) our obligation to\nabsorb losses and rights to receive returns from the Non-Arriver businesses. Accordingly, through the date of disposition by\nSSW Partners, the assets and liabilities of the Non-Arriver businesses have been consolidated and presented as held for sale\non our consolidated balance sheets, and the operating results (including the gain or loss on sale, the amounts of which were\nnot material) have been presented as discontinued operations.

Our cash flows from operations are adversely affected due to\nsignificantly higher cash tax payments. However, since the resulting deferred tax asset is established at the statutory rate of\n21% (rather than the current effective tax rate of 13% to 16% after considering the FDII deduction), capitalization favorably\nF-18\nQUALCOMM Incorporated\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\naffects our total provision for income taxes and results of operations. The adverse cash flow impact and favorable tax\nprovision impact will diminish in future years as capitalized research and development expenditures continue to amortize.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we completed an intra-group transfer of intellectual property to better align certain\nintellectual property ownership within our QCT business, which resulted in the recognition of a tax benefit of $317 million\nduring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 from the establishment of a deferred tax asset. Such tax benefit was based on the\nvalue of the intellectual property transferred, which was measured using an income approach based on significant\nunobservable inputs.\nBeginning in fiscal 2019, as a result of certain court rulings in Korea, among other factors, we decided to apply for a\npartial refund claim for taxes previously withheld from licensees in Korea on payments due under their license agreements to\nwhich we have claimed a foreign tax credit in the United States. As a result, $2.2 billion and $2.0 billion was recorded as a\nnoncurrent income taxes receivable (recorded in other assets) at September 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023, respectively,\nand $2.5 billion and $2.3 billion was recorded as a noncurrent liability for uncertain tax benefits (recorded in other liabilities)\nat September 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023, respectively.\nAt September 29, 2024, our remaining future payments were $1.0 billion for a one-time repatriation tax accrued in fiscal\n2018, after application of certain tax credits, which is payable in installments over the next two years. At September 29, 2024,\n$530 million was recorded in other current liabilities, reflecting the next installment due in January 2025, with the remaining\nnoncurrent portion presented in other liabilities on our balance sheet.\nWe had deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as follows (in millions):\nSeptember 29, September 24,\n2024 2023\nCapitalized research and development expenditures $ 3,015 $ 1,490\nUnused tax credits 2,172 1,819\nCustomer incentives 769 659\nUnused net operating losses 719 364\nAccrued liabilities and reserves 397 401\nOperating lease liabilities 282 216\nShare-based compensation 152 285\nUnrealized losses on other investments and marketable securities 146 159\nOther 459 409\nTotal gross deferred tax assets 8,111 5,802\nValuation allowance (2,061) (1,803)\nTotal net deferred tax assets 6,050 3,999\nIntangible assets (388) (335)\nOperating lease assets (248) (194)\nUnrealized gains on other investments and marketable securities (169) (101)\nOther (197) (170)\nTotal deferred tax liabilities (1,002) (800)\nNet deferred tax assets $ 5,048 $ 3,199\nReported as:\nNon-current deferred tax assets $ 5,162 $ 3,310\nNon-current deferred tax liabilities (1) (114) (111)\n$ 5,048 $ 3,199\n(1) Non-current deferred tax liabilities were included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nAt September 29, 2024, we had unused foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $2.6 billion, of which substantially all\nmay be carried forward indefinitely, unused state net operating loss carryforwards of $817 million expiring from 2025\nthrough 2037 and unused federal net operating loss carryforwards of $150 million, of which $102 million expire from 2025\nthrough 2037 and $48 million may be carried forward indefinitely. At September 29, 2024, we had unused state tax credits of\n$1.9 billion, of which substantially all may be carried forward indefinitely, unused federal tax credits of $219 million\nexpiring from 2028 through 2041 and unused tax credits of $92 million in foreign jurisdictions expiring from 2031 through\n2044. We do not expect our federal net operating loss carryforwards to expire unused.\nF-19\nQUALCOMM Incorporated\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAt September 29, 2024, we have provided a valuation allowance on certain state tax credits, foreign deferred tax assets\nand state net operating losses of $1.9 billion, $121 million and $41 million respectively. The valuation allowance reflects the\nuncertainties surrounding our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to utilize our net\ndeferred tax assets. We believe, more likely than not, that we will have sufficient taxable income to utilize our remaining\ndeferred tax assets.\nA summary of the changes in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 follows (in\nmillions):\n2024 2023 2022\nBeginning balance of unrecognized tax benefits $ 2,296 $ 2,191 $ 2,136\nAdditions based on prior year tax positions 2 10 58\nReductions for prior year tax positions and lapse in statute of limitations (1) (63) (136)\nAdditions for current year tax positions 153 158 184\nSettlements with taxing authorities — — (51)\nEnding balance of unrecognized tax benefits $ 2,450 $ 2,296 $ 2,191\nOf the $2.5 billion of unrecognized tax benefits, $2.3 billion has been recorded to other liabilities. We believe that it is\nreasonably possible that certain unrecognized tax benefits recorded at September 29, 2024 may result in a cash payment in\nfiscal 2025. Unrecognized tax benefits at September 29, 2024 included $91 million for tax positions that, if recognized,\nwould impact the effective tax rate. The unrecognized tax benefits differ from the amount that would affect our effective tax\nrate primarily because the unrecognized tax benefits were included on a gross basis and did not reflect related receivables or\nsecondary impacts, such as the federal deduction for state taxes, adjustments to deferred tax assets and the valuation\nallowance that might be required if our tax positions are sustained. The increase in unrecognized tax benefits for all periods\npresented was primarily due to expected refunds of Korean withholding tax previously paid (which such increase had an\ninsignificant impact to our income tax provision). If successful, the refund will result in a corresponding reduction in U.S.\nforeign tax credits. We believe that it is likely that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits at September 29, 2024 will\nincrease in fiscal 2025 as licensees in Korea continue to withhold taxes on future payments due under their licensing\nagreements at a rate higher than we believe is owed; such increase is not expected to have a significant impact on our income\ntax provision. At September 29, 2024, total interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits accrued in other current\nliabilities and other liabilities was $250 million, with a corresponding noncurrent income taxes receivable of $181 million\nrecorded in other assets for expected refunds of certain tax benefits.\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are no longer\nsubject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for years prior to fiscal 2018. We are also subject to examination in other\ntaxing jurisdictions in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. These examinations are at various stages with respect to\nassessments, claims, deficiencies and refunds, many of which are open for periods after fiscal 2001.\nCash amounts paid for income taxes, net of refunds received, were $3.3 billion, $1.4 billion and $2.1 billion for fiscal\n2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nNote 4. Capital Stock\nStock Repurchase Program. On October 12, 2021, we announced a $10.0 billion stock repurchase program. At\nSeptember 29, 2024, $1.0 billion remained authorized for repurchase under this stock repurchase program. On November 6,\n2024, we announced a new $15.0 billion stock repurchase authorization, which is in addition to the aforementioned program.\nThe stock repurchase programs have no expiration date.\nShares Outstanding. Shares of common stock outstanding at September 29, 2024 were as follows (in millions):\nBalance at beginning of period 1,114\nIssued 24\nRepurchased (25)\n1,113\nDividends. On October 16, 2024, we announced a cash dividend of $0.85 per share on our common stock, payable\non December 19, 2024 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 5, 2024.\nF-20\nQUALCOMM Incorporated\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 5. Employee Benefit Plans\nEquity Compensation Plans. On March 5, 2024, our stockholders approved the Amended and Restated Qualcomm\nIncorporated 2023 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2023 Plan), including an increase in the share reserve by 15 million shares.\nThe 2023 Plan provides for the grant of RSUs and other stock-based awards. The RSUs generally include dividend-\nequivalent rights and vest over three years from the date of grant. The Board of Directors may amend or terminate the 2023\nPlan at any time. Certain amendments, including an increase in the share reserve, require stockholder approval. At\nSeptember 29, 2024, approximately 75 million shares were available for future grant under the 2023 Plan.\nThe following is a summary of employee RSU transactions that contain only service requirements to vest:\nWeighted-\nNumber of Average\nShares Grant Date\n(in millions) Fair Value\nRSUs outstanding at September 24, 2023 35 $ 122.86\nRSUs granted 21 134.31\nRSUs canceled/forfeited (3) 124.84\nRSUs vested (25) 124.45\nRSUs outstanding at September 29, 2024 28 129.61\nThe weighted-average estimated grant date fair values of employee RSUs that contain only service requirements to vest\ngranted during fiscal 2023 and 2022 were $116.80 and $136.09 per share, respectively. Upon vesting, we issue new shares of\ncommon stock. For the majority of RSUs, shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the amount of shares needed to satisfy\nstatutory tax withholding requirements to be paid by us on behalf of the employees. As a result, the actual number of shares\nissued will be fewer than the number of RSUs outstanding. The annual pre-vest forfeiture rate for RSUs was estimated to be\napproximately 6%, 7% and 6% in fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAt September 29, 2024, total unrecognized compensation expense related to such non-vested RSUs granted prior to that\ndate was $2.9 billion, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.7 years. The total vest-date fair\nvalue of such RSUs that vested during fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $4.0 billion, $2.1 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively.\nThe total shares withheld to satisfy statutory tax withholding requirements related to all share-based awards were 6 million, 4\nmillion and 5 million in fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively and were based on the value of the awards on their vesting\ndates as determined by our closing stock price.\nThe total tax benefits realized, including the excess tax benefits, related to share-based awards during fiscal 2024, 2023\nand 2022 were $840 million, $435 million and $627 million, respectively.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan. We have an employee stock purchase plan that allows eligible employees to purchase\nshares of common stock at 85% of the value of our common stock on specific dates through periodic payroll deductions. The\nshares reserved for future issuance under the employee stock purchase plan were 15 million at September 29, 2024. We\nrecorded cash received from the exercise of purchase rights of $379 million, $395 million and $355 million during fiscal\n2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nShare-based Compensation Expense. Total share-based compensation expense, related to all of our share-based awards,\nwas comprised as follows (in millions):\n2024 2023 2022\nCost of revenues $ 89 $ 76 $ 61\nResearch and development 2,024 1,911 1,537\nSelling, general and administrative 535 497 463\nShare-based compensation expense before income taxes 2,648 2,484 2,061\nRelated income tax benefit (662) (463) (489)\n$ 1,986 $ 2,021 $ 1,572\nF-21\nQUALCOMM Incorporated\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 6.

At\nSeptember 29, 2024, the aggregate fair value of the notes, based on Level 2 inputs, was approximately $14.3 billion.\nAt September 29, 2024, all of our outstanding long-term debt is comprised of unsecured fixed-rate notes. We may\nredeem the outstanding fixed-rate notes at any time in whole, or from time to time in part, at specified make-whole premiums\nas defined in the applicable form of note. The obligations under the notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our\nother senior unsecured indebtedness and will effectively rank junior to all liabilities of our subsidiaries.\nThe effective interest rates for the notes include the interest on the notes, amortization of the discount, which includes\ndebt issuance costs, and if applicable, adjustments related to hedging. Interest is payable in arrears semi-annually for the\nnotes. Cash interest paid related to our commercial paper program and long-term debt was $656 million, $614 million and\n$491 million during fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nInterest Rate Swaps. At September 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023, we had outstanding interest rate swaps with an\naggregate notional amount of $2.1 billion that are designated as fair value hedges and allow us to effectively convert fixed-\nrate payments into floating-rate payments on a portion of our outstanding long-term debt.\nCommercial Paper Program. We have an unsecured commercial paper program, which provides for the issuance of up\nto $4.5 billion. Net proceeds from this program are for general corporate purposes. Maturities of commercial paper can range\nfrom 1 to up to 397 days. At September 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023, we had no amounts of commercial paper\noutstanding.\nRevolving Credit Facility. On August 8, 2024, we entered into a Revolving Credit Facility, replacing our prior Amended\nand Restated Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility provides for unsecured revolving facility loans, swing\nline loans and letters of credit in an aggregate amount of up to $4.0 billion, which expires on August 8, 2029. At\nSeptember 29, 2024, no amounts were outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. There were no outstanding\nborrowings under the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility at the time of termination and September 24, 2023.\nDebt Covenants. The Revolving Credit Facility requires that we comply with certain covenants, including that we\nmaintain an interest coverage ratio as defined in the agreement. We are not subject to any financial covenants under the notes\nnor any covenants that would prohibit us from incurring additional indebtedness ranking equal to the notes, paying dividends\nor issuing securities or repurchasing securities issued by us or our subsidiaries. At September 29, 2024, we were in\ncompliance with the applicable covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nF-22\nQUALCOMM Incorporated\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 7. Commitments and Contingencies\nLegal and Regulatory Proceedings.\nConsolidated Securities Class Action Lawsuit: On January 23, 2017 and January 26, 2017, securities class action\ncomplaints were filed by purported stockholders of us in the United States District Court for the Southern District of\nCalifornia against us and certain of our then current and former officers and directors. The complaints alleged, among other\nthings, that we violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 10b-5\nthereunder, by making false and misleading statements and omissions of material fact in connection with certain allegations\nthat we are or were engaged in anticompetitive conduct. The complaints sought unspecified damages, interest, fees and costs.\nThe court consolidated the two actions, and on July 3, 2017, the plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint asserting\nthe same basic theories of liability and requesting the same basic relief. On May 23, 2022, the plaintiffs filed a motion for\nclass certification, and on March 20, 2023, the court issued an order granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs’ motion\nfor class certification. The order denied class certification on the basis of alleged misrepresentations relating to our chip-level\nlicensing practices, but certified a class on the basis of alleged misrepresentations relating to the separate operations of QCT\nand QTL. We reached a proposed settlement with the plaintiffs to resolve this litigation, and on June 18, 2024, we and the\nplaintiffs, along with the individual defendants, filed a joint Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement with the court. The\nsettlement was approved by the court on September 27, 2024. In the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we recorded a charge of $75\nmillion to other expenses for the settlement amount, which amount was paid in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.\nConsumer Class Action Lawsuits: Beginning in January 2017, a number of consumer class action complaints were filed\nagainst us in the United States District Courts for the Southern and Northern Districts of California, each on behalf of a\nputative class of purchasers of cellular phones and other cellular devices. The cases filed in the Southern District of California\nwere subsequently transferred to the Northern District of California. On July 11, 2017, the plaintiffs filed a consolidated\namended complaint alleging that we violated California and federal antitrust and unfair competition laws by, among other\nthings, refusing to license standard-essential patents to our competitors, conditioning the supply of certain of our baseband\nchipsets on the purchaser first agreeing to license our entire patent portfolio, entering into exclusive deals with companies,\nincluding Apple Inc., and charging unreasonably high royalties that do not comply with our commitments to standard setting\norganizations. The complaint sought unspecified damages and disgorgement and/or restitution, as well as an order that we be\nenjoined from further unlawful conduct. On September 27, 2018, the court certified the class. We appealed the court’s class\ncertification order to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (Ninth Circuit). On September 29, 2021, the\nNinth Circuit vacated the class certification order, ruling that the district court had failed to correctly assess the propriety of\napplying California law to a nationwide class, and remanded the case to the district court. On June 10, 2022, the plaintiffs\nfiled an amended complaint, limiting the proposed class to California residents rather than a nationwide class. We filed a\nmotion to dismiss the amended complaint, and on January 6, 2023, the court issued an order granting in part and denying in\npart our motion to dismiss. We subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment on the plaintiffs’ remaining claims. The\ncourt granted our motion in its entirety and, on October 5, 2023, entered final judgment in Qualcomm’s favor. On November\n2, 2023, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the Ninth Circuit, and on October 15, 2024, the court held a hearing on the\nappeal. The court has not yet issued a ruling. We intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves in this matter.\nBeginning in November 2017, several other consumer class action complaints were filed against us in Canada (in the\nSupreme Court of British Columbia and the Quebec Superior Court), Israel (in the Haifa District Court) and the United\nKingdom (in the Competition Appeal Tribunal), each on behalf of a putative class of purchasers of cellular phones and other\ncellular devices, alleging violations of certain of those countries’ competition and consumer protection laws and seeking\ndamages. The claims in these complaints are similar to those in the U.S. consumer class action complaints described above.\nThese matters are at various stages of litigation, and we intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves.\nParkerVision, Inc. v. QUALCOMM Incorporated: On May 1, 2014, ParkerVision filed a complaint against us in the\nUnited States District Court for the Middle District of Florida alleging that certain of our products infringed seven\nParkerVision patents. On August 21, 2014, ParkerVision amended the complaint, alleging that we infringed 11 ParkerVision\npatents and sought damages and injunctive and other relief. ParkerVision subsequently reduced the number of patents\nasserted to three. The asserted patents are now expired, and injunctive relief is no longer available. ParkerVision continues to\nseek damages related to the sale of many of our radio frequency (RF) products sold between 2008 and 2018. On March 23,\n2022, the district court entered judgment in our favor on all claims and closed the case. On April 20, 2022, ParkerVision filed\na notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit). On September 6, 2024, the\nFederal Circuit reversed the judgment of the district court, citing certain substantive and procedural issues, and remanded the\ncase to the district court for further proceedings. We intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves in this matter.\nArm Ltd. v. QUALCOMM Incorporated: On August 31, 2022, Arm Ltd. (Arm) filed a complaint against us in the United\nStates District Court for the District of Delaware. Our subsidiaries Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. and NuVia, Inc. (Nuvia) are\nalso named in the complaint. The complaint alleges that following our acquisition of Nuvia, we and Nuvia breached Nuvia’s\nArchitecture License Agreement with Arm (the Nuvia ALA) by failing to comply with the termination obligations under the\nNuvia ALA. Arm is seeking specific performance, including that we cease all use of and destroy any technology that was\ndeveloped under the Nuvia ALA, including processor core technology (which Arm alleges includes our custom Qualcomm\nOryon CPU cores). Arm’s complaint also contends that we violated the Lanham Act through trademark infringement and\nfalse designation of origin through unauthorized use of Arm’s trademarks and seeks associated injunctive and declaratory\nrelief; however, Arm subsequently informed the court of its intent to withdraw such claims.\nF-23\nQUALCOMM Incorporated\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nOn September 30, 2022, we filed our Answer and Counterclaim in response to Arm’s complaint denying Arm’s claims.\nOur counterclaim seeks a declaratory judgment that we did not breach the Nuvia ALA or the Technology License Agreement\nbetween Nuvia and Arm (together with the Nuvia ALA, the Arm-Nuvia Agreements) and that, following the acquisition of\nNuvia, our architected cores (including all further developments, iterations or instantiations of the technology we acquired\nfrom Nuvia) and System-on-Chip (SoC) products incorporating such cores are fully licensed under our existing Architecture\nLicense Agreement with Arm (the Qualcomm ALA) and Technology License Agreement with Arm (together with the\nQualcomm ALA, the Arm-Qualcomm Agreements). We further seek an order enjoining Arm from making any claim that our\nproducts are not licensed under the Arm-Qualcomm Agreements, are not Arm-compliant or that we are prohibited from using\nArm’s marks in the marketing of any such products. On October 26, 2022, we filed an Amended Counterclaim seeking\nadditional declaratory relief that certain statements Arm is making in the marketplace concerning our rights under the Arm-\nQualcomm Agreements are false, and that Arm has no right to prevent us from shipping our products, which are validly\nlicensed. On March 22, 2024, we filed a Second Amended Counterclaim asserting that Arm has breached the Arm-Nuvia\nAgreements by continuing to use Nuvia technology and by failing to return or destroy Nuvia confidential information after\nthe Arm-Nuvia Agreements were terminated. The Second Amended Counterclaim seeks damages related to the asserted\nbreaches. On July 10, 2024, Arm filed a motion for partial summary judgment that the Nuvia ALA was properly terminated,\nthat the Nuvia ALA was breached, and that Arm did not breach the Arm-Nuvia Agreements. We also filed a motion for\nsummary judgment on Arm’s breach of contract claims, that Qualcomm’s architected cores are licensed under the Qualcomm\nALA, and that Qualcomm has not infringed Arm’s trademarks. On October 30, 2024, the court denied both parties’ motions\nfor summary judgment. Trial is scheduled to begin on December 16, 2024. We intend to continue to vigorously defend\nourselves against Arm’s claims in this matter.\nOn April 18, 2024, we filed a separate complaint (captioned QUALCOMM Incorporated v. Arm Ltd.) against Arm in the\nUnited States District Court for the District of Delaware. The complaint alleges that Arm has breached the Qualcomm ALA\nby failing to provide certain deliverables that Arm is obligated to provide. The complaint seeks an order that Arm comply\nwith its contractual obligations, damages, and additional relief. Arm moved to dismiss this complaint, and on October 30,\n2024, the court denied Arm’s motion to dismiss. No trial date has been set for this case.\nOn October 22, 2024, Arm provided us with a notice alleging that we have breached the Qualcomm ALA by marketing\nproducts that contain CPUs that Arm alleges use designs, technology and code created by Nuvia employees prior to our\nacquisition of Nuvia; by seeking support and verification from Arm for additional products that use such alleged designs,\ntechnology and code; and by suing Arm for breach of the Qualcomm ALA. Arm’s notice asserts that it will have the right to\nterminate the Qualcomm ALA if such alleged breaches are not cured within 60 days of such notice. We disagree with Arm’s\nallegations, including that we are in breach of the Qualcomm ALA.\nContingent Losses and Other Considerations: Litigation and investigations are inherently uncertain, and we face\ndifficulties in evaluating or estimating likely outcomes or ranges of possible loss, particularly in antitrust and trade regulation\ninvestigations. We have not recorded any accrual at September 29, 2024 for contingent losses associated with the pending\nmatters described above based on our belief that losses, while reasonably possible, are not probable. Further, any possible\namount or range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. The unfavorable resolution of one or more of these\nmatters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. We are\nengaged in numerous other legal actions not described above (for example, our 2010 European Commission matter relating to\nthe Icera complaint, and other matters arising in the ordinary course of our business, including those relating to employment\nmatters or the initiation or defense of proceedings relating to intellectual property rights) and, while there can be no\nassurance, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these other legal actions will not have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nIndemnifications. We generally do not indemnify our customers, licensees and suppliers for losses sustained from\ninfringement of third-party intellectual property rights. However, we are contingently liable under certain agreements to\ndefend and/or indemnify certain customers, licensees, and suppliers against certain types of liability and/or damages arising\nfrom the infringement of third-party intellectual property rights and to indemnify certain companies that purchased businesses\nwe previously consolidated against certain contingent losses. Our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms\nof time and/or amounts, and in some instances, we may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by us.\nClaims and reimbursements under indemnification arrangements have not been material to our consolidated financial\nstatements. We have not recorded accruals for certain claims under indemnification arrangements based on our belief that\nadditional liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, any possible range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated at\nthis time.\nF-24\nQUALCOMM Incorporated\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nPurchase Obligations. We have agreements with suppliers and other parties to purchase inventory, other goods and\nservices and long-lived assets. Such agreements include multi-year capacity purchase commitments with certain suppliers of\nour integrated circuit products. Total advance payments related to multi-year capacity purchase commitments recorded on the\nconsolidated balance sheets at September 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023 were $3.0 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively,\nof which $765 million and $404 million were recorded in other current assets, respectively, and $2.2 billion and $2.9 billion\nwere recorded in other assets, respectively. Integrated circuit product inventory obligations represent purchase commitments\n(including those under multi-year capacity purchase commitments to the extent such minimum amounts are both fixed and\ndeterminable) for raw materials, semiconductor die, finished goods and manufacturing services, such as wafer bump, probe,\nassembly and final test. Under our manufacturing relationships with our foundry suppliers and assembly and test service\nproviders, cancellation of outstanding purchase commitments is generally allowed but would require payment of costs\nincurred through the date of cancellation. Also, in some cases, we may be subject to incremental fees and/or the loss of\namounts paid in advance due to capacity underutilization and/or the failure to meet minimum purchase volumes under multi-\nyear capacity purchase commitments. Obligations under our purchase agreements, which primarily relate to integrated circuit\nproduct inventory obligations, at September 29, 2024 totaled $12.8 billion of which, $9.6 billion is expected to be paid in the\nnext 12 months.\nOperating Leases. We lease certain of our land, facilities and equipment under operating leases, with terms ranging from\nless than one year to 20 years, some of which include options to extend for up to 20 years. At September 29, 2024 and\nSeptember 24, 2023, the weighted-average remaining lease term for operating leases was nine years and eight years,\nrespectively. Operating lease expense for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $184 million, $204 million and $207 million,\nrespectively. At September 29, 2024, other assets included $719 million of operating lease assets, with corresponding lease\nliabilities of $98 million recorded in other current liabilities and $708 million recorded in other liabilities. At September 24,\n2023, other assets included $612 million of operating lease assets, with corresponding lease liabilities of $98 million recorded\nin other current liabilities and $571 million recorded in other liabilities.\nAt September 29, 2024, future lease payments under our operating leases were as follows (in millions):\nSeptember 29,\n2024\n2025 $ 136\n2026 134\n2027 127\n2028 117\n2029 102\nThereafter 468\nTotal future lease payments 1,084\nImputed interest (278)\nTotal lease liability balance $ 806\nNote 8. Segment Information\nWe are organized on the basis of products and services and have three reportable segments. Our operating segments\nreflect the way our businesses and management/reporting structure are organized internally and the way our Chief Operating\nDecision Maker (CODM), who is our CEO, reviews financial information, makes operating decisions and assesses business\nperformance. We also consider, among other items, the way budgets and forecasts are prepared and reviewed and the basis on\nwhich executive compensation is determined, as well as the similarities and the level of centralized resource planning within\nour operating segments, such as the nature of products, the level of shared products, technology and other resources,\nproduction processes and customer base. We conduct business primarily through our QCT semiconductor business and our\nQTL licensing business. QCT develops and supplies integrated circuits and system software with advanced connectivity and\nhigh-performance, low-power computing technologies for use in mobile devices; automotive systems for connectivity, digital\ncockpit and ADAS/AD; and IoT including consumer electronic devices, industrial devices and edge networking products.\nQTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain\npatent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products. Our QSI (Qualcomm\nStrategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic investments. We also have nonreportable segments, including\nQGOV (Qualcomm Government Technologies) and our cloud computing processing initiative.\nOur CODM allocates resources to and evaluates the performance of our segments based on revenues and earnings (loss)\nbefore income taxes (EBT). Segment EBT includes the allocation of certain corporate expenses to the segments, including\ndepreciation and amortization expense related to certain corporate assets. Certain income and charges are not allocated to\nsegments in our management reports because they are not considered in evaluating the segments’ operating performance.\nUnallocated income and charges include certain interest expense, certain net investment income, share-based compensation,\ngains and losses on our deferred compensation plan liabilities and related assets and certain research and development\nF-25\nQUALCOMM Incorporated\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nexpenses, certain selling, general and administrative expenses and other expenses or income that were deemed to be not\ndirectly related to the businesses of the segments. Additionally, unallocated charges include recognition of the step-up of\ninventories and property, plant and equipment to fair value, amortization of certain intangible assets and certain other\nacquisition-related charges, third-party acquisition and integration services costs and certain other items, which may include\nmajor restructuring and restructuring-related costs, asset impairment charges and awards, settlements and/or damages arising\nfrom legal or regulatory matters. Our CODM does not evaluate our operating segments using discrete asset information.\nThe table below presents revenues and EBT for reportable segments (in millions):\n2024 2023 2022\nRevenues:\nQCT $ 33,196 $ 30,382 $ 37,677\nQTL 5,572 5,306 6,358\nQSI 18 28 31\nReconciling items 176 104 134\nTotal $ 38,962 $ 35,820 $ 44,200\nEBT:\nQCT $ 9,527 $ 7,924 $ 12,837\nQTL 4,027 3,628 4,628\nQSI 104 (12) (279)\nReconciling items (3,322) (4,097) (2,188)\nTotal $ 10,336 $ 7,443 $ 14,998\nReconciling items for revenues and EBT in the previous table were as follows (in millions):\n2024 2023 2022\nRevenues:\nNonreportable segments $ 176 $ 144 $ 134\nUnallocated revenues — (40) —\n$ 176 $ 104 $ 134\nEBT:\nUnallocated revenues $ — $ (40) $ —\nUnallocated cost of revenues (229) (205) (266)\nUnallocated research and development expenses (2,277) (2,034) (1,767)\nUnallocated selling, general and administrative expenses (781) (588) (609)\nUnallocated other (expense) income (Note 2) (179) (862) 1,059\nUnallocated interest expense (697) (694) (490)\nUnallocated investment and other income (expense), net 855 364 (91)\nNonreportable segments (14) (38) (24)\n$ (3,322) $ (4,097) $ (2,188)\nThe net book value of long-lived tangible assets located outside of the U.S. (the majority of which is located in Taiwan\nand the rest of the Asia-Pacific region) was $3.5 billion and $3.6 billion at September 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023,\nrespectively. The net book value of long-lived tangible assets located in the U.S. was $1.9 billion and $2.0 billion at\nSeptember 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023, respectively.\nF-26\nQUALCOMM Incorporated\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nBeginning in fiscal 2024, revenues by country are presented based on our customer’s/licensee’s headquarter location and\nwere as follows (in millions):\n2024 2023 2022\nChina (including Hong Kong) $ 17,826 46 % $ 13,386 37 % $ 18,977 43 %\nUnited States 9,686 25 10,503 29 10,501 24\nSouth Korea 7,995 20 8,075 23 9,666 22\nOther foreign 3,455 9 3,856 11 5,056 11\n$ 38,962 100 % $ 35,820 100 % $ 44,200 100 %\nPreviously, revenues by country were presented based on the location to which our products or services were delivered.\nFor QCT, this was the country in which our customers manufacture their products and for licensing revenues, the invoiced\naddresses of our licensees, and was not necessarily indicative of either the country in which the devices containing our\nproducts and/or intellectual property are ultimately sold to consumers or the country in which the companies that sell the\ndevices were headquartered. We believe this change generally provides a better representation of the geographic profile of\nour revenues. However, it is still not necessarily indicative of the country in which the devices containing our products and/or\nintellectual property are ultimately sold to consumers. Prior period information has been recast to reflect this change.\nFor comparative purposes, based on the location to which our products or services are delivered, revenues from sales into\nChina (including Hong Kong), United States, South Korea, and Vietnam were 66%, 3%, 7%, and 12% of total revenues,\nrespectively, for fiscal 2024.\nNote 9.

The “Note\nRegarding Forward-Looking Statements” in this news release provides a description of certain risks that\nwe face, and our most recent annual report on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)\nprovides a more complete description of our risks.\nThe following table summarizes GAAP and Non-GAAP guidance based on the current outlook.\nCurrent Guidance\nQ1 FY25 Estimates1\nRevenues $10.5B - $11.3B\nSupplemental Revenue Information\nQCT revenues $9.0B - $9.6B\nQTL revenues $1.45B - $1.65B\nGAAP diluted EPS $2.39 - $2.59\nLess diluted EPS attributable to QSI $—\nLess diluted EPS attributable to share-based compensation ($0.53)\nLess diluted EPS attributable to other items2 $0.07\nNon-GAAP diluted EPS $2.85 - $3.05\n(1) Our outlook does not include provisions for proposed tax law changes, future asset impairments or for pending legal matters, other than future legal\namounts that are probable and estimable. Further, due to their nature, certain income and expense items, such as certain investments, derivative and foreign\ncurrency transaction gains or losses, cannot be accurately forecast. Accordingly, we only include such items in our financial outlook to the extent they are\nreasonably certain. Our outlook includes the impact of any pending business combinations to the extent they are expected to close in the upcoming quarter.\nActual results may differ materially from the outlook.\n(2) Our guidance for diluted EPS attributable to other items for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 is primarily related to the requirement to capitalize research and\ndevelopment expenditures under U.S. Federal income tax law, partially offset by acquisition-related items.\nQualcomm Announces Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2024 Results Page 4 of 10\nConference Call and Available Information\nQualcomm’s fourth quarter and fiscal 2024 earnings conference call will be broadcast live on November 6, 2024, beginning at 1:45\np.m. Pacific Time (PT) at https://investor.qualcomm.com/news-events/investor-events.

In addition, “Non-GAAP” is not a term defined by GAAP, and as a result,\nour Non-GAAP financial measures might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations\nbetween GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures are presented herein.\nWe use Non-GAAP financial information: (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark our operating results on a consistent and comparable\nbasis; (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of our ongoing core operating businesses, including our QCT (Qualcomm\nCDMA Technologies) and QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) segments; and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of\nthese segments against competitors. Non-GAAP measurements used by us include revenues, cost of revenues, research and\ndevelopment (R&D) expenses, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, other income or expenses, operating income,\ninterest expense, net investment and other income, income or earnings before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income and diluted\nearnings per share. We are able to assess what we believe is a meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures by\nusing Non-GAAP information. In addition, the HR and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors uses certain Non-GAAP\nfinancial measures in establishing portions of the performance-based incentive compensation programs for our executive officers. We\npresent Non-GAAP financial information to provide greater transparency to investors with respect to our use of such information in\nfinancial and operational decision-making. This Non-GAAP financial information is also used by institutional investors and analysts\nin evaluating our business and assessing trends and future expectations.\nNon-GAAP information presented herein excludes our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) segment and certain share-based\ncompensation, acquisition-related items, tax items and other items.\n• QSI is excluded because we generally expect to exit our strategic investments in the foreseeable future, and the effects of\nfluctuations in the value of such investments and realized gains or losses are viewed as unrelated to our operational performance.\n• Share-based compensation expense primarily relates to restricted stock units. We believe that excluding share-based\ncompensation from Non-GAAP financial information allows us and investors to make additional comparisons of the operating\nactivities of our ongoing core businesses over time and with respect to other companies.\n• Certain other items are excluded because we view such items as unrelated to the operating activities of our ongoing core\nbusinesses, as follows:\n◦ Acquisition-related items include amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, substantially all of which relate to\nthe amortization of technology-based intangible assets that is recorded in cost of revenues and will recur in future\nperiods until the related intangible assets have been fully amortized. We view acquisition-related intangible assets as\nitems arising from pre-acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition. Acquisition-related intangible\nassets contribute to revenue generation that has not been excluded from our Non-GAAP financial information.\nAcquisition-related items also include recognition of the step-up of inventories and property, plant and equipment to fair\nvalue and the related tax effects of acquisition-related items, as well as any effects from restructuring the ownership of\nsuch acquired assets. We also exclude the operating results of acquired and/or consolidated businesses that, as of close,\nare expected or required to be sold. Additionally, we exclude certain other acquisition-related charges such as third-party\nacquisition and integration services costs and costs related to temporary debt facilities and letters of credit executed prior\nto the close of an acquisition.\n◦ We exclude certain other items that we view as unrelated to our ongoing businesses, such as major restructuring and\nrestructuring-related costs, asset impairments and awards, settlements and/or damages arising from legal or regulatory\nmatters. We exclude gains and losses driven by the revaluation of our deferred compensation plan liabilities recognized\nin operating expenses and the offsetting gains and losses on the related plan assets recognized in investment and other\nincome (expense).\n◦ Certain tax items that are unrelated to the fiscal year in which they are recorded are excluded in order to provide a\nclearer understanding of our ongoing Non-GAAP tax rate and after-tax earnings. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal\n2023 and for the initial five-year period in which we are required to capitalize and amortize R&D expenditures for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes, we also exclude the favorable impact to our provision for income taxes and results of\noperations resulting from such change in treatment of R&D expenditures. The favorable tax provision impact will\ndiminish in future years as capitalized research and development expenditures continue to amortize.\nQualcomm Announces Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2024 Results Page 9 of 10\nReconciliations of GAAP Results to Non-GAAP Results\nGAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation Non-GAAP Supplemental Information\nLess Share- Non-GAAP\n(in millions, except per share GAAP Based Less Other Non-GAAP Reconciling\ndata and percentages) Results Less QSI Compensation Items1 Results QCT QTL Items2\nQ4 Fiscal 2024\nRevenues $10,244 $— $— $— $10,244 $8,678 $1,521 $45\nOperating income (loss) 2,581 (4) (695) (226) 3,506\nEBT 2,597 (16) (695) (183) 3,491 2,465 1,120 (94)\nEBT as % of revenues 25% 34%\nNet income (loss) 2,920 (13) (483) 380 3,036\nDiluted EPS $2.59 ($0.01) ($0.43) $0.34 $2.69\nDiluted shares 1,129 1,129 1,129 1,129 1,129\nQ4 Fiscal 2023\nRevenues $8,631 $6 $— ($40) $8,665 $7,374 $1,262 $29\nOperating income (loss) 1,411 — (608) (650) 2,669\nEBT 1,420 70 (608) (659) 2,617 1,889 829 (101)\nEBT as % of revenues 16% 30%\nNet income (loss) 1,489 55 (480) (363) 2,277\nDiluted EPS $1.32 $0.05 ($0.43) ($0.32) $2.02\nDiluted shares 1,125 1,125 1,125 1,125 1,125\nFiscal 2024\nRevenues $38,962 $18 $— $— $38,944 $33,196 $5,572 $176\nOperating income (loss) 10,071 (1) (2,648) (600) 13,320\nEBT 10,336 104 (2,648) (407) 13,287 9,527 4,027 (267)\nEBT as % of revenues 27% 34%\nNet income (loss) 10,142 82 (1,986) 501 11,545\nDiluted EPS $8.97 $0.07 ($1.76) $0.44 $10.22\nDiluted shares 1,130 1,130 1,130 1,130 1,130\nFiscal 2023\nRevenues $35,820 $28 $— ($40) $35,832 $30,382 $5,306 $144\nOperating income (loss) 7,788 1 (2,484) (1,189) 11,460\nEBT 7,443 (12) (2,484) (1,131) 11,070 7,924 3,628 (482)\nEBT as % of revenues 21% 31%\nNet income (loss) 7,232 (10) (2,021) (223) 9,486\nDiluted EPS $6.42 ($0.01) ($1.80) ($0.20) $8.43\nDiluted shares 1,126 1,126 1,126 1,126 1,126\n(1) Further details of amounts included in the “Other Items” column for the current periods are included at the end of this news release in the sections labeled\n“Supplemental Information and Reconciliations.” Details of amounts included in the “Other Items” column for the prior periods are included in the news\nrelease for those periods.\n(2) Non-GAAP reconciling items related to revenues consisted primarily of nonreportable segment revenues.

In addition, “Non-\nGAAP” is not a term defined by GAAP, and as a result, our Non-GAAP financial measures might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between GAAP and\nNon-GAAP financial measures are presented herein.\nWe use Non-GAAP financial information: (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark our operating results on a consistent and comparable basis; (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of our ongoing\ncore operating businesses, including our QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) and QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) segments; and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these\nsegments against competitors. Non-GAAP measurements used by us include revenues, cost of revenues, research and development (R&D) expenses, selling, general and administrative (SG&A)\nexpenses, other income or expenses, operating income, interest expense, net investment and other income, income or earnings before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income and diluted earnings\nper share. We are able to assess what we believe is a meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures by using Non-GAAP information. In addition, the HR and Compensation\nCommittee of our Board of Directors uses certain Non-GAAP financial measures in establishing portions of the performance-based incentive compensation programs for our executive officers. We\npresent Non-GAAP financial information to provide greater transparency to investors with respect to our use of such information in financial and operational decision-making. This Non-GAAP financial\ninformation is also used by institutional investors and analysts in evaluating our business and assessing trends and future expectations.\nNon-GAAP information presented herein excludes our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) segment and certain share-based compensation, acquisition-related items, tax items and other items.\n• QSI is excluded because we generally expect to exit our strategic investments in the foreseeable future, and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments and realized gains or losses\nare viewed as unrelated to our operational performance.\n• Share-based compensation expense primarily relates to restricted stock units. We believe that excluding share-based compensation from Non-GAAP financial information allows us and investors to\nmake additional comparisons of the operating activities of our ongoing core businesses over time and with respect to other companies.\n• Certain other items are excluded because we view such items as unrelated to the operating activities of our ongoing core businesses, as follows:\n• Acquisition-related items include amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, substantially all of which relate to the amortization of technology-based intangible assets that is recorded\nin cost of revenues and will recur in future periods until the related intangible assets have been fully amortized. We view acquisition-related intangible assets as items arising from pre-acquisition\nactivities determined at the time of an acquisition. Acquisition-related intangible assets contribute to revenue generation that has not been excluded from our Non-GAAP financial information.\nAcquisition-related items also include recognition of the step-up of inventories and property, plant and equipment to fair value and the related tax effects of acquisition-related items, as well as\nany effects from restructuring the ownership of such acquired assets. We also exclude the operating results of acquired and/or consolidated businesses that, as of close, are expected or required\nto be sold. Additionally, we exclude certain other acquisition-related charges such as third-party acquisition and integration services costs and costs related to temporary debt facilities and letters\nof credit executed prior to the close of an acquisition.\n• We exclude certain other items that we view as unrelated to our ongoing businesses, such as major restructuring and restructuring-related costs, asset impairments and awards, settlements\nand/or damages arising from legal or regulatory matters. We exclude gains and losses driven by the revaluation of our deferred compensation plan liabilities recognized in operating expenses\nand the offsetting gains and losses on the related plan assets recognized in investment and other income (expense).\n• Certain tax items that are unrelated to the fiscal year in which they are recorded are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of our ongoing Non-GAAP tax rate and after-tax\nearnings. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and for the initial five-year period in which we are required to capitalize and amortize R&D expenditures for U.S. federal income tax purposes,\nwe also exclude the favorable impact to our provision for income taxes and results of operations resulting from such change in treatment of R&D expenditures. The favorable tax provision impact\nwill diminish in future years as capitalized research and development expenditures continue to amortize.\nWe use free cash flow to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow our business, service debt and create long-term stockholder value. Accordingly, free\ncash flow does not represent the remaining cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures.\n19\nReconciliations of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nFree Cash Flow\n(in millions) FY24\nOperating cash flow (GAAP net cash provided by operating activities) $12,202\nLess capital expenditures 1,041\nFree cash flow (Non-GAAP) $11,161\nFourth Quarter Fiscal 2024 Results\nLess Share-\nGAAP Based Less Other Non-GAAP\n(in millions, except per share data) Results Less QSI Compensation Items(1) Results\nRevenues $10,244 $— $— $— $10,244\nNet income (loss) $2,920 ($13) ($483) $380 $3,036\nDiluted EPS $2.59 ($0.01) ($0.43) $0.34 $2.69\nDiluted shares 1,129 1,129 1,129 1,129 1,129\n1.)

I'll start with our fourth fiscal quarter earnings.\nWe are pleased to announce strong non-GAAP results, with revenues of $10.2 billion and EPS of $2.69, which was above the high end of our\nguidance. QTL revenues of $1.5 billion and EBT margin of 74% were at the high end of our guidance, driven by slightly higher handset units in the\nquarter.\nQCT delivered revenues of $8.7 billion and EBT margin of 28%, with revenues at the high end of our guidance range on strength in both IoT and\nautomotive. QCT handset revenues of $6.1 billion were in line with our expectations for the quarter.\nQCT IoT revenues of $1.7 billion increased 24% from the prior quarter due to the benefit of new product launches and continued normalization of\nchannel inventory. We delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of record QCT automotive revenues of $899 million with sequential growth of 11%\nand year-over-year growth of 68% on continued content increase in new vehicle launches.\nLastly, we returned $2.2 billion to stockholders, including $1.3 billion in stock repurchases and $947 million in dividends. Before turning to guidance,\nI'll summarize our fiscal '24 results.\nWe are very pleased with our execution and financial performance in fiscal '24. We delivered revenues of $39 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $10.22,\na growth of 21% on a year-over-year basis. Our results reflect the benefit of operating leverage as we maintain fiscal discipline and manage non-GAAP\noperating expenses relatively flat as compared to fiscal '23.\nIn QTL, we made significant progress in our ability to maintain revenue and margin scale as a result of completing a number of licensing renewals\nduring the year. In QCT handsets, we delivered greater than 20% year-over-year growth in Android revenues driven by technology leadership of\nour premium-tier Snapdragon products and normalization of channel inventory.\nConsistent with expectations outlined at the beginning of the fiscal year, QCT IoT revenues grew sequentially in each of the following quarters\nthroughout the year. In a challenging industry environment, we delivered full year revenue growth of 55% in QCT automotive, extending our\nleadership in automotive computing and connectivity platforms.\nLastly, our business generated record free cash flow of $11.2 billion, and our balance sheet remains strong with $13.3 billion in cash and marketable\nsecurities. Turning to guidance.\nWe now expect global 3G, 4G, 5G handset units to increase by low to mid-single-digit percentage on a year-over-year basis in calendar '24. For the\nfirst quarter of fiscal '25, we are forecasting revenues of $10.5 billion to $11.3 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2.85 to $3.05.\nIn QTL, we estimate revenues of $1.45 billion to $1.65 billion and EBT margins of 73% to 77%, reflecting normal seasonality for handset units when\nadjusted for the extra week in the fourth quarter of fiscal '24. In QCT, we expect revenues of $9 billion to $9.6 billion and EBT margins of 29% to\n31%.\n5\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

This forecast includes greater than 40%\nsequential revenue growth from Chinese OEMs and the acceleration of flagship Android handset launches powered by our recently announced\nSnapdragon 8 Elite platform.\nWe anticipate QCT IoT revenues to increase by more than 20% on a year-over-year basis with growth across consumer, industrial, and networking.\nFollowing our outperformance in the fourth quarter, this forecast reflects a seasonal sequential decline consistent with the last two fiscal years.\nWe expect QCT automotive revenues to grow by 50% relative to last year and be approximately flat on a sequential basis. Lastly, we estimate\nnon-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $2.2 billion.\nIn closing, I want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication and remaining focused on execution while delivering industry-leading\nproducts. The last few weeks have marked a meaningful acceleration in our progress towards our diversification strategy, and I'd like to highlight\nsome significant product announcements.\nFirst, we announced our Snapdragon X Plus platform at IFA Conference, which extends our performance leadership to the $700 price tier for\npersonal computers. Second, at the Embedded World North America, we introduced the most comprehensive chipset and software portfolio for\nAI-ready industrial IoT solutions.\nAnd third, at the Snapdragon Summit, we unveiled the Snapdragon 8 Elite handset platform, featuring the world's fastest mobile CPU; and the\nSnapdragon Cockpit Elite and Snapdragon Ride Elite automotive platforms, establishing us as a performance leader in digital cockpit and ADAS.\nLastly, we look forward to seeing you in New York on November 19, where we will expand on these exciting product announcements with an\nupdate on our IoT and automotive diversification strategy.\nThis concludes our prepared remarks. Back to you, Mauricio.\nMauricio Lopez-Hodoyan - Qualcomm Inc - Vice President, Investor Relations\nThank you, Akash. Operator, we are now ready for questions.\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) Joe Moore, Morgan Stanley.\nJoe Moore - Morgan Stanley - Analyst\nGreat. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk about the strength in autos. You've obviously put up great sequential numbers. There are headwinds\nin that business. I know you have a lot of pipeline momentum, but just kind of give us a picture of how the environment is affecting you and how\nmuch visibility you have into that trajectory.\nCristiano Renno Amon - Qualcomm Inc - President and Chief Executive Officer\nHey, Joe. Thanks for the question. This is Cristiano. As we said before, I think you should look at our revenue in auto, less sensitive to what happens\nin the market much more related to new models that are being launched with Qualcomm technology. And it's reflecting a shift in share.\n6\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

So that's the reason we continue to have growth\nboth sequentially and year-over-year.\nJoe Moore - Morgan Stanley - Analyst\nGreat. Thank you. And then I don't think you mentioned it. Anything you could say about the ARM dispute? Because that would help us understand\nwhat's the stake there.\nAkash Palkhiwala - Qualcomm Inc - Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer\nYeah. Joe. On the ARM side, from our perspective, we have a very broad, well-established license rights that cover our custom designed CPUs. So\nwe are very confident that those rights will be affirmed. The trial is scheduled for December, and so we're looking forward to addressing ARM's\nclaims at that point.\nJoe Moore - Morgan Stanley - Analyst\nOkay, thank you.\nOperator\nSamik Chatterjee, JPMorgan.\nSamik Chatterjee - JPMorgan - Analyst\nHey. Thank you for taking my questions. Really strong results, so congratulations on that. Maybe if I can start with IoT.\nYou -- for the first three quarters of the year, you had declines on a year-over-year basis. And you're seeing this acceleration in IoT in the fourth\nquarter and going into first quarter on a year-over-year basis. Can you just sort of parse that out a bit?\nHow much of this is a recovery in the traditional IoT businesses you are in relative to contribution from the PC market and really an acceleration\non account of that? Just anything you can parse out between industrial IoT, consumer IoT, and new products versus older products you've been\non. And I have a follow-up.\nAkash Palkhiwala - Qualcomm Inc - Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer\nSure. So Samik, it's Akash. If you look at our performance both in first -- fourth quarter and first quarter in IoT, we saw benefit across all the three\nareas, so consumer, industrial, and networking. And within fourth quarter, as some new products were launched in PC, in XR, in other areas as well,\nwe saw the benefit of those launches come through in our numbers.\nThere is a portion of channel inventory normalization as well, but it's really the new product launches coming through for us both in the fourth\nand the first quarter. And that sets up -- sets us up well for the rest of the year.\n7\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Got it. And I mean, it's -- obviously, as you mentioned, it's been a tough backdrop in terms of the macro, and you're guiding to about\na 10% revenue growth in the first quarter. Just trying to think about sustainability of that into the March quarter, particularly given that you did\nmention there's some acceleration of Android launches as well.\nHow should we think about -- with the combination of smartphone and the impressive performance you have on the non-smartphone areas now,\nhow sustainable is this double-digit growth into the March quarter?\nAkash Palkhiwala - Qualcomm Inc - Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer\nYeah. Samik, so we're pretty happy with the trajectory of the business, both in terms of our fourth quarter results and first quarter guidance. We\nare not guiding beyond the first quarter at this point. But as you know, we have an Investor Day coming up in a couple of weeks, where we're going\nto talk through our diversification strategy and growth; and we'll provide a financial framework around it. So we'll address some of these topics at\nthat point.\nSamik Chatterjee - JPMorgan - Analyst\nOkay. I'll pass it on. Thank you.\nOperator\nStacy Rasgon, Bernstein Research.\nStacy Rasgon - Bernstein - Analyst\nHi. guys. Thanks for taking my questions. My first question, just on chipset gross margins. They seem to be guided down a bit, I don't know, 100 or\n150 bps in Q1. Is that just like increased wafer cost, TSM? Is there something else going on with mix just given which products are shipping?\nAny color you can give us on gross margins? And I guess, like, is the framework on how to think about them going forward around 48-ish, plus or\nminus? Is that still the right way to think about chip gross margins?\nAkash Palkhiwala - Qualcomm Inc - Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer\nYeah. Sure, Stacy. It's Akash. So in fourth quarter, we actually guided lower, and we came in slightly better because of stronger mix. And so what\nwe're guiding in first quarter is really largely in line with fourth quarter, and we think that's a reasonable way to model the business going forward.\nAnd I think from a product mix perspective, we feel pretty good about where we are set up both across businesses and within handsets. So that\nwill obviously continue to play a factor as we look forward.\nStacy Rasgon - Bernstein - Analyst\nGot it. Thank you. For my follow-up, I just wanted to ask a little more about on PCs. You'd talked about new product launches in Q4. Can you help\nus size, like how big was the PC portion in Q4?\nAnd given you're guiding IoT down seasonally, sequentially in Q1, is PCs as well as some of the other stuff a function of that? Like how do we think\nabout the contribution that we're seeing early in the launch of those products?\n8\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

So Stacy, as you know, we're pretty excited about the PC roadmap. I think we've established ourselves as a performance leader in Windows\ndevices. And during the quarter, we also launched a new chip, Snapdragon X Plus 8-core chip, which allows us now to access the $700 price tier\nfor the PC market as well.\nSo now we have performance leadership really without compromising on NPU performance across tiers in the PC market. And so initial reaction\nhas been great. We are pleased with it. We will talk about this in a lot more detail at Investor Day both from traction across OEMs and then targets\nfor the longer term.\nCristiano Renno Amon - Qualcomm Inc - President and Chief Executive Officer\nStacy, this is Cristiano. I just wanted to add one thing. While I think we are going to make probably financial projections, how we think about the\nPC business in November 19, I wanted to point out one thing which is very visible. When we launched this -- we launched this in May.\nWe are -- so a period of time if you think about it, we are now in November. When we launched in May, we had about 20 platforms. One thing we\ndisclosed on this call is now, the platforms that we have designed in, they add to about 58.\nThat is almost a 3x increase on the number of platforms that are being designed and under development. I think that is giving us a lot of confidence\nthat our platform to resonate with the market and we're getting traction with the OEMs.\nStacy Rasgon - Bernstein - Analyst\nThank you.\nOperator\nJoshua Buchalter, TD Cowen.\nJoshua Buchalter - TD Cowen - Analyst\nHey. guys. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to follow up on Joe's question from earlier about the auto upside. I mean, in particular, the\nauto space upside has been driven by China. I guess, maybe you could give us some data points on how much your exposure within the auto\nmarket is driven by the China market now.\nAnd then also maybe some -- any metrics you can give us on how much is infotainment versus ADAS? And in particular, as you ramp Snapdragon\nRide Elite with capabilities of both infotainment and ADAS and one SoC, how is engagement for that? And how do you expect that to ramp over\nthe next couple of years? Thank you.\nAkash Palkhiwala - Qualcomm Inc - Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer\nHi, Josh. It's Akash. From a geography diversity perspective, you should think of our portfolio as very diverse. We have a very strong set of design\nwins globally across OEMs. And so you should not think of this as reliant on a specific geography, and we are planning to give some disclosures\non that topic as we go forward.\n9\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

I think in addition of in design with virtually every single OEM in every region, one of the things we're very excited\nabout it is what we did on both the Snapdragon Ride Elite and Cockpit Elite. One of the things I want to point out is it's one of the biggest upgrade\nsetting to date in order of magnitude about 12x on AI.\nAs we said before, I think GenAI use cases on a core and especially a little different approach is about future-proofing that design for software-defined\nvehicle. It's getting a lot of traction to a lot of OEMs. We announced two that made public, but I think design traction on that chipset is actually\nvery high.\nAkash Palkhiwala - Qualcomm Inc - Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer\nAnd Josh, on your second question on a combination of cockpit and ADAS, a lot of our traction this year is with launches with cars using our cockpit\nsolution. And we see ADAS having some traction, some deployments right now, but it's going to ramp over the next couple of years. And that\nbecomes another inflection point in our revenue growth going forward.\nJoshua Buchalter - TD Cowen - Analyst\nGot it. Thank you for all the color. And then a follow-up, I wanted to ask about the handset market. If we sort of back out your top two customers,\nhandsets are up, I think, around 50% year over year. Any metrics you can give us on units versus ASPs?\nI know there was an inventory dynamic last year. So as we think about the sustainability of that growth vector into 2025, in particular, for the China\nmarket, would be curious if there's any incremental metrics you can give us outside your top two customers. Thank you.\nAkash Palkhiwala - Qualcomm Inc - Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer\nYeah. I think, Josh, the -- if you look at the total handset market, and this is sell-through, we are projecting in '24 that the market will be up low to\nmid-single digits. But the big story for us has been content increase.\nWe've seen the chipsets becoming a lot more capable. And you saw the X Elite -- 8 Elite announcement that we did last month, a lot more content\ngoing into the chip. And as those get -- solutions get adopted, we get to see the benefit on the ASP side.\nThe second factor is the mix across tiers. We're seeing the mix across tiers continue to improve in the handset market as well. So if you look back\nover the last three or four years, devices greater than $400 has gone up from being 21% of the market to 30% of the market, and that is definitely\nbeneficial to us.\nMaybe one last point is, if you think about our guidance quarter, December quarter, we do not have any Huawei product revenue in our guidance.\nA year ago quarter, we did have Huawei product revenue. So it's actually something that we've overcome, and then we have growth on top of it.\nJoshua Buchalter - TD Cowen - Analyst\nThank you.\nOperator\nChris Caso, Wolfe Research.\n10\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

Just another follow-up question with regard to handset. And if you could characterize because I think for Qualcomm, you saw a\nrebound or normalization in the premium part of the handset market in the first half of the year. Is what you're seeing now some follow-through\non the mid-tier or it's just continuation of what you saw in the first half of the year?\nAnd then secondly on that, with regard to some of the accelerated China launches, do you think that's a reflection of the market, of some perhaps\nimprovement in the market in China or at least the China OEMs? Or is it simply a matter of timing?\nAkash Palkhiwala - Qualcomm Inc - Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer\nYeah. I think, Chris, if you think about our handset business, we're definitely really strong at the top of the roadmap in premium tier. And as we\nmentioned earlier, we announced our new flagship chipset, and you're seeing OEMs launch with that chipset.\nSo those definitely factor into our numbers. And it's less about other tiers, more about the fact that we launched our new premium-tier chipset.\nAnd the OEMs are actively taking advantage of it by accelerating their launches and really increasing the scale of their launches.\nChris Caso - Wolfe Research - Analyst\nGot it. And just with regard to the licensing business, you see a shallow sequential increase in the December quarter. I imagine that's because of\nthe absence of the extra week for that licensing business. Any changes for just the structure of that market that we shouldn't anticipate going\nforward? Or is it about what you'd consider to be normal?\nAkash Palkhiwala - Qualcomm Inc - Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer\nYeah, it's very much normal. It's really the extra week coming out and the normal sequential quarter-over-quarter growth.\nOperator\nTal Liani, Bank of America.\nTal Liani - BofA Global Research - Analyst\nHey, guys. Other companies reported opposite trends of what you're talking about. Some of the companies reported weakness in China, migration\nto lower tier, and then Apple had weaker numbers than expected.\nHow do you connect the comments we get from other vendors to your strengths? And are you concerned that maybe the strength is more inventory\nbuild-out or build-out by customers because of your new launches? So can you comment about end-market demand and the composition of\nend-market demands in -- globally? Thanks.\nCristiano Renno Amon - Qualcomm Inc - President and Chief Executive Officer\nLook, thanks for the question. I can't really speak of other companies. The only thing I can say is I'm actually very happy with our results.\nBut I'll give you a couple of data points, maybe help you triangulate that. When we look sequentially, we have now, quarter over quarter, greater\nthan 40% handset revenue growth with Chinese OEMs in -- look in the 1Q fiscal '25, if you look at the guide.\n11\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

And when we compare with our\nclosest competitor, for example, in Android, our premium tier, we get greater than 5x premium-tier revenue.\nSo I think it shows a couple of things. As Akash outlined, content is increasing. The premium tier is expanding in the market that it normalized. And\nwe don't see much of the inventory dynamics we used to see.\nSo I think it speaks a little bit to the strength of our product roadmap. I think the launch of new products from customers in China, but more\nimportant is this trend that the mix are really improving.\nTal Liani - BofA Global Research - Analyst\nGot it. Thank you.\nOperator\nTimothy Arcuri, UBS.\nTimothy Arcuri - UBS Equities - Analyst\nThanks a lot. Akash, I'm just looking at the guidance. And for China Android to be up more than 40%, it implies that your two other big customers\nare both down in the double-digit range. I mean both of them have to be down. So can you speak to that as very sort of anti-seasonal for at least\none of those guys to be down?\nAnd then can you speak to what's driving this? Do you think -- I mean, is any of this pull-forward because of tariffs? Are these customers concerned\nabout potential tariffs with -- given the results of the election? So maybe they are pulling some things forward. Is that plausible? Thanks.\nAkash Palkhiwala - Qualcomm Inc - Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer\nYeah. Let me start with the second part of your question. That's not the case. This is not about tariffs or pull-forward because of those reasons.\nFrom a customer perspective on the quarterly trend, the way we think about it is what we're guiding is based on customer launch cadences and\ntheir demands. You should not think of this as a statement on sell-through. It's really chipset purchases that are happening from us.\nSo I think that those two may be connected in some cases. But you already know what our share position is across OEMs, and so it's not a share\nquestion. It's just the timing of purchases from us.\nTimothy Arcuri - UBS Equities - Analyst\nOkay. Thank you.\nOperator\nC.J. Muse, Cantor Fitzgerald.\n12\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Muse - Cantor Fitzgerald - Analyst\nYeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. I guess first question, I was hoping to revisit IoT business growing nicely for you\nyear-on-year. And pretty much every other company that I've come across is seeing challenges there, particularly parts of consumer and industrial.\nSo would love to hear, perhaps on the consumer side, whether you're seeing kind of the uptake that we're hearing in China. And then moreover,\nI guess, on the industrial side, is that where you're seeing inventory correction? What's the timing of recovery and your thoughts there?\nAkash Palkhiwala - Qualcomm Inc - Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer\nYeah, sure. So on the consumer side, as we said, new product launches, both in XR and NPC, definitely a factor in our performance. And then on\nthe industrial side, at Embedded World, we announced a new product portfolio, updated product portfolio, that addresses both not just chipsets\nbut software readiness to drive through AI-ready use cases in industrial.\nWe think that that market is turning. There's an inflection point and there's going to be a lot of demand for solutions that have processing,\nconnectivity, AI readiness. And so we're seeing this early stages of demand come through for our solutions. And this is one of the topics that we'll\ndiscuss in detail at our Investor Day, so stay tuned on that one.\nC.J. Muse - Cantor Fitzgerald - Analyst\nVery helpful. And as a follow-up, in your 10-K, you talked about a large customer potentially going internal as a next several quarter risk. And\nobviously, this has been discussed for many years. But if it were to happen, how should we think about the moving parts to your overall QCT\nmargins?\nAkash Palkhiwala - Qualcomm Inc - Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer\nI think no real change, no new information here. I think you -- there's enough data out there for you to be able to size the risk that we've always\noutlined. As we've said, we have a three-year agreement, '24, '25, and '26 phone launches; and the framework of that agreement is consistent with\nthe prior one.\nOur planning assumption has been that the share will ramp down to 20% for the '26 launch, and the agreement ends after that. So no change really\nto anything we've said in the past, and I think that's how our planning assumption is. Anything better would be upside.\nC.J. Muse - Cantor Fitzgerald - Analyst\nThank you.\nOperator\nThat concludes our question-and-answer session. Mr. Amon, do you have anything further to add before adjourning the call?\nCristiano Renno Amon - Qualcomm Inc - President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, just a few statements. Thank you. Thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today.\nWhen we look at Qualcomm, I think we feel pretty good at our position. There are very few companies positioned in so many markets in the\ntransformation of many industries.\n13\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

We're really focused on executing on our growth and diversification. And we're\nreally looking forward, I think, to tell our story on November 19.\nI'd like to take a moment to thank all of our employees for incredible fiscal year -- fiscal '24. They're truly the best part of Qualcomm. And we're\ngoing to be -- keep executing and focus on changing the company into a connected computing company for the age of AI.\nThank you so much, and I look forward to speaking with you all next quarter.\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.
