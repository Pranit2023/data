(Simply Wall St) \n\nApril 10, 2024 4 min read\n\n## In This Article:\n\n[ SENEA  -1.06% ](/quote/SENEA/ \"SENEA\")\n\n[ SENEB  +3.95% ](/quote/SENEB/ \"SENEB\")\n\n### Key Insights\n\n  * Institutions' substantial holdings in Seneca Foods implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price\n\n  * The top 17 shareholders own 51% of the company\n\n  * [ Recent purchases by insiders ](https://simplywall.st/company/id/B8F110F5-8E3C-4173-B257-E0CB109A3C0A/ownership?blueprint=2986596&utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=cta&utm_source=yahoo)\n\n\n\n\nEvery investor in Seneca Foods Corporation ([NASDAQ:SENE.A](https://au.finance.yahoo.com/quote/SENEA)) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 44% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\n\nSince institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.\n\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Seneca Foods, beginning with the chart below.\n\n[ See our latest analysis for Seneca Foods ](https://simplywall.st/company/id/B8F110F5-8E3C-4173-B257-E0CB109A3C0A?blueprint=2986596&utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=cta&utm_source=yahoo)\n\n[![ownership-breakdown](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/pxbgrNsvt5whh1ttwvlISw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTM3MjtjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/simply_wall_st__316/6bc054e93731be78965cf5a6b6b40c42)](https://simplywall.st/company/id/B8F110F5-8E3C-4173-B257-E0CB109A3C0A/ownership?blueprint=2986596&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=infographic&amp;utm_source=yahoo)\n\nNasdaqGS:SENE.A Ownership Breakdown April 10th 2024 \n\n## What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Seneca Foods?\n\nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\n\nWe can see that Seneca Foods does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Seneca Foods' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.\n\n[![earnings-and-revenue-growth](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/QRtvMkdKCnPmSEIT_IUTOQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTYxMztjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/simply_wall_st__316/cc96dbe09f59a863a1ba639b13e7be6b)](https://simplywall.st/company/id/B8F110F5-8E3C-4173-B257-E0CB109A3C0A/future?blueprint=2986596&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=infographic&amp;utm_source=yahoo)\n\nNasdaqGS:SENE.A Earnings and Revenue Growth April 10th 2024 \n\nHedge funds don't have many shares in Seneca Foods. Seneca Foods Corp. Employees' Pension Benefit Plan is currently the company's largest shareholder with 8.1% of shares outstanding. With 7.7% and 6.1% of the shares outstanding respectively, Dimensional Fund Advisors LP and BlackRock, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders. In addition, we found that Paul Palmby, the CEO has 2.6% of the shares allocated to their name.\n\nA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 17 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.\n\nResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. We're not picking up on any analyst coverage of the stock at the moment, so the company is unlikely to be widely held.\n\nStory Continues\n\n## Insider Ownership Of Seneca Foods\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.\n\nInsider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.\n\nOur information suggests that insiders maintain a significant holding in Seneca Foods Corporation.

2024, 5:42 PM 2 min read\n\n## In This Article: \n\n[ SENEA  -1.06% ](/quote/SENEA/ \"SENEA\")\n\n[ SENEB  +3.95% ](/quote/SENEB/ \"SENEB\")\n\nThe worst result, after buying shares in a company (assuming no leverage), would be if you lose all the money you put in. But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. Long term **Seneca Foods Corporation** ([NASDAQ:SENE.A](https://simplywall.st/company/id/B8F110F5-8E3C-4173-B257-E0CB109A3C0A?blueprint=2932978&utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=intro&utm_source=yahoo)) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 122% in five years. And in the last month, the share price has gained 14%.\n\nLet's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns.\n\n[ See our latest analysis for Seneca Foods ](https://simplywall.st/company/id/B8F110F5-8E3C-4173-B257-E0CB109A3C0A?blueprint=2932978&utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=cta&utm_source=yahoo)\n\nTo quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.\n\nDuring the five years of share price growth, Seneca Foods moved from a loss to profitability. Sometimes, the start of profitability is a major inflection point that can signal fast earnings growth to come, which in turn justifies very strong share price gains.\n\nThe graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).\n\n[![earnings-per-share-growth]()](https://simplywall.st/company/id/B8F110F5-8E3C-4173-B257-E0CB109A3C0A/past?blueprint=2932978&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=infographic&amp;utm_source=yahoo)\n\nNasdaqGS:SENE.A Earnings Per Share Growth March 14th 2024 \n\nWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Seneca Foods' [earnings, revenue and cash flow](https://simplywall.st/company/id/B8F110F5-8E3C-4173-B257-E0CB109A3C0A/past?blueprint=2932978&utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=integrated-pitch&utm_source=yahoo).\n\n## A Different Perspective\n\nSeneca Foods shareholders are down 1.0% for the year, but the market itself is up 34%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 17% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Seneca Foods better, we need to consider many other factors.

read\n\n## In This Article:\n\n[ SENEA  -1.06% ](/quote/SENEA/ \"SENEA\")\n\n[ SENEB  +3.95% ](/quote/SENEB/ \"SENEB\")\n\nTo find a multi-bagger stock, what are the underlying trends we should look for in a business? In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. So when we looked at **Seneca Foods** ([NASDAQ:SENE.A](https://simplywall.st/company/id/B8F110F5-8E3C-4173-B257-E0CB109A3C0A?blueprint=2864095&utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=intro&utm_source=yahoo)) and its trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw.\n\n## Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)\n\nIf you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Seneca Foods, this is the formula:\n\n**Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)**\n\n0.065 = US$74m ÷ (US$1.6b - US$433m) _(Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023)_.\n\nTherefore, **Seneca Foods has an ROCE of 6.5%.** Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Food industry average of 10%.\n\n[ Check out our latest analysis for Seneca Foods ](https://simplywall.st/company/id/B8F110F5-8E3C-4173-B257-E0CB109A3C0A?blueprint=2864095&utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=cta&utm_source=yahoo)\n\n[![roce](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/lXecNamZU5t2riQD5EMGMw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTY0MDtoPTYwNztjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/simply_wall_st__316/cf36d94e7d9ae94ba84bb394c49f815c)](https://simplywall.st/company/id/B8F110F5-8E3C-4173-B257-E0CB109A3C0A?blueprint=2864095&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=infographic&amp;utm_source=yahoo)\n\nNasdaqGS:SENE.A Return on Capital Employed February 9th 2024 \n\nWhile the past is not representative of the future, it can be helpful to know how a company has performed historically, which is why we have this chart above.

The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last five years to 6.5%. The company is effectively making more money per dollar of capital used, and it's worth noting that the amount of capital has increased too, by 38%. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers.\n\n## Our Take On Seneca Foods' ROCE\n\nAll in all, it's terrific to see that Seneca Foods is reaping the rewards from prior investments and is growing its capital base. Since the stock has returned a solid 74% to shareholders over the last five years, it's fair to say investors are beginning to recognize these changes. Therefore, we think it would be worth your time to check if these trends are going to continue.\n\nLike most companies, Seneca Foods does come with some risks, and we've found[ **2 warning signs** ](https://simplywall.st/company/id/B8F110F5-8E3C-4173-B257-E0CB109A3C0A?blueprint=2864095&utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=conclusion-grid&utm_source=yahoo) that you should be aware of.\n\nWhile Seneca Foods may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

The effect of the LIFO inventory valuation method on YTD nine months pre-tax results decreased operating earnings by $19.6 million and $79.3 million for the nine months ended December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.  \n---|---  \nNote 2:| During the three and nine months ended December 30, 2023, respectively, the Company incurred restructuring charges primarily due to plants that were closed in previous periods. During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, the Company incurred restructuring charges primarily associated with ceasing production of green beans at a plant in the Northeast. The charges were comprised of severance costs and a write down of production equipment that was sold during the subsequent twelve months.  \nNote 3:| The Company had net other operating expense of $0.4 million during the three months ended December 30, 2023, which was driven by $0.6 million of transition service fees incurred in connection with an asset acquisition. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company had net other operating expense of $0.2 million, which was driven primarily by a write down of idle production equipment to estimated selling price, less commission, as the assets met the criteria to be classified as held for sale at December 31, 2022. The write down was partially offset by a gain on the sale of an aircraft. The Company had net other operating income of $1.2 million during the nine months ended December 30, 2023, which was driven primarily by $1.8 million from the sale of non-operational assets in the Pacific Northwest, offset by $0.6 million of transition service fees during the nine-month period. During the nine months ended December 31, 2022, the Company had net other operating income of $2.4 million, which was driven primarily by a gain on the sale of the Company’s western trucking fleet amongst other fixed assets and a true-up of the supplemental early retirement plan accrual, partially offset by the aforementioned write down of idle production equipment.  \nNote 4:| The Company used the “two-class” method for basic earnings per share by dividing the net earnings attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average of common shares outstanding during the period.  \n  \n![](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/EV12QskukJy21HvTaz6B5A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTU0MDtjZj13ZWJw/https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/ZWQzNjlmZmEtNDlhYi00YWQzLThjZDQtNmJiODRhMWJkMGJjLTEwMzEyMTU=/tiny/Seneca-Foods-Corp-.png)\n\nView Comments \n\n[Terms ](https://guce.yahoo.com/terms?locale=en-US)\n\nand \n\n[Privacy Policy ](https://guce.yahoo.com/privacy-policy?locale=en-US)\n\n[Privacy Dashboard ](https://guce.yahoo.com/privacy-dashboard?locale=en-US)\n\n## Recommended Stories\n\nWaiting for permission\n\nAllow microphone access to enable voice search\n\nTry again.\n\nTry saying\n"

](/quote/SENEA/ \"SENEA\")\n\n[ SENEB  +3.95% ](/quote/SENEB/ \"SENEB\")\n\n[ BGS  +3.73% ](/quote/BGS/ \"BGS\")\n\nAlluvial Capital Management, an investment advisory firm, released its fourth-quarter 2023 investor letter. A copy of the same can be [downloaded here](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/alluvial-capital-managements-q4-2023-investor-letter-1251671/). The fund returned 3.2% in the fourth quarter, bringing yearly returns to 15.1%. The portfolio typically lags during significant market movements, and the current quarter was no different. Despite being ahead of benchmarks through October, the fund achieved a decent outcome this year, outperforming the micro-cap index and trailing only small caps. In addition, you can check the top 5 holdings of the fund to know its best picks in 2023.\n\nAlluvial Capital Management featured stocks such as Seneca Foods Corporation (NASDAQ:[SENEA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SENEA)) in the fourth quarter 2023 investor letter. Headquartered in Fairport, New York, Seneca Foods Corporation (NASDAQ:SENEA) offers packaged fruits and vegetables. On January 30, 2024, Seneca Foods Corporation (NASDAQ:SENEA) stock closed at $54.99 per share. One-month return of Seneca Foods Corporation (NASDAQ:SENEA) was 4.31%, and its shares lost 9.63% of their value over the last 52 weeks. Seneca Foods Corporation (NASDAQ:SENEA) has a market capitalization of $390.07 million.\n\nAlluvial Capital Management stated the following regarding Seneca Foods Corporation (NASDAQ:SENEA) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n> \"**Seneca Foods Corporation** (NASDAQ:SENEA) has been active. Shares dipped after quarterly results but have since recovered. In November, the company acquired the Green Giant canned vegetables business from B&G Foods. Seneca was already active in co-manufacturing product for B&G, so this acquisition should result in increased gross profit for Seneca with little incremental investment or expenditure. Besides the B&G Foods assets, Seneca Foods has been very active in repurchasing its own shares, reducing the quantity outstanding by nearly 6% from July through October. I expect to see additional repurchase activity when the company reports in February. Buying back shares while they trade at a mid-single digit multiple of earnings is an excellent use of capital.\"\n\n![5 States with the Lowest Unemployment Rates](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/gzrvul0DgEDryv8CeqIQRg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTUzODtjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/insidermonkey.com/362cc99aaf9d3acc1d6f7b57545e70da)\n\n5 States with the Lowest Unemployment Rates \n\nA worker taking out freshly made packaged food products from a production line.\n\nSeneca Foods Corporation (NASDAQ:SENEA) is not on our list of [30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/30-most-popular-stocks-among-hedge-funds-2023-q3-1174547/).
