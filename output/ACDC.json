Partners with Prairie Operating Co. to Launch Electric Frac Fleet in Colorado\")\n\n**_Innovative Collaboration Aims to Set New Standards in Emissions Reduction and Efficiency_**\n\nWILLOW PARK, Texas, Nov. 12, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- ProFrac Holding Corp. (NASDAQ: ACDC) (\"ProFrac\", or the \"Company\") is proud to announce its partnership with Prairie Operating Co. (NASDAQ: PROP) (\"Prairie\") to implement an electric frac fleet for operations in Colorado. This groundbreaking initiative will feature a fleet of 25 advanced 3,000 HHP single E-Pumps, allowing both hydraulic fracturing and pump down operations to be fully electrified.\n\nProFrac anticipates initial frac operations under the new partnership will commence on Prairie's recently drilled 8-well Shelduck pad in Weld County, CO.\n\n\"This partnership represents a significant step forward in our commitment to emissions reductions, innovative technology and operational efficiency,\" said Edward Kovalik, Chairman and CEO of Prairie Operating Co. \"By transitioning to an all-electric frac fleet, we are not only enhancing our operational capabilities but also taking proactive measures to reduce our environmental impact. Combined with our previously announced agreement with High West Energy to provide line power in Weld County, the ProFrac partnership moves us toward our ultimate goal of having all operations, drilling through the production phase, fully electrified.\"\n\n\"We are excited to partner with Prairie Operating Co. on this transformative initiative to implement an all-electric frac fleet in Colorado,\" said Matt Wilks, Executive Chairman of ProFrac. \"At ProFrac, we are committed to advancing cutting-edge technologies that drive operational efficiency and reduce environmental impact. This collaboration not only supports Prairie's vision of a fully electrified operation but also strengthens our position in the Rockies, where we continue to grow our presence. Our goal is to secure long-term contracts on our top-tier assets, and this partnership marks another important milestone in this effort and further positions us to lead the industry in electrification and sustainable operations,\" concluded Mr. Wilks.\n\nIn addition to the E-Pumps, the fleet will be equipped with state-of-the-art electric blender units, hydration systems, and chemical additive units, all powered by 100% natural gas, marking a significant shift from conventional diesel-powered operations.\n\nTo support this fully electric fleet, power will be provided by state-of-the-art turbine generators, including two new Solar – SMT130 Mobile Gas Turbines each capable of generating 16.5 MWe ISO (13.8 kV).\n\nPrairie is committed to upholding Colorado's stringent emissions standards through the implementation of ProFrac's innovative power generation solutions. The Solar – SMT 130 Mobile Gas Turbines are expected to reduce emissions significantly across key metrics and stay below the Air Quality Control Commission's stated NOx targets.\n\nThe collaboration between Prairie and ProFrac underscores both companies' dedication to innovation in the energy sector, setting a new benchmark for responsible and efficient hydraulic fracturing practices.\n\n**About Prairie Operating Co.** Prairie Operating Co. is a Houston-based publicly traded independent energy company engaged in the development and acquisition of oil and natural gas resources in the United States.

(NASDAQ: ACDC) (\"ProFrac\", or the \"Company\") today announced financial and operational results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Results**\n\n  * Total revenue was $575.3 million compared to second quarter revenue of $579.4 million\n  * Net loss was $43.5 million compared to net loss of $65.6 million in the second quarter\n  * Adjusted EBITDA(1) was $134.8 million compared to $135.6 million in the second quarter\n  * Net cash provided by operating activities was $98.0 million compared to $113.5 million in the second quarter\n  * Capital expenditures totaled $70.0 million\n  * Free cash flow(2) was $30.9 million\n\n\n\nMatt Wilks, ProFrac's Executive Chairman, stated, \"We continued our recent quarterly trend setting new operating efficiency records while delivering leading performance for our customers amidst a challenging market environment. Despite continued activity softness, ProFrac was able to deliver strong financial results in line with the second quarter. As I have previously highlighted, ProFrac's leading position throughout the completions value chain enables us to deliver robust financial and operational performance through-the-cycle. Further, our integrated platform bolsters our commercial strategy to partner with operators that value integrated, highly efficient solutions at scale.\n\n\"ProFrac's third quarter performance is underpinned by our record-setting efficiency per active fleet, which is a clear testament to the quality of our people and their commitment to safety, efficiency and premium customer service,\" concluded Mr. Wilks.\n\n**Outlook**\n\nIn the **_Stimulation Services segment_ ,** the Company anticipates pricing and activity to decline in the fourth quarter. Due to our integrated model and prudent cost management, we are able to navigate cyclicality without sacrificing service and asset quality. Based on ongoing dialogue with operators we anticipate a recovery in activity in 2025 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2024, and we continue to field new inbound requests for additional integrated fleet deployments with the highest demand for electric and Tier 4 dual fuel or DGB technologies. Today, approximately 72% of our active fleets include e-fleet or natural gas-capable equipment.\n\nThe **_Proppant Production_** **_segment_** started to see incremental improvement as we moved through the third quarter, although natural gas-directed activity was subdued and West Texas remains highly competitive. We anticipate that pricing and volumes in the fourth quarter will be impacted by weaker demand. We continue to actively manage operating costs to partially mitigate the impact of lower profitability. We expect a recovery in activity in 2025 relative to the fourth quarter, with a more pronounced potential improvement in oil-levered regions.\n\n**Business Segment Information**\n\nThe **_Stimulation Services_**** _segment_** generated revenues of $507.1 million in the third quarter, which resulted in $112.6 million of Adjusted EBITDA.\n\nThe **_Proppant Production_** **_segment_** generated revenues of $52.8 million in the third quarter, which resulted in $17.3 million of Adjusted EBITDA. Approximately 24% of the Proppant Production segment's revenue was intercompany.\n\nThe **_Manufacturing_** **_segment_** generated revenues of $61.5 million in the third quarter, which resulted in $0.1 million of Adjusted EBITDA. Approximately 80% of the Manufacturing segment's revenue was intercompany.\n\nOur **_Other Business Activities_** generated revenues of $51.3 million in the third quarter, which resulted in $4.8 million of Adjusted EBITDA. The Other Business Activities solely relate to the results of Flotek.\n\n**Capital Expenditures and Capital Allocation**\n\nCash capital expenditures totaled $70 million in the third quarter, approximately flat from the prior quarter.\n\nFor the full year 2024, the Company expects to incur capital expenditures closer to the lower end of previously provided guidance. Maintenance-related capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $150 million to $200 million, while growth-related capital expenditures across all segments are expected to total approximately $100 million in 2024. The Company continues to monitor market conditions, industry dynamics and customer demand to appropriately align spending levels and growth initiative timelines. Currently, growth capital expenditures for 2024 are expected to be primarily related to frac fleet upgrades, investments in next generation technologies, and sand mine improvements.\n\n**Balance Sheet and Liquidity**\n\nTotal debt outstanding as of September 30, 2024 was $1.17 billion. Net debt(3) outstanding as of September 30, 2024 was $1.18 billion.\n\nTotal cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 was $25.5 million, of which $5.0 million was related to Flotek and not accessible by the Company.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024 the Company had $109.2 million of liquidity, including approximately $20.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, excluding Flotek, and $88.7 million of availability under its asset-based credit facility.\n\n**Footnotes**  \n---  \n(1) |  Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") (a \"Non-GAAP Financial Measure\").

Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are supplemental measures utilized by our management and other users of our financial statements such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and others, to assess our financial performance. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is an important supplemental measure because it allows us to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the effects of our capital structure (such as varying levels of interest expense), asset base (such as depreciation and amortization) and items outside the control of our management team (such as income tax rates). We believe Free Cash Flow is an important supplemental liquidity measure of the cash that is available (if any), after purchases of property and equipment, for operational expenses, investment in our business, and to make acquisitions, and Free Cash Flow is useful to investors as a liquidity measure because it measures our ability to generate or use cash in excess of our capital investments in property and equipment. We believe Net Debt is an important supplemental measure of indebtedness for management and investors because it provides a more complete understanding of our leverage position and borrowing capacity after factoring in cash and cash equivalents.\n\nWe view Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow as important indicators of performance. We define Adjusted EBITDA as our net income (loss), before (i) interest expense, net, (ii) income taxes, (iii) depreciation, depletion and amortization, (iv) loss or gain on disposal of assets, (v) stock-based compensation, and (vi) other charges, such as certain credit losses, (gain) or loss on extinguishment of debt, unrealized loss (or gain) on investments, acquisition and integration expenses, litigation expenses and accruals for legal contingencies, acquisition earnout adjustments, severance charges, goodwill impairments, gains on insurance recoveries, transaction costs, third-party supply commitment charges, and impairments of long-lived assets. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by or (used in) operating activities less investment in property, plant and equipment plus proceeds from sale of assets.\n\nWe believe that our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow will provide useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nNet income (loss) is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss). Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes some but not all items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Because Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of this non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to Free Cash Flow. Free Cash Flow should not be considered as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities. Free Cash Flow has important limitations as an analytical tool including that Free Cash Flow does not reflect the cash requirements necessary to service our indebtedness and Free Cash Flow is not a reliable measure for actual cash available to the Company at any one time. Because Free Cash Flow may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of this Non-GAAP Financial Measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.\n\nNet Debt is defined as total debt plus unamortized debt discounts, premiums, and issuance costs less cash and cash equivalents. Total debt is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to Net Debt. Net Debt should not be considered as an alternative to total debt. Net Debt has important limitations as a measure of indebtedness because it does not represent the total amount of indebtedness of the Company.\n\nThe presentation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures is not intended to be a substitute for, and should not be considered in isolation from, the financial measures reported in accordance with GAAP.

(NASDAQ: ACDC) (\"ProFrac\", or the \"Company\") today announced financial and operational results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Results**\n\n  * Total revenue was $579.4 million compared to first quarter revenue of $581.5 million\n  * Net loss was $65.6 million compared to net income of $3.0 million in the first quarter\n  * Adjusted EBITDA(1) was $135.6 million compared to $159.7 million in the first quarter\n  * Net cash provided by operating activities grew approximately 43% sequentially over the first quarter to $113.5 million\n  * Capital expenditures totaled $61.9 million\n  * Free cash flow(2) grew 187% sequentially to $74.0 million\n\n\n\nMatt Wilks, ProFrac's Executive Chairman, stated, \"Overall, the market for our services has been challenged as operators have reduced drilling and completion activity, particularly in natural gas regions. This market softness in the second quarter led to sequentially lower results in the quarter.\n\n\"However, despite these challenges, we are proud to report that our team achieved records for average pump hours per fleet and efficiencies during the second quarter, while concurrently upgrading our fleet with additional electric and Tier 4 dual fuel systems. Today, we continue to field new inbound requests for additional deployments with the highest demand being for electric and Tier 4 dual fuel or DGB technologies. Strengthened by our vertical integration, we continue to build scale and position ProFrac to deliver long-term value for our stakeholders,\" concluded Mr. Wilks. \n\n**Outlook**\n\nIn the **_Stimulation Services segment_ ,** the Company anticipates pricing will remain steady. Because of our superior cost structure and operating leverage, we continue to see opportunities to further improve profitability per fleet. We also continue to field new inbound requests for additional integrated fleet deployments with the highest demand for electric and Tier 4 dual fuel or DGB technologies. Today, 70% of our active fleets include e-fleet or natural gas-capable equipment.\n\nIn the **_Proppant Production_** **_segment_** , the Company currently anticipates that total volumes and pricing will continue to decline followed by a gradual recovery. However, the Company expects that the reduction in profitability will be partially offset by operating cost reductions and the idling of one underperforming mine in the Haynesville region.\n\n**Business Segment Information**\n\nThe **_Stimulation Services_**** _segment_** generated revenues of $505.6 million in the second quarter, which resulted in $107.3 million of Adjusted EBITDA.\n\nThe **_Proppant Production_** segment generated revenues of $69.5 million in the second quarter, which resulted in $25.7 million of Adjusted EBITDA. Approximately 23% of the Proppant Production segment's revenue was intercompany. Additionally, the segment recognized a goodwill impairment of $67.7 million related to the Company's Haynesville Proppant reporting unit, which does not impact Adjusted EBITDA.\n\nThe **_Manufacturing_** segment generated revenues of $55.9 million in the second quarter, which resulted in $0.1 million of Adjusted EBITDA. Approximately 74% of the Manufacturing segment's revenue was intercompany.\n\nOur **_Other Business Activities_** generated revenues of $47.6 million in the second quarter, which resulted in $4.4 million of Adjusted EBITDA. The Other Business Activities solely relate to the results of Flotek.\n\n**Capital Expenditures and Capital Allocation**\n\nCash capital expenditures totaled $61.9 million in the second quarter, approximately flat from the prior quarter.\n\nFor the full year 2024, the Company expects to incur capital expenditures closer to the lower end of previously provided guidance. Maintenance-related capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $150 million to $200 million, while growth-related capital expenditures across all segments are expected to total approximately $100 million in 2024. The Company continues to monitor market conditions, industry dynamics and customer demand to appropriately align spending levels and growth initiative timelines. Currently, growth capital expenditures for 2024 are expected to be primarily related to frac fleet upgrades, investments in next generation technologies, and sand mine improvements.\n\n**Balance Sheet and Liquidity**\n\nTotal debt outstanding as of June 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024 was $1.20 billion and $1.05 billion, respectively. Net debt(3) outstanding as of June 30, 2024 was $1.21 billion, an increase of approximately $153.6 million from the first quarter, related to the June issuance of $120 million of senior secured floating rate notes due June 2029, which was used to fund the Company's acquisition of AST.\n\nTotal cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2024 was $24.0 million, of which $4.8 million was related to Flotek and not accessible by the Company.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024 the Company had $161.2 million of liquidity, including approximately $19.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, excluding Flotek, and $142.0 million of availability under its asset-based credit facility.\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n(1) |  Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") (a \"Non-GAAP Financial Measure\").

Such forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions made by the Company as of the date hereof and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.

The reader should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. The Company anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause its assessments to change. However, while the Company may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, it expressly disclaims any duty to update these forward-looking statements, except as otherwise required by law.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nAdjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow and Net Debt are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss) or net cash from operating activities, respectively, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP or as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our profitability or liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are supplemental measures utilized by our management and other users of our financial statements such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and others, to assess our financial performance. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is an important supplemental measure because it allows us to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the effects of our capital structure (such as varying levels of interest expense), asset base (such as depreciation and amortization) and items outside the control of our management team (such as income tax rates). We believe Free Cash Flow is an important supplemental liquidity measure of the cash that is available (if any), after purchases of property and equipment, for operational expenses, investment in our business, and to make acquisitions, and Free Cash Flow is useful to investors as a liquidity measure because it measures our ability to generate or use cash in excess of our capital investments in property and equipment. We believe Net Debt is an important supplemental measure of indebtedness for management and investors because it provides a more complete understanding of our leverage position and borrowing capacity after factoring in cash and cash equivalents.\n\nWe view Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow as important indicators of performance. We define Adjusted EBITDA as our net income (loss), before (i) interest expense, net, (ii) income taxes, (iii) depreciation, depletion and amortization, (iv) loss or gain on disposal of assets, (v) stock-based compensation, and (vi) other charges, such as certain credit losses, (gain) or loss on extinguishment of debt, unrealized loss (or gain) on investments, acquisition and integration expenses, litigation expenses and accruals for legal contingencies, acquisition earnout adjustments, severance charges, goodwill impairments, gains on insurance recoveries, and impairments of long-lived assets. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by or (used in) operating activities less investment in property, plant and equipment plus proceeds from sale of assets.\n\nWe believe that our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow will provide useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nNet income (loss) is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss). Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes some but not all items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Because Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of this non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to Free Cash Flow. Free Cash Flow should not be considered as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities. Free Cash Flow has important limitations as an analytical tool including that Free Cash Flow does not reflect the cash requirements necessary to service our indebtedness and Free Cash Flow is not a reliable measure for actual cash available to the Company at any one time. Because Free Cash Flow may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of this Non-GAAP Financial Measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.\n\nNet Debt is defined as total debt plus unamortized debt discounts, premiums, and issuance costs less cash and cash equivalents. Total debt is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to Net Debt. Net Debt should not be considered as an alternative to total debt. Net Debt has important limitations as a measure of indebtedness because it does not represent the total amount of indebtedness of the Company.\n\nThe presentation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures is not intended to be a substitute for, and should not be considered in isolation from, the financial measures reported in accordance with GAAP. The following tables present a reconciliation of the Non-GAAP Financial Measures of Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for the periods indicated.\n\nContacts: |  _ProFrac Holding Corp._  \n---|---  \nAustin Harbour – Chief Financial Officer  \nMichael Messina – Director of Finance  \ninvestors@pfholdingscorp.com  \n_Dennard Lascar Investor Relations_  \nKen Dennard / Rick Black  \nACDC@dennardlascar.com  \n  \n_- Tables to Follow-_\n\nProFrac Holding Corp.

(NASDAQ: ACDC) (\"ProFrac\", or the \"Company\") today announced financial and operational results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Results**\n\n  * Total revenue was $575.3 million compared to second quarter revenue of $579.4 million\n  * Net loss was $43.5 million compared to net loss of $65.6 million in the second quarter\n  * Adjusted EBITDA(1) was $134.8 million compared to $135.6 million in the second quarter\n  * Net cash provided by operating activities was $98.0 million compared to $113.5 million in the second quarter\n  * Capital expenditures totaled $70.0 million\n  * Free cash flow(2) was $30.9 million\n\n\n\nMatt Wilks, ProFrac's Executive Chairman, stated, \"We continued our recent quarterly trend setting new operating efficiency records while delivering leading performance for our customers amidst a challenging market environment. Despite continued activity softness, ProFrac was able to deliver strong financial results in line with the second quarter. As I have previously highlighted, ProFrac's leading position throughout the completions value chain enables us to deliver robust financial and operational performance through-the-cycle. Further, our integrated platform bolsters our commercial strategy to partner with operators that value integrated, highly efficient solutions at scale.\n\n\"ProFrac's third quarter performance is underpinned by our record-setting efficiency per active fleet, which is a clear testament to the quality of our people and their commitment to safety, efficiency and premium customer service,\" concluded Mr. Wilks.\n\n**Outlook**\n\nIn the **_Stimulation Services segment_ ,** the Company anticipates pricing and activity to decline in the fourth quarter. Due to our integrated model and prudent cost management, we are able to navigate cyclicality without sacrificing service and asset quality. Based on ongoing dialogue with operators we anticipate a recovery in activity in 2025 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2024, and we continue to field new inbound requests for additional integrated fleet deployments with the highest demand for electric and Tier 4 dual fuel or DGB technologies. Today, approximately 72% of our active fleets include e-fleet or natural gas-capable equipment.\n\nThe **_Proppant Production_** **_segment_** started to see incremental improvement as we moved through the third quarter, although natural gas-directed activity was subdued and West Texas remains highly competitive. We anticipate that pricing and volumes in the fourth quarter will be impacted by weaker demand. We continue to actively manage operating costs to partially mitigate the impact of lower profitability. We expect a recovery in activity in 2025 relative to the fourth quarter, with a more pronounced potential improvement in oil-levered regions.\n\n**Business Segment Information**\n\nThe **_Stimulation Services_**** _segment_** generated revenues of $507.1 million in the third quarter, which resulted in $112.6 million of Adjusted EBITDA.\n\nThe **_Proppant Production_** **_segment_** generated revenues of $52.8 million in the third quarter, which resulted in $17.3 million of Adjusted EBITDA. Approximately 24% of the Proppant Production segment's revenue was intercompany.\n\nThe **_Manufacturing_** **_segment_** generated revenues of $61.5 million in the third quarter, which resulted in $0.1 million of Adjusted EBITDA. Approximately 80% of the Manufacturing segment's revenue was intercompany.\n\nOur **_Other Business Activities_** generated revenues of $51.3 million in the third quarter, which resulted in $4.8 million of Adjusted EBITDA. The Other Business Activities solely relate to the results of Flotek.\n\n**Capital Expenditures and Capital Allocation**\n\nCash capital expenditures totaled $70 million in the third quarter, approximately flat from the prior quarter.\n\nFor the full year 2024, the Company expects to incur capital expenditures closer to the lower end of previously provided guidance. Maintenance-related capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $150 million to $200 million, while growth-related capital expenditures across all segments are expected to total approximately $100 million in 2024. The Company continues to monitor market conditions, industry dynamics and customer demand to appropriately align spending levels and growth initiative timelines. Currently, growth capital expenditures for 2024 are expected to be primarily related to frac fleet upgrades, investments in next generation technologies, and sand mine improvements.\n\n**Balance Sheet and Liquidity**\n\nTotal debt outstanding as of September 30, 2024 was $1.17 billion. Net debt(3) outstanding as of September 30, 2024 was $1.18 billion.\n\nTotal cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 was $25.5 million, of which $5.0 million was related to Flotek and not accessible by the Company.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024 the Company had $109.2 million of liquidity, including approximately $20.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, excluding Flotek, and $88.7 million of availability under its asset-based credit facility.\n\n**Footnotes**  \n---  \n(1) |  Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") (a \"Non-GAAP Financial Measure\").

Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are supplemental measures utilized by our management and other users of our financial statements such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and others, to assess our financial performance. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is an important supplemental measure because it allows us to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the effects of our capital structure (such as varying levels of interest expense), asset base (such as depreciation and amortization) and items outside the control of our management team (such as income tax rates). We believe Free Cash Flow is an important supplemental liquidity measure of the cash that is available (if any), after purchases of property and equipment, for operational expenses, investment in our business, and to make acquisitions, and Free Cash Flow is useful to investors as a liquidity measure because it measures our ability to generate or use cash in excess of our capital investments in property and equipment. We believe Net Debt is an important supplemental measure of indebtedness for management and investors because it provides a more complete understanding of our leverage position and borrowing capacity after factoring in cash and cash equivalents.\n\nWe view Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow as important indicators of performance. We define Adjusted EBITDA as our net income (loss), before (i) interest expense, net, (ii) income taxes, (iii) depreciation, depletion and amortization, (iv) loss or gain on disposal of assets, (v) stock-based compensation, and (vi) other charges, such as certain credit losses, (gain) or loss on extinguishment of debt, unrealized loss (or gain) on investments, acquisition and integration expenses, litigation expenses and accruals for legal contingencies, acquisition earnout adjustments, severance charges, goodwill impairments, gains on insurance recoveries, transaction costs, third-party supply commitment charges, and impairments of long-lived assets. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by or (used in) operating activities less investment in property, plant and equipment plus proceeds from sale of assets.\n\nWe believe that our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow will provide useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nNet income (loss) is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss). Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes some but not all items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Because Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of this non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to Free Cash Flow. Free Cash Flow should not be considered as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities. Free Cash Flow has important limitations as an analytical tool including that Free Cash Flow does not reflect the cash requirements necessary to service our indebtedness and Free Cash Flow is not a reliable measure for actual cash available to the Company at any one time. Because Free Cash Flow may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of this Non-GAAP Financial Measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.\n\nNet Debt is defined as total debt plus unamortized debt discounts, premiums, and issuance costs less cash and cash equivalents. Total debt is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to Net Debt. Net Debt should not be considered as an alternative to total debt. Net Debt has important limitations as a measure of indebtedness because it does not represent the total amount of indebtedness of the Company.\n\nThe presentation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures is not intended to be a substitute for, and should not be considered in isolation from, the financial measures reported in accordance with GAAP. The following tables present a reconciliation of the Non-GAAP Financial Measures of Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for the periods indicated.\n\n_- Tables to Follow-_\n\nProFrac Holding Corp.
