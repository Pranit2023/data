11/19/2024\n\n[ Download the PDF version PDF Format (opens in new window) PDF ](//s27.q4cdn.com/877017610/files/doc_news/2024/Nov/19/Press-Release-First-Mid-Bank-Trust-Offers-Expert-Advice-on-Budgeting-During-the-Holidays.pdf)\n\n**St. Louis, MO (November 19, 2024)** The National Retail Federation estimates Americans will spend $1 trillion purchasing gifts and other related items during the holidays. Inflation has gone up 22% over the past five years, meaning shoppers may feel the pinch in their wallets. To help people avoid financial stress, First Mid Bank & Trust (First Mid) is offering tips on how to budget for holiday expenses.\n\nStas Wolak, Chief Retail Banking Officer at First Mid, said sticking to a budget this time of year can seem overwhelming. However, a little bit of prioritizing and being creative can go a long way when shopping for gifts and other holiday needs. Wolak recommends really focusing on what means the most to you and your loved ones. For some, that’s gift-giving, for others, it’s cooking delicious meals. Families might also elect to spend more on certain traditions or trips.\n\n“Give some thought to what’s been successful in the past and the fondest memories you’ve made during those years,” Wolak said. “After setting your priorities, budgeting becomes a lot easier. It also helps to make purchases earlier, reducing stress when the holidays arrive. The gifts you buy right before a work party or visiting loved ones are usually your biggest expenses along with last-minute wrapping needs. It can be tough but try hard not to bust your budget. Remind yourself, no one ever says, ‘I wish I spent more over the holidays’ when February and March come around.”\n\nThere are plenty of ways to get creative with your spending. Wolak said practical gifts like pool passes are long-lasting and save you money over time. Reusable water bottles, bedding, and clothes are essential items that will always be put to good use. Instead of buying gifts, put that money toward sponsoring a family in need or donating to recent victims of a natural disaster for a real boost of holiday spirit.\n\n“Gift exchanges are another innovative way to limit spending. They come in many shapes and sizes, and it’s easy to Google how to make them a new tradition,” Wolak said. Another helpful tip is to check out sales on days like Black Friday and Cyber Monday. However, if you can, wait until early 2025 to get some of those big-ticket items as they tend to go even further down in price.\n\n“While starting to plan and save early in the year is ideal, we know it’s not always possible. Even beginning in September or October can make a difference, giving you extra room in your budget and helping you steer clear of holiday debt,” Wolak said. “Sticking to a budget is key, but if you manage your credit card responsibly and pay it off each month, using rewards strategically during the holidays can be a smart move.”\n\nFor more tips to help stay on track with holiday expenses, go to [www.firstmid.com/holiday-spending-tips/](http://www.firstmid.com/holiday-spending-tips/).\n\n**About First Mid Bancshares, Inc.:** First Mid Bancshares, Inc. is the parent company of First Mid Bank & Trust, N.A., First Mid Insurance Group, and First Mid Wealth Management Company.

11/14/2024\n\n[ Download the PDF version PDF Format (opens in new window) PDF ](//s27.q4cdn.com/877017610/files/doc_news/2024/Nov/14/Press-Release-First-Mid-Bank-Trust-Highlights-Local-Business-Ahead-of-Small-Business-Saturday.pdf)\n\n**St. Louis, MO (November 14, 2024)** The United States is home to 33 million independent small businesses, employing around 60 million people and providing a backbone to the country’s economy. With Small Business Saturday approaching on November 30, First Mid Bank & Trust (First Mid) is highlighting Clement Auto Group, a Greater St. Louis area small business that inspires entrepreneurs to grow their ventures while positively impacting the community. Clement Auto Group gives back to the community itself with its Drive for Excellence program, annually awarding a brand-new Ford Mustang to a local high school student.\n\nThe Drive for Excellence program promotes good grades and attendance by offering raffle tickets for report cards with A’s and B’s and extra tickets for perfect attendance. Every April, Clement Auto Group draws 20 finalists from the raffle tickets, then those 20 students get the chance to ‘try out keys’ at the dealership, with one of the keys being the lucky winner to unlock the Mustang. Clement Auto Group owner, Penuel ‘Raj’ Clement, said he started the program to encourage kids to do their best in school, adding he knows firsthand how important it is for young people to get a head start.\n\n“I have never allowed obstacles to deter me from pursuing my dreams,” Clement said. “As the youngest dealer to operate a Hyundai Motor America franchise and the nation's youngest first-generation Ford Motor Company dealer, I have always stood out in my field. Our Drive for Excellence program is about more than just giving away a brand-new car. It’s about encouraging kids to focus on their grades while still in high school. Building good study habits and working hard now will help them later in business or any other venture they pursue.”\n\nClement started his career as an entrepreneur in college by selling affordable cars on Craigslist to support himself. He completed his degree and started working at a local car dealership before starting his own. Since founding Clement Auto Group in 2012, he has grown the business into six dealerships and an auto service center in St. Louis and the Metro East. His advice to other potential small business owners is not to be afraid to take the leap.\n\n“My advice is to just take that first step,” Clement said. “Even if you have only 10% of the necessary resources, begin anyway. Trust your gut if you have an idea. Don’t let hesitation hold you back. Starting is the most significant factor in determining your business success. The other pieces will come together as you move forward, but you must start even before you feel ready.”\n\nClement has received support from First Mid throughout his time as a business owner. Commercial loans from First Mid have helped Clement Auto Group with various things, including funding for its service department and transportation trucks. Clement said his current commercial lender, Allen Burnett, has been there to help and guide him when needed.\n\n“I have a long-standing relationship with First Mid,” Clement said. “They have provided financing for my home, and I hold multiple accounts with them. I highly value the long-standing relationship we have maintained over the years. Their support has been crucial to the growth of my business.”\n\nFor anyone interested in starting or expanding their business, visit [www.firstmid.com/commercial-lending](http://www.firstmid.com/commercial-lending).\n\n**About First Mid Bancshares, Inc.:** First Mid Bancshares, Inc. is the parent company of First Mid Bank & Trust, N.A., First Mid Insurance Group, Inc., and First Mid Wealth Management Company.
