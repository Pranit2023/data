Net interest margin was 3.82% for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 3.83% for the second quarter of 2024.\n  * Non-performing assets were $17.4 million, representing 0.60% of total assets at September 30, 2024, compared to $10.6 million, representing 0.37% of total assets at June 30, 2024.

The allowance for credit losses-loans was 1.20% of total loans held for investment at September 30, 2024, unchanged from June 30, 2024.\n  * On May 9, 2024, the Company announced that LINKBANK had entered into a definitive purchase and assumption agreement for the sale of the Bank's banking operations and three branches in New Jersey, including related loans and deposits (the \"Branch Sale\"). The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, and is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024 or the first quarter of 2025.\n\n\n\nAs a result of the Branch Sale announcement, associated loans and deposits were reclassified as held for sale, impacting the Company's allowance for credit losses and purchase accounting amortization related to the loans held for sale. \n\n\"We are pleased to announce another quarter of record earnings for the third quarter of 2024, representing an annualized 1.00% return on average assets for the quarter and demonstrating solid progress toward achieving our target profitability metrics. This is a result of prioritizing high quality loan and strong core deposit growth, with an emphasis on achieving cost efficiencies from the merger and branch consolidations, while also executing on non-interest income initiatives,\" said Andrew Samuel, Chief Executive Officer of LINKBANCORP. \"As we look to close 2024 with a strong fourth quarter, our teams continue to implement strategies to reduce funding costs and operational expenses and generate additional revenue to support further earnings growth.\" \n\n1 See Appendix A – Reconciliation to Non-GAAP Financial Measures for the computation of this non-GAAP measure.  \n---  \n2 Total loans and total deposits include balances held for sale in the Branch Sale of $102.3 million and $94.0 million, respectively, at September 30, 2024. These balances were $116.2 million and $96.8 million respectively at June 30, 2024.   \n  \n**_Income Statement_** Net interest income before the provision for credit losses for the third quarter of 2024 was $25.0 million compared to $24.5 million in the second quarter of 2024.

Excluding one-time costs associated with the Branch Sale and branch consolidations of $171 thousand in the third quarter of 2024 and $631 thousand in the second quarter of 2024, adjusted noninterest expense was generally flat at $18.3 million for the second and third quarter of 20241 , as decreases in personnel and occupancy costs were offset by increases in FDIC deposit insurance and fraud-related operating losses.\n\nIncome tax expense was $2.0 million for the third quarter of 2024, reflecting an effective tax rate of 22.2%.\n\n1 See Appendix A – Reconciliation to Non-GAAP Financial Measures for the computation of this non-GAAP measure.  \n---  \n  \n**_Balance Sheet_** Total assets were $2.88 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to $2.86 billion at June 30, 2024 and $1.26 billion at September 30, 2023. Deposits and net loans as of September 30, 2024 totaled $2.37 billion and $2.19 billion, respectively, compared to deposits and net loans of $2.36 billion and $2.17 billion, respectively, at June 30, 2024 and $1.04 billion and $969.0 million, respectively, at September 30, 2023. Deposits and net loans exclude balances held for sale in the Branch Sale of $94.0 million and $102.3 million, respectively, at September 30, 2024, which are reflected in liabilities held for sale and assets held for sale. These balances were $96.8 million and $116.2 million respectively, at June 30, 2024. \n\nIncluding loans held for sale, total loans increased $8.8 million, from $2.31 billion at June 30, 2024 to $2.32 billion at September 30, 2024. Total commercial loan commitments for the third quarter of 2024 were $111.0 million with funded balances of $74.8 million.

This increase included growth of $54.5 million in demand deposit accounts and $21.4 million in retail time deposits, offset by a decrease in brokered deposits of $69.4 million quarter over quarter.\n\nThe Company maintains strong on-balance sheet liquidity, as cash and cash equivalents increased to $191.2 million at September 30, 2024 compared to $181.7 million at June 30, 2024.\n\nShareholders' equity increased from $271.4 million at June 30, 2024 to $277.4 million at September 30, 2024 primarily as a result of a $4.3 million increase in retained earnings. Book value per share increased to $7.42 at September 30, 2024 compared to $7.27 at June 30, 2024. Tangible book value per share increased to $5.26 at September 30, 2024 compared to $5.07 at June 30, 20241.\n\n1 See Appendix A – Reconciliation to Non-GAAP Financial Measures for the computation of this non-GAAP measure.  \n---  \n  \n**_Asset Quality_** The Company recorded a $84 thousand provision for credit losses during the third quarter of 2024, after recording no provision for credit losses in the second quarter of 2024. \n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company's non-performing assets were $17.4 million, representing 0.60% of total assets, compared to $10.6 million, representing 0.37% of total assets at June 30, 2024. The increase related primarily to a single real estate secured loan acquired in the merger with Partners Bancorp (the \"Partners Merger\") with an outstanding principal balance of approximately $5.5 million at September 30, 2024. Based on a recent appraisal and application of the Company's reserve methodology, a specific reserve was not needed for this loan as of September 30, 2024. \n\nLoans 30-89 days past due at September 30, 2024 were $2.7 million, representing 0.12% of total loans, an improvement compared to $5.2 million or 0.24% of total loans at June 30, 2024.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses-loans was $26.5 million, or 1.20% of total loans held for investment at September 30, 2024, compared to $26.3 million, or 1.20% of total loans held for investment at June 30, 2024. In addition to the recorded provision, the increased allowance resulted from a reallocation of a portion of the allowance for credit losses-unfunded commitments to the allowance for credit losses-loans. The allowance for credit losses-loans to nonperforming assets was 152.73% at September 30, 2024, compared to 248.26% at June 30, 2024.\n\n**_Capital_** The Bank's regulatory capital ratios were well in excess of regulatory minimums to be considered \"well capitalized\" as of September 30, 2024. The Bank's Total Capital Ratio and Tier 1 Capital Ratio were 11.44% and 10.62% respectively, at September 30, 2024, compared to 11.09% and 10.30 %, respectively, at June 30, 2024 and 12.92% and 12.37%, respectively, at September 30, 2023. The Company's ratio of Tangible Common Equity to Tangible Assets was 7.02%1 at September 30, 2024.\n\n1 See Appendix A – Reconciliation to Non-GAAP Financial Measures for the computation of this non-GAAP measure.  \n---  \n  \n**ABOUT LINKBANCORP, Inc.** LINKBANCORP, Inc. was formed in 2018 with a mission to positively impact lives through community banking.

Management uses these non-GAAP measures in its analysis of the Company's performance. These measures should not be considered a substitute for GAAP basis measures nor should they be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP. Management believes the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of specified items provide useful supplemental information that is essential to a proper understanding of the Company's financial condition and results. Non-GAAP measures are not formally defined under GAAP, and other entities may use calculation methods that differ from those used by us. As a complement to GAAP financial measures, our management believes these non-GAAP financial measures assist investors in comparing the financial condition and results of operations of financial institutions due to the industry prevalence of such non-GAAP measures. See the tables below for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\n\n**Adjusted Return on Average Assets**  \n---  \n**For the Three Months Ended** | **For the Nine Months Ended**  \n(Dollars in thousands) | **9/30/2024** | **6/30/2024** | **9/30/2023** | **9/30/2024** | **9/30/2023**  \nNet income | $ 7,095 | $ 5,804 | $ 1,240 | $ 18,625 | $ 1,033  \nAverage assets | 2,812,261 | 2,781,139 | 1,246,474 | 2,764,544 | 1,227,395  \n**Return on average assets (annualized)** | **1.00 %** | **0.84 %** | **0.39 %** | **0.90 %** | **0.11 %**  \nNet income | 7,095 | 5,804 | 1,240 | 18,625 | 1,033  \nNet (gains) losses on sale of securities | -

Announces Second Quarter 2024 Earnings\n\nJuly 29, 2024\n\n[ Download (opens in new window) ](//s201.q4cdn.com/596618833/files/doc_financials/2024/q2/Press-Release-Earnings-Q2-2024-FINAL.pdf)\n\nHARRISBURG, Pa., July 29, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- LINKBANCORP, Inc. (NASDAQ: LNKB) (the \"Company\"), the parent company of LINKBANK (the \"Bank\") reported net income of $5.8 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. Excluding expenses associated with the sale of its New Jersey branches and additional branch consolidations, adjusted earnings were $6.3 million1, or $0.171 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2024.\n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/LINKBANCORP, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1747435/LINKBANCORP_Inc_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1747435/LINKBANCORP_Inc_Logo.html)\n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * Total loans2 increased $63.6 million, or 11.4% annualized from $2.25 billion at March 31, 2024 to $2.31 billion at June 30, 2024, led by strong growth of $28.5 million in commercial & industrial loans over the period.\n  * Total deposits2 increased $71.3 million, or 12.0% annualized from $2.39 billion at March 31, 2024 to $2.46 billion at June 30, 2024, including growth of $38.4 million in noninterest bearing demand account balances at quarter end.\n  * Noninterest expense decreased $350 thousand quarter over quarter to $18.9 million in the second quarter of 2024. Excluding merger expenses and costs associated with the Branch Sale and branch consolidations, adjusted noninterest expense was $18.3 million in the second quarter of 2024, a $925 thousand decrease compared to $19.2 million in the first quarter of 2024.1\n  * Net interest income before provision for credit losses was $24.5 million for the second quarter of 2024 compared to $24.9 million in the first quarter of 2024, and was impacted by a quarter-over-quarter decline in purchase accounting accretion as well as increased funding costs due to continued competition for deposits to support quality loan growth and maintain prudent on-balance sheet liquidity. Net interest margin was 3.83% for the second quarter of 2024 compared to 4.03% for the first quarter of 2024.\n  * Non-performing assets were $10.6 million, representing 0.37% of total assets at June 30, 2024, compared to $6.7 million, representing 0.24% of total assets at March 31, 2024. The allowance for credit losses-loans was 1.20% of total loans held for investment at June 30, 2024, compared to 1.06% at March 31, 2024. The allowance was impacted by the reclassification of loans related to the Branch Sale as assets held for sale, offset by net loan growth in the quarter, as well as a loan acquired in the merger with Partners Bancorp (the \"Partners Merger\") which experienced credit deterioration that was present at the time of the merger and required a day one purchase accounting adjustment that increased the allowance for credit losses by $2.3 million and increased goodwill by $1.8 million.\n  * On May 9, 2024, the Company announced that LINBANK had entered into a definitive purchase and assumption agreement for the sale of the Bank's banking operations and three branches in New Jersey, including related loans and deposits (the \"Branch Sale\"). The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, and is expected to close in the second half of 2024.\n\n\n\nAs a result of the Branch Sale announcement, associated assets and liabilities were reclassified as held for sale, impacting the Company's allowance for credit losses and purchase accounting amortization related to the loans held for sale. \n\n\"We are pleased by the consistent improvement in performance achieved through the hard work and dedication of all of our teams, evidenced by the results of the second quarter of 2024, including increased profitability metrics and strong commercial loan and core deposit growth,\" said Andrew Samuel, Chief Executive Officer of LINKBANCORP. \"The consolidation of three client solution centers was completed during the quarter and we remain on target to conclude the pending sale of the New Jersey operations in the second half of the year.\" He continued, \"We continue to be very focused on achieving further improvements in profitability and customer experience to meet our goals for the second half of the year.\"\n\n1 See Appendix A – Reconciliation to Non-GAAP Financial Measures for the computation of this non-GAAP measure.  \n---  \n2 Total loans and total deposits include balances held for sale in the Branch Sale of $116.2 million and $96.8 million at June 30, 2024. These balances in the first quarter of 2024 were $115.9 million and $105.6 million respectively at March 31, 2024.  \n  \n**_Income Statement_**\n\nNet interest income before the provision for credit losses for the second quarter of 2024 was $24.5 million compared to $24.9 million in the first quarter of 2024. Net interest margin was 3.83% for the second quarter of 2024 compared to 4.03% for the first quarter of 2024. For the second quarter of 2024, net interest income was impacted by the amortization of purchase accounting adjustments, as interest income from purchase accounting accretion during this period was approximately $568 thousand less than purchase accounting accretion recognized in the first quarter of 2024. Cost of funds increased to 2.43% for the second quarter of 2024 compared to 2.33% for the first quarter of 2024, reflecting continued pressure from competition for deposits in the Bank's markets. \n\nNoninterest income increased quarter-over-quarter to $1.9 million for the second quarter of 2024 compared to $1.7 million for the first quarter of 2024, and included an $85 thousand increase in service charges on deposit accounts.\n\nNoninterest expense for the second quarter of 2024 was $18.9 million compared to $19.3 million for the first quarter of 2024. Excluding one-time merger expenses and costs associated with the Branch Sale and branch consolidations of $631 thousand in the second quarter of 2024 and $56 thousand in the first quarter of 2024, noninterest expense decreased by $925 thousand to $18.3 million in the second quarter of 2024 from $19.2 million in the first quarter1. This improvement was largely driven by a $1.2 million decrease in salaries and employee benefits following the reduction in headcount relating to the Partners Merger.\n\nIncome tax expense was $1.6 million for the second quarter of 2024, reflecting an effective tax rate of 22.0%.\n\n**_Balance Sheet_**\n\nTotal assets were $2.86 billion at June 30, 2024 compared to $2.79 billion at March 31, 2024 and $1.31 billion at June 30, 2023. Deposits and net loans as of June 30, 2024 totaled $2.36 billion and $2.17 billion, respectively, compared to deposits and net loans of $2.28 billion and $2.11 billion, respectively, at March 31, 2024 and $1.03 billion and $959.3 million, respectively, at June 30, 2023. Deposits and net loans exclude balances held for sale in the Branch Sale of $96.8 million and $116.2 million, respectively, at June 30, 2024, which are reflected in liabilities held for sale and assets held for sale. These balances were $105.6 million and $115.9 million respectively at March 31, 2024. \n\nIncluding loans held for sale, total loans increased $63.6 million, from $2.25 billion at March 31, 2024 to $2.31 billion at June 30, 2024, led by strong growth of $28.5 million in commercial & industrial loans over the period. Total commercial loan commitments for the second quarter of 2024 were $117.9 million with funded balances of $81.8 million. The average commercial loan commitment originated during the second quarter of 2024 totaled approximately $771 thousand with an average outstanding funded balance of $534 thousand.\n\nIncluding deposits held for sale, total deposits at June 30, 2024 totaled $2.46 billion, an increase of $71.3 million from $2.39 billion at March 31, 2024. This increase included growth of $38.4 million in noninterest bearing demand accounts and $31.2 million in interest bearing demand, money market and savings account balances.\n\nThe Company maintains strong on-balance sheet liquidity, as cash and cash equivalents increased to $181.7 million at June 30, 2024 compared to $172.3 million at March 31, 2024.\n\nShareholders' equity increased from $268.2 million at March 31, 2024 to $271.4 million at June 30, 2024 primarily as a result of a $3.1 million increase in retained earnings. Book value per share increased to $7.27 at June 30, 2024 compared to $7.18 at March 31, 2024. Tangible book value per share increased to $5.07 at June 30, 2024 compared to $5.00 at March 31, 20241.\n\n1 See Appendix A – Reconciliation to Non-GAAP Financial Measures for the computation of this non-GAAP measure.  \n---  \n  \n**_Asset Quality_**\n\nIn the second quarter of 2024, the Company did not record a provision for credit losses, compared to a $40 thousand provision for credit losses in the first quarter of 2024. Additional provision was not required due in part to reclassification of loans related to the Branch Sale as assets held for sale, offset by net loan growth in the quarter, as well as an increase in the allowance through an adjustment to goodwill related to purchase accounting described below.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company's non-performing assets were $10.6 million, representing 0.37% of total assets, compared to $6.7 million, representing 0.24% of total assets at March 31, 2024. The increase relates primarily to a single loan for a commercial property acquired in the Partners Merger with an outstanding principal balance of approximately $3.9 million at June 30, 2024. Loans 30-89 days past due at June 30, 2024 were $5.15 million, representing 0.24% of total loans, an improvement compared to $15.3 million or 0.72% of loans at March 31, 2024.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses-loans was $26.3 million, or 1.20% of total loans held for investment at June 30, 2024, compared to $23.8 million, or 1.06% of total loans held for investment at March 31, 2024. The increase was driven primarily by a specific allowance related to a loan acquired in the Partners Merger as described above, which experienced credit deterioration that was present at the time of the merger and required a day one purchase accounting adjustment that increased the allowance for credit losses by $2.3 million and increased goodwill by $1.8 million. The allowance for credit losses-loans to nonperforming assets was 248.26% at June 30, 2024, compared to 357.18% at March 31, 2024.\n\n**_Capital_**\n\nThe Bank's regulatory capital ratios were well in excess of regulatory minimums to be considered \"well capitalized\" as of June 30, 2024. The Bank's Total Capital Ratio and Tier 1 Capital Ratio were 11.09% and 10.30% respectively, at June 30, 2024, compared to 10.62% and 9.92%, respectively, at December 31, 2023 and 11.04% and 10.24%, respectively, at March 31, 2023. The Company's ratio of Tangible Common Equity to Tangible Assets was 6.82%1 at March 31, 2024.\n\n1 See Appendix A – Reconciliation to Non-GAAP Financial Measures for the computation of this non-GAAP measure.  \n---  \n  \n**ABOUT LINKBANCORP, Inc.**\n\nLINKBANCORP, Inc. was formed in 2018 with a mission to positively impact lives through community banking.

Management uses these non-GAAP measures in its analysis of the Company's performance. These measures should not be considered a substitute for GAAP basis measures nor should they be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP. Management believes the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of specified items provide useful supplemental information that is essential to a proper understanding of the Company's financial condition and results. Non-GAAP measures are not formally defined under GAAP, and other entities may use calculation methods that differ from those used by us. As a complement to GAAP financial measures, our management believes these non-GAAP financial measures assist investors in comparing the financial condition and results of operations of financial institutions due to the industry prevalence of such non-GAAP measures. See the tables below for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. \n\n**Adjusted Return on Average Assets**  \n---  \n**For the Three Months Ended** | **For the Six Months Ended**  \n(Dollars in thousands) | **6/30/2024** | **3/31/2024** | **6/30/2023** | **6/30/2024** | **6/30/2023**  \nNet income (loss) | $ 5,804 | $ 5,726 | $ 1,347 | $ 11,530 | $ (207)  \nAverage assets | 2,781,139 | 2,691,840 | 1,251,009 | 2,740,881 | 1,224,116  \n**Return on average assets (annualized)** | **0.84 %** | **0.86 %** | **0.43 %** | **0.85 %** | **-0.03 %**  \nNet income (loss) | 5,804 | 5,726 | 1,347 | 11,530 | (207)  \nNet (gains) losses on sale of securities | (4) | -

Measures\nThis document contains supplemental financial information determined by methods other than in\naccordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America\n(“GAAP”). Management uses these non-GAAP measures in its analysis of the Company’s\nperformance. These measures should not be considered a substitute for GAAP basis measures\nnor should they be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with\nGAAP. Management believes the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the\nimpact of specified items provide useful supplemental information that is essential to a proper\nunderstanding of the Company’s financial condition and results. Non-GAAP measures are not\nformally defined under GAAP, and other entities may use calculation methods that differ from\nthose used by us. As a complement to GAAP financial measures, our management believes these\nnon-GAAP financial measures assist investors in comparing the financial condition and results of\noperations of financial institutions due to the industry prevalence of such non-GAAP measures.\nSee the tables below for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly\ncomparable GAAP financial measures.\nAdjusted Return on Average Assets\nFor the Three Months Ended For the Nine Months Ended\n(Dollars in thousands) 9/30/2024 6/30/2024 9/30/2023 9/30/2024 9/30/2023\nNet income $ 7,095 $ 5 ,804 $ 1 ,240 $ 1 8,625 $ 1,033\nAverage assets 2,812,261 2 ,781,139 1 ,246,474 2 ,764,544 1,227,395\nReturn on average assets (annualized) 1.00% 0.84% 0.39% 0.90% 0.11%\nNet income 7,095 5 ,804 1 ,240 1 8,625 1,033\nNet (gains) losses on sale of securities -

(Unaudited)\n[In Thousands, Except Share Data]\n1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nA summary of significant accounting and reporting policies applied in the presentation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements follows:\nNature of Operations\nLINKBANCORP, Inc. (the “Company” or \"LINKBANCORP\") was incorporated on April 6, 2018, under the laws of the Commonwealth of\nPennsylvania. The Company was formed with the intent of becoming a bank holding company through acquisition of a bank.\nOn September 17, 2018, the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities (the \"PADOBS\") approved the acquisition of 100 percent of the shares\nof Stonebridge Bank. On October 5, 2018, LINKBANCORP purchased 100 percent of the outstanding shares of Stonebridge Bank, from its former\nparent company Stonebridge Financial Corp. under section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code. LINKBANCORP subsequently renamed the bank LINKBANK.\nOn December 10, 2020, the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, LINKBANK, and GNB Financial Services, Inc. (“GNBF”), and its wholly\nowned subsidiary, The Gratz Bank (the \"Bank”) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger pursuant to which GNBF merged with and into the\nCompany, with the Company as the surviving corporation. LINKBANK merged with and into The Gratz Bank, with The Gratz Bank as the surviving\ninstitution (collectively, the \"Gratz Merger\"). The Gratz Merger was consummated effective September 18, 2021. In markets other than the pre-merger\nGratz Bank areas, the Bank operated as \"LINKBANK, a division of The Gratz Bank.\" Effective November 4, 2022, the Bank legally changed its name\nand began to operate under one brand under the name LINKBANK.\nOn November 30, 2023, the Company completed its merger with Partners Bancorp (\"Partners\"), and its wholly owned subsidiaries, The Bank of\nDelmarva and Virginia Partners Bank, pursuant to which Partners merged with and into the Company with the Company as the surviving corporation\n(the \"Partners Merger\"). The Bank of Delmarva and Virginia Partners Bank merged with and into LINKBANK with LINKBANK as the surviving bank.\nIn connection with the announcement of the Partners Merger in the first quarter of 2023, LINKBANCORP completed a private placement of $10.0\nmillion with certain directors of LINKBANCORP as well as other accredited investors.\nThe Bank is a full-service commercial bank providing personal and business lending and deposit services. The Bank’s operations are conducted from its\neight solutions centers located in Dauphin, Chester, Cumberland, Lancaster, Northumberland, and Schuylkill Counties, and loan production offices\nlocated in Chester and York Counties, in Pennsylvania, eight solutions centers in Wicomico, Charles, Anne Arundel, and Worcester counties in\nMaryland, and a loan production office in Anne Arundel County in Maryland, four solutions centers and a loan production office in Sussex county in\nDelaware, three solutions centers in Camden and Burlington counties in New Jersey, one solutions center in Spotsylvania County in Virginia, and three\nsolutions centers in the cities of Fredericksburg and Reston, Virginia. The Company’s corporate office resides in Camp Hill, Pennsylvania. As a state\nchartered, non-Federal Reserve member bank, the Bank is subject to regulation and supervision by the PADOBS and the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation (the \"FDIC\"). The Company is regulated by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. The Bank’s deposits are insured up to the applicable\nlimits by the FDIC.\nInitial Public Offering\nIn September 2022, the Company completed its initial public offering whereby it issued and sold 5,101,205 shares of common stock at a public offering\nprice of $7.50 per share. The Company received net proceeds of $34,659 after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $2,487 and other\noffering expenses of $1,114. The Company's common stock trades on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \"LNKB.\"\nPending sale of New Jersey Solutions Centers\nOn May 9, 2024, the Bank entered into a purchase and assumption agreement (the “Agreement”) with American Heritage Federal Credit Union\n(“AHFCU”) pursuant to which AHFCU will purchase certain assets and assume certain liabilities (the “Transaction”) of the New Jersey operations of the\nBank, including all three branch locations (including two branch leases).\nUnder the Agreement, AHFCU will acquire substantially all of the loans, three branch locations (along with associated personal property and fixtures)\nand will assume substantially all of the deposits. The total deposit premium to be paid by AHFCU equates to approximately 7.0% of all deposits assumed\nat closing. With respect to the acquired loans, AHFCU will pay an amount equal to the principal balances plus any accrued but unpaid interest and late\ncharges on the loans measured as of the closing date.\n8\nLINKBANCORP, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\n[In Thousands, Except Share Data]\nAHFCU will pay book value for fixed assets, real estate and any other assets located at the owned branch. As of September 30, 2024, approximately\n$102.3 million in loans and $94.0 million in deposits were classified as held for sale in connection with the Transaction.\nThe Transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024 or the first quarter of 2025 and is subject to receipt of regulatory approvals and certain\nother customary closing conditions.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and the Bank. All significant\nintercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The accounting and reporting practices of the Company conform to\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and to general practices within the banking industry. In the opinion of\nmanagement, all adjustments (all of which are of a normal recurring nature) that are necessary for a fair statement are reflected in the unaudited\ncondensed consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company has evaluated events and transactions occurring subsequent to the consolidated balance sheet date of September 30, 2024 for items that\nshould potentially be recognized or disclosed in these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. The evaluation was conducted through the\ndate these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were issued.\nEstimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could\ndiffer from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the allowance for credit\nlosses, accounting for business combinations, and the valuation of deferred tax assets.\nInterim Financial Information\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial\ninformation. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.\nIn the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024. The\naccompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements\nand notes thereto, included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nReclassification of Prior Period Financial Statements\nCertain previously reported items have been reclassified to conform to the current year's classifications. Refer to the supplemental cash flow disclosures\nsection of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Reclassifications had no effect on prior year net income or shareholders' equity.\nUnregistered Sale of Equity Securities\nOn February 21, 2023, the Company entered into Investment Agreements with certain directors of the Company as well as other accredited investors\nunder which it issued and sold 1,282,052 shares of its common stock, par value $0.01, at a price of $7.80 per share. The shares were issued on February\n21, 2023, in a private placement exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Regulation D of the rules\nand regulations promulgated thereunder. The offering resulted in gross proceeds of $10.0 million. There were no underwriting discounts or commissions.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nReference Rate Reform\n9\nLINKBANCORP, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\n[In Thousands, Except Share Data]\nIn January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial\nReporting, which added to ASU 2020-04 optional expedients and exceptions to the U.S. GAAP guidance on contract modifications and hedge\naccounting to ease the financial reporting burdens of the expected market transition from LIBOR and other interbank offered rates to alternative\nreference rates, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate. Entities can elect not to apply certain modification accounting requirements to contracts\naffected by what the guidance calls “reference rate reform” if certain criteria are met. An entity that makes this election would not have to remeasure the\ncontracts at the modification date or reassess a previous accounting determination. Also, entities can elect various optional expedients that would allow\nthem to continue applying hedge accounting for hedging relationships affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met, and can make a\nonetime election to sell and/or reclassify held-to-maturity debt securities that reference an interest rate affected by reference rate reform. ASU 2022-06,\nReference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848 deferred the sunset date of Topic 848 from December 31, 2022 to\nDecember 31, 2024. The amendments in this ASU are effective for all entities upon issuance through December 31, 2024. The Company identified its\nloan receivables that have an interest rate indexed to LIBOR, verified proper transition language existed in the contracts and executed contractual\nupdates, as needed, with the impacted borrowers. The Company replaced LIBOR in most cases with one-month Term SOFR or Daily SOFR. The\nadoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the Company's operating results or financial condition.\nGoodwill Impairment\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. This\nstandard simplifies the test for goodwill impairment by eliminating the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill, which had been Step\n2 of the goodwill impairment test. Instead, the goodwill impairment test consists of a single quantitative step comparing the fair value of the reporting\nunit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize a goodwill impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the\nreporting unit's fair value. The new standard was effective for annual and any interim goodwill impairment tests in reporting periods beginning after\nDecember 15, 2022. The Company adopted ASU 2017-04 on January 1, 2023. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the\nCompany's operating results or financial condition.\nDerivatives\nOn March 28, 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2022-01, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic\n815): Fair Value Hedging – Portfolio Layer Method. The purpose of this updated guidance is to further align risk management objectives with hedge\naccounting results on the application of the last-of-layer method, which was first introduced in ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815):\nTargeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities. ASU 2022-01 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2022, with early adoption in the interim period permitted. For entities who have already adopted ASU 2017-12, immediate adoption is\nallowed. ASU 2022-01 requires a modified retrospective transition method for basis adjustments in which the entity will recognize the cumulative effect\nof the change on the opening balance of each affected component of equity in the statement of financial position as of the date of adoption. The\nCompany adopted ASU 2022-01 on January 1, 2023. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the Company's operating results or\nfinancial condition.\nCurrent Expected Credit Losses\nOn January 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on\nFinancial Instruments, as amended, which replaces the impairment model for most financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loan\nreceivables and held-to-maturity debt securities. This model is also applicable to off-balance sheet credit exposures not accounted for as insurance, such\nas loan commitments, standby letters of credit, financial guarantees, and other similar instruments. In addition, the amendments in ASU 2016-03 require\ncredit losses on available-for-sale debt securities to be presented as a valuation allowance rather than as a direct write down.\nThe Company adopted ASC 326 using the modified retrospective method for all financial assets measured at amortized cost, and off-balance-sheet credit\nexposures. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2023 are presented under ASC 326 while prior period amounts continue to be\nreported in accordance with previously applicable GAAP. At January 1, 2023, the Company increased the allowance for credit losses for loans by $5.7\nmillion, the allowance for credit losses for unfunded loan commitments by $910 thousand, and the allowance on held-to-maturity securities by $602\nthousand. At January 1, 2023, the Company reported a cumulative-effect adjustment of $5.4 million which decreased retained earnings.\n10\nLINKBANCORP, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\n[In Thousands, Except Share Data]\nThe Company did not record an allowance for credit losses on its available-for-sale debt securities under the newly codified available-for-sale debt\nsecurity impairment model, as the majority of these securities are government agency-backed securities for which the risk of loss is minimal.\nThe Company adopted ASC 326 using the prospective transition approach for financial assets purchased with credit deterioration (PCD) that were\npreviously classified as purchased credit impaired and accounted for under ASC 310-30. In accordance with the standard, management did not reassess\nwhether PCI assets met the criteria of PCD assets as of the date of the adoption. On January 1, 2023, the amortized cost basis of the PCD assets were\nadjusted to reflect the addition of $308 thousand to the allowance for credit losses. The remaining noncredit discount (based on the adjusted amortized\ncost basis) will be accreted into interest income at the effective interest rate as of January 1, 2023.\nThe Federal Reserve and the FDIC have adopted a rule that provides a banking organization the option to phase-in, over a three year period, the effects\nof CECL on its regulatory capital upon the adoption of the CECL standard. The Company has elected to exercise this phase-in option.\nIn March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures, which\neliminates accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings (\"TDRs\") by creditors that have adopted ASU 2016-13 and its related amendments. The\namendments require that an entity evaluate whether the loan modification represents a new loan or a continuation of an existing loan, and introduce new\nrequirements related to modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The amendments also require public business entities to\ndisclose current-period gross write-offs for financing receivables by year of origination in the vintage disclosures. For entities that have adopted ASU\n2016-13, the amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. For entities that have not adopted ASU 2016-13,\nthe amendments in this update are effective at the time the entity adopts ASU 2016-13. The Company adopted this standard effective January 1, 2023 in\nconjunction with ASC 326. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the Company's operating results or financial condition.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. This standard\nupdate requires additional interim and annual disclosures about a reportable segment's expenses, even for companies with only one reportable segment.\nThis Update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024.\nThe Company is currently evaluating the guidance; however, the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's\noperating results or financial condition.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. This standard update requires\nadditional interim and annual disclosures about a company's income taxes, including more detailed information around the annual rate reconciliation and\nincome taxes paid. For public business entities, this Update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is currently\nevaluating the guidance; however, the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's operating results or financial\ncondition.\n2. MERGER AND ACQUISITION\nAs described in Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, effective November 30, 2023 the Company completed its merger with Partners.\nPursuant to the Partners Merger Agreement, Partners merged with and into LINKBANCORP with LINKBANCORP as the surviving corporation.\nAdditionally, the Bank of Delmarva and Virginia Partners Bank each merged with and into LINKBANK, with LINKBANK as the surviving bank.\nThe Partners Merger constituted a business combination and was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, in accordance with the\nprovisions of FASB ASC 805 Business Combinations. As such, LINKBANCORP was the accounting acquirer and Partners was the accounting acquiree\nand the historical financial statements of the combined company are the historical financial statements of LINKBANCORP.\nUnder the Partners Merger Agreement, Partners shareholders received 1.150 LINKBANCORP common shares for each share they owned, and cash in\nlieu of fractional shares. LINKBANCORP issued 20.7 million common shares to Partners shareholders which represented approximately 55.4% of the\npost-merger outstanding common shares of the Company. The fair value of the\n11\nLINKBANCORP, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\n[In Thousands, Except Share Data]\ncommon shares issued as the consideration paid for Partners was determined by the closing price of the Company's common shares at the acquisition\ndate.\nThe total fair value consideration was $135.8 million which consisted of $133.8 million for the fair value of common stock issued and $2.0 million for\nthe fair value of Partners restricted stock shares.\nThe following condensed statement reflects the amounts acquired at the acquisition date for each major class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\nTotal Consideration in the Merger $ 135,779\nCalculated Fair Value of Assets Acquired\nCash and cash equivalents $ 34,586\nFederal Funds Sold 7,159\nSecurities available for sale 123,440\nLoans, net of ACL(1) 1,238,087\nPremises and equipment 15,422\nRight-of-use asset 6,042\nCore deposit intangibles 25,344\nDeferred taxes 14,986\nInvestments in restricted bank stock 6,763\nAccrued interest receivable and other assets 29,855\nTotal Assets Acquired 1,501,684\nCalculated Fair Value of Liabilities Assumed\nDeposits 1,299,867\nLong term borrowings 55,292\nSubordinated debt 21,078\nOperating lease liabilities 6,908\nOther liabilities 5,724\nTotal Liabilities Assumed 1,388,869\nNet Assets Acquired 112,815\nGoodwill From the Merger $ 22,964\n(1) The Company recorded a $2.3 million measurement period adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill related to a PCD loan at June 30, 2024\n12\nLINKBANCORP, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\n[In Thousands, Except Share Data]\nThe following table summarizes the Partners Merger as of November 30, 2023:\nConsideration paid\n(dollars in thousands)\nCommon stock consideration:\nCommon shares of Partners Bancorp 17,985,577\nExchange ratio 1.15\nLINKBANCORP, Inc. common stock issued 20,683,158\nLINKBANCORP, Inc. stock price on acquisition date $ 6.47\nPurchase price assigned to Partners Bancorp common shares 133,820\nRestricted stock consideration\nPartners Bancorp restricted stock shares 297,726\nLINKBANCORP, Inc. stock price on acquisition date $ 6.47\nTotal purchase price assigned to Partners Bancorp restricted shares 1,926\nCash paid in exchange for Partners Bancorp stock options and fractional shares 33\nTotal consideration $ 135,779\nNet Assets Acquired\nPartners Bancorp shareholders’ equity $ 143,817\nPartners Bancorp goodwill and intangibles (10,699)\nFair Value Adjustments:\nSecurities available for sale (921)\nLoans\nInterest rate (53,681)\nGeneral credit (11,607)\nCredit adjustment for loans acquired with deteriorated credit quality (1) (8,263)\nRemove existing deferred loan fees, net at acquisition 2,462\nRemove the allowance for credit losses present at acquisition 16,124\nPremises and equipment 2,963\nCore deposit intangible 25,344\nOther assets 4,527\nLiabilities\nTime deposits 3,595\nSubordinated debt 1,179\nOther liabilities (2,025)\n112,815\nGoodwill From the Merger $ 22,964\n(1) The Company recorded a $2.3 million measurement period adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill related to a PCD loan at June 30, 2024\nPursuant to accounting standards, the Company assigned a fair value to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of Partners. ASC 820 defines fair value as\n“the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.”\nThe assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of Partners were recorded at their estimated fair values based on management’s best estimates\nusing information available at the date of the acquisition and are subject to adjustment for up to one year after the closing date of the acquisition. While the fair\nvalues are not expected to be materially different from the estimates, any material adjustments to the estimates will be reflected, retroactively, as of the date of\nthe acquisition. The items most susceptible to adjustment are the fair value adjustments on loans, core deposit intangible and the deferred income tax assets\nresulting from the acquisition. The Company is continuing to finalize the fair values of all aspects of the acquisition. During the second quarter of 2024,\nmanagement identified a loan which, at the time of acquisition, met the criteria to be considered purchase credit deteriorated. The\n13\n\nLINKBANCORP, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\n[In Thousands, Except Share Data]\nanalysis of the loan resulted in $2,300 added to the allowance for credit losses, and $1,838 added to goodwill. The resulting changes to loans, goodwill, and\ndeferred taxes are reflected within this footnote.\nGoodwill represents consideration transferred in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. The goodwill resulting from the acquisition represents the\nvalue expected from the expansion of the Company's market and enhancement of operations and efficiencies. Goodwill acquired in the acquisition is not\ndeductible for tax purposes.\nInvestment securities available-for-sale\nThe estimated fair values of the investment securities available for sale, primarily comprised of U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed securities,\nobligations of states and political subdivisions, and obligations of U.S. Government agencies and corporations were determined using Level 1 and Level 2\ninputs in the fair value hierarchy. A fair value discount of $921 was recorded and will be amortized over the estimated life of the investments using the interest\nrate method.\nLoans\nAcquired loans are classified into two categories: PCD loans and non-PCD loans. PCD loans are defined as a loan or group of loans that have experienced more\nthan insignificant credit deterioration since origination. Non-PCD loans will have an allowance established on acquisition date, which is recognized as an\nexpense through provision for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses on non-PCD loans of $9.7 million was recorded through the provision for credit\nlosses within the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nFor PCD loans, an allowance is recognized at acquisition by adding it to the fair value of the loan, which is the “Day 1 amortized cost”. There is no provision\nfor credit loss expense recognized on PCD loans because the initial allowance is established by grossing-up the amortized cost of the PCD loan. At the date of\nacquisition, of the $1.3 billion of loans acquired from Partners, $435.7 million, or 34%, of Partners’ loan portfolio, was accounted for as PCD loans. The fair\nvalue of PCD loans was $406.4 million at the date of acquisition. The gross contractual amounts receivable related to the PCD loans was $435.7 million. The\nCompany estimates, on the date of acquisition, that $2,458 of the contractual cash flows specific to the PCD loans will not be collected.\nLeased Facilities\nThe Company assumed leases on 11 facilities of Partners. The Company believes that the current lease costs were at market terms therefore no fair value\nadjustment is needed.\nOwned Facilities\nThe Company acquired 13 locations previously owned by Partners as branches and administration offices. A fair value adjustment of $5.9 million was recorded\nat acquisition date.\nCore Deposit Intangible\nThe fair value of the core deposit intangible was determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis using a discount rate commensurate with market\nparticipants. To calculate cash flows, deposit account servicing costs (net of deposit fee income) and interest expense on deposits were compared to the higher\ncost of alternative funding sources available through national brokered CD offering rates and FHLB advance rates. The projected cash flows were developed\nusing expected deposit attrition. The core deposit intangible will be amortized over ten years using the sum-of-years digits method.\nTime Deposits\nThe fair value adjustment for time deposits was based on a discounted cash flow methodology of the contract rates and contractual repayments of fixed maturity\ndeposits using prevailing market interest rates for similar-term time deposits. The time deposit fair value adjustment will be amortized into income on a level\nyield amortization method over the contractual life of the deposits.\nLong Term Borrowings\nThe Company reviewed the cost of the borrowings to market interest rates for similar instruments and believed that the rates were comparable and that no fair\nvalue adjustment was recorded.\nSubordinated Debt\nThe fair value of the subordinated debt was determined using a discounted cash flow method using a market participant discount rate for similar instruments.\nThe subordinated debt fair value adjustment will be amortized into income on a level yield amortization method based upon the assumed market rate and the\nterm of the subordinated debt.\n14\nLINKBANCORP, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\n[In Thousands, Except Share Data]\nPro Forma Combined Results of Operations (Unaudited)\nThe following pro forma financial information presents the consolidated results of operations of Partners and LINKBANCORP as if the Partners Merger\noccurred as of January 1, 2022 with pro forma adjustments.

A significant portion of the loan portfolio is secured by real estate.\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 the recorded investment of consumer mortgage loans secured by residential real estate properties for\nwhich formal foreclosure proceedings are in process was $647 thousand and $264 thousand, respectively.\n5. ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES\nThe segments of the Company’s loan portfolio are disaggregated to a level that allows management to monitor risk and performance. The loan segments\nused are consistent with the internal reports evaluated by the Company’s management and Board of Directors to monitor risk and performance within\nvarious segments of its loan portfolio and, therefore, no further disaggregation is considered necessary. The Company’s loan portfolio consists primarily\nof real estate loans on commercial and residential property. The portfolio also includes agricultural loans, commercial loans, municipal loans, and\nconsumer loans.\nThe Company’s primary lending activity is the origination of commercial loans extended to small and mid-sized commercial and industrial entities.\nCommercial loans are primarily underwritten on the basis of the borrowers’ ability to service such debt from income. The cash flows of borrowers,\nhowever, may not be as expected and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. As a general practice, the Company takes as collateral a\nsecurity interest in any equipment, or other chattel, although loans may also be made on an unsecured basis. Collateralized working capital loans\ntypically are secured by short-term assets whereas long-term loans are primarily secured by long-term assets.\nConstruction and Land loans are to finance the construction of owner-occupied and income producing properties. These loans are categorized within\ncommercial or one-to-four family residential loans based upon the underlying collateral and intended use following the completion of the construction\nperiod. Real estate development and construction loans are approved based on an analysis of the borrower and guarantor, the viability of the project and\non an acceptable percentage of the appraised value of the property securing the loan. Construction loan funds are disbursed periodically based on the\npercentage of construction or development completed. The Company carefully monitors these loans with on-site inspections and requires the receipt of\nlien\n20\nLINKBANCORP, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\n[In Thousands, Except Share Data]\nwaivers on funds advanced. The Company considers the market conditions and feasibility of proposed projects, the financial condition and reputation of\nthe borrower and guarantors, the amount of the borrower’s equity in the project, independent appraisals, cost estimates and pre-construction sale\ninformation. The Company also makes loans on occasion for the purchase of land for future development by the borrower. Land loans are extended for\nthe future development for either commercial or residential use by the borrower. The Company carefully analyzes the intended use of the property and\nthe viability thereof.\nThe Company’s commercial real estate loans consist of mortgage loans secured by nonresidential real estate, such as by apartment buildings, small office\nbuildings, and owner-occupied properties. Commercial real estate loans are secured by the subject property and are underwritten based on loan to value\nlimits, cash flow coverage and general creditworthiness of the obligors. These loans tend to involve larger loan balances and their repayment is typically\ndependent upon the successful operation and management of the underlying real estate.\nResidential real estate loans are underwritten based on the borrower’s repayment capacity and source, value of the underlying property, credit history and\nstability. These loans are secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrower’s principal residence or their second/vacation home (excluding\ninvestment/rental property).\nIn addition to the main types of loans discussed above, the Company also originates agricultural loans, consumer loans, and municipal loans. The\nagricultural loan portfolio consists of loans to local farmers and agricultural businesses that are generally secured by farmland and equipment. The\nconsumer loan portfolio consists of lending in the form of home equity loans secured by financed property and personal consumer loans, which may be\nsecured or unsecured. The municipal loan portfolio consists of loans to qualified local municipalities, which are generally supported by the taxing\nauthority of the borrowing municipality, and is frequently secured by collateral.\nManagement systematically monitors the loan portfolio and the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses on a quarterly basis to provide for\nexpected losses inherent in the portfolio. For segments determined by discounted cash flow analysis, the Company's estimate of future economic\nconditions utilized in its estimate is primarily dependent on the Federal Open Market Committee's forecasts related to Real Gross Domestic Product and\nUnemployment rate. For segments determined by the remaining life method, an average loss rate is generally calculated based on peer losses and applied\nto the future outstanding loan balances at quarter end.\nCertain qualitative factors are then added to the historical allocation percentage to get the adjusted factor to be applied to non-classified loans. The\nfollowing qualitative factors are analyzed for each portfolio segment:\n• Levels of and trends in delinquencies\n• Trends in volume and terms\n• Changes in collateral\n• Changes in management and lending staff\n• Economic trends\n• Concentrations of credit\n• Changes in lending policies\n• External factors\n• Changes in underwriting process\n• Trends in credit quality ratings\nThese qualitative factors are reviewed each quarter and adjusted based upon relevant changes within the portfolio.\nThe total allowance reflects management’s estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the Consolidated Balance Sheet date. The Company\nconsiders the allowance for credit losses adequate to cover loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nAccrued interest receivable on loans totaled $8,577 at September 30, 2024 and was reported within accrued interest receivable and other assets on the\nconsolidated balance sheets and is excluded from the estimate of credit losses.\n21\nLINKBANCORP, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\n[In Thousands, Except Share Data]\nThe following tables summarize the activity in the

The grading analysis\nestimates the capability of the borrower to repay the contractual obligations of the loan agreements as scheduled or at all.\nThe Company’s internally assigned grades are as follows:\nPass – loans that are protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or by the value of the underlying collateral. There are four sub-\ngrades within the Pass category to further distinguish the loan.\nSpecial Mention – loans where a potential weakness or risk exists, which could cause a more serious problem if not corrected.\nSubstandard – loans that have a well-defined weakness based on objective evidence and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bank will\nsustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.\nDoubtful – loans classified as Doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in a Substandard asset. In addition, these weaknesses make collection or\nliquidation in full highly questionable and improbable, based on existing circumstances.\nLoss – loans classified as a Loss are considered uncollectible and are immediately charged against allowances.\n26\nLINKBANCORP, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\n[In Thousands, Except Share Data]\nThe following tables present the classes of the loan portfolio summarized by the internal risk rating system as of September 30, 2024.\nSeptember 30, 2024\nTerm Loans Amortized Cost Basis by Origination Year\nRevolvin\ng loans Revolving\namortize loans\nd cost converted\n(In Thousands)\n2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 Prior basis to term Total\nAgriculture and farmland\nPass 8,61 1,15 13,8 9,06 4,87 21,3 63,4\n$ 8 $ 9 $ 23 $ 3 $ 5 $ 26 $ 4,589 $ — $ 53\nSpecial mention 1,41 1,71\n— 11 — 58 — 2 232 — 3\nSubstandard or lower — — — — — — — — —\nTotal Agriculture and farmland 8,61 1,17 13,8 9,12 4,87 22,7 65,1\n$ 8 $ 0 $ 23 $ 1 $ 5 $ 38 $ 4,821 $ — $ 66\nAgriculture and farmland\nCurrent period gross charge-offs — — — — — — — — —\nConstruction\nPass 19,6 63,1 36,0 21,4 1,25 9,42 161,\n99 45 57 45 7 0 6,523 4,198 744\nSpecial mention — — — — — — — — —\nSubstandard or lower — 201 — — — — — 87 288\nTotal Construction 19,6 63,3 36,0 21,4 1,25 9,42 162,\n99 46 57 45 7 0 6,523 4,285 032\nConstruction\nCurrent period gross charge-offs — — — — — — — — —\nCommercial & industrial\nPass 29,1 23,7 20,3 20,6 11,36 8,93 107,01 221,\n55 73 12 08 2 4 0 25 179\nSpecial mention 4,63 11,83\n18 162 6 100 — 379 6,543 — 8\nSubstandard or lower 2,12\n— 78 462 93 — 332 1,162 — 7\nTotal Commercial & industrial 29,1 24,0 25,4 20,8 11,36 9,64 235,\n73 13 10 01 2 5 114,715 25 144\nCommercial & industrial\nCurrent period gross charge-offs — — — — 4 6 — — 10\nCommercial real estate -

The investors included a related party entity that is controlled by a member of the Board of Directors of the\nCompany, which purchased $7,000 in principal amount of the note. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company contributed $15,000 of the\nsubordinated note proceeds to the Bank as equity capital, the impact of which can be seen within Note 10 Regulatory Capital Requirements later in this\ndocument.\nThe Notes, which mature on April 15, 2032, bear interest at a fixed annual rate of 4.50% for the period up to but excluding April 15, 2027 (the “Fixed Interest\nRate Period”). From April 15, 2027 until maturity or redemption (the “Floating Interest Rate Period”), the interest rate will adjust to a floating rate equal to a\nbenchmark rate, which is expected to be the then-current three-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\"), plus 203 basis points. The Company will\npay interest in arrears semi-annually during the Fixed Interest Rate Period and quarterly during the Floating Interest Rate Period. The Notes constitute\nunsecured and subordinated obligations of the Company and rank junior in right of payment to any senior indebtedness and obligations to general and secured\ncreditors. Subject to limited exceptions, the Company cannot redeem the Notes before the fifth anniversary of the issuance date.\nThe Notes are intended to qualify at the holding company level as Tier 2 capital under the capital guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board. The Agreements and\nNotes contain customary subordination provisions, representations and warranties, covenants, and events of default.\nSubordinated Notes - Gratz Merger\nAs part of the Gratz Merger, the Company assumed Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes with a carrying value of $20.2 million. The notes (the \"Merger\nSubordinated Notes\") mature October 1, 2030 and will initially bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.0% until October 1, 2025. From October 1, 2025 to the stated\nmaturity date or early redemption date, the interest rate will reset semi-annually to an annual floating rate equal to the then-current three-month term SOFR plus\na spread of 475 basis points, but no less than 5.0%. The Company may redeem the Merger Subordinated Notes, in whole or in part, on or after October 1, 2025,\nplus accrued and unpaid interest. The Merger Subordinated Notes are also redeemable in whole or in part upon the occurrence of specific events defined within\nthe indenture.\nThe Merger Subordinated Notes may be included in Tier I capital (subject to certain limitations) under current regulatory guidelines and interpretations.\nSubordinated Notes - Partners Merger\nAs part of the Partners Merger, the Company assumed Subordinated Notes with a total carrying value of $21.7 million with one tranche having a face value of\n$4.5 million and the other with face value of $18.1 million. The first tranche that has a face value of $4.5 million bears interest at a fixed rate of 6.875%. These\nnotes mature in April 2028.\nThe second tranche that has a face value of $18.1 million bears interest at a fixed rate of 6.0% which began on June 25, 2022 to but excluding July 1, 2025,\npayable semi-annually in arrears. From and including July 1, 2025 to but excluding July 1, 2030, or up to an early redemption date, the interest rate shall reset\nquarterly to an interest rate per annum equal to the then current three-month SOFR plus 590 basis points, payable quarterly in arrears. Beginning on July 1,\n2025 through maturity, the subordinated notes may be redeemed, at the Company’s option, on any scheduled interest payment date. The subordinated notes will\nmature on July 1, 2030. The subordinated notes are subject to customary representations, warranties and covenants made by the Company and the purchasers.\n34\nLINKBANCORP, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\n[In Thousands, Except Share Data]\nNote Payable - Partners Merger\nAs part of the Partners Merger, the Company assumed a one-half undivided interest in 410 William Street, Fredericksburg, Virginia. Partners purchased a one-\nhalf interest in the land for cash, plus additional settlement costs, and assumption of one-half of the remaining deed of trust loan on December 14, 2012.\nPartners indemnified the indemnities, who are the personal guarantors of the deed of trust loan in the amount of $886 thousand, which was one-half of the\noutstanding balance of the loan as of the purchase date. The Company has a remaining obligation under the note payable of $572 thousand as of September 30,\n2024. The loan was refinanced on April 30, 2015 with a twenty-five year amortization. The interest rate is fixed at 3.60% for the first 10 years, and then\nbecomes a variable rate of 3.0% plus the 10 year Treasury rate until maturity.\nBorrowings - FHLB\nThe Company had $40,000 and $0 in long-term FHLB Advances outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The FHLB\nAdvance has a fixed rate of 4.827% and will mature on February 20, 2026.\nThe Company had $0 and $10,000 in short-term FHLB Advances outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nAt September 30, 2024, the Company had remaining available capacity with FHLB, subject to certain collateral restrictions, of approximately $742.8 million\nAvailable Lines of Credit\nThe Company and Bank have available unsecured lines of credit, with interest based on the daily Federal Funds rate, with seven correspondent banks totaling\n$77 million at September 30, 2024. There were no borrowings under these lines of credit at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n8. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nManagement uses its best judgment in estimating the fair value of the Company’s financial instruments; however, there are inherent weaknesses in an\nestimation technique. Therefore, for substantially all financial instruments, the fair value estimates herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts\nThe Company could have realized in a sales transaction on the dates indicated. The estimated fair value amounts have been measured as of their\nrespective year-ends and have not been re-evaluated or updated for purposes of these financial statements subsequent to those respective dates. As such,\nthe estimated fair values of these financial instruments subsequent to the respective reporting dates may be different than the amounts reported at each\nyear-end.\nThe Company uses fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures. In\naccordance with the fair value measurements accounting guidance (FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements), the fair value of a financial instrument is\nthe price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement\ndate. Fair value is best determined based upon quoted market prices. However, in many instances, there are no quoted market prices for the Company’s\nvarious financial instruments. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other\nvaluation techniques. Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows.\nAccordingly, the fair value estimates may not be realized in an immediate settlement of the instrument.\nThe Company uses a consistent definition of fair value, which focuses on exit price in an orderly transaction (that is, not a forced liquidation or\ndistressed sale) between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. If there has been a significant decrease in the\nvolume and level of activity for the asset or liability, a change in valuation technique or the use of multiple valuation techniques may be appropriate. In\nsuch instances, determining the price at which willing market participants would transact at the measurement date under current market conditions\ndepends on the facts and circumstances and requires the use of significant judgment. The fair value guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that\nprioritizes the inputs to valuation methods used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active\n35\nLINKBANCORP, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\n[In Thousands, Except Share Data]\nmarkets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels\nof the fair value hierarchy are as follows:\nThe following disclosures show the hierarchal disclosure framework associated with the level of pricing observations utilized in measuring assets and\nliabilities at fair value. The three broad levels of pricing are as follows:\nLevel I: Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reported date.\nLevel II: Pricing inputs are other than the quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date.\nThe nature of these assets and liabilities includes items for which quoted prices are available but traded less frequently and items that are\nfair-valued using other financial instruments, the parameters of which can be directly observed.\nLevel III: Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.\nThis hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available.\nThe estimated fair values of the Company’s financial instruments that are not required to be measured or reported at fair value are as follows:\nAt September 30, 2024 At December 31, 2023\nCarrying Fair Carrying Fair\n(In Thousands) Amount Value Amount Value\nFinancial assets:\nCash and cash equivalents (Level 1) $ 191,232 $ 191,232 $ 80,190 $ 80,190\nSecurities held to maturity (Level 2) 34,626 32,823 36,735 34,236\nLoans, net of allowance for credit losses (Level 3) 2,189,326 2,208,344 2,104,517 2,027,937\nAccrued interest receivable (Level 1) 9,588 9,588 9,831 9,831\nRestricted investments in bank stock (Level 1) 4,904 4,904 3,965 3,965\nCash surrender value of life insurance (Level 1) 51,646 51,646 48,847 48,847\nFinancial liabilities:\nNon-maturity deposits (Level 1) 1,762,697 1,762,697 1,604,535 1,604,535\nTime Deposits (Level 3) 609,955 608,781 594,264 589,699\nLong-term borrowings (Level 3) 40,000 40,000 — —\nShort-term borrowings (Level 1) — — 10,000 10,000\nNote payable (Level 3) 572 572 590 590\nSubordinated Notes (Level 3) 61,843 59,197 61,444 57,303\nAccrued interest payable (Level 1) 2,479 2,479 1,466 1,466\nThe following tables present the assets reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at their fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, by level within the fair value hierarchy.

These securities are valued by an independent third party. The\nvaluations are based on market data. The valuations utilize evaluated pricing models that vary by asset and incorporate available trade, bid and other\nmarket information. For securities that do not trade on a daily basis, their evaluated pricing applications apply available information such as\nbenchmarking and matrix pricing. The market inputs normally sought in the evaluation of securities include benchmark yields, reported trades,\nbroker/dealer quotes (only obtained from market makers or broker/dealers recognized as market participants), issuer spreads, two-sided markets,\nbenchmark securities, bid, offers and reference data. For certain securities additional inputs may be used or some market inputs may not be applicable.\nInputs are prioritized differently on any given day based on market conditions.\n36\nLINKBANCORP, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\n[In Thousands, Except Share Data]\nSeptember 30, 2024\n(In Thousands) Level I Level II Level III Total\nAssets:\nUS Government Agency securities $ — $ 12,377 $ — $ 12,377\nObligations of state and political subdivisions — 48,595 — 48,595\nMortgage backed securities in government-sponsored entities — 87,828 — 87,828\nOther securities — 515 — 515\nTotal $ — $ 149,315 $ — $ 149,315\nLiabilities:\nDerivative $ — $ — $ 120 $ 120\nDecember 31, 2023\n(In Thousands) Level I Level II Level III Total\nAssets:\nUS Government Agency Securities $ — $ 12,985 $ — $ 12,985\nUS Government Treasury Securities — 4,942 — 4,942\nObligations of state and political subdivisions — 47,045 — 47,045\nMortgage backed securities in government-sponsored entities — 48,181 — 48,181\nOther securities — 2,337 — 2,337\nTotal $ — $ 115,490 $ — $ 115,490\nDerivative $ — $ — $ 716 $ 716\nFor financial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, the fair value measurements by level within the fair value hierarchy used as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are presented in the table below.\nSeptember 30, 2024\n(In Thousands) Level I Level II Level III Total\nLoans individually evaluated $ — $ — $ 21,410 $ 21,410\nDecember 31, 2023\n(In Thousands) Level I Level II Level III Total\nLoans individually evaluated $ — $ — $ 13,223 $ 13,223\nThe following tables provide information describing the valuation processes used to determine nonrecurring fair value measurements categorized within\nLevel III of the fair value hierarchy:\nSeptember 30, 2024\nQuantitative Information About Level III Fair Value Measurements\nRange\nValuation Unobservable (Weighted\n(In Thousands) Fair Value Techniques Input Average)\nAppraisal of Liquidation\nLoans individually evaluated $ 21,410 collateral (1) expenses 10%\nDecember 31, 2023\nQuantitative Information About Level III Fair Value Measurements\nRange\nValuation Unobservable (Weighted\n(In Thousands) Fair Value Techniques Input Average)\nAppraisal of Liquidation\nLoans individually evaluated $ 13,223 collateral (1) expenses 10%\n37\nLINKBANCORP, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\n[In Thousands, Except Share Data]\n(1) Fair value is generally determined through independent appraisals of the underlying collateral, which include various Level III inputs that are\nnot identifiable.\nAppraisals may be adjusted by management for qualitative factors, such as economic conditions, aging, and/or estimated liquidation expenses incurred\nwhen selling the collateral.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nThe LINKBANCORP, Inc. 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the \"2019 Plan\") authorized the issuance or delivery to participants of up to 450,000 shares of\nLINKBANCORP common stock pursuant to grants of incentive and non-statutory stock options. The Plan is administered by the members of\nLINKBANCORP’s Compensation Committee (the \"Committee\"). Unless the Committee specified a different vesting schedule, awards under the Plan\nwere granted with a vesting rate of 20 percent per year. Vesting may be accelerated under certain conditions or at the discretion of the Committee at any\ntime. Employees and directors of LINKBANCORP or its subsidiaries were eligible to receive awards under the plan, except that nonemployees were not\ngranted incentive stock options. Stock options are either “incentive” stock options or “nonqualified” stock options. Incentive stock options have certain\ntax advantages and must comply with the requirements of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code. The 2019 Plan was frozen such that no new awards\nwould be granted under the 2019 Plan following receipt of shareholder approval of the LINKBANCORP, Inc. 2022 Equity Incentive Plan described\nwithin this footnote.\nOn May 26, 2022, the Company's shareholders approved the LINKBANCORP, Inc. 2022 Equity Incentive Plan (the \"2022 Plan\").

For organizers, the warrants serve as a reward for bearing the financial risk of the\nCompany’s organization by advancing “seed money” for its organizational and pre-opening expenses. The organizers’ warrants are non-voting and are\nexercisable for a period of ten years from the date of grant. All grants were issued during 2019. These warrants are transferable in accordance with the\nwarrant agreement, but are not puttable to the Company. These shares may be issued from previously authorized but unissued shares of stock. The Board\nhas made no additional authorization to issue any further warrants as of September 30, 2024 and has no current plans for future issuance of warrants. To\ndate, organizers have not exercised any warrants since their issuance. As of September 30, 2024, there were 1,537,484 warrants outstanding with a strike\nprice of $10 and an intrinsic value of $0.\n10. REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS\nThe Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Pennsylvania\nDepartment of Banking and Securities. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possible additional\ndiscretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Under\ncapital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve\nquantitative measures of the Bank’s assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Bank’s\ncapital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk-weightings, and other factors.\nThe Bank is subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by banking agencies. Capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action\nregulations involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices.\nCapital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors and the\nregulators can lower classifications in certain cases. Failure to meet various capital requirements can initiate regulatory action that could have a direct\nmaterial effect on the financial statements. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank has met all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject.\nThe prompt corrective action regulations provide five classifications, including well capitalized, adequately capitalized, under-capitalized, significantly\nundercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized, although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition. If an institution is adequately\ncapitalized, regulatory approval is required before the institution may accept brokered deposits. If an institution is undercapitalized, capital distributions\nare limited, as is asset growth and expansion, and plans for capital restoration are required.\nThe capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of Common Equity Tier\n1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer will face limitations on dividends, stock repurchases and certain\ndiscretionary bonus payments to management based on the amount of the shortfall. Under Basel III rules, banks must hold a capital conservation buffer\nabove the adequately capitalized risk-based capital ratios. The required capital conservation buffer is 2.50%.\nThe following table presents actual and required capital ratios as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 under the Basel III Capital Rules. Bank\ncapital levels required to be considered well capitalized are based upon prompt corrective action regulations.\n39\nLINKBANCORP, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\n[In Thousands, Except Share Data]\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\n(Dollars in Thousands) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio\nTotal capital\n(to risk-weighted assets)\nActual $ 277,027 11.44% $ 251,042 10.62%\nFor capital adequacy purposes 193,699 8.00 188,807 8.00\nTo be well capitalized 242,124 10.00 236,009 10.00\nTier 1 capital\n(to risk-weighted assets)\nActual $ 257,229 10.62% $ 234,533 9.92%\nFor capital adequacy purposes 145,274 6.00 141,605 6.00\nTo be well capitalized 193,699 8.00 188,807 8.00\nCommon equity\n(to risk-weighted assets)\nActual $ 257,229 10.62% $ 234,533 9.92%\nFor capital adequacy purposes 108,956 4.50 106,204 4.50\nTo be well capitalized 157,381 6.50 153,406 6.50\nTier 1 capital\n(to average assets)\nActual $ 257,229 9.41% $ 234,533 14.13%\nFor capital adequacy purposes 109,387 4.00 66,412 4.00\nTo be well capitalized 136,734 5.00 83,016 5.00\nThe federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, issued a rule pursuant to The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act of\n2018 to establish for institutions with assets of less than $10 billion a “community bank leverage ratio” (the ratio of a bank’s tier 1 capital to average\ntotal consolidated assets) of 9% that qualifying institutions may elect to use in lieu of the generally applicable leverage and risk-based capital\nrequirements under Basel III. If an election to use the community bank leverage ratio capital framework is made, a qualifying bank with less than $10\nbillion in assets with capital exceeding the specified community bank leverage ratio is considered compliant with all applicable regulatory capital and\nleverage requirements, including the requirement to be “well capitalized.” As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank had not elected\nto be subject to the alternative framework.\nFederal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid by the Bank. The Pennsylvania Banking Code provides that cash\ndividends may be declared and paid out of accumulated net earnings. In addition, dividends paid by the Bank would be prohibited if the effect thereof\nwould cause the Bank’s capital to be reduced below applicable minimum capital requirements. Loans or advances by the Bank to the Company are\nlimited to 10 percent of the Bank’s capital stock and surplus and must have collateral securing the loans or advances.\nThe Federal Reserve and the FDIC have adopted a rule that provides a banking organization the option to phase-in over a three-year period the effects of\nCECL on its regulatory capital upon the adoption of the CECL standard. The Company opted to exercise this phase-in option.\n11. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK\nThe Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its\ncustomers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit. Such commitments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and\ninterest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company’s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit is\nrepresented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making and monitoring commitments and\nconditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company has an allowance for\ncredit losses for off-balance sheet instruments of $1,857 and $2,189, respectively, included within the liabilities section of the balance sheet. The\ncorresponding debit to provision for credit losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $110 and $331, respectively.

Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The Company\nevaluates each customer’s credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon\nextension of credit, is based on management’s credit evaluation. Collateral held varies but may include personal or commercial real estate, accounts\nreceivable, inventory, and equipment.\n12.

DERIVATIVES\nDuring the second quarter of 2023 the Company entered into a pay fixed / received variable interest rate swap with a notional amount of $75,000 which has a\nfixed rate of 3.28%, a maturity of five years and is designated against either a mix of one-month FHLB advances or brokered certificates of deposit. The\nCompany will utilize, from time to time, interest rate swap agreements as part of its asset liability management strategy to help manage its interest rate risk\nposition. The notional amount of the interest rate swaps does not represent amounts exchanged by the parties. The amount exchanged is determined by reference\nto the notional amount and the other terms of the individual interest rate swap agreements. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt\nof variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the\nunderlying notional amount. At September 30, 2024, the derivative contract is used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with monthly brokered deposits.\nFor derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges of inte94rest rate risk, the gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in Accumulated Other\nComprehensive Income (loss) and subsequently reclassified into interest expense in the same period(s) during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.\nAmounts reported in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on\nthe Company’s variable-rate debt. The amounts reclassified to interest expense were $383 thousand and $1.2 million for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, respectively. Comparatively, the amounts reclassified to interest expense for three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were $375\nthousand and $572 thousand, respectively. Over the next 12 months, the Company estimates that an additional $371 thousand will be reclassified as a reduction\nto interest expense.\nThe Company recorded ($120) thousand and $716 thousand within other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, which represented the fair value of this\nderivative at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis discussion and analysis reflects the Company’s consolidated financial statements and other relevant statistical data and is intended to enhance your\nunderstanding of the Company’s consolidated financial condition and results of operations.

We\ndisclaim any obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to reflect future events or\ndevelopments.\nOverview and Strategy\nThe Company’s core strategy is to further its mission of “positively impacting lives” through community banking by building strong relationships that bring\nvalue to its customers, employees, the communities it serves and its shareholders. In pursuing this mission, the Company specifically desires to invest in the\ndevelopment of strong future leaders for the banking industry and our communities, to contribute to economically and socially flourishing communities, and to\ndemonstrate the continued viability and integral role of community banking for our economic and social development.\nThe Company operates primarily through its wholly-owned subsidiary, LINKBANK, which provides traditional lending, deposit gathering and cash services to\nretail customers, small businesses and nonprofit organizations. The Bank focuses its lending activities on small businesses, targeted to create a diverse loan\nportfolio in relation to its underlying collateral and different business segments with unique cash flow generation and varied interest rate sensitivity. The Bank\noffers a full suite of deposit products and cash management services focused on the small business and nonprofit segments.\nOur revenues consist primarily of interest income earned on loans and investments. Interest income is partially offset by interest expense incurred on deposits,\nborrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is affected by the balances of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and\ntheir relative interest rates. Net interest income is typically further reduced by a provision for credit losses.\nNon-interest income also contributes to our operating results, consisting of service charges on deposit accounts, earnings on bank-owned life insurance, revenue\nfrom the sale of securities, and revenue from the sale of SBA loans and residential mortgage loans to the secondary market and related servicing fees. Non-\ninterest expenses, which include salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment costs, data processing, professional fees, FDIC insurance expense,\nmerger and system conversion expense, and other general and administrative expenses, are the Company’s primary expenditures incurred as a result of\noperations.\nFinancial institutions, in general, are significantly affected by economic conditions, competition, and the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government.\nLending activities are influenced by the demand for and supply of housing and commercial real estate, competition among lenders, interest rate conditions, and\nfunds availability. Our operations and lending are concentrated in South Central Pennsylvania in Dauphin, Chester, Cumberland, Lancaster, Northumberland,\nSchuylkill, and York Counties. In 2023 as a result of the completion of the Partners Merger, we entered the counties of Wicomico, Charles, Anne Arundel, and\nWorcester counties in Maryland, Sussex county in Delaware, Camden and Burlington counties in New Jersey, Spotsylvania county in Virginia, and the cities of\nFredericksburg and Reston, Virginia. Our operations and lending are influenced by local economic conditions. Deposit balances and cost of funds are influenced\nby prevailing market rates on competing investments, customer preferences, and levels of personal income and savings in our primary market area. Operations\nare also significantly impacted by government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. Future changes in applicable law, regulations or government\npolicies may materially impact the Company.\nPending Sale of New Jersey Solutions Centers\nOn May 9, 2024, the Bank entered into a purchase and assumption agreement (the “Agreement”) with American Heritage Federal Credit Union (“AHFCU”)\npursuant to which AHFCU will purchase certain assets and assume certain liabilities (the “Transaction”) of the New Jersey operations of the Bank, including all\nthree branch locations (including two branch leases).\n45\nUnder the Agreement, AHFCU will acquire substantially all of the loans, three branch locations (along with associated personal property and fixtures) and will\nassume substantially all of the deposits. The total deposit premium to be paid by AHFCU equates to approximately 7.0% of all deposits assumed at closing.\nWith respect to the acquired loans, AHFCU will pay an amount equal to the principal balances plus any accrued but unpaid interest and late charges on the loans\nmeasured as of the closing date. AHFCU will pay book value for fixed assets, real estate and any other assets located at the owned branch. As of September 30,\n2024, approximately $102.3 million in loans and $94.0 million in deposits were classified as held for sale in connection with the Transaction.\nThe Transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024 or the first quarter of 2025 and is subject to receipt of regulatory approvals and certain other\ncustomary closing conditions.\nPartners Merger\nOn November 30, 2023, LINKBANCORP completed its merger with Partners Bancorp (\"Partners\"), and its wholly owned subsidiaries, The Bank of Delmarva\nand Virginia Partners Bank, pursuant to which Partners merged with and into the Company with the Company as the surviving corporation (the \"Partners\nMerger\"). The Bank of Delmarva and Virginia Partners Bank merged with and into LINKBANK with LINKBANK as the surviving bank. In connection with\nthe announcement of the Partners Merger in the first quarter of 2023, LINKBANCORP completed a private placement of $10.0 million with certain directors of\nLINKBANCORP as well as other accredited investors.\nFinancial Highlights\nThe following is a summary of the financial highlights as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024:\n• Quarterly Net Income and Net Income Per Share - Net income was $7.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a $5.8 million\nincrease from the same period in 2023 and a $1.3 million increase from the three months ended June 30, 2024 (\"Linked Quarter\"). Diluted\nearnings per share was $0.19 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $0.08 per diluted share for the comparable period in\n2023.\n• YTD Net Income - Net income was $18.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a $17.6 million increase from the same period\nin 2023.\n• Net Interest Income - Net interest income before provision for credit losses increased $16.6 million or 199.1% for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Net interest margin for the third quarter of 2024 was 3.82%, representing a 93 basis\npoints increase over the same period in 2023. Compared to the Linked Quarter, net interest income before provision for credit losses increased\n$497 thousand and net interest margin decreased 1 basis point.\nSee the sections below for a complete analysis of the results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nComparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023\nTotal assets at September 30, 2024, were $2.88 billion, an increase of $210.6 million, or 7.9%, from $2.67 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase in total\nassets was primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $111.0 million, from $80.2 million at December 31, 2023 to $191.2 million at September\n30, 2024, an increase in loans held for investment of $87.6 million, from $2.13 billion at December 31, 2023 to $2.22 billion at September 30, 2024, and an\nincrease in securities available-for-sale from $115.5 million at December 31, 2023 to $149.3 million at September 30, 2024.\nCash and cash equivalents increased $111.0 million, or 138.5%, from $80.2 million at December 31, 2023 to $191.2 million at September 30, 2024. The\nincrease was primarily due to:\nPrimary Cash Inflows\n• Net increase in deposits of $166.2 million;\n• Proceeds from long-term borrowings of $40.0 million;\n• Net cash from investment securities (sales, calls, maturities, and principal repayments) of $21.1 million; and\n• Cash from operating activities of $19.6 million.\nPrimary Cash Outflows\n• Net increase in cash funding of loans receivable of $65.1 million;\n• Purchase of investment securities available for sale of $50.4 million;\n46\n• Repayment of short-term borrowings of $10.0 million; and\n• Dividends paid of $8.3 million.\nSecurities available-for-sale increased by $33.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, with a balance of $149.3 million at September 30,\n2024 and $115.5 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to purchases of investment securities of $50.4 million and an increase in the\nfair value of our securities of $2.1 million as a result of changes in market conditions. The increase was partially offset by sales/calls/repayments totaling $19.0\nmillion. Securities held to maturity decreased $2.1 million, or 5.7% to $34.6 million at September 30, 2024 from $36.7 million at December 31, 2023. This\ndecrease was primarily the result of principal repayments of $2.1 million.\nNet loans receivable increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as shown in the table below:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n(dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Change %\nAgriculture loans $ 65,166 $ 65,861 $ (695) (1.06)%\nConstruction loans 162,032 161,825 207 0.13\nCommercial loans 235,144 232,412 2,732 1.18\nCommercial real estate loans\nMultifamily 206,867 176,843 30,024 16.98\nOwner occupied 479,361 474,964 4,397 0.93\nNon-owner occupied 598,681 551,481 47,200 8.56\nResidential real estate loans\nFirst liens 374,130 376,092 (1,962) (0.52)\nSecond liens and lines of credit 72,061 66,648 5,413 8.12\nConsumer and other loans 17,496 16,740 756 4.52\nMunicipal loans 4,296 5,244 (948) (18.08)\nTotal Loans 2,215,234 2,128,110 87,124 4.09\nDeferred costs 634 174 460 264.37\nAllowance for credit losses (26,542) (23,767) (2,775) 11.68\nTotal $ 2,189,326 $ 2,104,517 84,809 4.03%\nThe above table does not include loans that are held for sale related to the New Jersey branch sale.\nCommercial real estate loans increased $81.6 million during the first nine months of 2024. This growth was not attributable to any one significant relationship\nand was primarily the result of current balances of new loan originations of $122.3 million partially offset by net loan repayment activity. Construction loans\nincreased $207 thousand during the first nine months of 2024 primarily due to draws on existing loans of $36.7 million and new loan originations for the year to\ndate of $20.2 million. Payoffs on construction loans existing at December 31, 2023 were $35.1 million and $26.0 million in construction loans were reclassified\ninto other loan segments upon completion of construction. Commercial loans increased $2.7 million from December 31, 2023, resulting from $32.5 million in\nbalances on newly originated loans offset by net loan repayments on existing loans.\nThe allowance for credit losses-loans increased $2.8 million from $23.8 million at December 31, 2023 to $26.5 million at September 30, 2024. The primary\ndriver of the increased allowance for credit losses-loans was a measurement period adjustment resulting in a $2.3 million provision related to a non-owner-\noccupied commercial real estate loan from the Partners Merger that experienced credit deterioration that existed at acquisition and was considered purchase-\ncredit deteriorated. The recorded investment of this loan was $3.95 million at September 30, 2024. Refer to Note 5 within the Consolidated Financial Statements\nfor further information.\nAt September 30, 2024, non-performing loans, which is defined as non-accrual loans, and loans delinquent greater than 90 days and still accruing interest, was\n$17.4 million or 0.78% of total gross loans held for investment. This compares to $7.3 million of non-performing loans at December 31, 2023, which equated to\n0.34% of total gross loans held for investment. The increase in non-accrual loans was due to the loan acquired in the Partners Merger described above, and an\nowner-occupied commercial real estate relationship totaling $6.5 million that experienced deterioration and was downgraded. This credit was placed on non-\naccrual status during the third quarter of 2024, at which time the Company obtained updated appraisals of the underlying collateral indicating that there was\nsufficient collateral value resulting in no required specific reserve as of September 30, 2024. Additionally, our allowance for credit losses for loans totaled $26.5\nmillion at September 30, 2024 and represented 1.20% of our total gross loans held for investment, compared to $23.8 million or 1.06% of our total gross loans\nat December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no other real estate owned.\n47\nThe federal banking regulators have issued guidance for those institutions which are deemed to have concentrations in commercial real estate lending. Pursuant\nto the supervisory criteria contained in the guidance for identifying institutions with a potential commercial real estate concentration risk, institutions which\nhave (1) total reported loans for construction, land development and other land acquisitions which represent 100% or more of an institution’s total risk-based\ncapital; or (2) total commercial real estate loans representing 300% or more of the institution’s total risk-based capital and the institution’s commercial real\nestate loan portfolio has increased 50% or more during the prior 36 months are identified as having potential commercial real estate concentration risk.\nInstitutions which are deemed to have concentrations in commercial real estate lending are expected to employ heightened levels of risk management with\nrespect to their commercial real estate portfolios and may be required to hold higher levels of capital. The Company, like many community banks, has a\nconcentration in commercial real estate loans, and the Company has experienced growth in its commercial real estate portfolio in recent years, including\nthrough the recently completed Partners Merger.\nAt September 30, 2024, non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans (including construction, land and land development loans) represented 365.86% of\ntotal risk based capital compared to 374.5% at December 31, 2023. Construction, land and land development loans represented 63.31% of total risk based\ncapital at September 30, 2024 compared to 64.46% at December 31, 2023. These percentages of non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans to total risk\nbased capital, and construction loans to total risk based capital were calculated using total loans, including loans held for sale as of September 30, 2024, in\naccordance with prevailing regulatory guidance. Management has implemented and continues to maintain heightened risk management procedures and prudent\nunderwriting criteria with respect to its commercial real estate portfolio. Loan monitoring practices include but are not limited to periodic stress testing analysis\nto evaluate changes to cash flows and changes in collateral values to determine the loan level of stress over key underwriting metrics such as debt service\ncoverage ratios, and loan-to-value ratios. Nevertheless, we may be required to maintain higher levels of capital as a result of our commercial real estate\nconcentrations, which could require us to obtain additional capital and may adversely affect shareholder returns. The Company's Capital Policy and Capital Plan\nhas established internal minimum targets for regulatory capital ratios that are in excess of well capitalized ratios.\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no concentrations of loans in any one industry exceeding 10% of its total loan portfolio. An\nindustry for this purpose is defined as a group of businesses that are engaged in similar activities and have similar economic characteristics that would cause\ntheir ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions.\nDeposits grew by $173.9 million, or 7.9%, to $2.37 billion at September 30, 2024 from $2.20 billion at December 31, 2023. Changes in the deposit types are\npresented in the table below:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 Change %\nDemand, noninterest-bearing $ 658,473 $ 624,780 $ 33,693 5.4%\nDemand, interest-bearing 534,228 425,551 108,677 25.5\nMoney market and savings 569,996 554,204 15,792 2.8\nTime deposits, $250,000 and over 160,592 128,334 32,258 25.1\nTime deposits, other 374,363 346,519 27,844 8.0\nBrokered deposits 75,000 119,411 (44,411) (37.2)\nTotal deposits $ 2,372,652 $ 2,198,799 $ 173,853 7.9%\nThe above table does not include deposits that are held for sale related to the New Jersey branch sale.\nThe increase of $142.4 million in demand deposits during the first nine months of 2024 was the result of new accounts opened during the first nine months of\n2024, primarily interest-bearing, partially offset by net decreases in existing account balances, with new accounts contributing approximately $153.6 million in\nbalance at September 30, 2024. New accounts opened during the first nine months of 2024 also explained the growth in money market and savings accounts,\ncontributing $61.6 million to the overall balance growth of $15.8 million.\nThe Company has estimated deposits that exceed the FDIC insurance limit of $250,000 of $844.0 million, or 34.22% of total deposits and $713.4 million, or\n31.04% of total deposits at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Total uninsured deposits is calculated based on regulatory reporting\nrequirements and reflects the portion of any deposit of a customer at an insured depository institution that exceeds the applicable FDIC insurance coverage for\nthat depositor at that institution and amounts in any other uninsured investment or deposit accounts that are classified as deposits and not subject to any federal\nor state deposit insurance regime. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total uninsured deposits includes $52.0 million and $41.2 million,\n48\nrespectively, of municipal deposits that exceed the FDIC insurance limits. These municipal deposits are fully secured with pledged securities from our available\nfor sale securities portfolio.\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, long-term borrowings consisted of $40.0 million and $0, respectively, in long-term FHLB advances. In the first\nquarter of 2024, the Company replaced some of its overnight borrowings with a lower cost, $40.0 million term advance with a fixed interest rate of 4.827%,\nmaturing in February 2026.\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, short term FHLB advances were $0 and $10.0 million, respectively.\nDuring the second quarter of 2023, the Company entered into a pay fixed/received variable interest rate swap with a notional amount of $75 million which has a\nfixed rate of 3.28%, and a maturity of five years. As part of the transaction, the Company will receive an offset to the interest incurred on either a mix of one-\nmonth FHLB advances or brokered certificates of deposit at a rate equal to one-month SOFR. Our time deposits balance as of September 30, 2024 contains $75\nmillion of one-month maturity brokered deposits that matured in October 2024. As part of our interest rate swap transaction, the Company has committed to\nmaintain either one-month advances from the FHLB or brokered deposits with a duration of one month through May 2028.\nSubordinated debt with a fair value of $20.7 million was assumed as part of the Gratz Merger. These notes bear interest at a fixed interest rate of 5.0% per year\nfor five years and then float at an index tied to the SOFR. The notes have a term of ten years, with a maturity date of October 1, 2030. The notes are redeemable\nat the option of the Company, in whole or in part, subject to any required regulatory approvals after five years, or October 1, 2025. Additionally, on April 8,\n2022, LINKBANCORP issued subordinated debt with a carrying value of $20.0 million. These notes bear interest at a fixed annual rate of 4.50% per year up to\nApril 15, 2027 and then float to an index tied to the three-month SOFR, plus 203 basis points. Subject to limited exceptions, the Company cannot redeem the\nnotes before the fifth anniversary of the issuance date. The balance of subordinated debt was $40.4 million and $40.5 million at September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively.\nSubordinated notes with carrying value of $21.4 million were assumed in the Partners Merger within two tranches of debt issuances. The first tranche has a face\nvalue of $4.5 million and bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.875% per year for four years. The second tranche has a face value of $18.05 million and bear interest\nat a fixed rate of 6.0% per year for 18 additional months.\nTotal shareholders’ equity increased by $11.6 million, or 4.4%, to $277.4 million at September 30, 2024 from $265.8 million at December 31, 2023. The\nincrease was primarily attributable to net income of $18.6 million for the first nine months ended September 30, 2024. This increase was offset by dividends of\n$8.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and a dissolution of a minority interest of $483 thousand.\nComparison of Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nGeneral: Net income was $7.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, or $0.19 per diluted share, an increase of $5.9 million compared to net\nincome of $1.2 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe increase in net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same prior year period was primarily the result of an increase in\ninterest and dividend income of $25.4 million and an increase in non-interest income of $1.8 million. Offsetting the increase in net income was an increase in\ninterest expense of $8.8 million, and an increase in non-interest expense of $10.5 million primarily as a result of the increase in salaries and employee benefits\nof $5.7 million due to the Partners Merger for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same prior year period.\nAnalysis of Net Interest Income\nNet interest income represents the difference between the interest the Company earns on its interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and\nthe expense the Company pays on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Net interest income depends on both the volume of our interest-\nearning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates the Company earns or pays on them. In general, the shift in the interest rate environment that\nbegan in March of 2022 resulted in higher interest rates earned on loans, securities, and interest-earning cash as well as higher interest rates paid on deposits and\nborrowed money when comparing the three months ended September 30, 2024 to the same period in 2023. Since December 31, 2021, the Federal Funds Target\nRate rose from a range of 0.00% - 0.25% to a range of 5.25% - 5.50% as of September 30, 2023 which held until September 2024 and decreased to a range of\n4.75% - 5.00% as of September 30, 2024. While this interest rate index is not used for all financial instruments, the interest rate indices and interest rate curves\nhave increased over this same time horizon. The results of this overall upward shift in interest rates has generally caused net interest margins at financial\ninstitutions to contract when comparing the third quarter of 2024 to the third quarter of 2023 as the cost of funds of financial institutions, generally, have risen at\na faster pace than the yield on interest earning assets. While this trend is generally accurate across the broader banking sector, our results for the third quarter of\n2024 have been positively impacted by the Partners Merger by adding increased yield on interest earning assets which outpaced the rise in funding costs when\ncompared to the same period in 2023. As shown in the table below and subsequent discussion,\n49\nthe average yield on interest earning assets increased 103 basis points when comparing the third quarter of 2024 to the third quarter of 2023, while our average\ncost of funds increased seven basis points over that same period, resulting in an increase to net interest margin of 93 basis points.\nAverage Balances, Interest and Average Yields: The following table sets forth certain information relating to average balance sheets and reflects the average\nannualized yield on interest-earning assets and average annualized cost of interest-bearing liabilities, interest earned and interest paid for the periods indicated.\nSuch yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of interest-earning assets or interest-bearing liabilities, respectively, for\nthe periods presented. Average balances are derived from daily balances over the periods indicated. The average balances for loans are net of allowance for\ncredit losses, but include non-accrual loans. The loan yields include net amortization of certain deferred fees and costs that are considered adjustments to yields.\nYields on earning assets are shown on a fully taxable-equivalent basis assuming a tax rate of 21%.\nFor the Three Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n(Dollars in thousands) Avg Bal Interest (2) Yield/Rate Avg Bal Interest (2) Yield/Rate\nInt.

The increase can be mostly attributed to higher average balances in loans as well as a 103 basis\npoints increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets. The increase was partially offset by an increase in interest expense resulting from increased\naverage rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities due to the higher interest rate environment and an increase in average interest bearing liabilities. The increase in\naverage balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities was a result of the completion of the Partners Merger. The net interest margin increased\n93 basis points to 3.82% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.89% for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nInterest Income: Interest income increased to $40.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with $14.8 million for the three months\nended September 30, 2023 primarily due to an increase in interest income on loans as a result of the growth in average loans as well as the increase in average\nyields earned on all categories of interest earning assets. The growth in the average balance of interest earning assets which increased $1.5 billion to $2.6 billion\nfor the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $1.1 billion for the comparable period in 2023 contributed $19.1 million to the increase in interest\nincome. The growth in the average balance of interest earning assets was due primarily to the increase in the average balance of loans which increased $1.3\nbillion to $2.3 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, as a result of growth in the commercial loan\nportfolio primarily due to the completion of the Partners Merger and, contributed $18.0 million to the increase in interest income. The average yield on loans\nincreased 101 basis points on an annualized basis from 5.33% for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 6.34% for the three months ended September\n30, 2024, which contributed $5.8 million to the increase in interest income. Normal amortization of net loan discounts recorded as part of purchase accounting\nadjustments to acquired loans contributed $3.3 million to the increase in interest income during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Overall the average\nyield of interest earning assets increased 103 basis points on an annualized basis to 6.16% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the\nsame period in 2023 due primarily to a larger concentration of interest earning assets in loans along with an increase in the average yield earned on loans due to\nthe current higher interest rate environment.\nInterest Expense: Interest expense increased by $8.8 million, or 136.8%, to $15.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $6.4\nmillion for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to the increase in the average balance of interest\nbearing liabilities, which increased $967 million to $1.8 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $877.8 million for the three months\nended September 30, 2023 as a result of the increase in the average balance of our deposits and borrowings due to the completion of the Partners Merger. The\nincrease in interest expense was also impacted by an increase in the interest rate paid on interest bearing liabilities. The average rate paid on interest-bearing\nliabilities increased 38 basis points on an annualized basis from 2.90% for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 3.28% for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 due to the higher interest rate environment and in particular its impact on deposit cost. Normal amortization of net discounts on acquired\ninterest bearing liabilities recorded as part of purchase accounting adjustments through the Partners Merger contributed $359 thousand to the increase in interest\nexpense during the three months ended September 30, 2024.\n51\nInterest expense on borrowings was reduced by $383 thousand during the third quarter of 2024 due to the impact of the interest rate swap.\nProvision for Credit Losses: The provision for credit losses is the resulting expense from the allowances for credit losses on loans, unfunded commitments, and\nheld-to-maturity securities. The provision for credit losses was $84 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a negative provision\nof $349 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The majority of the provision for credit losses can be attributable to an increase in specific\nreserves at September 30, 2024 when compared to September 30, 2023.\nThe Company completes a comprehensive quarterly evaluation to determine its provision for credit losses. The evaluation reflects analyses of individual\nborrowers and historical loss experience, and changes in net loan balances, supplemented as necessary by credit judgment that considers observable trends,\nconditions, and other relevant environmental and economic factors.\nRefer to Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statement for additional details on the provision for credit losses.\nNon-interest Income: Non-interest income increased by $1.8 million to $2.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from $880 thousand\nrecognized during the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $854 thousand in service charges on deposit accounts and an\nincrease of $253 thousand from income on bank-owned life insurance.\nNon-interest Expense: Non-interest expense increased $10.5 million, or 130.8%, to $18.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $8.0\nmillion for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was largely due to: (1) an increase in salaries and employee benefits expense of $5.7\nmillion related to an increase in the number of employees due to the completion of the Partners Merger; (2) an increase of $1.1 million in intangible\namortization; (3) an increase of $739 thousand in occupancy expense related to increased property maintenance costs, lease costs, and deprecation expense\nmostly related to facilities acquired in the Partners Merger; (4) an increase of $706 thousand in equipment and data processing; and (5) an increase of $1.3\nmillion in other expenses which consist of items such as communications expenses, insurance expenses and other administrative expenses.\nIncome Tax Expense: Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled $2.0 million compared to an income tax expense of $347\nthousand for the same period in 2023 as a result of an increase in income before income tax expense. The income tax expense recognized for the three months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was the direct result of our net income adjusted for tax free income and non-deductible merger related expenses. We\nrecognized an income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 at an effective tax rate of 22.2%. As a result of the Partners Merger, the\nCompany now has nexus in states with applicable state corporate income taxes which is adding to the effective tax rate and resulting in a rate greater than our\nstatutory federal tax rate of 21%. This is compared to income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023 which resulted in an effective tax rate\nof 21.9% which is more than our federal statutory rate of 21%.\nComparison of Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nGeneral: Net income was $18.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, or $0.50 per diluted share, an increase of $17.6 million compared to net\nincome of $1.0 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe increase in net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same prior year period was primarily the result of an increase in\ninterest and dividend income of $76.3 million and an increase in noninterest income of $6.4 million. Offsetting the increase in net income was an increase in\ninterest expense of $26.4 million, and an increase in non-interest expense of $33.1 million primarily as a result of the increase in salaries and employee benefits\nof $18.6 million due to the Partners Merger for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same prior year period.\nAnalysis of Net Interest Income\nNet interest income represents the difference between the interest the Company earns on its interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and\nthe expense the Company pays on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings.

Since December 31, 2021, the Federal Funds Target\nRate rose from a range of 0.00% - 0.25% to a range of 5.25% - 5.50% as of September 30, 2023 which held until September 2024 and decreased to a range of\n4.75% - 5.00% as of September 30, 2024. While this interest rate index is not used for all financial instruments, the interest rate indices and interest rate curves\nhave increased over this same time horizon. The results of this overall upward shift in interest rates has generally caused net interest margins at financial\ninstitutions to contract when comparing the first nine months of 2024 to the same period in 2023 as the cost of funds of financial institutions, generally, have\nrisen at a faster pace than\n52\nthe yield on interest earning assets.

As shown in the following table and subsequent discussion, our average yield on interest earning assets increased 121 basis points\nwhen comparing the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the same period in 2023, while our average cost of funds increased 18 basis points over that\nsame period, resulting in an increase to net interest margin of 101 basis points.\nAverage Balances, Interest and Average Yields: The following table sets forth certain information relating to average balance sheets and reflects the average\nannualized yield on interest-earning assets and average annualized cost of interest-bearing liabilities, interest earned and interest paid for the periods indicated.\nSuch yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of interest-earning assets or interest-bearing liabilities, respectively, for\nthe periods presented.

This increase can be attributed to an increase in interest income resulting from a higher average\nbalance in interest-earning assets and an increase in the average yield on interest earning assets as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was\npartially offset by an increase in interest expense resulting from increased average rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities due to the higher interest rate\nenvironment and an increase in average interest bearing liabilities. The increase in average balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities was\na result of the completion of the Partners Merger. The net interest margin increased 101 basis points to 3.89% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024\nfrom 2.88% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nInterest Income: Interest income increased to $118.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with $42.1 million for the nine months\nended September 30, 2023 primarily due to an increase in interest income on loans as a result of the growth in average loans as well as the increase in average\nyields earned on all categories of interest earning assets. The growth in average balance of interest earning assets which increased $1.4 billion to $2.6 billion for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $1.1 billion for the comparable period in 2023 contributed $54.6 million to the increase in interest\nincome. The growth in the average balance of interest earning assets was due primarily to the increase in the average balance of loans which increased $1.3\nbillion to $2.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 as a result of growth in the commercial loan\nportfolio primarily due to the completion of the Partners Merger. The average yield on loans increased 118 basis points on an annualized basis from 5.21% for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 6.39% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which contributed $20.1 million to the increase in interest\nincome. Normal amortization of net loan discounts recorded as part of purchase accounting adjustments to acquired loans contributed $11.4 million to interest\nincome during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Overall the average yield of interest earning assets increased 121 basis points on an annualized basis\nto 6.21% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 due primarily to a larger concentration of interest earning\nassets in loans along with an increase in the average yield of interest earning cash, securities and loans.\nInterest Expense: Interest expense increased by $26.4 million, or 149.0%, to $44.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $17.7\nmillion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to the increase in the average balance of interest-\nbearing liabilities, which increased $944 million to $1.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $867.0 million for the nine months\nended September 30, 2023 as a result of the increase in the average balance of our deposits and borrowings due to the completion of the Partners Merger. The\nincrease in interest expense was also impacted by an increase in the interest rate paid on interest bearing liabilities. The average rate paid on interest-bearing\nliabilities increased 52 basis points on an annualized basis from 2.73% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 3.25% for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 due to the higher interest rate environment and in particular its impact on deposits costs. Normal amortization of net discounts on acquired\ninterest bearing liabilities recorded as part of purchase accounting adjustments through the Partners Merger contributed $2.0 million to the increase in interest\nexpense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Interest expense on borrowings was reduced by $1.2 million due to the impact of the interest rate\nswap.\nProvision for Credit Losses: The provision for credit losses increased by $674 thousand from a negative provision of $549 thousand for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 to a provision of $125 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The provision for credit losses for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 consisted of $497 thousand related to loans, ($331) thousand\n54\nrelated to unfunded commitments, and ($41) thousand related to held-to-maturity securities. The majority of the provision for credit losses can be attributable to\nan increase in specific reserves at September 30, 2024 when compared to September 30, 2023.\nThe Company completes a comprehensive quarterly evaluation to determine its provision for credit losses. The evaluation reflects analyses of individual\nborrowers and historical loss experience, and changes in net loan balances, supplemented as necessary by credit judgment that considers observable trends,\nconditions, and other relevant environmental and economic factors.\nRefer to Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statement for additional details on the provision for credit losses.\nNon-interest Income: Non-interest income increased by $6.4 million to $6.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from a net loss of\napproximately $88 thousand recognized during the same period of 2023. The increase was primarily the result of a loss on the sale in the first nine months of\n2023 of an investment in the subordinated notes of Signature Bank which was taken into FDIC receivership during the 2023 first quarter. The Company sold our\ninvestment and recognized a loss of $2.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Service charges on deposit accounts increased $2.1 million,\nfrom $593 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $2.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nNon-interest Expense: Non-interest expense increased $33.1 million, or 140.4%, from $23.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $56.6\nmillion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to: (1) an increase in salaries and employee benefits expense of $18.6\nmillion related to an increase in the number of employees due to the completion of the Partners Merger; (2) an increase of $3.4 million of amortization of\nintangible assets as a result of intangibles acquired from the Partners Merger; (3) an increase of $2.8 million in equipment and data processing costs; and (4) an\nincrease of $2.5 million in occupancy expense related to increased property maintenance costs, lease costs, and depreciation expense mostly related to facilities\nacquired in the Partners Merger.\nIncome Tax Expense: Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled $5.3 million compared to an income tax expense of $276\nthousand for the same period in 2023 as a result of an increase in income before income tax expense. The income tax expense recognized for the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 was the direct result of our net income adjusted for tax free income and non-deductible merger related expenses. We recognized an\nincome tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 at an effective tax rate of 22.0%. As a result of the Partners Merger, the Company now has\nnexus in states with applicable state corporate income taxes which is adding to the effective tax rate and resulting in a rate greater than our statutory federal tax\nrate of 21%. This is compared to income tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 which resulted in an effective tax rate of 21.1%.\nLiquidity, Commitments, and Capital Resources\nThe Company’s liquidity, represented by cash and due from banks, is a product of our operating, investing and financing activities. The Company’s primary\nsources of funds are deposits, principal repayments of securities and outstanding loans, and funds provided from operations. In addition, the Company invests\nexcess funds in short-term interest-earnings assets such as overnight deposits or U.S. agency securities, which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements.\nWhile scheduled payments from the amortization of loans and securities and short-term investments are relatively predictable sources of funds, general interest\nrates, economic conditions and competition greatly influence deposit flows and repayments on loans and mortgage-backed securities.\nThe Company strives to maintain sufficient liquidity to fund operations, loan demand and to satisfy fluctuations in deposit levels. The Company is required to\nhave enough investments that qualify as liquid assets in order to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure safe and sound banking operations. Liquidity may\nincrease or decrease depending upon the availability of funds and comparative yields on investments in relation to the return on loans. Our attempts to maintain\nadequate but not excessive liquidity, and liquidity management is both a daily and long-term function of the Company’s business management. We manage our\nliquidity in accordance with a board of directors-approved asset liability policy, which is administered by the Company’s asset-liability committee (“ALCO”).\nALCO reports interest rate sensitivity, liquidity, capital and investment-related matters on a quarterly basis to the Company’s board of directors.\nThe Company reviews cash flow projections regularly and updates them in order to maintain liquid assets at levels believed to meet the requirements of normal\noperations, including loan commitments and potential deposit outflows from maturing certificates of deposit and savings withdrawals. Certificates of deposit\ndue within one year of September 30, 2024, totaled $588.3 million, or 96.3% of our certificates of deposit, and 23.8% of total deposits. Of these certificates of\ndeposit, $75 million are brokered deposits. If these deposits do not remain with us, we will be required to seek other sources of funds, including other deposits\nand FHLB advances. Depending on market conditions, we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or borrowings than we currently pay. We\nbelieve, however, based on past experience that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us. We have the ability to attract and retain deposits by\nadjusting the interest rates offered. Additionally, management noted that approximately 10.18% of our deposits (measured on a year-to-date average balance)\nconsisted of balances in escrow-type deposits which are distributed among different customers with no customer exceeding our policy limits on size of deposits.\nWhile deposits are the Company’s primary source of funds, when needed the Company is also able to generate cash through borrowings from the Federal Home\nLoan Bank of\n55\nPittsburgh (“FHLB”). At September 30, 2024, the Company had $40.0 million in outstanding FHLB borrowings with a remaining available capacity with\nFHLB, subject to certain collateral restrictions, of approximately $742.8 million.\nIn addition to our available borrowing capacity at the FHLB, the Company has lines of credit with multiple financial institutions that provide an available $77\nmillion of additional liquidity at September 30, 2024. The Company also maintains available credit at the Federal Reserve Bank's Discount Window of $26.2\nmillion at September 30, 2024.\nThe following table shows the Company's available liquidity at September 30, 2024.\n(In Thousands)\nLiquidity Source Capacity Outstanding Available\nFederal Home Loan Bank $ 782,807 $ 40,000 $ 742,807\nFederal Reserve Bank Discount Window 26,191 - 26,191\nCorrespondent Banks 77,000 - 77,000\nTotal $ 885,998 $ 40,000 $ 845,998\nConsistent with the Company’s goals to operate as a sound and profitable financial institution, the Company actively seeks to maintain the Bank's status as a\nwell-capitalized institution in accordance with regulatory standards. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank met the capital requirements\nto be considered “well capitalized.” See Note 10 within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding our capital\nresources.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations\nSee Note 11 within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning for more information regarding the Company’s off-balance sheet\narrangements.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nIt is management’s opinion that accounting estimates covering certain aspects of the Company’s business have more significance than others due to the relative\nimportance of those areas to overall performance, or the level of subjectivity required in making such estimate, which have a material impact on the carrying\nvalue of certain assets and liabilities. The judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors, which are\nbelieved to be reasonable under the circumstances. The more significant area in which the Company's management applies critical assumptions and estimates\ninclude the following:\nAllowance for credit losses: The loan portfolio is the biggest asset on the Company's balance sheet. The allowance for credit losses represents management's\nestimate of credit losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. A provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the level of the allowance for credit\nlosses as deemed necessary by management. The allowance for credit losses consists of reserves on loans that share similar risk characteristics, and reserves on\nloans that do not share similar risk characteristics.\nExpected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loan, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. The contractual term excludes\nexpected extensions, renewals, and modifications unless either of the following applies: management has a reasonable expectation at the reporting date that a\nrestructured loan will be executed with an individual borrower or the extension or renewal options are included in the original or modified contract at the\nreporting date and are not unconditionally cancelable by the Company. Management’s determination of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is based\non periodic evaluations of past events, including historical credit loss experience on financial assets with similar risk characteristics, historical credit losses\nexperienced by peer institutions on financial assets with similar risk characteristics, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the\ncollectability of the remaining cash flows over the contractual term of the financial assets. This evaluation has subjective components requiring material\nestimates, including forecasted national economic conditions such as GDP, unemployment, and housing price indexes. Other components impacting the estimate\ninclude expected default probabilities, the expected loss given default, and the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows. Of the previously listed\ncomponents, the economic forecasts are the most sensitive to change.\nGenerally, loans that do not share similar risk characteristics are collateral-dependent and impairment is measured through the collateral method. When the\nmeasurement of these loans is less than the recorded investment in the loan, the shortfall is recorded through the allowance for credit losses. To the extent that\nactual results differ from management estimates, additional provisions for credit losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods.\nBusiness Combinations: The Company accounts for acquisitions under the acquisition method of accounting. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a\nbusiness combination are recorded at their estimated fair value on their purchase date. As provided for under accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States of America, management has up to 12 months following the date of the acquisition to finalize the fair values of acquired assets and assumed\nliabilities. Management continues to finalize the fair values of\n56\nacquired assets and assumed liabilities. The valuation of acquired loans involves significant estimates, assumptions and judgment based on information\navailable as of the acquisition date. Loans acquired in a business combination transaction are evaluated either individually or in pools of loans with similar\ncharacteristics; including consideration of a credit component. A number of factors are considered in determining the estimated fair value of purchased loans\nincluding, among other things, the remaining life of the acquired loans, estimated prepayments, estimated loss ratios, estimated value of the underlying\ncollateral, estimated holding periods, contractual interest rates compared to market interest rates, and net present value of cash flows expected to be received.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nRecently issued accounting standards are included in Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk\nNot required for smaller reporting companies.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the\nparticipation of its management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its\ndisclosure controls and procedures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and\nprocedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management was\nrequired to apply judgment in evaluating its controls and procedures. Based on their evaluation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures\n(as defined in 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”)) are designed to ensure that information\nrequired to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the\ntime periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations and are operating in an effective manner.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) under the Exchange\nAct) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting.\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nAt September 30, 2024, the Company is not involved in any pending legal proceedings other than routine legal proceedings occurring in the ordinary course of\nbusiness, which involve amounts in the aggregate believed by management to be immaterial to the financial condition and operating results of the Company.\nItem 1A – Risk Factors\nThere have been no material changes to the risk factors set forth under Item 1.A. Risk Factors as set forth in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for\nthe year ended December 31, 2023.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Use of Proceeds, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nNone\n57\nItem 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities\nNone\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable\nItem 5. Other Information\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, none of our directors or officers adopted or terminated any contract, instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of\nCompany securities that was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) or any “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement,” as that\nterm is used in SEC regulations.\n58\nItem 6.
