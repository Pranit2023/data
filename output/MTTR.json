(Nasdaq: MTTR) (“Matterport” or the “Company”), the leading spatial data company driving the digital transformation of the built world, today announced financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n“I’m pleased to share our third-quarter 2024 results, highlighting our continued success driving efficient growth,” said RJ Pittman, Chairman and CEO of Matterport. “Total square feet managed reached 47.3 billion, up 34% year-over-year, with annual recurring revenue hitting a record $101.5 million, an 11% increase year-over-year,” Pittman added. “Our Fall 2024 Release introduced groundbreaking AI-powered tools designed to elevate digital twin applications and real estate listings.

Features like 3D model merge, field tags, and bill-back processing bring unmatched speed, efficiency, and precision to managing spaces at scale for agents, contractors, and enterprise teams alike.”\n\n“We believe our innovation pipeline is the strongest it’s ever been, and with customers raving about our Fall 2024 Release, we’re setting the stage for more bold, product-led growth in 2025,” Pittman concluded.\n\n“Our strong third quarter performance propelled the company to a new record for total revenue, $43.8 million, up 8% year-over-year,” said JD Fay, Chief Financial Officer of Matterport. “Further, our continued focus on operating expense discipline helped deliver near break-even results, yielding a non-GAAP loss per share of just $0.01. These results demonstrate that customers continue to adopt Matterport while underscoring our commitment to growth and profitability.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * Square feet under management reached 47.3 billion, up 34% year-over-year\n\n\n  * Spaces under management reached 13.6 million, up 22% year-over-year\n\n\n  * Total subscribers reached 1.1 million, up 25% year-over-year\n\n\n  * Subscription revenue of $25.4 million, up 11% year-over-year\n\n\n  * Annualized Recurring Revenue (ARR) was $101.5 million\n\n\n  * Total revenue was $43.8 million\n\n\n  * Net loss of $0.12 per share; Non-GAAP net loss of $0.01 per share, which is a 75% improvement year-over-year\n\n\n  * Cash used in operating activities was $18.6 million for the first nine months of 2024, a 61% improvement year-over-year\n\n\n\n**Recent Business Highlights**\n\n  * Announced the [_Fall 2024 Release_](https://matterport.com/news/matterport-fall-2024-release-insights-meets-imagination-elevates-the), a groundbreaking suite of new tools designed to reshape the way professionals design, build, and market properties. Through the power of generative AI, Matterport users can now easily reimagine the potential of any space, transforming digital twins from static replicas into dynamic canvases for creativity.\n\n\n  * Announced that Matterport is contributing to the promotion of digital twin use by [_Tokyu Construction Co., Ltd._](https://matterport.com/news/tokyu-construction-visualizes-the-future-and-improves-operational-efficiency), an advanced digital utilization company in civil engineering and infrastructure construction. Matterport's digital twin solutions are used in a wide range of phases of construction projects, including current status surveys, completed form management, streamlining and enhancing the scanning of point cloud data, and facilitating consensus building and communication among construction-related parties.\n\n\n  * In August, Matterport released its third [_Environmental, Social, and Governance Report_](https://matterport.com/news/matterports-latest-esg-report-sets-new-targets-for-reducing-carbon-emissions) which sets ambitious targets for the Company’s top ESG priorities, including reducing emissions and fostering gender equality in the workplace. The new Report also showcases the Company’s success helping its more than one million subscribers reduce their own carbon emissions by using Matterport’s digital twins to reduce travel to the more than 13 million spaces that are on the Matterport digital twin platform.\n\n\n\n**Transaction with CoStar Group, Inc.**\n\nGiven the pending acquisition of Matterport by CoStar Group, Inc. that was announced on April 22, 2024, Matterport will not be holding a conference call or live webcast to discuss quarterly financial results. Also, in light of the pending transaction, the Company had previously suspended its financial guidance for the full fiscal year 2024 and will not be providing financial guidance for the upcoming fiscal quarter. At a special meeting of stockholders held on July 26, 2024, Matterport stockholders approved the transaction with CoStar Group, Inc. The completion of the transaction remains subject to the expiration or termination of the waiting period imposed by the Hart-Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the satisfaction or waiver of the other closing conditions specified in Matterport’s agreement with CoStar Group, Inc. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024 or the first quarter of 2025.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Information**\n\nMatterport has provided in this press release financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). We believe that the presentation of non-GAAP financial information provides important supplemental information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to Matterport’s financial condition and results of operations.\n\nThe presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measures and should be read only in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. For further information regarding these non-GAAP measures, including the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, please refer to the financial tables below.\n\n_Non-GAAP Net Loss and Non-GAAP Net Loss Per Share, Basic and Diluted._ Matterport defines non-GAAP net loss as net loss, adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation-related charges (including share-based payroll tax expense), fair value change of warrants liability, amortization of acquired intangible assets, litigation expense, and acquisition-related transaction costs, in order to provide investors and management with greater visibility to the underlying performance of Matterport’s recurring core business operations. We define non-GAAP net loss per share, as non-GAAP net loss divided by the weighted-average shares outstanding, which includes the dilutive effect of potentially diluted common stock equivalents outstanding during the period if any.\n\n**About Matterport**\n\nMatterport, Inc.

These tools save time, elevate listings, and simplify complex workflows for everyone—from real estate agents to contractors and enterprise teams. And with features like 3D model merge, field tags, and one-click bill-back processing, we’re helping customers manage spaces at scale with unprecedented speed, efficiency and precision.”\n\n**New tools for agents:**\n\nOne of the most revolutionary additions in the Fall Release is Matterport’s AI-powered **defurnish** **tool** , designed to solve a common challenge for home sellers and agents: clutter. With a single click, users can now transform a cluttered living room or messy garage into a clean, open space—allowing potential buyers to visualize the home’s true potential. Whether it’s “erasing” an outdated couch or clearing out the dining room set, defurnish gives agents a powerful yet simple tool to make every property shine.\n\n![Defurnish-Before-After](https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/83e3edfc-cc12-4080-aa67-89389c7f2562/defurnish-before-after.jpg)\n\nMatterport’s new defurnish tool uses AI to remove furniture and other objects from virtual property listings.\n\nAnd coming soon, Matterport’s interior design tools will unlock creativity for everyone—letting users digitally furnish and redesign spaces with ease and offering a glimpse of what the future could hold.\n\nThe AI-powered **property description** **tool** is another game-changer, crafting detailed, engaging written descriptions in just seconds. Brokers and marketers can select the style and tone, ensuring each listing is perfectly tailored—whether it’s a sleek, modern downtown loft or a charming suburban home. And by leveraging the precise spatial data of every digital twin, the tool creates content that is not only beautifully written but also accurate down to the last detail, saving hours of work and producing results that even seasoned experts will admire.\n\n**New tools for property managers, contractors, and designers:**\n\nFor large-scale projects, Matterport’s new **Merge** **tool** enables users to seamlessly “snap” together multiple digital twins. Imagine creating a full digital model of an entire hotel, floor by floor, or merging every floor of a high-rise office tower into one cohesive 3D tour of the building. Merge also allows multiple team members to scan different sections of a property simultaneously and integrate them later, making it possible to capture and manage even the most expansive buildings quickly and efficiently.\n\n**Field Tags** further enhance the efficiency of on-site work by allowing users to add on-site observations and tags during the scanning process. No more repeat visits to capture missed details—everything can be documented in real-time, ensuring accurate, comprehensive records of the space are captured at the moment they matter most. This feature keeps teams aligned and projects moving forward without unnecessary delays.\n\nLastly, Matterport introduces **one-click bill-back processing** , a highly anticipated feature for enterprise customers. This simple yet powerful tool removes the headache of manual invoicing and cost allocation, allowing organizations to easily distribute expenses across departments and external partners. By automating billing processes, Matterport reduces administrative burdens and empowers teams to focus on what matters most.\n\nVisit Matterport’s [_Fall 2024 Release page_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=j2ujYsKC1jcOvLRFxGI9k798_sRDZYdKPoVOHNQpczJEwdjvBPTv3nyN9FP7PtZbK3-am7OJDhdu1Z0YUS-XKEMxwgSuSCPVkM16xShyzTuh_IyhSgwGPAWElAoav7fH) to see everything in action.\n\n**_About Matterport_** _Matterport, Inc.

Also, in light of the pending transaction, the Company had previously suspended its financial guidance for the full fiscal year 2024 and will not be providing financial guidance for the upcoming fiscal quarter. At a special meeting of stockholders held on July 26, 2024, Matterport stockholders approved the transaction with CoStar Group, Inc. The completion of the transaction remains subject to the expiration or termination of the waiting period imposed by the Hart-Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the satisfaction or waiver of the other closing conditions specified in Matterport’s agreement with CoStar Group, Inc. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024 or the first quarter of 2025.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Information**\n\nMatterport has provided in this press release financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). We believe that the presentation of non-GAAP financial information provides important supplemental information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to Matterport’s financial condition and results of operations.\n\nThe presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measures and should be read only in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. For further information regarding these non-GAAP measures, including the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, please refer to the financial tables below.\n\n_Non-GAAP Net Loss and Non-GAAP Net Loss Per Share, Basic and Diluted._ Matterport defines non-GAAP net loss as net loss, adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation-related charges (including share-based payroll tax expense), fair value change of warrants liability, amortization of acquired intangible assets, litigation expense, and acquisition-related transaction costs, in order to provide investors and management with greater visibility to the underlying performance of Matterport’s recurring core business operations. We define non-GAAP net loss per share, as non-GAAP net loss divided by the weighted-average shares outstanding, which includes the dilutive effect of potentially diluted common stock equivalents outstanding during the period if any.\n\n**About Matterport**\n\nMatterport, Inc.
