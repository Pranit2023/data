The Company has significantly improved our rates, reliability, and product quality at Ironton. While there is still more work to be done, we are confident in continuing to move the Ironton Facility forward and pursuing nameplate capacity targets in the future. These achievements are allowing the Company to turn its focus toward the next phase of PureCycle's growth by ramping-up our commercialization efforts.\" Olson continued, \"With positive customer feedback and initial success in commercial trials, Q3 was a pivotal time for the team. We are seeing strong interest in our product by leading companies from several market channels and plan to increase production to meet those needs. The Company believes this should lead to meaningful sales going into 2025.\"\n\n**Ironton Facility Update**\n\nAs previously announced, the Ironton Facility hit three key production milestones before the end of the third quarter, including one million pounds of feedstock processed in a week; 200,000 pounds of feedstock processed in a day; and feed rates of more than 10,000 pounds per hour. Each of these targets was set with a focus on proving out specific elements of the plant. With the facility having shown greater reliability and uptime, the Company can focus on ramping toward nameplate capacity and improving product quality.\n\nThe equipment updates to the co-product 2 (CP2) removal system have been commissioned and are working as designed. In addition to the CP2 removal improvements, the Company advanced its sorting strategy in mid-October by commissioning a new 325,000 square foot facility located in Denver, Pennsylvania. The facility sorts mixed plastic bales using optical and robotic sorting technologies. With these technologies, the facility has been able to improve the polypropylene concentration of the mixed bales from ~60-80% to ~90-95%. The higher concentration of polypropylene combined with the improved CP2 removal system has led to greater output and improved quality at the Ironton Facility.\n\n**Commercial Update**\n\nThe market continues to lack high quality recycled material and PureCycle offers an answer for companies looking to achieve their sustainability goals. Initial feedback from customers in the qualification process has been very positive and the Company is working to convert these trials into orders in the near future. The Company has produced and built meaningful inventory to meet near term expected demand and give customers confidence Ironton will be able to ramp-up to meet their needs.\n\nThe increased production volume at the Ironton Facility and expanded efforts with compounding allowed the Company to introduce samples to new markets and further trials with potential customers. PureCycle recently provided The Procter & Gamble Company (P&G) with compounded material. This will allow P&G to begin the approval process for the recycled resin in various applications. PureCycle plans to provide material to P&G for production beginning in Q2 or Q3 of 2025.\n\nThe Company completed multiple trials with customers in the fiber market, which has been an underserved area when it comes to recycled polypropylene. These trials were conducted with some of the largest fiber manufacturers in the country and built upon earlier smaller-scale successful trials. PureCycle worked with the manufacturers to produce continuous filament and staple fibers with varying product properties that should allow for the introduction into applications such as carpet, clothing, upholstery, and automotive.\n\nThe Company also progressed the approval process with one of the largest global automotive manufacturers for both interior and exterior applications. The first application would include PureCycle resin from 100% recycled feedstock.\n\n**PureCycle Financial Update**\n\nOn August 7, 2024 the Company sold approximately $22.5 million in aggregate par amount of its Series A Southern Ohio Port Authority Revenue Bonds to certain investors. The Company received $18 million in gross proceeds.\n\nIn September, PureCycle entered into a series of transactions with Sylebra Capital Management and Samlyn Capital, LLC and raised gross proceeds of $90 million. The capital raised should allow the Company to continue with its investments to facilitate future growth. At the end of the recent third quarter, the Company had an unrestricted and restricted cash balance of $93.7 million.\n\n###\n\n**_PureCycle Contact_**\n\nChristian Brueycbruey@purecycle.com+1 (352) 745-6120\n\n**_About PureCycle Technologies_**\n\nPureCycle Technologies LLC., a subsidiary of PureCycle Technologies, Inc., holds a global license for the only patented solvent-driven purification recycling technology, developed by The Procter & Gamble Company (P&G), that is designed to transform polypropylene plastic waste (designated as No. 5 plastic) into a continuously renewable resource.

The Company has significantly improved our rates, reliability, and product quality at Ironton. While there is still more work to be done, we are confident in continuing to move the Ironton Facility forward and pursuing nameplate capacity targets in the future. These achievements are allowing the Company to turn its focus toward the next phase of PureCycle's growth by ramping-up our commercialization efforts.\" Olson continued, \"With positive customer feedback and initial success in commercial trials, Q3 was a pivotal time for the team. We are seeing strong interest in our product by leading companies from several market channels and plan to increase production to meet those needs. The Company believes this should lead to meaningful sales going into 2025.\"\n\n**Ironton Facility Update**\n\nAs previously announced, the Ironton Facility hit three key production milestones before the end of the third quarter, including one million pounds of feedstock processed in a week; 200,000 pounds of feedstock processed in a day; and feed rates of more than 10,000 pounds per hour. Each of these targets was set with a focus on proving out specific elements of the plant. With the facility having shown greater reliability and uptime, the Company can focus on ramping toward nameplate capacity and improving product quality.\n\nThe equipment updates to the co-product 2 (CP2) removal system have been commissioned and are working as designed. In addition to the CP2 removal improvements, the Company advanced its sorting strategy in mid-October by commissioning a new 325,000 square foot facility located in Denver, Pennsylvania. The facility sorts mixed plastic bales using optical and robotic sorting technologies. With these technologies, the facility has been able to improve the polypropylene concentration of the mixed bales from ~60-80% to ~90-95%. The higher concentration of polypropylene combined with the improved CP2 removal system has led to greater output and improved quality at the Ironton Facility.\n\n**Commercial Update**\n\nThe market continues to lack high quality recycled material and PureCycle offers an answer for companies looking to achieve their sustainability goals. Initial feedback from customers in the qualification process has been very positive and the Company is working to convert these trials into orders in the near future. The Company has produced and built meaningful inventory to meet near term expected demand and give customers confidence Ironton will be able to ramp-up to meet their needs.\n\nThe increased production volume at the Ironton Facility and expanded efforts with compounding allowed the Company to introduce samples to new markets and further trials with potential customers. PureCycle recently provided The Procter & Gamble Company (P&G) with compounded material. This will allow P&G to begin the approval process for the recycled resin in various applications. PureCycle plans to provide material to P&G for production beginning in Q2 or Q3 of 2025.\n\nThe Company completed multiple trials with customers in the fiber market, which has been an underserved area when it comes to recycled polypropylene. These trials were conducted with some of the largest fiber manufacturers in the country and built upon earlier smaller-scale successful trials. PureCycle worked with the manufacturers to produce continuous filament and staple fibers with varying product properties that should allow for the introduction into applications such as carpet, clothing, upholstery, and automotive.\n\nThe Company also progressed the approval process with one of the largest global automotive manufacturers for both interior and exterior applications. The first application would include PureCycle resin from 100% recycled feedstock.\n\n**PureCycle Financial Update**\n\nOn August 7, 2024 the Company sold approximately $22.5 million in aggregate par amount of its Series A Southern Ohio Port Authority Revenue Bonds to certain investors. The Company received $18 million in gross proceeds.\n\nIn September, PureCycle entered into a series of transactions with Sylebra Capital Management and Samlyn Capital, LLC and raised gross proceeds of $90 million. The capital raised should allow the Company to continue with its investments to facilitate future growth. At the end of the recent third quarter, the Company had an unrestricted and restricted cash balance of $93.7 million.\n\n###\n\n**_PureCycle Contact_**\n\nChristian Brueycbruey@purecycle.com+1 (352) 745-6120\n\n**_About PureCycle Technologies_**\n\nPureCycle Technologies LLC., a subsidiary of PureCycle Technologies, Inc., holds a global license for the only patented solvent-driven purification recycling technology, developed by The Procter & Gamble Company (P&G), that is designed to transform polypropylene plastic waste (designated as No. 5 plastic) into a continuously renewable resource.

          "content": "November 7, 2024\nPureCycle Provides Third Quarter 2024\nCorporate Update\nORLANDO, FL / ACCESSWIRE / November 7, 2024 /P ureCycle Technologies, Inc.\n(Nasdaq:PCT), a U.S.-based company revolutionizing plastic recycling, today, announced a\ncorporate update for the third quarter ending September 30, 2024.\nManagement Commentary\nPureCycle CEO Dustin Olson commented, \"The third quarter represented meaningful\nprogress for the Company on multiple fronts. The Company has significantly improved our\nrates, reliability, and product quality at Ironton. While there is still more work to be done, we\nare confident in continuing to move the Ironton Facility forward and pursuing nameplate\ncapacity targets in the future. These achievements are allowing the Company to turn its\nfocus toward the next phase of PureCycle's growth by ramping-up our commercialization\nefforts.\" Olson continued, \"With positive customer feedback and initial success in commercial\ntrials, Q3 was a pivotal time for the team. We are seeing strong interest in our product by\nleading companies from several market channels and plan to increase production to meet\nthose needs. The Company believes this should lead to meaningful sales going into 2025.\"\nIronton Facility Update\nAs previously announced, the Ironton Facility hit three key production milestones before the\nend of the third quarter, including one million pounds of feedstock processed in a week;\n200,000 pounds of feedstock processed in a day; and feed rates of more than 10,000\npounds per hour. Each of these targets was set with a focus on proving out specific\nelements of the plant. With the facility having shown greater reliability and uptime, the\nCompany can focus on ramping toward nameplate capacity and improving product quality.\nThe equipment updates to the co-product 2 (CP2) removal system have been commissioned\nand are working as designed. In addition to the CP2 removal improvements, the Company\nadvanced its sorting strategy in mid-October by commissioning a new 325,000 square foot\nfacility located in Denver, Pennsylvania. The facility sorts mixed plastic bales using optical\nand robotic sorting technologies. With these technologies, the facility has been able to\nimprove the polypropylene concentration of the mixed bales from ~60-80% to ~90-95%. The\nhigher concentration of polypropylene combined with the improved CP2 removal system has\nled to greater output and improved quality at the Ironton Facility.\nCommercial Update\nThe market continues to lack high quality recycled material and PureCycle offers an answer\nfor companies looking to achieve their sustainability goals. Initial feedback from customers in\nthe qualification process has been very positive and the Company is working to convert\nthese trials into orders in the near future. The Company has produced and built meaningful\ninventory to meet near term expected demand and give customers confidence Ironton will be\nable to ramp-up to meet their needs.\nThe increased production volume at the Ironton Facility and expanded efforts with\ncompounding allowed the Company to introduce samples to new markets and further trials\nwith potential customers. PureCycle recently provided The Procter & Gamble Company\n(P&G) with compounded material. This will allow P&G to begin the approval process for the\nrecycled resin in various applications. PureCycle plans to provide material to P&G for\nproduction beginning in Q2 or Q3 of 2025.\nThe Company completed multiple trials with customers in the fiber market, which has been\nan underserved area when it comes to recycled polypropylene. These trials were conducted\nwith some of the largest fiber manufacturers in the country and built upon earlier smaller-\nscale successful trials. PureCycle worked with the manufacturers to produce continuous\nfilament and staple fibers with varying product properties that should allow for the\nintroduction into applications such as carpet, clothing, upholstery, and automotive.\nThe Company also progressed the approval process with one of the largest global\nautomotive manufacturers for both interior and exterior applications. The first application\nwould include PureCycle resin from 100% recycled feedstock.\nPureCycle Financial Update\nOn August 7, 2024 the Company sold approximately $22.5 million in aggregate par amount\nof its Series A Southern Ohio Port Authority Revenue Bonds to certain investors. The\nCompany received $18 million in gross proceeds.\nIn September, PureCycle entered into a series of transactions with Sylebra Capital\nManagement and Samlyn Capital, LLC and raised gross proceeds of $90 million. The capital\nraised should allow the Company to continue with its investments to facilitate future growth.\nAt the end of the recent third quarter, the Company had an unrestricted and restricted cash\nbalance of $93.7 million.\n###\nPureCycle Contact\nChristian Bruey\ncbruey@purecycle.com\n+1 (352) 745-6120\nAbout PureCycle Technologies\nPureCycle Technologies LLC., a subsidiary of PureCycle Technologies, Inc., holds a global\nlicense for the only patented solvent-driven purification recycling technology, developed by\nThe Procter & Gamble Company (P&G), that is designed to transform polypropylene plastic\nwaste (designated as No. 5 plastic) into a continuously renewable resource.

THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n(Unaudited)\n\nNOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION\n\nFormation and Organization\n\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc. (“PCT” or “Company”) is a Florida-based corporation focused on commercializing a patented purification recycling technology (the “Technology”), originally developed by The Procter & Gamble Company (“P&G”), for restoring waste polypropylene into resin, called ultra-pure recycled (“UPR”) resin, which has nearly identical properties and applicability for reuse as virgin polypropylene. PCT has a global license for the Technology from P&G. PCT’s goal is to create an important new segment of the global polypropylene market that will assist multinational entities in meeting their sustainability goals, providing consumers with polypropylene-based products that are sustainable, and reducing overall polypropylene waste in the world’s landfills and oceans.\n\nBusiness Combination\n\nOn March 17, 2021, PureCycle consummated the previously announced business combination (“Business Combination”) by and among Roth CH Acquisition I Co., a Delaware corporation (“ROCH”), Roth CH Acquisition I Co. Parent Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned direct subsidiary of ROCH (“ParentCo”), Roth CH Merger Sub LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned direct subsidiary of ParentCo, Roth CH Merger Sub Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned direct subsidiary of ParentCo and PureCycle Technologies LLC (“PCT LLC” or “Legacy PCT”) pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of November 16, 2020, as amended from time to time (the “Merger Agreement”).\n\nUpon the completion of the Business Combination and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the “Transactions”, and such completion, the “Closing”), ROCH changed its name to PureCycle Technologies Holdings Corp. and became a wholly owned direct subsidiary of ParentCo, PCT LLC became a wholly owned direct subsidiary of PureCycle Technologies Holdings Corp. and a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of ParentCo, and ParentCo changed its name to PureCycle Technologies, Inc. The Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (\"Common Stock\"), units and warrants are now listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“NASDAQ”) under the symbols “PCT,” “PCTTU” and “PCTTW,” respectively.\n\nLegacy PCT unitholders were to be issued up to 4.0 million additional shares of the Common Stock if certain conditions were met (“the Earnout”). The Legacy PCT unitholders were entitled to 2.0 million shares of Common Stock if, after 1 year after the Closing and prior to or as of the third anniversary of the Closing, the closing price of the Common Stock was greater than or equal to $18.00 over any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period. The Company failed to achieve this milestone by March 17, 2024, and those shares have been forfeited and can no longer be earned by the Legacy PCT unitholders.\n\nThe Legacy PCT unitholders will be entitled to the remaining 2.0 million shares from the Earnout upon the Ironton Facility becoming operational, as certified by Leidos Engineering, LLC (“Leidos”), an independent engineering firm, in accordance with criteria established in agreements in connection with construction of the plant.\n\nUnless the context otherwise requires, “Registrant,” “PureCycle,” “Company,” “PCT,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to PureCycle Technologies, Inc., and its subsidiaries at and after the Closing and give effect to the Closing. “Legacy PCT,” “ROCH” and “ParentCo” refer to PureCycle Technologies LLC, ROCH and ParentCo, respectively, prior to the Closing.\n\n10\n\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\n\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — CONTINUED\n\n(Unaudited)\n\nLiquidity and Going Concern\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that PCT will continue as a going concern; however, the conditions described below raise substantial doubt about PCT’s ability to do so, which management believes has been alleviated through its plans to mitigate these conditions and obtain additional unrestricted liquidity.\n\nThe Company has sustained recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations since its inception. As reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company has begun limited commercial operations but does not have any significant sources of revenue. The following is a summary of the components of our current liquidity (in thousands):\n\nAs of  \n---  \nSeptember 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023  \nCash and cash equivalents | $ | 83,673 | $ | 73,411  \nDebt securities available for sale | — | $ | 48,226  \nAvailable unrestricted liquidity | $ | 83,673 | $ | 121,637  \nRestricted cash (current and non-current) | $ | 9,980 | $ | 229,103  \nWorking capital | $ | 43,213 | $ | 107,035  \nAccumulated deficit | $ | (568,698 | ) | $ | (344,240 | )  \nFor the nine months ended  \nSeptember 30, 2024 | September 30, 2023  \nNet loss | $ | (224,458 | ) | $ | (72,680 | )  \n  \nAs of September 30, 2024, PCT had $83.7 million of Cash and cash equivalents, and $10.0 million of Restricted cash. PCT also has a $200.0 million revolving credit facility with Sylebra Capital (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) that is currently unused and expires on March 31, 2026, per a recent amendment. See Note 3 - Notes Payable and Debt Instruments for further information.\n\nThrough the first nine months of 2024, PCT has not yet reached meaningful production volumes, sales, or production of on-spec product. Currently, PCT is focused on customer sampling and qualifications and believes that this will lead to meaningful future sales. Also, during the third quarter, the Company initiated compounding operations to blend its resin with either post-industrial recycled material or virgin polypropylene, which is expected to improve product consistency and accelerate the product delivery to customers.\n\nPCT has experienced intermittent mechanical challenges during the commissioning process including, but not limited to, limits in the rates at which certain contaminants can currently be removed from the purification process, as well as challenges with sustaining continuous operations. Recently, PCT has been focused on the recovery and removal of polyethylene and other solids (“CP2”), which impacts the ability to run higher volumes and produce consistent, high quality UPR resin. PCT has modified the CP2 removal system to remove higher volumes of CP2 more quickly and believes these changes enable us to produce higher volumes of on-spec product. The Company is currently testing the system improvements at various operating conditions to validate the new limits.\n\nOn October 3, 2024, PCT funded $35.9 million to a restricted escrow account related to the Augusta purification facility project. Further, as of September 30, 2024, and through the twelve months from the date of filing, PCT had additional committed capital related to the Augusta Facility of approximately $11.0 million for long-lead equipment and pre-construction work. With additional project finance, the Company anticipates that it may make a higher level\n\n11\n\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\n\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — CONTINUED\n\n(Unaudited)\n\nof investment in 2025 to further the construction of the Augusta Facility. Also remaining are final investments in the Ironton Facility of approximately $5.0 to $8.0 million. Moreover, there are interest and principal payments of at least $60.6 million, as well as other ongoing monthly costs associated with managing the Company and possible draws on the Revolving Credit Facility.\n\nPursuant to the requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 205-40, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, management must evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the date the consolidated financial statements are issued. This evaluation does not take into consideration the potential mitigating effect of management’s plans that have not been fully implemented or are not within control of the Company as of the date the financial statements are issued. When substantial doubt exists under this methodology, management evaluates whether the mitigating effect of its plans sufficiently alleviates substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The mitigating effect of management’s plans, however, is only considered if both (1) it is probable that the plans will be effectively implemented within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued, and (2) it is probable that the plans, when implemented, will mitigate the relevant conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the consolidated financial statements are issued.\n\nPCT believes that its current level of unrestricted liquidity is not sufficient to fund operations, fund outstanding commitments, and further its future growth plans. The conditions described above raise substantial doubt regarding PCT’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least one year from the date of issuance of the consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n\nIn an effort to alleviate these conditions, PCT is currently performing certain operational enhancements that are expected to correct the production issues with the Ironton Facility. Further, on March 5, 2024, PCT LLC purchased 99% of the outstanding bonds (see Note 3 - Notes Payable and Debt Instruments for further information). Since the purchase of the outstanding bonds, PCT has, through a series of transactions, resold $116.8 million at a price of $800 per $1,000 principal amount. As of September 30, 2024, there were $117.6 million of outstanding bonds that PCT intends to, and has the ability to, re-market based on the need for additional liquidity. The re-marketing process may require the addition of certain covenants to enhance the marketability of the purchased Bonds. The ability to re-market the purchased bonds with any such additional new covenants would require a further amendment to, or waiver of, provisions included within the Revolving Credit Facility. After considering management’s plans to mitigate these conditions, including operational progress and re-marketing of the Bonds, PCT believes this substantial doubt has been alleviated and it has sufficient liquidity to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months.\n\nPCT’s future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the funding mechanism and construction schedule of the Augusta Facility and other anticipated facilities outside the United States, build-out of multiple Feed PreP facilities, funding needs to support other business opportunities, funding for general corporate purposes, debt service and other challenges or unforeseen circumstances. As a low-revenue operating company, PCT continually reviews its cash outlays, pace of hiring, professional services and other spend, and capital commitments to proactively manage those needs in tandem with its cash balance. For future growth and investment, PCT expects to seek additional debt or equity financing from outside sources, which it may not be able to raise on terms favorable to PCT, or at all. If PCT is unable to raise additional debt or sell additional equity when desired, or if PCT is unable to manage its cash outflows, PCT’s business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected. In addition, any financing arrangement may have potentially adverse effects on PCT and/or its stockholders. Debt financing (if available and undertaken) will increase expenses, must be repaid regardless of\n\n12\n\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\n\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — CONTINUED\n\n(Unaudited)\n\noperating results and may involve restrictions limiting PCT’s operating flexibility. If PCT consummates an equity financing to raise additional funds, the percentage ownership of its existing stockholders will be reduced, and the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the current holders of PCT’s Common Stock.\n\nNOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nBasis of Presentation\n\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements include the accounts of the Company. The condensed consolidated interim financial statements are presented in U.S. Dollars. Certain information in footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements was condensed or omitted for the interim periods presented in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). Intercompany balances and transactions were eliminated upon consolidation. The results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the entire year ending December 31, 2024. The accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to present a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented.\n\nThe unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the information contained in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for a full year.\n\nReclassifications\n\nCertain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with the report classifications of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Specifically, the Company reclassified certain expenses between Operating costs, Research and development, and Selling, general, and administrative to more accurately reflect the activities of the business. Total operating costs and expenses did not change for prior years.\n\nImmaterial Corrections Related to Prior Periods\n\nWe have identified an immaterial correction to certain 2023 quarters related to depreciation expense associated with the Ironton Facility assets (Machinery and equipment) placed in service during the period presented herein. We evaluated the effect of this correction on the interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 in accordance with the guidance in ASC 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, ASC 250-10-S99-1, Assessing Materiality, and ASC 250-10-S99-2, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements. We have concluded that the 2023 prior periods are not materially misstated. Accordingly, we have reflected the 2023 prior period impacts and associated revisions for these periods presented herein.\n\nThe revision increased property, plant and equipment, net and decreased depreciation expense by $3.6 million and $4.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and increased basic and diluted earnings per share (\"EPS\") by $0.02 and $0.03, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to what was presented in previous quarterly filings.\n\n13\n\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\n\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — CONTINUED\n\n(Unaudited)\n\nRestricted Cash\n\nCash pledged as collateral for future capital purchases and leased properties is deemed restricted and included within restricted cash. Restricted cash that is expected to be spent or released from restriction within twelve months is classified as current on the consolidated balance sheet. Restricted cash that is expected to be spent or released from restriction after twelve months is classified as noncurrent on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nInventory\n\nProduction inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value and include raw materials, work-in-process, and finished goods inventory. The Company’s inventories are valued under the average cost method. As the Company has not generated material sales and is in the early stages of operations, net realizable value is being estimated based on anticipated selling prices, and the Company has not yet begun applying full absorption costing.\n\nThe Company records spare parts for plant maintenance as a current asset and expenses them when utilized. The Company has recorded $2.8 million and $1.6 million for spare parts inventory within Prepaid expenses and other current assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-09—Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which enhances the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The amendments in this update address investor requests for more transparency about income tax information through improvements to income tax disclosures primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information and includes certain other amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures. The updated standard is effective for our annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting, which expands annual and interim disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The updated standard is effective for our annual periods beginning in fiscal year 2024 and interim periods beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.\n\n14\n\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\n\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — CONTINUED\n\n(Unaudited)\n\nNOTE 3 – NOTES PAYABLE AND DEBT INSTRUMENTS\n\nThe Company’s debt balances, including related party debt, consist of the following at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\n\nSeptember 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nGreen Convertible Notes, interest at 7.25% due semiannually; balance due at maturity in August 2030 | $ | 250,000 | $ | 250,000  \nCSC Equipment Financing Payable, currently bearing interest at a monthly charge of 3.1% of the outstanding balance financed; 36 month term expected to commence July 1, 2026, bearing interest at 7.25% (based on lease rate factor indexed to WSJ Prime Rate) | 20,290 | 19,747  \nRevenue Bonds, interest at 7% due semiannually; semiannual principal repayments beginning 2031 maturing 2042 | 12,800 | 249,550  \nOther Debt | 9,074 | 1,762  \n292,164 | 521,059  \nLess: Original issue discount and debt issuance costs classified as a reduction to long-term debt | (26,294 | ) | (44,203 | )  \nLess: Current portion | (10,839 | ) | (9,148 | )  \nLong-term debt, less current portion | $ | 255,031 | $ | 467,708  \nRelated Party Debt  \nRevenue Bonds due to related party, interest rates between 6.5% and 13% due semiannually; principal repayments vary by series and begin December 2024 fully maturing December 2042 | 106,335 | —  \nPure Plastic Note Payable, interest at applicable rate plus margin, as defined (12.9% and 13.0% as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively) | — | 43,125  \nLess: Original issue discount and debt issuance costs classified as a reduction to note payable | (30,868 | ) | (3,429 | )  \nLess: Current portion | (1,040 | ) | —  \nRelated party debt | $ | 74,427 | $ | 39,696  \nSylebra Line of Credit, $200.0M borrowing capacity remaining, interest at applicable rate plus margin, as defined; maturing March 2026 | $ | — | $ | —  \n  \nRevenue Bonds\n\nOn October 7, 2020, the Southern Ohio Port Authority (“SOPA”) issued certain Revenue Bonds (as defined below) pursuant to an Indenture of Trust dated as of October 1, 2020 (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Indenture”), between SOPA and UMB Bank, N.A., as Trustee (“Trustee”), and loaned the proceeds from their sale to PureCycle: Ohio LLC (“PCO”), an Ohio limited liability company and indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, pursuant to a Loan Agreement dated as of October 1, 2020, between SOPA and PCO (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Loan Agreement”) to be used to, among other things, acquire, construct and equip the Company’s first commercial-scale recycling facility in Lawrence County, Ohio, the Ironton Facility.

The Purchase was to occur only if Sellers, including at least the Majority Holders, consented to the Proposed Amendments. The purchase price did not include any default or penalty interest accruing from January 1, 2024 that may otherwise be owed to Sellers, and each Seller will waive its respective right to such default or penalty interest as additional compensation for the Purchase.\n\nThe Third Supplemental Indenture amended and supplemented the Indenture and certain of the other Financing Documents (as defined by the Indenture) by, among other things and without limitation, eliminating substantially all covenants and events of default contained in the Indenture (\"Events of Default\"), the Loan Agreement and certain of such other Financing Documents including, but not limited, to the following changes:\n\n•\n\nelimination of the Milestones and Revised Milestones;\n\n•\n\namendments extending the Outside Completion Date to December 31, 2030;\n\n•\n\namendments to the definition of each of “Outstanding,” “Bonds Outstanding,” and “Outstanding Bonds” in the Indenture such that any Bonds owned by or on behalf of PureCycle or an affiliate of PureCycle or the Issuer or an affiliate of the Issuer will have the same approval voting or consent rights as other Holders;\n\n•\n\nelimination of the requirement to produce sufficient annual gross revenues in order to provide a Senior Debt Service Coverage Ratio (“DSCR”) equal to at least 150% for each fiscal year, and a ratio of at least 110% of net income available for debt service;\n\n•\n\nelimination of certain financial prerequisites that placed limitations on the issuance of additional senior parity indebtedness, subordinate indebtedness and non-parity indebtedness;\n\n•\n\nelimination of the DSCR requirement for certain equipment liens;\n\n•\n\nelimination of delivery of interim financial statements on a quarterly basis for PCO and the Guarantor;\n\n•\n\nelimination of requirement for an unqualified opinion of the independent certified public accountant for year-end financials for PCO;\n\n16\n\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\n\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — CONTINUED\n\n(Unaudited)\n\n•\n\nelimination of quarterly operating statements and monthly reconciliation statements;\n\n•\n\nelimination of the Operating Revenue Escrow Fund;\n\n•\n\nelimination of the restrictions on distributions by PCO on any of its membership interests, including management fees;\n\n•\n\nelimination of the requirement to disclose transactions with affiliates to the Trustee and bondholders and to seek approval of Majority Holders for affiliate transactions;\n\n•\n\nelimination of the requirement that offtake contracts provide revenues to PCO sufficient to meet a Senior Parity Coverage Requirement ratio (“SPCR”) of 125% for any fiscal year, commencing December 31, 2023;\n\n•\n\nelimination of the requirement that feedstock supply contracts provide feedstock to PCO sufficient to permit PCO to meet a SPCR of 125% for any fiscal year, commencing December 31, 2023;\n\n•\n\nelimination of the requirement that the Guarantor replenish the Contingency Account from the Liquidity Reserve Escrow Fund and replenish the Liquidity Reserve Escrow Fund;\n\n•\n\namendments providing that the occurrence of an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default under the Loan Agreement, the Mortgage or the Tax Compliance Agreement, each as defined in the Indenture) will not be an Event of Default under the Indenture;\n\n•\n\nprovide for a potentially earlier termination of the Guaranty and release of funds remaining in the Liquidity Reserve Escrow Fund after the Purchase;\n\n•\n\nprovide for the release of funds (solely to the extent such release may be effectuated with the consent of the Majority Holders) on deposit in accounts in the Trust Estate (as defined in the Indenture) in an amount proportionate to the percentage of aggregate principal amount of Bonds that are submitted for Purchase (with such released funds being used by the Purchaser, together with other available funds of the Purchaser, to effectuate the Purchase); and\n\n•\n\namendments to various escrow accounts and other funds managed by the Trustee and US Bank to permit the release of funds from such accounts in an amount proportionate to the percentage of aggregate principal amount of Bonds purchased by PCO or an affiliate of PCO from time to time.\n\nAs of March 5, 2024, (the “Closing Date”) PCO and the Majority Holders closed on the Purchase Agreement and Consent (“Purchase Agreement”) comprising the definitive purchase agreement and, as additional consideration, the consent to the Third Supplemental Indenture, including the Proposed Amendments described therein. PCT LLC, an affiliate of PCO and the Guarantor under the Guaranty, is the purchaser (“Purchaser”) of Bonds under the Purchase Agreement. The Purchase Agreement was executed by each Holder that elects to sell its Bonds to the Purchaser and by PCO and the Purchase was effective on the Closing Date.\n\nThe Purchaser purchased 99% of the outstanding bonds with $74.5 million of unrestricted cash and $184.6 million of restricted cash. The Purchase was determined to be an extinguishment of the underlying debt obligation due to PCO being a wholly owned subsidiary of the Purchaser. As of September 30, 2024, there were $117.6 million of outstanding Bonds that PCT intends to, and has the ability to, re-market based on the need for additional liquidity. Of the $259.1 million paid for the purchase, $5.9 million represented payment of accrued and unpaid interest prior to the Closing Date and $253.2 million was allocated to the outstanding carrying value at the Closing Date of $232.0 million. A $21.2 million loss on extinguishment of the Bonds was recognized in the condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nOn March 25, 2024, SOPA, as Issuer, PCO, the Guarantor, PCTO Holdco, a Delaware limited liability company and affiliate of PCO (the pledgor under the Equity Pledge and Security Agreement (as defined in the Fourth\n\n17\n\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\n\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — CONTINUED\n\n(Unaudited)\n\nSupplemental Indenture)) and the Trustee entered into the Fourth Supplemental Indenture (the “Fourth Supplemental Indenture”) which amended certain provisions of the Indenture, the Loan Agreement and that certain Amended and Restated Guaranty of Completion, entered into as of May 11, 2021, and effective as of October 7, 2020 (the “Guaranty”), by instructing the Trustee to release $22.1 million from the Senior Bonds Debt Service Reserve Fund and $3.3 million from the Repair and Replacement Fund, in each case, to PCO. In addition, the Fourth Supplemental Indenture provides that the Senior Bonds Debt Service Reserve Requirement, the Subordinate Bonds Debt Service Reserve Requirement, and the Repair and Replacement Fund Requirement shall each be reduced to $0, respectively, and that certain provisions of the Indenture and/or the Loan Agreement, as applicable, relating to the funding and maintenance of the Senior Bonds Debt Service Reserve Fund, the Subordinate Bonds Debt Service Reserve Fund, and the Repair and Replacement Fund, will be suspended until the effectiveness of an amendment to the Indenture, the Loan Agreement and/or other applicable Financing Documents provides otherwise in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Loan Agreement and such other applicable Financing Documents.\n\nOn October 25, 2024, SOPA, as Issuer, PCO, the Guarantor, PCTO Holdco and the Trustee entered into the Sixth Supplemental Indenture (the “Sixth Supplemental Indenture”) which amended certain provisions of the Indenture and Loan Agreements to include, among other things, certain financial covenants. The amendments were a requirement of the Bond Purchase Agreement.

Affiliates of Pure Plastic are greater than 5% beneficial owners of the Company.\n\nOn May 10, 2024, Pure Plastic executed a Payoff and Release Letter (the “Payoff and Release Letter”), which memorialized the exchange of the Company’s obligations under the $40 million term loan provided to the Company pursuant to the Term Loan Credit Agreement (as defined below). The Company was also required to pay a 12% prepayment premium on the outstanding principal and interest paid in order to prepay the Term Loan Facility (the “Prepayment Premium”), plus certain expenses. The Company issued warrants (“Series B Warrants”) to Pure Plastic pursuant to the Series B Warrant Agreement to satisfy the Prepayment Premium (the “Series B Warrant Agreement”). Refer to Note 6 – Warrants for further discussion.\n\nOn May 28, 2024, PCT LLC and Pure Plastic executed the First Amendment to the Amended and Restated Bond Purchase Agreement (“First Amendment”) whereby Exhibit A to the Amended and Restated Bond Purchase Agreement was replaced with Exhibit A-3 to the First Amendment to facilitate the transfer by the Depository Trust Company of certain of the Related Party Bonds. The total amount of the Related Party Bonds and the cash due from Pure Plastic to PCT LLC remains the same. Except as summarized above and as set forth in the First Amendment, PCT LLC and Pure Plastic each acknowledged and reaffirmed the terms of the Amended and Restated Bond Purchase Agreement in the First Amendment.\n\nOn June 14, 2024, SOPA, as Issuer, PCO, the Guarantor, PCTO Holdco, and the Trustee entered into the Fifth Supplemental Indenture (the “Fifth Supplemental Indenture”) which amended certain provisions of the Indenture including (a) redefining “Majority Holders” to be the Holders of seventy-five percent (75%) in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Bonds then Outstanding, or if no Senior Bonds are then Outstanding, the Holders of seventy-five percent (75%) in aggregate principal amount of Bonds then Outstanding, and (b) amending the lead paragraph of Section 10.02(a) of the Indenture by raising the threshold for consenting to and approving the execution by the Issuer and the Trustee of Supplemental Indentures from “Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Senior Bonds” to “Holders of not less than 75% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Senior Bonds” with the limited exceptions therein stated.\n\nThe issuance of the Related Party Bonds and retirement of the Term Loan Facility with Pure Plastic was accounted for as a debt modification. The principal issued for the Related Party Bonds amounted to $94.3 million, with $29.8 million of discount and $1.5 million of issuance costs recorded as a reduction of the debt carrying value on the date of the transaction (including retention of $1.5 million of discount and $1.5 million of issuance cost remaining on the Term Loan Facility as of the transaction date, as well as a discount of $6.8 million related to the value of the Series B Warrants issued in satisfaction of the Prepayment Premium). The carrying value of the Related Party Bonds is recorded within Related party bonds payable in the condensed consolidated balance sheet.\n\n19\n\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\n\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — CONTINUED\n\n(Unaudited)\n\nOn August 7, 2024, PCT LLC, Pure Plastic, and several other parties reached agreement on terms whereby certain investors purchased approximately $22.5 million in aggregate par amount of Series A Bonds owned by PCT LLC at a purchase price of $800 per $1,000 principal amount (the “August Purchased Bonds”) under a bond purchase agreement. The purchase of the August Purchased Bonds was completed and funds received by PCT LLC on or about August 9, 2024, with $12.5 million in aggregate par amount being sold to Pure Plastic and $10.0 million in aggregate par amount being sold to other parties. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of the Related Party Bonds was $98.0 million and the fair value of the third party bonds was $10.9 million. These bonds were included in the level 3 measurement in the fair value hierarchy as they were derived using significant unobservable inputs.\n\nSylebra Credit Facility\n\nOn March 15, 2023, PCT entered into the $150.0 million Revolving Credit Facility pursuant to a credit agreement (the \"Revolving Credit Agreement\") dated as of March 15, 2023, with PureCycle Technologies Holdings Corp. and PCT LLC (the “Guarantors”), Sylebra Capital Partners Master Fund, LTD, Sylebra Capital Parc Master Fund, and Sylebra Capital Menlo Master Fund (collectively, the “Lenders”), and Madison Pacific Trust Limited (the “Administrative Agent” and “Security Agent”). The Lenders and their affiliates are greater than 5% beneficial owners of PCT.\n\nOn March 1, 2024, PCT increased the Revolving Credit Facility from $150.0 million to $200.0 million, extended the maturity date to September 30, 2025 (which was further extended below), and obtained a carveout to permit the Company to purchase the Revenue Bonds, pursuant to an amendment to the Revolving Credit Agreement with PCT, the Guarantors, the Lenders, and the Administrative Agent and Security Agent.\n\nIn conjunction with PCT LLC’s sale of approximately $94.3 million of Related Party Bonds, on May 10, 2024, the Company, the Guarantors, the Administrative Agent, the Security Agent and the Lenders executed a Limited Consent and Fifth Amendment to the Credit Agreement to permit the Disposition of Bonds (as defined therein), as well as to provide certain administrative revisions to eliminate the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined therein) and references to the Term Loan Credit Agreement.\n\nOn September 11, 2024, in connection with PCT’s offering of Series A Preferred Stock, PCT extended the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility to March 31, 2026, in conjunction with the Limited Consent and Sixth Amendment to the Credit Agreement, which also (i) permitted the offering of Series A Preferred Stock; (ii) added PureCycle Augusta, LLC as a “Guarantor” and a \"Loan Party\" thereunder and (iii) added as secured obligations certain obligations in respect of the Series A Preferred Stock and Series C Warrants owed to the Lenders’ affiliates. Refer to Note 4 - Redeemable Preferred Stock—Series A Preferred Stock for more information.\n\nThe Pure Plastic Term Loan Facility\n\nOn May 8, 2023, the Company entered into a $40.0 million term loan facility pursuant to the Term Loan Credit Agreement (\"Term Loan Credit Agreement\") dated as of May 8, 2023, among the Guarantors and Pure Plastic (as Lender, Administrative Agent, and Security Agent), which matures on December 31, 2025 (the “Term Loan Facility”). The Term Loan Credit Agreement was amended on August 21, 2023. Affiliates of the Lender are greater than 5% beneficial owners of the Company.\n\nOn March 1, 2024, PCT increased the amount available to the Company under the Term Loan Credit Agreement's permitted indebtedness covenant basket for the Revolving Credit Facility from $150.0 million to $200.0 million and obtained a carve out to permit the Company to purchase the Revenue Bonds. Each of PureCycle Technologies Holdings Corp. and PCT LLC are subsidiaries of the Company.\n\n20\n\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\n\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — CONTINUED\n\n(Unaudited)\n\nOn May 10, 2024, Pure Plastic executed the Payoff and Release Letter, which memorialized the exchange of the Company’s obligations under the Term Loan Credit Agreement. Refer to \"Revenue Bonds Issued to Related Party\" section above for further discussion.\n\nEquipment Financing\n\nCSC Leasing Co.\n\nOn May 8, 2023, the Company, through PureCycle PreP LLC, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a Master Lease Agreement (the “Master Lease Agreement”) with CSC Leasing Co. (“CSC”). Pursuant to the Master Lease Agreement, the Company and CSC agreed to enter into schedules that establish the specific terms and conditions of leasing certain equipment, machines, devices, features and any other items listed in each equipment lease schedule. The Master Lease Agreement commenced on the date set forth above and continues in effect until the later time that it is terminated, either by CSC at the end of any lease term, or by the Company upon three months written notice prior to the expiration of a lease term.\n\nAlso on May 8, 2023, the Company, also through PureCycle PreP LLC, entered into an Equipment Procurement Agreement (the “Equipment Agreement”) with CSC. Under the terms of the Equipment Agreement, CSC has agreed to finance, acquire and/or purchase certain equipment (the “Equipment”) from third-party vendors and/or manufacturers (each, a “Vendor”), so that CSC may lease the Equipment to the Company pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Master Lease Agreement. Prior to entering into formal lease schedules under the Master Lease Agreement, the Company will lease from CSC certain Equipment pursuant to the terms of the Equipment Agreement.\n\nIn connection with the above, CSC has funded $20.3 million for purposes of procuring equipment from a Vendor, which had previously been ordered by the Company prior to entering into these agreements with CSC. CSC will lease this equipment back to the Company under a 36-month lease, which will commence when the Company accepts delivery of the equipment at its operating location and all final bills from Vendor are paid (the “Schedule Commencement Date”). The Company has determined that it did not relinquish control of the assets to the buyer-lessor under these arrangements. Therefore, the Company has accounted for this transaction as a failed sale-leaseback transaction whereby it has continued recording these assets in the consolidated balance sheet and also recorded a financing obligation for the consideration paid by the buyer-lessor. The Company currently expects the lease term to commence in 2026, and the repayment schedule below assumes payments under the 36-month term commence on July 1, 2026.\n\nThe Company is required to make monthly payments under the agreements during the period between funding of the construction obligation and delivery of the equipment, which began in June 2023. Payments are equal to a monthly lease rate factor of approximately 3.1% of the outstanding amount funded by CSC. The Company has previously determined that these payments represent a cost of borrowing under the financing arrangement and has historically recorded the payments as interest expense in the interim condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. On September 4, 2024, the Company and CSC entered into a Rider to Supplement to the Master Lease Agreement, which allows the Company to credit fifty percent of payments made from November 1, 2023, through the earlier of the Schedule Commencement Date or November 1, 2025 against the outstanding principal owed (“CSC Principal Credit”). The Company is currently paying $0.6 million in Accumulating Rent (as defined in the Equipment Agreement) per month and has made total payments of $10.1 million as of September 30, 2024, of which it will receive $3.5 million credit toward the principal owed. The CSC Principal Credit shall be applied in thirty-six equal monthly installments against the basic rental amount owed in accordance with the lease schedules. The Company did not recognize any gain or loss in connection with the restructuring. The Company will begin amortizing the principal balance beginning with the date of the amendment.\n\n21\n\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\n\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — CONTINUED\n\n(Unaudited)\n\nVarilease Finance, Inc.\n\nOn July 12, 2024, PCT entered into an equipment financing arrangement with Varilease Finance, Inc. (\"VFI\") pursuant to a master lease agreement dated June 24, 2024, and received progress funding of $6.5 million on July 19, 2024. PCT anticipates an additional $3.8 million to be funded under this arrangement, pending completion of certain requirements. The Company began making accumulated rent payments on September 1, 2024 and will continue to do so until the related equipment is placed in service, at which point the 24-month rental term will commence.\n\nGreen Convertible Notes\n\nOn August 21, 2023, the Company priced its private offering of $215.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.25% Green Convertible Senior Notes due 2030 (the “Initial Notes”). On August 22, 2023, the initial purchaser in such offering exercised its option to purchase an additional $35.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 7.25% Green Convertible Senior Notes due 2030 (together with the “Initial Notes”, the “Green Convertible Notes”), bringing the total aggregate principal amount of the Green Convertible Notes to $250.0 million. Entities affiliated with a greater than 5% beneficial owner of the Company purchased $50.0 million aggregate principal amount at maturity of the Green Convertible Notes. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of the Green Convertible Notes was $222.6 million.

No shares of Series A Preferred Stock were authorized, issued or outstanding as of December 31, 2023.\n\nHolders of the Series A Preferred Stock do not have voting rights. The Series A Preferred Stock is not convertible, nor are there any sinking-fund requirements. The Series A Preferred Stock is redeemable at the Company’s option or mandatorily on September 13, 2027. The Company accounts for the Series A Preferred Stock as a liability in accordance with ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. The Series A Preferred Stock will be measured subsequently at the present value of the amount to be paid at settlement, accruing interest cost using the rate implicit at inception.\n\nThe holders of the Series A Preferred Stock have a contingent put right (the “Put Option”) which was bifurcated and recognized separately at fair value through earnings pursuant to ASC 815-15 Embedded derivatives. The Put Option is contingent upon the Company incurring any indebtedness after the initial issue date that is senior to the Series A Preferred Stock and/or secured by the assets of PureCycle Augusta, LLC (the “Trigger Event”). As of September 30, 2024, the Put Option liability has a fair value of $7.3 million. The Series A Preferred Stock and Put Option were not applicable as of December 31, 2023.\n\nThe shares of Series A Preferred Stock will be redeemed in cash at a price equal to $1,050 per share (105% of the Initial Issue Price) regardless of whether they are called by the Company, put back to the Company by the holders, or redeemed on September 13, 2027. The Series A Preferred Stock is liability classified and presented within Non-Current liabilities, as Preferred Stock Liability and Put Option Liabilityon the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nOn September 17, 2024, the holders of all of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock entered into waivers to irrevocably and unconditionally waive (and consent to such waivers for purposes of Section 12 of the Certificate of Designations) the rights of the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, (i) pursuant to the Certificate of Designations, (a) to elect to receive shares of Common Stock or pre-funded warrants to purchase Common Stock in connection with redemption events under the Certificate of Designations, (b) to elect to receive additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock on return payment dates, and (c) to receive return payments on the first three quarterly return payment dates within each one-year period following the issue date and to instead receive such return payments on the fourth quarterly return payment date within each one-year period following the issue date, such that each holder of Series A Preferred Stock shall receive return payments for the entire one-year period preceding each such fourth quarterly return payment date, and (ii) pursuant to the Subscription Agreements, to require the Company to register the shares of Common Stock issuable upon redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock on a registration statement filed by the Company.\n\n23\n\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\n\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — CONTINUED\n\n(Unaudited)\n\nNOTE 5 - EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION\n\n2021 Equity Incentive Plan\n\nOn March 17, 2021, our stockholders approved the PureCycle Technologies, Inc. 2021 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan (the “Plan”).\n\nThe Plan provides for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted stock, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), performance shares, performance units, dividend equivalents, and certain other awards.

Each whole warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase one whole share of the Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per share at the later of the closing of the Business Combination or one year after ROCH’s initial public offering, provided that the Company has an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating to them is available and such shares are registered, qualified or exempt from registration under the securities, or blue sky, laws of the state of residence of the holder. The warrants will expire five years after March 17, 2021, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. The private warrants are identical to the public warrants, except that the private warrants and the common stock issuable upon exercise of the private warrants were not transferable, assignable or salable until after March 17, 2021, subject to certain limited exceptions. Additionally, the private warrants are non-redeemable so long as they are held by the initial holder or any of its permitted transferees. If the private warrants are held by someone other than the initial holder or its permitted transferees, the private warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the public warrants.\n\nThe Company may redeem the outstanding warrants in whole, but not in part, at a price of $0.01 per warrant upon a minimum of 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption, if and only if the last sale price of the Common Stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share for any 20-trading days within a 30-trading day period ending three business days before the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders. If the Company calls the warrants for redemption, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the warrants to do so on a cashless basis. In no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the warrant exercise. The public warrants are accounted for as equity classified warrants as they were determined to be indexed to the Company’s stock and meet the requirements for equity classification.\n\nThe Company has classified the private warrants as a warrant liability as there is a provision within the warrant agreement that allows for private warrants to be exercised via a cashless exercise while held by CR Financial Holdings, Inc. (the “Sponsor”) and affiliates of the Sponsor, but would not be exercisable at any time on a cashless basis if transferred and held by another investor. Therefore, the Company will classify the private warrants as a liability pursuant to ASC 815 until the private warrants are transferred from the initial purchasers or any of their permitted transferees.\n\nThere were approximately 5.7 million public warrants and 0.2 million private placement warrants outstanding at September 30, 2024 and 2023.

The Company has determined this provision introduces leverage to the holders of the Series A Warrants that could result in a value that would be greater than the settlement amount of a fixed-for-fixed option on the Company’s own equity shares. Therefore, the Company will classify the Series A Warrants as a liability pursuant to ASC 815.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, there were approximately17.9million Series A Warrants outstanding.

The Company has determined this provision introduces leverage to the holders of the Series B Warrants that could result in a value that would be greater than the settlement amount of a fixed-for-fixed option on the Company’s own equity shares. Therefore, the Company will classify the Series B Warrants as a liability pursuant to ASC 815.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, there were approximately3.1 million Series B Warrants outstanding.

The Series C Warrants are exercisable from September 13, 2024, until they expire on December 1, 2030. Each warrant is exercisable at a price per share of Common Stock of $11.50, subject to adjustment for splits, dividends, recapitalizations and other similar events.\n\nAt any time following January 1, 2029, the Company may redeem the outstanding Series C Warrants in whole, but not in part, at a price of $0.01 per warrant, if and only if the last sales price of the Common Stock has been equal to or greater than $22.00 per share (subject to adjustment for splits, dividends, recapitalizations and other similar events) for any twenty (20) trading days within a thirty (30) trading day period.\n\nThe Series C Warrant provides for a Black-Scholes Value in the event of Fundamental Transactions, which includes a floor on volatility utilized in the value calculation at 100% or greater. The Company has determined this provision introduces leverage to the holders of the Series C Warrants that could result in a value that would be greater than the settlement amount of a fixed-for-fixed option on the Company’s own equity shares. Therefore, the Company will classify the Series C Warrants as a liability pursuant to ASC 815.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, there were 5.0 million Series C Warrants issued and outstanding.

The two-class method requires income available to common stockholders for the period to be allocated between common and participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income for the period had been distributed. The two-class method also requires losses for the period to be allocated between common and participating securities based on their respective rights if the participating security contractually participates in losses. As holders of participating securities do not have a contractual obligation to fund losses, undistributed net losses are not allocated to nonvested restricted stock for purposes of the loss per share calculation.\n\n29\n\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\n\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — CONTINUED\n\n(Unaudited)\n\nPresented in the table below is a reconciliation of the basic and diluted EPS calculations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands except per share data):\n\nThree Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \nNet (loss) income attributable to PCT | $ | (90,639 | ) | $ | 8,530 | $ | (224,458 | ) | $ | (72,680 | )  \nLess income attributable to participating warrants | — | (480 | ) | — | —  \nNet (loss) income attributable to common stockholders | $ | (90,639 | ) | $ | 8,050 | $ | (224,458 | ) | $ | (72,680 | )  \nWeighted average common stock outstanding, basic | 166,513 | 164,018 | 165,224 | 163,783  \nNet (loss) income per share attributable to common stockholder, basic | $ | (0.54 | ) | $ | 0.05 | $ | (1.36 | ) | $ | (0.44 | )  \nThree Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \nNet (loss) income attributable to PCT | $ | (90,639 | ) | $ | 8,530 | $ | (224,458 | ) | $ | (72,680 | )  \nLess change in fair value of RTI Warrants | — | (4,049 | ) | — | (1,485 | )  \nAdd interest and amortization on Green Convertible Notes | — | (81 | ) | — | —  \nNet (loss) income attributable to common stockholders | $ | (90,639 | ) | $ | 4,400 | $ | (224,458 | ) | $ | (74,165 | )  \nWeighted average common stock outstanding, basic | 166,513 | 164,018 | 165,224 | 163,783  \nAdd common equivalent shares from warrants | — | 395 | — | 197  \nAdd common equivalent shares from equity awards | — | 1,135 | — | —  \nWeighted average common shares outstanding, diluted | 166,513 | 165,548 | 165,224 | 163,980  \nNet (loss) income per share attributable to common stockholder, diluted | $ | (0.54 | ) | $ | 0.03 | $ | (1.36 | ) | $ | (0.45 | )  \n  \nCertain outstanding Common Stock equivalents were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders for the periods presented as including them would have been anti-dilutive.

As a result, for the periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company has reported tax expense of $0 and $0, respectively.\n\nManagement has evaluated the Company’s tax positions and has determined that the Company has taken no uncertain tax positions that require adjustment to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the respective periods.\n\n31\n\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\n\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — CONTINUED\n\n(Unaudited)\n\nNOTE 10 – FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and sets out a fair value hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). Inputs are broadly defined as assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. Assets and liabilities carried at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:\n\nLevel 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.\n\nLevel 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, and fair value is determined through the use of models or other valuation methodologies\n\nLevel 3 - Inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. The inputs into the determination of fair value are based upon the best information in the circumstances and may require significant management judgment or estimation.\n\nAssets and liabilities measured and recorded at Fair Value on a recurring basis\n\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company’s financial assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis were classified within the fair value hierarchy as follows (in thousands):\n\nSeptember 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nLevel 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Total | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Total  \nAssets  \nCash equivalents | $ | 77,533 | $ | — | $ | — | $ | 77,533 | $ | 36,277 | $ | 35,215 | $ | — | $ | 71,492  \nRestricted cash equivalents - current | 241 | — | — | 241 | 25,692 | — | — | 25,692  \nRestricted cash equivalents - noncurrent | 9,739 | — | — | 9,739 | 203,411 | — | — | 203,411  \nInvestments:  \nCommercial paper, available for sale | — | — | — | — | — | 46,049 | — | 46,049  \nUS Treasury Notes | — | — | — | — | 2,177 | — | — | 2,177  \nTotal investments | $ | — | $ | — | $ | — | $ | — | $ | 2,177 | $ | 46,049 | $ | — | $ | 48,226  \nLiabilities  \nWarrant liability:  \nRTI warrants | — | — | 9,051 | 9,051 | — | — | 1,437 | 1,437  \nPrivate warrants | — | — | 672 | 672 | — | — | 265 | 265  \nSeries A warrants | — | 53,566 | — | 53,566 | — | 20,357 | — | 20,357  \nSeries B warrants | — | — | 17,404 | 17,404 | — | — | — | —  \nSeries C warrants | — | — | 32,750 | 32,750 | — | — | — | —  \nTotal warrant liability | $ | — | $ | 53,566 | $ | 59,877 | $ | 113,443 | $ | — | $ | 20,357 | $ | 1,702 | $ | 22,059  \n  \n32\n\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\n\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — CONTINUED\n\n(Unaudited)\n\nFor the instruments classified as level 3 (discussed further below), significant changes in any of the significant unobservable inputs in isolation would not result in a materially different fair value estimate. However, since each of instruments classified as level 3 are being valued using similar inputs, a significant change that would impact expected volatility or the market price of PCT's Common Stock could result in a material change to the total combined value of these instruments. An increase in one or both of these inputs would result in a higher assessed value for each instrument.\n\nMeasurement of the Private Warrants\n\nThe private warrants are measured at fair value on a recurring basis using a Black-Scholes model. The private warrants are classified as Level 3 and were valued using the following assumptions:\n\nSeptember 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nExpected annual dividend yield | — |  % | — |  %  \nExpected volatility | 85.10 |  % | 100.20 | %  \nRisk-free rate of return | 3.79 |  % | 4.10 | %  \nExpected option term (years) | 1.47 | 2.20  \n  \nThe expected term of the warrants granted is determined based on the duration of time the warrants are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The expected volatility is based on the implied volatility calculated for the Company’s public warrants, which have similar characteristics to the private warrants. The dividend yield on the Company’s warrants is assumed to be zero as the Company has not historically paid dividends. The fair value of the underlying Company shares was determined using the Black-Scholes calculation.\n\nThe aggregate values of the private warrants were $0.7 million and $0.3 million on September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n\nA summary of the private warrants activity from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 is as follows (in thousands):\n\nFair value(Level 3)  \n---  \nBalance, December 31, 2023 | $ | 265  \nChange in fair value | 407  \nBalance, September 30, 2024 | $ | 672  \n  \nRefer to Note 6 – Warrants for further information.\n\nMeasurement of the RTI warrants\n\nThe Company has determined the RTI warrants to be a Level 3 fair value measurement and has remeasured using a Binomial Tree option pricing model to calculate its fair value using the following assumptions:\n\nSeptember 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nExpected annual dividend yield | — |  % | — |  %  \nExpected volatility | 105.10 |  % | 118.10 |  %  \nRisk-free rate of return | 4.67 |  % | 4.70 |  %  \nExpected option term (years) | 0.25 | 1.00  \n  \n33\n\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\n\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — CONTINUED\n\n(Unaudited)\n\nThe expected term of the warrants granted is determined based on the duration of time the warrants are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The expected volatility is calculated based on the specific volatility of PCT’s publicly-traded Common Stock. In determining similar entities, the Company considered industry, stage of life cycle, size and financial leverage. The dividend yield on the Company’s warrants is assumed to be zero as the Company has not historically paid dividends. The fair value of the underlying Company shares was determined using the Binomial Tree model calculation.\n\nThe Company has an option to repurchase the warrants at any time. The maximum fair value of the warrants is limited by the fair value of the repurchase option, which cannot exceed $15.0 million.\n\nChanges in Level 3 liabilities measured at fair value from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 are as follows (in thousands):\n\nFair value(Level 3)  \n---  \nBalance, December 31, 2023 | $ | 1,437  \nChange in fair value | 7,614  \nBalance, September 30, 2024 | $ | 9,051  \n  \nMeasurement of the Series A Warrants\n\nThe Series A Warrants meet the definition of derivative instruments and are measured at fair value on a recurring basis using the market price of the Company’s publicly traded warrants, with changes in fair value recorded in current earnings. The Company has determined the publicly traded warrants to be an appropriate proxy to value the Series A Warrants as both warrants have similar redemption features and the same exercise price. The Series A Warrants are classified as Level 2 for both initial measurement at issuance and subsequent measurement each period.\n\nMeasurement of the Series B Warrants\n\nThe Series B Warrants meet the definition of derivative instruments and are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The Company has determined the Series B Warrants to be a Level 3 fair value measurement and has performed initial recognition and ongoing remeasurement using a Monte Carlo simulation to calculate its fair value using the following assumptions:\n\nSeptember 30, 2024 | May 10, 2024  \n---|---  \nExpected annual dividend yield | — |  % | — |  %  \nExpected volatility | 85.10 |  % | 99.30 |  %  \nRisk-free rate of return | 3.60 |  % | 4.46 |  %  \nExpected option term (years) | 6.17 | 6.56  \n  \nThe expected term of the warrants granted is determined based on the duration of time the warrants are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the valuation date. The expected volatility is based on the implied volatility calculated for the Company’s public warrants, which have similar characteristics to the Series B Warrants. The dividend yield on the Company’s warrants is assumed to be zero as the Company has not historically paid dividends.

The Company records debt at cost.\n\nNOTE 11 - AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS\n\nThe Company classifies its investments in debt securities as available-for-sale. Debt securities have been historically comprised of highly liquid investments with minimum “A” rated securities. The debt securities have historically been reported at fair value with unrealized gains or losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

The Company considers factors such as the duration, severity and the reason for the decline in value, the potential recovery period and our intent to sell. For debt securities, we also consider whether (i) it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the debt securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis and (ii) the amortized cost basis cannot be recovered as a result of credit losses. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not recognize any other-than-temporary impairment losses. All marketable securities with unrealized losses have been in a loss position for less than twelve months, and the Company does not anticipate any material losses upon maturity of these investments. The fair value for fixed-rate debt securities is based on quoted market prices for the same or similar debt instruments and is classified as Level 2. The fair value for the Company's other securities holdings, primarily under commercial paper, equals the carrying value and is classified as Level 2.\n\n36\n\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\n\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — CONTINUED\n\n(Unaudited)\n\nNOTE 12 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\n\nFinancial Assurance\n\nOn March 14, 2024, PCT renewed a surety bond in the amount of $25.0 million to provide financial assurance related to its performance under a certain vendor contract, which expires at the earlier of satisfaction of the obligation, termination of the related vendor contract, or one year from issuance (subject to renewal within one year). Effective July 1, 2024, the amount was increased from $25.0 million to $45.9 million. Effective October 3, 2024, the amount was decreased from $45.9 million to $8.1 million as a result of PCT funding a restricted escrow account.\n\nThese financial instruments are issued in the normal course of business and are not considered company indebtedness. Because PCT currently has no liability for these financial assurance instruments, they are not reflected in its consolidated balance sheets.\n\nLegal Proceedings\n\nPCT is subject to legal and regulatory actions that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. The assessment as to whether a loss is probable or reasonably possible, and as to whether such loss or a range of such losses is estimable, often involves significant judgment about future events, and the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. Other than as described below, there is no material pending or threatened litigation against PCT that remains outstanding as of September 30, 2024.\n\nShareholder Securities Litigation\n\nBeginning on or about May 11, 2021, two putative class action complaints were filed against PCT, certain senior members of management and others, asserting violations of federal securities laws under Section 10(b) and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The complaints generally allege that the applicable defendants made false and/or misleading statements in press releases and public filings regarding the Technology, PCT’s business and PCT’s prospects. The first putative class action complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida by William C. Theodore against PCT and certain senior members of management (the “Initial Theodore Lawsuit”). The second putative class action complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida by David Tennenbaum against PCT, certain senior members of management and others (the “Tennenbaum Lawsuit”). On July 14, 2021, the court granted a motion to consolidate the Initial Theodore and Tennenbaum Lawsuits (consolidated as the “Consolidated Theodore Lawsuit”) and on July 27, 2021, Tennenbaum filed a motion to voluntarily dismiss his complaint without prejudice. On August 5, 2021, the Court entered an order appointing Mariusz Ciecko and Robert Ciecko as Co-Lead Plaintiffs (“Lead Plaintiffs”) and Pomerantz LLP as Lead Counsel.\n\nOn April 2, 2024, the Company reached a tentative settlement of the Consolidated Theodore Lawsuit (the “Securities Settlement”), which was memorialized in a Stipulation of Settlement dated May 6, 2024. Under the terms of the Securities Settlement, all known and unknown claims shall be settled for $12 million in exchange for a complete release of the Company and the individually named defendants in each of the referenced matters. The Securities Settlement shall be funded by the remainder of the Company’s self-insured retention under its directors and officers liability insurance policies applicable to the claims (“D&O Insurance”) and contributions by various carriers comprising part of the D&O Insurance tower available to the Company and defendants. On October 8, 2024, the Court entered a final order approving the Securities Settlement and resolving the Consolidated Theodore Lawsuit.\n\nOn September 29, 2023, Jay Southgate, a purported shareholder, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against PCT, and certain senior members of management (“Individual Southgate\n\n37\n\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\n\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — CONTINUED\n\n(Unaudited)\n\nDefendants”), asserting violations of federal securities laws under Section 10(b) and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act (the \"Southgate Lawsuit\"). The complaints generally allege that the applicable defendants made false and/or misleading statements in press releases and public filings between August 8, 2023 and September 13, 2023, regarding the status of commissioning activities at the Ironton Facility, and specifically the impact of a power outage at the Ironton Facility in August 2023 and subsequent seal system failure in September 2023. Purported shareholders filed motions to be appointed lead plaintiff in the action, and on February 20, 2024, the Court appointed James Smith as Lead Plaintiff and Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP as Lead Counsel.\n\nOn April 5, 2024, plaintiffs in the Southgate matter filed an amended complaint (“Amended Southgate Complaint”), in which the plaintiffs allege the Company and the Individual Southgate Defendants violated Section 10(b) and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The Amended Southgate Complaint alleges that beginning in April 2023 through December 2023, the Company and the Individual Southgate Defendants made misleading and inaccurate statements and omissions regarding the operations at the Ironton Facility,PCT’s ability to meet certain milestones and alleged issues with certain third-party contractors. On May 6, 2024, the Company and the Individual Southgate Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Southgate complaint. On June 5, 2024, plaintiffs filed their brief in opposition to the Company and Individual Southgate Defendants' motion to dismiss. On June 5, 2024, the Company and the Individual Southgate Defendants filed a reply to the plaintiffs' brief. On November 12, 2024, the court will hear oral arguments on the Company and Individual Southgate Defendants' motion to dismiss.\n\nPCT, the PCT Defendants and the Individual Southgate Defendants intend to vigorously defend against the Amended Southgate Complaint. Given the stage of the litigation, PCT cannot reasonably estimate at this time whether there will be any loss, or if there is a loss, the possible range of loss, that may arise from the Southgate Lawsuit.\n\nHan, Ayers, and Brunson Derivative Litigation\n\nOn November 3, 2021, Byung-Gook Han, a purported PCT shareholder, derivatively and purportedly on behalf of PCT, filed a shareholder derivative action in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (Byung-Gook Han v. Otworth et. al., Case No. 1:21-cv-01569-UNA) against certain senior members of PCT’s management, PCT’s directors and Byron Roth, who was subsequently dismissed (collectively, the “Individual Han Defendants”), alleging violations of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act and breaches of fiduciary duties and bringing claims for unjust enrichment and waste of corporate assets (“Han Derivative Lawsuit\"). On January 19, 2022, the court granted the parties’ joint stipulation to stay the Han Derivative Lawsuit and administratively closed the matter pending the disposition of the motions to dismiss the Consolidated Theodore Lawsuit.\n\nOn January 27, 2022, Patrick Ayers, a purported PCT shareholder, derivatively and purportedly on behalf of PCT, filed a shareholder derivative action in the United States District Court of the District of Delaware, captioned Patrick Ayers v. Otworth et. al., Case No. 1:22-cv-00110, against certain members of PCT’s management, PCT’s directors and others (collectively, the “Individual Ayers Defendants”), alleging violations of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act and breaches of fiduciary duties, as well as claims for unjust enrichment, gross mismanagement, contribution, and indemnification (“Ayers Derivative Lawsuit\").\n\nOn March 17, 2022, the court granted the parties’ joint stipulation to stay the Ayers Derivative Lawsuit and administratively closed the matter pending the disposition of the motions to dismiss the Consolidated Theodore Lawsuit.\n\nAfter the court in the Consolidated Theodore Lawsuit ruled on the second motion to dismiss, the stay in the derivative actions was lifted. Ayers and Han (collectively the “Derivative Plaintiffs”), PCT and the Individual Ayers and Han Defendants (collectively, the “Individual Derivative Defendants”) filed a joint stipulation to consolidate the\n\n38\n\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\n\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — CONTINUED\n\n(Unaudited)\n\nrelated derivative actions on June 26, 2023. The court granted the motion to consolidate the derivative actions on June 27, 2023, and ordered the Consolidated Derivative Action to be captioned In re: PureCycle Technologies, Inc. Derivative Litigation, Lead Case No. 21-1569-RGA (D. Del.) (“Consolidated Derivative Litigation”). In light of the Motion for Reconsideration in the Consolidated Theodore Lawsuit, the Derivative Plaintiffs, PCT, and Individual Derivative Defendants filed a joint stipulation to continue the stay of the Consolidated Derivative Litigation until thirty days after the court in the Class Action rules on the Motion for Reconsideration. The Motion for Reconsideration in the Consolidated Theodore Lawsuit remains pending.\n\nOn February 23, 2024, Ayers filed an amended derivative complaint under seal. The Consolidated Amended Derivative Complaint generally alleges that the Individual Derivative Defendants made materially false and misleading statements and omissions in press releases, webinars and other public filings regarding PCT’s business, the technology, PCT’s prospects, the background and experience of the Individual Derivative Defendants, PCT’s internal controls, and various production issues and delays. The Consolidated Amended Derivative Complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages, reform of the corporate governance and internal procedures, unspecified restitution from the Individual Han Defendants, and costs and fees associated with bringing the action. At this stage of the litigation, neither PCT nor the Individual Ayers Defendants have answered the Consolidated Amended Derivative Complaint, moved to dismiss the complaint, or otherwise responded to the complaint.\n\nOn March 29, 2024, John Brunson, a purported PCT shareholder, and on behalf of whom the February 2023 Delaware 220 demand referenced below was issued to the Company, derivatively and purportedly on behalf of PCT, filed a shareholder derivative action under seal in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware, captioned John Brunson v. Otworth et. al., against certain members of PCT’s management, PCT’s directors and others (collectively, the “Individual Brunson Defendants”), alleging breaches of fiduciary duties, aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duty, corporate waste, and unjust enrichment (“Brunson Derivative Lawsuit\"). The Brunson Derivative Lawsuit generally contains similar allegations as contained in Consolidated Derivative Amended Derivative Complaint, as well as allegations regarding undisclosed operational risks, production issues and delays, persistent failure to remediate known material deficiencies, including inadequate staffing, lack of segregation of duties, unfamiliarity with financial reporting requirements, and lack of accounting resources, leading to revisions of prior financial statements. The Brunson Derivative Lawsuit also references two reports by Bleeker Street Research in November 2023 which alleged that the Company had misled investors about the launch of the Ironton Facility, and would not meet its production targets. Plaintiffs also point to and discuss the Theodore Securities Class Action and the Southgate Amended Complaint and allege that PCT is exposed to liability in those cases. The Brunson Derivative Lawsuit seeks unspecified monetary damages, declaratory relief, unspecified disgorgement and restitution from the Individual Brunson Defendants, and costs and fees associated with bringing the action.\n\nOn May 7, 2024, the Company entered into a memorandum of understanding agreement to settle the Ayers Derivative Lawsuit, the Brunson Derivative Lawsuit and certain shareholder demand letters described below under the heading Other Matters (the “Settling Demand Letters”), including demands under Delaware Code Section 220 and/or investigation demands (the “Derivative Settlement”). On July 17, 2024, the parties executed a Stipulation of Settlement. Under the proposed terms of the Stipulation in the Derivative Settlement, all claims shall be settled in exchange for certain corporate therapeutics and a monetary component of $3 million, out of which plaintiffs’ counsel intend to seek up to $1.75 million in attorneys’ fees (as approved by the Court), in exchange for a complete release of all claims, known or unknown, that have been or could have been asserted in the Ayers Derivative Lawsuit, the Brunson Lawsuit, the Settling Demand Letters, or in any other forum by any current PureCycle stockholders derivatively on behalf of PureCycle. Carriers comprising part of the D&O insurance tower will contribute $3 million of applicable policy limits to fund the monetary component of the Derivative Settlement. On July 31, 2024, the lead plaintiff in the Ayers Derivative Lawsuit filed a Motion for Preliminary Approval of the Derivative Settlement, which is pending before the court. The Derivative Settlement, including the amount of attorneys’ fees awarded, is subject to\n\n39\n\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\n\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — CONTINUED\n\n(Unaudited)\n\ncourt approval. In the future, PCT may become party to additional legal matters and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. While PCT is unable to predict the outcome of the above or future matters, it does not believe, based upon currently available facts, that the ultimate resolution of any such pending matters will have a material adverse effect on its overall financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\nDenham-Blythe Arbitration\n\nOn October 7, 2020, PCO, a subsidiary of PCT and Denham-Blythe Company, Inc. (“DB”) executed an Engineering, Procurement, and Construction Agreement for certain construction activities associated with the Ironton Facility (“EPC Contract”).\n\nOn June 16, 2023, following unsuccessful efforts at mediating various disputes over certain unapproved change orders and payment applications, DB filed a demand for binding arbitration (“Arbitration Demand”) with the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), seeking approximately $17.0 million related to certain fee applications, change orders and amounts currently held in retainage by PCO, and, on June 21, 2023, filed a mechanics lien in Lawrence County, Ohio for the same sum. On July 20, 2023, PCO filed its Answer and Counterclaim, in which PCO contends that various deficiencies in DB’s work resulted in damages to PCO in excess of DB’s $17.0 million Arbitration Demand, including, but not limited to, the following: DB’s insufficient and incomplete engineering drawings and packages, insufficient and unorganized material management, insufficient and inefficient contractor management, insufficient and rudimentary schedule management, incomplete and inefficient procurement procedures, and that the Company was required to undertake significant re-work at additional cost resulting from DB’s failure to adequately perform its obligations under the EPC Contract. On September 14, 2023, DB filed a motion with the AAA seeking to join ThermalTech Engineering, Inc., and ThermalTech Turnkey Solutions LLC, a subcontractor engaged by DB to provide engineering services for the Ironton Project. PCO and ThermalTech Engineering, Inc. have objected to the joinder and the matter remains pending.\n\nOn August 30, 2023, DB filed a breach of contract claim against PCO and others in Lawrence County Ohio, alleging the same facts contained in its arbitration demand, as well as an action to foreclose on a lien filed in Lawrence County, Ohio. Concurrently DB requested the complaint be stayed pending the resolution of all issues in the arbitration. On December 12, 2023, defendant UMB Bank, N.A. (“UMB”) filed an Answer and Counterclaim against DB. On January 9, 2024, the Lawrence County Court granted DB’s request for a stay of the lawsuit pending the resolution of the arbitration proceeding.\n\nOn March 8, 2024, ISC Constructors, a DB subcontractor, filed an action in equity for unjust enrichment against PCO in Lawrence Co. Ohio Case # 240C000171. The lawsuit alleges $526,007.48 in unpaid invoices and retainage. An arbitration claim for breach of contract, for the same amount, was filed by ISC Constructors in the AAA against DB. That arbitration action has been consolidated with the AAA arbitration between PCO and DB listed above. Recently PCO moved to stay the ISC lawsuit and consolidate it with the DB lawsuit which is currently stayed.\n\nPCO intends to vigorously defend itself against DB’s claims and to pursue recovery of damages resulting from DB’s failure to perform adequately under the EPC Contract. Given the stage of the arbitration, PCT cannot reasonably estimate at this time whether there will be any loss, or if there is a loss, the possible range of loss, that may result from the Arbitration Demand.\n\nOther Matters\n\nOn February 3, 2023, the Company received a books and records demand pursuant to Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, from a purported stockholder of the Company, in connection with the stockholder’s\n\n40\n\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\n\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — CONTINUED\n\n(Unaudited)\n\ninvestigation of, among other matters, potential breaches of fiduciary duty, mismanagement, self-dealing, corporate waste or other violations of law by the Company’s Board with respect to these matters.\n\nOn October 6, 2023 and October 27, 2023, the Company received two additional books and records demands pursuant to Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, from two purported stockholders of the Company, in connection with the stockholders’ investigation of, among other matters, potential breaches of fiduciary duty, mismanagement, self-dealing, corporate waste or other violations of law by the Company’s Board with respect to these matters.  On February 5, 2024, and February 23, 2024, the Company received two additional demand letters demanding that the Company initiate legal action against its officers, directors, or members of senior management for their alleged breach of fiduciary duties and take remedial measures for damages from alleged unjust enrichment and corporate waste. Collectively, the February 3, 2023, October 6, 2023, October 27, 2023, February 5, 2024, and February 23, 2024 demand letters shall be referred to as the “Demand Letters”. The claims asserted in the Demand Letters are included as part of the Derivative Settlement.\n\nOn April 25, 2024, the Company received a litigation demand letter from a purported shareholder, Selim Piot, requesting that the Board take action against certain officers and directors. On May 6, 2024, Mr. Piot served a books and records demand and initiated a derivative action in the Chancery Court of Delaware captioned Piot v. Bouck, et al., No. 2024-0475-NAC (Del. Ch.). On May 21, 2024, Mr. Piot served another books and records demand. The claims asserted in Mr. Piot’s demand letters and derivative action are substantially similar to those asserted in the Ayers and Brunson Derivative Lawsuits and the Demand Letters. We are currently unable to predict the outcome of this matter.\n\nNOTE 13 - LEASES\n\nOn May 14, 2024, the Company sublet the leased space that previously housed its corporate headquarters in Orlando, FL and will have no further involvement in that property. The Company recognized a $0.8 million impairment on the related right-of-use asset for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which is recorded in other expense in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.\n\nIn October 2024, the Company commenced a real estate lease in Denver, Pennsylvania, where it began operations of a Feed PreP facility. The lease agreement, with an initial term of 15 years and total minimum lease payments of $52.3 million, is subject to 3% to 3.5% annual escalations.\n\nNOTE 14 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\n\nIn connection with the preparation of the condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the period ended September 30, 2024, management has evaluated events through November 15, 2024 to determine whether any events required recognition or disclosure in the condensed consolidated interim financial statements. The following subsequent events were identified through the date of these condensed consolidated interim financial statements:\n\nEffective October 3, 2024, PCT decreased an outstanding surety bond from $45.9 million to $8.1 million as a result of PCT funding a restricted escrow account in its place.\n\nIn October 2024, PCT commenced the Denver, Pennsylvania lease. See Note 13 - Leases for additional information.\n\nOn October 25, 2024, SOPA, as Issuer, PCO, the Guarantor, PCTO Holdco and the Trustee entered into the Sixth Supplemental Indenture which amended certain provisions of the Indenture and Loan Agreement. See Note 3 - Notes Payable and Debt Instruments for additional information.\n\n41\n\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\n\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe following discussion and analysis provides information which PCT’s management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of PCT’s condensed consolidated results of operations and financial condition. The discussion should be read together with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements, together with related notes thereto, included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under “Risk Factors” in the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” to “we,” “us,” “our,” and “the Company” are intended to mean the business and operations of PCT and its consolidated subsidiaries.\n\nOverview\n\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc. (“PCT” or “Company”) is a Florida-based corporation focused on commercializing a patented purification recycling technology (the “Technology”), originally developed by The Procter & Gamble Company (“P&G”), for restoring waste polypropylene into resin, called ultra-pure recycled (“UPR”) resin, which has nearly identical properties and applicability for reuse as virgin polypropylene. PCT has a global license for the Technology from P&G. PCT’s goal is to create an important new segment of the global polypropylene market that will assist multinational entities in meeting their sustainability goals, providing consumers with polypropylene-based products that are sustainable, and reducing overall polypropylene waste in the world’s landfills and oceans.\n\nPCT’s process includes two steps: Feed Pre-Processing (“Feed PreP”) and the use of PCT’s recycling technology for purification. The Feed PreP step will collect, sort, and prepare polypropylene waste (“feedstock”) for purification. The purification step is a purification recycling process that uses a combination of solvent, temperature, and pressure to return the feedstock to near-virgin condition through a novel configuration of commercially available equipment and unit operations. The purification process puts the plastic through a physical extraction process using super critical fluids that both extract and filter out contaminants and purify the color, opacity, and odor of the plastic without changing the bonds of the polymer. By not altering the chemical makeup of the polymer, the Company is able to use significantly less energy and reduce production costs as compared to virgin resin.\n\nThe Ironton Facility\n\nPCT commenced commissioning activities at its first commercial-scale plant in Lawrence County, Ohio (referred to herein as the “Ironton Facility”), in April 2023, achieved mechanical completion of the plant and commenced pellet production from post-industrial and post-consumer materials later in 2023. The Ironton Facility leverages the existing infrastructure of PCT’s pilot facility known as the Feedstock Evaluation Unit, which became operational in 2019, and the Ironton Facility is expected to have UPR resin capacity of approximately 107 million pounds per year when fully operational. Through the first nine months of 2024, PCT has not yet reached meaningful production volumes, sales, or production of on-spec product. Currently, PCT is focused on customer sampling and qualifications and believes that this will lead to meaningful future sales. Also, during the third quarter, the Company initiated compounding operations to blend its resin with either post-industrial recycled material or virgin polypropylene, which is expected to improve product consistency and accelerate the product delivery to customers.\n\n42\n\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\n\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — CONTINUED\n\nPCT has experienced intermittent mechanical challenges during the commissioning process including, but not limited to, limits in the rates at which certain contaminants can currently be removed from the purification process, as well as challenges with sustaining continuous operations. Recently, PCT has been focused on the recovery and removal of polyethylene and other solids (“CP2”), which impacts the ability to run higher volumes and produce consistent, high quality UPR resin. PCT has modified the CP2 removal system to remove higher volumes of CP2 more quickly and believes these changes enable us to produce higher volumes of on-spec product. The Company is currently testing the system improvements at various operating conditions to validate the new limits.\n\nThe Augusta Facility\n\nIn July 2021, PCT reached an agreement with The Augusta Economic Development Authority (“AEDA”) to build its first U.S. facility with multiple lines for both Feed PreP and purification in Augusta, Georgia (the “Augusta Facility”). PCT expects the approximately 200-acre location to eventually include up to eight production lines, which are expected to collectively have UPR resin production capacity of approximately 1 billion pounds per year. When fully operational, each purification line at the Augusta Facility is expected to have annual production capacity of approximately 130 million pounds of PCT’s UPR resin. PureCycle has allocated 40% of the Augusta Facility output, for Lines 1 and 2, to existing customers and expects that additional offtake agreements will continue to be negotiated.\n\nOn June 30, 2023, PCT and the AEDA executed an Economic Development Agreement (“EDA”) related to the Company’s plans to construct the Augusta Facility. Pursuant to the EDA, PCT expects to receive certain property tax abatement benefits as well as certain other incentives, including site infrastructure development assistance (“Incentive Benefits”). In order to receive the Incentive Benefits under Phase One (as defined below) of the Augusta Project (as defined below), PCT will be obligated to create 82 full-time jobs with investments of at least $440 million no later than December 31, 2026. Through September 30, 2024, PCT has invested approximately $95.9 million for pre-construction engineering and long-lead equipment for the benefit of Phase One investments. If PCT elects to activate the second phase of the Augusta Project, PCT will be required to create an additional 25 full-time jobs and investments of $295 million no later than December 31, 2028. To the extent PCT fails to achieve an average of 80% of the jobs and investment commitments in any year over the 20-years of each phase, PCT will be required to make a repayment to the AEDA of a pro rata portion of the total value of the Incentive Benefits received by PCT in such year.\n\nAlso on June 30, 2023, PCT entered into a series of agreements with the AEDA to construct phase one (“Phase One”) of the Augusta Facility. PCT is leasing 150 acres of land (“Real Property”) owned by the AEDA and will construct buildings, building equipment, and other structures (the “Improvements”) on the land. PCT will also acquire and install the necessary processing, warehousing, and other equipment, as well as conveyors and pipelines (the “Equipment”, together with the Real Property and the Improvements, the “Augusta Project”). The Improvements and Equipment will be transferred to the AEDA and leased back by PCT. As noted above, PCT anticipates that the first portion of Phase One will consist of one purification line and construction, which were commenced prior to the end of 2023. Also as noted above, construction of the first purification line must be completed by December 31, 2026.\n\nThe legal sale-leaseback structure provides the Incentive Benefits to PCT as lessee of the Augusta Project. PCT will remain the owner of the Improvements and Equipment for accounting purposes during the term of the lease as PCT will have the right to acquire title to the Augusta Project for a nominal amount during the term and at the conclusion of the arrangement, which has an initial expiration date in 2044. The payments PCT makes to the AEDA during the term of the arrangement are not otherwise expected to be material.\n\nAt the end of 2023, the Company commenced site preparation activities, including debris removal and site stabilization activities, and continued with payments to vendors for certain long lead-time equipment. Pursuant to\n\n43\n\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\n\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — CONTINUED\n\nthe EDA, PCT must also show continuous construction progress, with regard to the first purification line under the first phase of the Augusta Project during 2024 or risk losing certain future Incentive Benefits. While the Company believes it has satisfied the contractual obligations regarding financing and construction of Phase One to date, the AEDA believes that it could seek to terminate the lease if PCT does not demonstrate further progress on Phase One. Market conditions remain challenging and have created uncertainty as to the timing or likelihood of success of the currently anticipated project financing for the Augusta Facility. As a result, PCT is currently pursuing various structures for project financing of the Augusta Facility. While PCT remains confident in its ability to finance the Augusta Facility, it is limiting its expenses and adjusting its timeline in light of this uncertainty. If PCT is unable to raise additional debt or equity, when desired, or on terms favorable to PCT, PCT’s business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.\n\nFeedstock Pricing\n\nPCT sees a robust pipeline of demand for its recycled polypropylene and PCT is seeing market acceptance of its “Feedstock+” pricing model for its UPR resin. The “Feedstock+” pricing model divides the market cost of feedstock by a set yield-loss and adds a fixed price, which effectively passes on the cost of feedstock and de-risks PCT’s operating margin volatility.\n\nFor the Ironton Facility, PCT’s feedstock price was linked, in part, to changes in the Chemical Market Analysis, the index for virgin polypropylene, in a price schedule that contained a fixed, collared price around an index price range, which was further adjusted based on the percentage of polypropylene in the feedstock supplied. For the Augusta Facility and future purification facilities, PCT plans to link the feedstock price, in part, to the price of a no. 5 plastic bale of polypropylene as reported by recyclingmarkets.net (“Feedstock Market Pricing”). PCT will procure both feedstock in line with Feedstock Market Pricing as well as low value feedstocks that can be processed by PCT, below Feedstock Market Pricing for the Augusta Facility.\n\nPreP Facilities\n\nIn conjunction with the Augusta Facility, PCT also plans to build and operate Feed PreP facilities in locations geographically near the feed sources to optimize PCT’s supply chain economics. During the third quarter of 2022, PCT experienced challenges obtaining the necessary water and sewer permits to construct its first planned Feed PreP facility in Central Florida. PCT is evaluating its available recourses, including legal requirements and remedies with regard to its obligations for the remaining 8 years of its 11-year lease agreement for the Central Florida facility. PCT is also evaluating alternative preprocessing sites in other locations. Also, in October 2024, PCT commenced operations of a Feed PreP facility in Denver, Pennsylvania. Throughout the second half of 2021, PCT developed a feedstock processing system with advanced sorting capabilities that can handle various types of plastics in addition to polypropylene (designated as no. 5 plastic). PCT’s enhanced sorting should allow PCT to process plastic bales between no. 1 and no. 7. PCT’s new Feed PreP facilities will extract polypropylene and ship it to PCT’s purification lines, while the non-polypropylene feed will be sorted, baled, and subsequently sold on the open market.\n\nLetter of No Objection Submission and the Granting of FDA Food Packaging Clearances for Certain Feedstocks\n\nOn September 10, 2021, PCT filed for a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) Letter of No Objection (“LNO”), for Conditions of Use A – H. Conditions of Use describe the temperature and duration at which a material should be tested to simulate the way the material is intended to be used. Conditions of Use C – H address many consumer product packaging requirements, including applications for hot filled and pasteurized, as well as room temperature, refrigerated and frozen applications. Generally speaking, Conditions of Use A and B relate to extreme temperature applications. The LNO submission also defines the feedstock sources for the Company’s planned commercial recycling process, and this LNO submission pertained to (i) food grade post-industrial recycled feedstocks and (ii) food grade curbside post-consumer recycled feedstocks.\n\n44\n\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\n\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — CONTINUED\n\nThe FDA confirmed receipt of the submission on September 13, 2021 and followed up with additional questions and requests for clarification in a letter received by PCT on January 7, 2022. PCT responded to the FDA’s questions on February 17, 2022.\n\nOn September 6, 2022, PCT received two separate notifications from the FDA with respect to the following two feedstock sources:\n\n(i) Food grade post-industrial recycled feedstocks: an FDA opinion letter approving Conditions of Use A – H and\n\n(ii) Food-grade post-consumer recycled feedstock from stadiums: an FDA LNO for Conditions of Use E – G.\n\nOn June 11, 2024, the Company received an additional LNO from the FDA, which expands upon the previous LNO and allows use of PCT's UPR resin (to the extent made from food grade post-consumer recycled material) in contact with all food types under FDA's Conditions of Use A through H. This expansion provides PCT with the same Conditions of Use for its UPR resin as virgin polypropylene, which span from frozen food storage to microwaveable packaging.\n\nThe Company’s FDA food contact grades are capable of being used for all food types per the conditions of use listed and per all applicable authorizations in the food contact regulations listed in the 21 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21).\n\nThe Company is conducting additional testing and plans to make further LNO submissions for additional post-consumer recycled feedstock sources and expanded Conditions of Use.\n\nFuture Expansion\n\nOn January 17, 2023, the Company announced that its first European purification facility will be in Antwerp, Belgium. On October 20, 2022, the Company executed a Joint Venture Agreement with SK geo centric Co., Ltd. (\"SK\"), to develop a UPR purification facility in Ulsan, South Korea. Effective October 25, 2024, the Company and SK agreed to discontinue the joint venture for a project that was intended to construct and operate a recycled polypropolene purification plan at the SKGC Ulsan site; coordinating multiple independent technologies on a single site proved to be too challenging for the overall project execution. The two sides are open to working together to find an alternative location in South Korea, pursuant to a Heads of Agreement executed in 2022.\n\nThe Company is also planning to expand its production capabilities into Asia through negotiation of a joint venture with Mitsui & Co. Ltd. in Japan for in-country production and sales. Future expansion is dependent on successful completion of project financing.\n\nComponents of Results of Operations\n\nRevenue\n\nPCT generated an immaterial amount of revenue through the first nine months of 2024 and has not yet reached (i) significant continuous operational volumes at the Ironton Facility or (ii) significant revenue generation.\n\n45\n\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\n\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — CONTINUED\n\nOperating Costs\n\nOperating expenses to date have consisted mainly of personnel costs (including wages, salaries and benefits) and other costs directly related to operations at PCT’s operating facilities, including rent, depreciation, repairs and maintenance, utilities and supplies. Costs attributable to the design and development of the Ironton Facility, Augusta Facility, and Feed PreP facilities in Central Florida and Denver, Pennsylvania, are capitalized and, when placed in service, will be depreciated over the expected useful life of the asset. We expect our operating costs to increase as we continue to scale operations and increase headcount.\n\nResearch and Development Expense\n\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs related to the continuous improvement and enhancement of the Technology, the facilities and equipment that will use the Technology to purify recycled polypropylene, and the processes needed to collect, sort, and prepare feedstock for purification. These include mainly personnel costs, depreciation for long-lived assets, third-party consulting costs, and the cost of various recycled waste. We are increasing our in-house feedstock analytical capabilities, which will include additional supporting equipment and personnel.\n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses for our corporate, executive, finance and other administrative functions and professional services, including legal, audit and accounting services. We expect our selling, general, and administrative expenses to increase for the foreseeable future as we scale headcount with the growth of our business, and as a result of operating as a public company, including compliance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), legal, audit, additional insurance expenses, investor relations activities, and other administrative and professional services.\n\nResults of Operations\n\nComparison of three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\n\nThe following table summarizes our operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\n\nThree Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n$ | % | $ | %  \n(in thousands, except %) | 2024 | 2023 | Change | Change | 2024 | 2023 | Change | Change  \nCosts and expenses  \nOperating costs | $ | 16,965 | $ | 17,053 | $ | (88 | ) | (1 | )% | $ | 60,379 | $ | 36,037 | $ | 24,342 | 68 | %  \nResearch and development | 1,544 | 1,592 | (48 | ) | (3 | )% | 4,940 | 4,917 | 23 | 0 | %  \nSelling, general and administrative | 12,789 | 12,958 | (169 | ) | (1 | )% | 44,883 | 39,063 | 5,820 | 15 | %  \nTotal operating costs and expenses | 31,298 | 31,603 | (305 | ) | (1 | )% | 110,202 | 80,017 | 30,185 | 38 | %  \nInterest expense | 14,567 | 11,500 | 3,067 | 27 | % | 41,676 | 16,183 | 25,493 | 158 | %  \nInterest income | (414 | ) | (2,867 | ) | 2,453 | (86 | )% | (4,530 | ) | (6,377 | ) | 1,847 | (29 | )%  \nChange in fair value of warrants | 44,899 | (48,817 | ) | 93,716 | (192 | )% | 54,532 | (17,669 | ) | 72,201 | (409 | )%  \nLoss on debt extinguishment | — | — | — | 100 | % | 21,214 | — | 21,214 | 100 | %  \nOther expense | 289 | 51 | 238 | 467 | % | 1,364 | 526 | 838 | 159 | %  \nNet (loss) income | $ | (90,639 | ) | $ | 8,530 | $ | 99,169 | 1,163 | % | $ | (224,458 | ) | $ | (72,680 | ) | $ | (151,778 | ) | 209 | %  \n  \nOperating costs\n\nThe increase for the nine month period was primarily attributable to higher depreciation expense related to assets supporting operations of $14.0 million, respectively, due primarily to placing the Ironton Facility assets in service in the second quarter of 2023 and increased operational site costs of $11.5 million, respectively, related to operating the Ironton Facility. Operational costs did not significantly change over the three month period.\n\n46\n\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\n\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — CONTINUED\n\nResearch and development expenses\n\nResearch and development expenses did not significantly change period over period.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n\nThe increase for the nine month period was principally attributable to $6.9 million higher legal and professional consulting fees primarily related to a legal settlements reached in the second and third quarters of 2024 and $2.1 million higher insurance costs, partially offset by $1.7 million lower employee costs and $0.5 million lower bonus costs due to lower headcount and $0.7 million lower taxes and licenses expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses did not significantly change over the three month period.\n\nInterest expense\n\nThe increase for the three and nine month periods was attributable to additional financing incurred in the second and third quarters of 2023, including the closing of the $250.0 million of green convertible senior notes in August 2023, as well as ceasing capitalization of interest on the Revenue Bonds (as defined below) beginning in June 2023 as the plant is now in service.\n\nInterest income\n\nThe decrease for the three and nine month periods was primarily attributable to the Company's liquidation of the available-for-sale investment portfolio earlier in 2024.\n\nChange in fair value of warrants\n\nThe increased expense for the three and nine month periods was attributable to the change in fair value of the Company’s liability-classified warrants, of which the primary drivers of the change in valuation related to changes in the underlying price of PCT’s common stock, as well as an increase in the number of warrants in 2024.\n\nLoss on debt extinguishment\n\nThe amount reported in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 relates to the loss recorded on the purchase of the majority of the outstanding Revenue Bonds in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nOther expense\n\nThe increased expense for the nine month period was attributable to the $0.4 million change in derivative fair value in the third quarter of 2024. Other expense did not significantly change over the three month period.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nDuring 2023 and through September 30, 2024, PCT commenced commercial operations and sold an immaterial amount of resin and has not yet reached significant continuous operational volumes. PCT’s ongoing operations have, to date, been funded by a combination of equity financing through the issuance of units and the issuance of various debt instruments. On September 11, 2024, the Company entered into subscription agreements with certain investors pursuant to which it sold, in a private placement, approximately $90 million in the aggregate and before deducting fees and other estimated offering expenses of (i) Series A Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (\"Series A Preferred Stock\"); (ii) Common Stock and (iii) Series C Warrants. The following is a summary of the components of our current liquidity. The Debt Securities Available for Sale represent investment holdings in highly liquid debt securities and commercial paper with an average maturity of less than one year. As of December 31, 2023, Restricted cash consisted primarily of certain amounts required for the Series 2020A Bonds and other initial\n\n47\n\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\n\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — CONTINUED\n\nconstruction commitments for the Augusta Facility. On March 5, 2024, a subsidiary of the Company purchased 99% of the outstanding bonds (as defined below) which, among other things, released Restricted Cash to be used to purchase the Bonds. See Indebtedness – Revenue Bonds for more information.\n\n(in millions) | September 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023  \n---|---|---  \nCash and Cash Equivalents | $ | 83.7 | $ | 73.4  \nDebt Securities Available for Sale | — | 48.2  \nIronton Facility Bond Reserves | $ | 2.8 | $ | 210.6  \nAugusta Construction Escrow | — | 14.4  \nLetters of Credit and Other Collateral | 7.2 | 4.1  \nRestricted Cash (current and non-current) | $ | 10.0 | $ | 229.1  \nGreen Convertible Notes | $ | 223.7 | $ | 220.7  \nRelated Party Revenue Bonds | 75.5 | —  \nEquipment Financing Payable | 28.2 | 21.6  \nPure Plastic Related Party Note Payable | — | 39.7  \nRevenue Bonds | 12.8 | 234.6  \nOther Debt | 1.1 | —  \nAdd: Discount and Issuance Costs | 57.2 | 47.6  \nGross Long-term Debt and Related Party Note Payable | $ | 398.5 | $ | 564.2  \n  \nAs of September 30, 2024, PCT had $83.7 million of Cash and cash equivalents and $10.0 million of Restricted cash. PCT also has a $200.0 million revolving credit facility with Sylebra Capital (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) that is currently unused and expires on March 31, 2026, per a recent amendment described below.\n\nThrough the first nine months of 2024, PCT has not yet reached meaningful production volumes, sales, or production of on-spec product. Currently, PCT is focused on customer sampling and qualifications and believes that this will lead to meaningful future sales. Also, during the third quarter, the Company initiated compounding operations to blend its resin with either post-industrial recycled material or virgin polypropylene, which is expected to improve product consistency and accelerate the product delivery to customers.\n\nPCT has experienced intermittent mechanical challenges during the commissioning process including, but not limited to, limits in the rates at which certain contaminants can currently be removed from the purification process, as well as challenges with sustaining continuous operations. Recently, PCT has been focused on the recovery and removal of polyethylene and other solids (“CP2”), which impacts the ability to run higher volumes and produce consistent, high quality UPR resin. PCT has modified the CP2 removal system to remove higher volumes of CP2 more quickly and believes these changes will enable us to produce higher volumes of on-spec product. The Company is currently testing the system improvements at various operating conditions to validate the new limits.\n\nOn October 3, 2024, PCT funded $35.9 million to a restricted escrow account related to the Augusta purification facility project. Further, as of September 30, 2024, and through the twelve months from the date of filing, PCT had additional committed capital related to the Augusta Facility of approximately $11.0 million for long-lead equipment and pre-construction work. With additional project finance, the Company anticipates that it may make a higher level of investment in 2025 to further the construction of the Augusta Facility. Also remaining are final investments in the Ironton Facility of approximately $5.0 to $8.0 million. Moreover, there are interest and principal payments of at least $60.6 million, as well as other ongoing monthly costs associated with managing the Company and possible draws on the Revolving Credit Facility.\n\n48\n\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\n\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — CONTINUED\n\nPCT believes that its current level of unrestricted liquidity is not sufficient to fund operations, outstanding commitments, and further its future growth plans. The conditions described above raise substantial doubt regarding PCT’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least one year from the date of issuance of the consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. See Note 1 - Organization - Liquidity and Going Concern for further information.\n\nIn an effort to alleviate these conditions, PCT is currently performing certain operational enhancements that are expected to correct the production issues with the Ironton Facility. Further, on March 5, 2024, PureCycle Technologies LLC (\"PCT LLC\") purchased 99% of the outstanding Bonds (as defined below). Since the purchase of the outstanding Bonds, PCT has, through a series of transactions described below, resold $116.8 million of Bonds at a purchase price of $800 per $1,000 principal amount. As of September 30, 2024, there were $117.6 million of outstanding Bonds that PCT intends to, and has the ability to, re-market based on the need for additional liquidity. The re-marketing process may require the addition of certain covenants to enhance the marketability of the purchased Bonds. The ability to re-market the purchased Bonds with any such additional new covenants would require a further amendment to, or waiver of, provisions included within the Revolving Credit Facility. After considering management’s plans to mitigate these conditions, including operational progress and re-marketing of the Bonds, PCT believes this substantial doubt has been alleviated and it has sufficient liquidity to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months.\n\nPCT’s future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the funding mechanism and construction schedule of the Augusta Facility and other anticipated facilities outside the United States, build-out of multiple Feed PreP facilities, funding needs to support other business opportunities, funding for general corporate purposes, debt service, and other challenges or unforeseen circumstances. As a low-revenue operating company, PCT continually reviews its cash outlays, pace of hiring, professional services and other spend, and capital commitments to proactively manage those needs in tandem with our available unrestricted cash balance. For future growth and investment, PCT expects to seek additional debt or equity financing from outside sources, which it may not be able to raise on terms favorable to PCT, or at all. If PCT is unable to raise additional debt or sell additional equity when desired, or if PCT is unable to manage its cash outflows, PCT’s business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected. In addition, any financing arrangement may have potentially adverse effects on PCT and/or its stockholders. Debt financing (if available and undertaken) will increase expenses, must be repaid regardless of operating results and may involve restrictions limiting PCT’s operating flexibility. If PCT consummates an equity financing to raise additional funds, the percentage ownership of its existing stockholders will be reduced, and the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the current holders of PCT’s Common Stock.\n\nPCT has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on its financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. PCT does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements or interests in variable interest entities that would require consolidation. Note that while certain legally binding offtake arrangements have been entered into with customers, these arrangements are not unconditional and definite agreements subject only to customer closing conditions, and do not qualify as off-balance sheet arrangements required for disclosure.\n\n49\n\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\n\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — CONTINUED\n\nCash Flows\n\nA summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated is as follows:\n\nNine Months Ended September 30,  \n---  \n$ | %  \n(in thousands, except %) | 2024 | 2023 | Change | Change  \nNet cash used in operating activities | $ | (112,985 | ) | $ | (61,330 | ) | $ | (51,655 | ) | 84 | %  \nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities | 14,586 | (55,329 | ) | 69,915 | (126 | )%  \nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities | (110,462 | ) | 273,275 | (383,737 | ) | (140 | )%  \nCash and cash equivalents, beginning of period | 302,514 | 227,523 | 74,991 | 33 | %  \nCash and cash equivalents, end of period | $ | 93,653 | $ | 384,139 | $ | (290,486 | ) | (76 | )%  \n  \nCash Flows from Operating Activities\n\nThe $51.7 million increase in net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ending September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily attributable to higher interest payments on debt of $31.1 million (including $17.7 million paid for the green convertible notes and $5.9 million in outstanding interest paid in connection with the purchase of the Revenue Bonds in March 2024), an increase in cash payments related to operating expenses of $22.1 million primarily driven by increased operational site costs at the Ironton Facility as well as higher legal and professional consulting fees primarily related to the payout of legal settlements in the second and third quarters of 2024.\n\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\n\nThe $69.9 million increase in cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ending September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was attributable to $108.7 million lower capital expenditure payments, offset by $18.6 million higher investment purchases and $20.2 million lower maturities and sales of investments.\n\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\n\nThe $383.7 million increase in net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ending September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily attributable to $253.2 million paid to purchase the outstanding Revenue Bonds and a decrease of $225.2 million in proceeds from debt, partially offset by $90.0 million in preferred stock proceeds.\n\nIndebtedness\n\nThere have been no material changes regarding the Company's indebtedness from the information we provided in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, except as outlined in the information below. Refer to Note 3 - Notes Payable and Debt Instruments to the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding the Company's outstanding indebtedness.\n\nRevenue Bonds\n\nOn October 7, 2020, the Southern Ohio Port Authority (“SOPA”) issued certain Revenue Bonds (as defined below) pursuant to an Indenture of Trust dated as of October 1, 2020 (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Indenture”), between SOPA and UMB Bank, N.A., as Trustee (“Trustee”), and loaned the proceeds from their sale to PureCycle: Ohio LLC (“PCO”), an Ohio limited liability company and indirect wholly owned subsidiary of PCT, pursuant to a Loan Agreement dated as of October 1, 2020, between SOPA and\n\n50\n\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\n\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — CONTINUED\n\nPCO (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Loan Agreement”) to be used to, among other things, acquire, construct and equip the Company’s first commercial-scale recycling facility in Lawrence County, Ohio (the “Ironton Facility”). Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Indenture.\n\nThe Revenue Bonds were offered in three series, including (i) Exempt Facility Revenue Bonds (PureCycle Project), Tax-Exempt Series 2020A (“Series 2020A Bonds”); (ii) Subordinate Exempt Facility Revenue Bonds (PureCycle Project), Tax-Exempt Series 2020B (“Series 2020B Bonds”); and (iii) Subordinated Exempt Facility Revenue Bonds (PureCycle Project), Taxable Series 2020C (“Series 2020C Bonds” and, together with the Series 2020A Bonds and the Series 2020B Bonds, the “Bonds” or \"Revenue Bonds\").\n\nAll of the Bonds are Outstanding under the Indenture. PureCycle Technologies LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Guarantor”), purchased $246.8 million in aggregate principal amount of Bonds Outstanding under the Indenture on March 5, 2024, of which $216.8 million in aggregate principal amount were Series 2020A Bonds, such that the Guarantor comprised the Majority Holders. The Purchase was determined to be an extinguishment of the underlying debt obligation due to PCO being a wholly owned subsidiary of the Guarantor. As of September 30, 2024, there were $117.6 million of outstanding Bonds that PCT intends to, and has the ability to, re-market based on the need for additional liquidity. The re-marketing process may require the addition of certain covenants to enhance the marketability of the purchased Bonds.\n\nOn October 25, 2024, SOPA, as Issuer, PCO, the Guarantor, PCTO Holdco and the Trustee entered into the Sixth Supplemental Indenture, which amended certain provisions of the Indenture and Loan Agreement. Refer to Note 3 – Notes Payable and Debt Instruments for further discussion.\n\nRevenue Bonds Issued to Related Party\n\nOn May 7, 2024, PCT LLC and Pure Plastic LLC (\"Pure Plastic\") executed a bond purchase agreement (as subsequently amended and restated to reflect the appropriate denomination of bonds, the “Amended and Restated Bond Purchase Agreement”), whereby Pure Plastic purchased approximately $94.3 million in aggregate par amount of Bonds owned by PCT LLC (the “Related Party Bonds”), including (i) a portion of the Series 2020A Bonds, (ii) all of the Series 2020B Bonds, and (iii) all of the Series 2020C Bonds, at a purchase price of $800 per $1,000 principal amount of the Related Party Bonds. Affiliates of Pure Plastic are greater than 5% beneficial owners of the Company.\n\nOn May 10, 2024, Pure Plastic executed a Payoff and Release Letter (the “Payoff and Release Letter”), which memorialized the exchange of the Company’s obligations under the $40 million term loan provided to the Company pursuant to the Term Loan Credit Agreement (as defined below). The Company was also required to pay a 12% prepayment premium on the outstanding principal and interest paid in order to prepay the Term Loan Facility (the “Prepayment Premium”), plus certain expenses. The Company issued warrants (“Series B Warrants”) to Pure Plastic pursuant to the Series B Warrant Agreement to satisfy the Prepayment Premium (the “Series B Warrant Agreement”). Refer to Note 6 – Warrants for further discussion.\n\nOn May 28, 2024, PCT LLC and Pure Plastic executed the First Amendment to Amended and Restated Bond Purchase Agreement (“First Amendment”) whereby Exhibit A to the Amended and Restated Bond Purchase Agreement was replaced with Exhibit A-3 to the First Amendment to facilitate the transfer by the Depository Trust Company of certain of the Related Party Bonds. The total amount of the Related Party Bonds and the cash due from Pure Plastic to PCT LLC remains the same. Except as summarized above and as set forth in the First Amendment, PCT LLC and Pure Plastic each acknowledged and reaffirmed the terms of the Amended and Restated Bond Purchase Agreement in the First Amendment.\n\n51\n\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\n\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — CONTINUED\n\nOn June 14, 2024, SOPA, as Issuer, PCO, the Guarantor, PCTO Holdco LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and affiliate of PCO (the pledgor under the Equity Pledge and Security Agreement (as defined in the Fifth Supplemental Indenture) and the Trustee entered into the Fifth Supplemental Indenture (the “Fifth Supplemental Indenture”) which amended certain provisions of the Indenture including (a) redefining “Majority Holders” to be the Holders of seventy-five percent (75%) in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Bonds then Outstanding, or if no Senior Bonds are then Outstanding, the Holders of seventy-five percent (75%) in aggregate principal amount of Bonds then Outstanding, and (b) amending the lead paragraph of Section 10.02(a) of the Indenture by raising the threshold for consenting to and approving the execution by the Issuer and the Trustee of Supplemental Indentures from “Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Senior Bonds” to “Holders of not less than 75% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Senior Bonds” with the limited exceptions therein stated.\n\nOn August 7, 2024, PCT LLC, Pure Plastic, and several other parties reached agreement on terms whereby certain purchasers purchased approximately $22.5 million in aggregate par amount of Series A Bonds owned by PCT LLC at a purchase price of $800 per $1,000 principal amount (the “August Purchased Bonds”) under a bond purchase agreement. The purchase of the August Purchased Bonds was completed and funds received by PCT LLC on or about August 9, 2024, with $12.5 million in aggregate par amount being sold to Pure Plastic and $10.0 million in aggregate par amount being sold to other parties.\n\nSylebra Credit Facility\n\nOn March 15, 2023, PCT entered into the $150.0 million Revolving Credit Facility pursuant to a Credit Agreement (as amended, the “Revolving Credit Agreement”) dated as of March 15, 2023, with PureCycle Technologies Holdings Corp. and PCT LLC (the “Guarantors”), Sylebra Capital Partners Master Fund, LTD, Sylebra Capital Parc Master Fund, and Sylebra Capital Menlo Master Fund (collectively, the “Lenders”), and Madison Pacific Trust Limited (the “Administrative Agent” and “Security Agent”). The Lenders and their affiliates are greater than 5% beneficial owners of PCT.\n\nOn March 1, 2024, PCT increased the Revolving Credit Facility from $150.0 million to $200.0 million and obtained a carveout to permit the Company to purchase the Revenue Bonds, pursuant to an amendment to the Revolving Credit Agreement.\n\nIn conjunction with PCT LLC’s sale of approximately $94.3 million of Related Party Bonds, on May 10, 2024, the Company, the Guarantors, the Administrative Agent, the Security Agent and the Lenders executed a Limited Consent and Fifth Amendment to the Credit Agreement to permit the Disposition of Bonds (as defined therein), as well as to provide certain administrative revisions to eliminate the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined therein) and references to the Term Loan Credit Agreement.\n\nOn September 11, 2024, in connection with PCT's offering of Series A Preferred Stock, PCT extended the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility to March 31, 2026, in conjunction with the Limited Consent and Sixth Amendment to the Credit Agreement,which also (i) permitted the offering of Series A Preferred Stock; (ii) added PureCycle Augusta, LLC as a “Guarantor” and a \"Loan Party\" thereunder and (iii) added as secured obligations certain obligations in respect of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series C Warrants and pre-funded warrants owed to the Lenders’ affiliates.\n\nThe Pure Plastic Term Loan Facility\n\nOn May 8, 2023, the Company entered into a $40.0 million term loan facility pursuant to the Term Loan Credit Agreement (\"Term Loan Credit Agreement\") dated as of May 8, 2023, among the Guarantors and Pure Plastic (as Lender, Administrative Agent, and Security Agent), which matures on December 31, 2025 (the “Term Loan\n\n52\n\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\n\nITEM 2.

Affiliates of the Lender are greater than 5% beneficial owners of the Company.\n\nOn March 1, 2024, PCT increased the amount available to the Company under the Term Loan Credit Agreement's permitted indebtedness covenant basket for the Revolving Credit Facility from $150.0 million to $200.0 million and obtained a carve out to permit the Company to purchase the Revenue Bonds. Each of PureCycle Technologies Holdings Corp. and PCT LLC are subsidiaries of the Company.\n\nOn May 10, 2024, Pure Plastic executed the Payoff and Release Letter, which memorialized the exchange of the Company’s obligations under the Term Loan Credit Agreement. Refer to \"Revenue Bonds Issued to Related Party\" section above for further discussion.\n\nFinancial Assurance\n\nOn March 14, 2024, PCT renewed a surety bond in the amount of $25.0 million to provide financial assurance related to its performance under a certain vendor contract, which expires at the earlier of satisfaction of the obligation, termination of the related vendor contract, or one year from issuance (subject to renewal within one year). Effective July 1, 2024, the amount was increased from $25.0 million to $45.9 million. Effective October 3, 2024, the amount was decreased from $45.9 million to $8.1 million as a result of PCT funding a restricted escrow account.\n\nThese financial instruments are issued in the normal course of business and are not considered company indebtedness. Because PCT currently has no liability for these financial assurance instruments, they are not reflected in its consolidated balance sheets.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nThere have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates from the information we provided in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nSee Note 2 to the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information about recent accounting pronouncements, the timing of their adoption, and our assessment, to the extent we have made one, of their potential impact on our financial condition and our results of operations.\n\n53\n\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\n\nITEM 3.

Business\nOverview\nPCT is commercializing a patented purification recycling technology (the “Technology”), originally developed by The Procter & Gamble Company (“P&G”), for\nrestoring waste polypropylene into resin with near-virgin characteristics, called ultra-pure recycled (“UPR”) resin, which has nearly identical properties and\napplicability for reuse as virgin polypropylene. PCT has a global license for the Technology from P&G. In April 2023, we certified as mechanically complete our\nfirst commercial scale recycling facility (the \"Ironton Facility\"), which is expected to have capacity of approximately 107 million pounds/year when fully\noperational. Commissioning activities have begun but the plant is not yet operating at the expected full capacity. The plant is expected to be fully operational\nlater in 2024. Our goal is to create an important new segment of the global polypropylene market that will assist multinational entities in meeting their\nsustainability goals, provide consumers with polypropylene-based products that are sustainable, and reduce overall polypropylene waste in the world’s landfills\nand oceans.\nPCT’s process includes two steps: Feed Pre-Processing (“Feed PreP”) and the use of the Technology for purification. The Feed PreP step will collect, sort, and\nprepare polypropylene waste (“feedstock”) for purification. The purification step is a purification recycling process that uses a combination of solvent,\ntemperature, and pressure to return the feedstock to near-virgin condition through a novel configuration of commercially available equipment and unit\noperations. The purification process puts the plastic through a physical extraction process using super critical fluids that both extract and filter out contaminants\nand purify the color, opacity, and odor of the plastic without changing the bonds of the polymer. By not altering the chemical makeup of the polymer, the\nCompany is able to use significantly less energy and reduce production costs as compared to virgin resin.\nPCT intends to build new recycling production facilities globally, as project financing becomes available. In addition to the Ironton Facility and our first U.S.\nfacility with multiple lines for purification (“multi-line facility”) to be located in Augusta, Georgia (the “Augusta Facility”), and multiple Feed PreP facilities centrally\nlocated, we currently expect the next plants to be located in the Port of Antwerp in Belgium and Ulsan, South Korea under a joint venture. The Augusta Facility\nwill be our first scaled up multi-line facility model. Pre-engineering for the design and installation of multiple commercial lines at the Augusta Facility is currently\nunderway and is expected to create efficiencies across the construction and permitting processes. Further, we have placed orders for our long-lead equipment\nfor the Augusta Facility, with additional construction progress expected to begin sometime in late 2024, pending timely completion of project financing.\nPCT is pursuing a leading role in solvent-based polypropylene recycling. The Company’s Feedstock Evaluation Unit (“FEU”), which has been operational since\nJuly 2019, is a smaller scale replica of the Ironton Facility. The FEU was designed to simulate commercial production and validate for PCT’s customers and\nsuppliers the viability of our process, which has helped PCT secure 20+ year signed offtake agreements and feedstock supply agreements with large multi-\nnational partners and industry participants. Based on the testing PCT has performed and continues to perform through the FEU and independent labs, PCT\nbelieves a sufficient number of feedstock sources have been identified that are suitable for its purification technology. PCT has partnered with suppliers to\nprovide the required mix and quality of feedstock necessary to meet its offtake requirements at Ironton, and believes it will be able source feedstock sufficient to\nsupport future operations in the U.S., Europe, and Asia.\nThe Technology has been evaluated by third parties with a focus on the Technology’s efficacy and commercial scalability. Certain of our strategic partners have\nconducted testing on PCT’s UPR resin. In these evaluations, PCT’s UPR resin compared favorably to virgin polypropylene in common Food & Beverage industry\nbenchmarks for melt flow and mechanical properties, purity, odor, and function (lift decay, hinge break, and impact resistance).\nIndustry Background\nCurrently, polypropylene is one of the largest contributors to the global plastics waste crisis. Each year more than 170 billion pounds of polypropylene are\nmanufactured and incorporated into a wide array of consumer facing and industrial products. According to a 2022 report from Greenpeace, the EPA (as defined\nbelow) estimated in a 2018 study that less than 1% of polypropylene is collected and recycled annually, compared to\n5\nTable of Contents\napproximately 19% of polyethylene terephthalate (“PET”). Many of the advantages attributed to polypropylene (strength, toughness, elasticity) also contribute to\nits problematic waste stream after initial use. Due to its chemical makeup, polypropylene does not react with diluted bases and acids. Consequently,\npolypropylene does not break down and can remain a pollutant in our oceans, landfills, and food chain for centuries. Despite these environmental\nconsequences, polypropylene utilization continues to increase, with a projected 3.5% average annual growth rate over the next 5 years, based on 2022 data.\nIn response to these issues, multinational companies have partnered with non-governmental organizations (“NGOs”) and trade associations to encourage\nrecycling of plastics. Significant capital has been raised to combat the global plastics crisis, including multinational collaboration, ocean clean-up initiatives, new\nplastic economies, and global infrastructure investments. Furthermore, over 450 multinationals have signed commitments focused on, among other things, the\nreuse, recycling, or composting of all plastic packaging. Numerous multinationals have taken this pledge even further by committing to reduce the use of virgin\nplastic packaging by 50% by 2025. These commitments are being driven by consumer demand for sustainable products, which is expected to continue to drive\nmany multinational corporations to source sustainable materials to achieve publicly announced sustainability objectives.\nWhile there are a range of ways that plastics can be recycled today, there are very limited options available for polypropylene. The current options are chemical\nand mechanical recycling, both of which have significant drawbacks that have resulted in extremely low recycling rates. Chemical recycling requires further\nprocessing to become a viable product for fuel or plastic, which results in substantially higher energy expenditure, carbon dioxide (“CO2”) emissions, and\ninflated cost. Mechanical recycling, while more energy efficient than chemical recycling, does not remove all of the waste contaminants from the end product,\nleading to wide variation in end product quality and low-value end uses.\nPureCycle’s Solution: Ultra-Pure Recycled Polypropylene\nPCT’s recycling technology is a purification recycling process that uses a combination of solvent, temperature, and pressure. Waste stream polypropylene is\nreturned to near-virgin condition through a novel configuration of commercially available equipment and unit operations. The process puts the plastic through a\nphysical extraction process using super critical fluids that both extract and filter out contaminants and purify the color, opacity, and odor of the plastic with\nminimal controlled alteration of the physical characteristics of the polymer. By not altering the chemical makeup of the polymer, the Company is able to use\nsignificantly less energy and reduce production costs as compared to virgin resin. The unique super-critical fluid extraction process does not require chemical\nreactions.\nKey benefits of the Technology include:\n• most equipment is standard processing equipment, commercially available and widely used;\n• it uses a physical separation/purification process without chemical reactions;\n• it is expected to utilize approximately one fourth the amount of energy required to produce virgin polypropylene resin; and\n• its ability to recycle a wide range of polypropylene waste.\nOur UPR resin technology results in near-virgin equivalent quality and color, and substantially improved odor profile compared to traditional recycled\npolypropylene. UPR resin provides our customers with 100% recycled content without compromising appearance, purity, odor or performance in finished\nproducts.\nThe Product: UPR resin\nPolypropylene has multiple applications including packaging and labeling for consumer products, piping, ropes, cabling and plastic parts for many industries\nand, in particular, the automotive industry. It is one of the most commonly used plastics in the world due to its flexibility as a “living hinge” on consumer product\nlids (e.g., shampoo, condiments) since it typically will not break when bent even after multiple movements and ranges of motion.\n6\nTable of Contents\nPCT’s unique purification process separates colors, odors, and contaminants through a physical separation process. This process and end product quality have\nbeen tested and validated by P&G, prospective offtake partners, and independent third party labs. When compared to virgin resin, PCT’s UPR resin expresses\nnear identical mechanical properties across Melt Flow Index (a measure of viscosity), Tensile Modulus (measure of stiffness), and Impact Strength (a measure\nof sudden resistance to force).\nPCT has leveraged strategic partners with expertise in operations, the use of additives to improve the physical properties of polymers, and consumer packaged\ngoods companies to conduct early testing to confirm that the product meets the expectations of the end users and offtake partners.\nOfftake and Customers\nBased on current offtake subscription agreements and letters of intent (“LOIs”), PCT intends to market and sell the UPR resin to a wide range of industries,\nincluding but not limited to: resin distributors, resin converters, compounders, consumer goods manufacturers, food and beverage producers, toy manufacturers\nand personal care goods producers. Polypropylene is used in a variety of end markets, including consumer packaged goods, electronics, automotive, building &\nconstruction, household goods and agriculture. Due to a growing awareness around sustainability and many multinational companies shifting their strategic\nfocus to sustainability as a key differentiator, PCT intends to provide UPR resin to a diversified customer base across most, if not all, of these end markets over\ntime.\nFeedstock Supply\nOver 150 billion pounds of polypropylene waste feedstocks are generated every year across multiple industries. Most of these feedstocks are untapped by the\nmarket today and are disposed of in landfills and oceans. These feedstocks include flexible and rigid packaging, plastic waste from textiles, and large business\nsegments including consumer products, medical, automotive, industrial, and agricultural.\nPCT’s efforts to reliably and cost-effectively source high quality polypropylene content waste feedstock are ongoing and primarily consist of purchasing pre-\nsorted polypropylene waste feedstock from various suppliers and purchasing non-sorted plastic waste that PCT itself sorts through its Feed PreP facilities.\nPCT’s polypropylene waste feedstock sourcing strategy will evolve as the market for polypropylene waste feedstock evolves.\nThe Processing Facilities\nThe Feedstock Evaluation Unit\nThe FEU is an 11,000 square foot facility located adjacent to the commercial line at the Ironton Facility in Lawrence County, Ohio with over 1 mile of stainless-\nsteel piping. The facility was completed in July 2019 and has been producing UPR resin product since that time. The FEU is considered a pilot scale replica of\nthe larger commercial line at the Ironton Facility. It serves the strategic purpose of determining if new feedstock streams are of sufficient quality before\nintroducing them into the commercial line at the Ironton Facility, as well as providing sample UPR resin to prospective customers. Quantities of offtake from the\nFEU have been provided to offtake partners for evaluation. To date, the product produced is within ranges acceptable under contractual offtake agreements.\nThe FEU will remain a critical component for testing feedstock for PCT’s current and future plants.\nIronton Facility\nLocated on the same site as the FEU, PCT commenced construction in October 2020 on the Ironton Facility, began commissioning in April 2023, and became\noperational later in 2023. While the plant began operations in 2023, it has not yet reached significant continuous operational volumes. The approximately\n150,000 square foot facility houses commercial-scale equipment designed to process 182 tons of feedstock per day into UPR resin and will also be used for\nfeedstock pre-processing and feedstock storage. An additional building has been leased for feedstock pre-processing research and development. The Ironton\nFacility is expected to have UPR resin capacity of approximately 107 million pounds/year when fully operational. We expect the Ironton Facility to\n7\nTable of Contents\nbe fully operational later in 2024.\nAugusta Facility\nPCT announced that it had secured the site location for its second purification facility in Augusta, Georgia on July 29, 2021 and executed a lease on June 30,\n2023, for an approximately 150-acre tract, with the availability to lease a second tract, totaling approximately 50 acres, subject to various milestones. The\nSoutheast was targeted given its ideal location for access to feedstock and multiple ports creating numerous options for exporting the UPR resin overseas.\nAugusta also provides a strong labor market, optimized infrastructure with access to electricity and natural gas at the site boundary, and an advanced supply\nchain with interstate and rail access to reduce transportation costs.\nThe Augusta Facility will be the Company’s first multi-line facility, currently expected to be comprised of up to eight purification lines, and is designed to\nultimately produce approximately 130 million pounds annually per line. The engineering design has been completed and portions of the long-lead equipment has\nbeen ordered.\nGlobal Facilities\nPCT announced that it secured a site for its first European purification facility in Antwerp, Belgium on January 17, 2023. The location was selected after a\nthorough review, including proximity to sources of feedstock and likely offtake partners. The location of the facility, within the Port of Antwerp, is expected to\nprovide logistics advantages for shipment of product and receipt of feedstock. PCT also completed its joint venture agreement with SK geo centric Co., Ltd., on\nOctober 20, 2022 to establish the Company’s first Asian purification facility in Ulsan, South Korea.\nPreP Facilities\nPCT is developing a feedstock processing system with advanced sorting capabilities that can handle various types of plastics in addition to polypropylene\n(designated as no. 5 plastic). PCT’s enhanced sorting should allow PCT to process plastic bales between no. 1 and no. 7. PCT’s new Feed PreP facilities will\nextract polypropylene and ship it to PCT’s purification lines, while the non-polypropylene feed will be sorted, baled, and subsequently sold on the open market.\nIn conjunction with the Augusta Facility, PCT also plans to build and operate Feed PreP facilities in locations geographically near the feed sources to optimize\nPCT’s supply chain economics. During the third quarter of 2022, PCT experienced new challenges obtaining the necessary water and sewer permits to operate\nits first planned Feed PreP facility in Central Florida. PCT is evaluating its available recourses to obtain these permits, as well as potential legal remedies with\nregard to its obligations under its 11-year lease agreement for the Central Florida facility. PCT is also evaluating alternative preprocessing sites in other\nlocations. On August 24, 2022, PCT signed a lease for a future PreP facility in Denver, Pennsylvania, which is expected to be operationally ready by the end of\n2024, provided we obtain the financing and permits necessary for operational readiness.\nGovernment Regulation\nPCT is subject to laws and regulations administered by various federal, state and local government agencies in the United States that prescribe the\nrequirements and establish the standards for quality and safety, regulate PCT’s products, and the manufacturing, labeling, marketing, promotion, and\nadvertising thereof.\nPCT is also subject to labor and employment laws, laws governing advertising, privacy laws, safety regulations, marketing claims and other laws, including but\nnot limited to consumer protection regulations that regulate retailers or govern the promotion and sale of merchandise. PCT’s operations, and those of its\nsuppliers, are subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and worker health and safety matters.\nFDA Requirements\nRecycled polypropylene in food packaging applications in the U.S. is regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). The FDA has established\ncertain requirements for the use of polypropylene in food packaging, as well as guidelines for the use of recycled plastics in food packaging. On a voluntary\nbasis,\n8\nTable of Contents\ncompanies may ask FDA to issue a Letter of No Objection (“LNO”) to provide assurance to customers regarding regulatory compliance and safety of systems\nthat recycle polymers.\nOn September 10, 2021, PCT filed for a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) Letter of No Objection (“LNO”), for Conditions of Use A – H. Conditions of\nUse describe the temperature and duration at which a material should be tested to simulate the way the material is intended to be used. Conditions of Use C –\nH address many consumer product packaging requirements, including applications for hot filled and pasteurized, as well as room temperature, refrigerated and\nfrozen applications. Generally speaking, Conditions of Use A and B relate to extreme temperature applications. The LNO submission also defines the feedstock\nsources for the Company’s planned commercial recycling process, and this LNO submission pertained to (i) food grade post-industrial recycled feedstocks and\n(ii) food grade curbside post-consumer recycled feedstocks.\nThe FDA confirmed receipt of the submission on September 13, 2021 and followed up with additional questions and requests for clarification in a letter received\nby PCT on January 7, 2022. PCT responded to the FDA’s questions on February 17, 2022.\nOn September 6, 2022, PCT received two separate notifications from the FDA with respect to the following two feedstock sources:\n(i) Food grade post-industrial recycled feedstocks: an FDA opinion letter approving Conditions of Use A – H and\n(ii) Food-grade post-consumer recycled feedstock from stadiums: an FDA LNO for Conditions of Use E – G.\nThe Company’s FDA food contact grades are capable of being used for all food types per the conditions of use listed and per all applicable authorizations in the\nfood contact regulations listed in the 21 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21).\nThe Company is conducting additional testing and plans to make further LNO submissions for additional post-consumer recycled feedstock sources and\nexpanded Conditions of Use.\nEnvironmental and Workplace Safety Laws\nPCT is subject to air, water, waste and other environmental, commercial and workplace safety laws and regulations at the federal, state, and local level in the\nUnited States including requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), and the\nFederal Trade Commission (“FTC”).\nRecycled polypropylene for use in non-food packaging uses complies with or is exempt from EPA’s requirements under the Toxic Substances Control Act\n(“TSCA”), since polypropylene (Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Number (CASRN) 9003-07-0) is approved for use on the TSCA Chemical Substances\nInventory and the manufacture of polymers is exempt from TSCA Chemical Data Reporting. Additive selection will also comply with the TSCA.\nPCT is subject to local, state and federal laws and regulations that address the release of hazardous substances into the air, water and land, and the storage,\nhandling, disposal and transportation of hazardous materials. PCT holds various state and local licenses and permits, some of which are perpetual, and others\nwhich renew periodically. These include both environmental and general business licenses. Larger multi-line locations may also fall under federal Title V\npermitting rules.\nOSHA and the delegated states implement the Occupational Safety and Health Act and relevant state counterparts. In relevant part, this requires hazard\nidentification and communication about materials used or produced in operations to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. Other\nworkplace safety rules, such as those governing confined space entry and process safety management, also apply to PCT’s operations, and PCT’s facility is\nsubject to OSHA inspection. PCT’s operations are subject to privacy laws and federal and state laws governing labor and employment matters such as minimum\nwage, overtime, working conditions and employment eligibility requirements.\nThe FTC requires that marketing and advertising by PCT and its feedstock suppliers be truthful, non-misleading, not deceptive to consumers, and consistent\nwith the Guides for the Use of Environmental Marketing Claims, 16 C.F.R. Part 260, concerning recycling claims. The federal Lanham Act and federal antitrust\nlaws govern PCT’s\n9\nTable of Contents\nbusiness activities and advertising claims. State law equivalents of false advertising claims laws apply and these laws may differ from each other in significant\nways. They often are not preempted by federal laws.\nRegulation Outside the United States\nThe commercialization of our product in countries other than the U.S. may require that PCT, or companies with whom PCT partners for such foreign\ncommercialization, obtain necessary approvals for food packaging use under foreign regulatory regimes comparable to that of the FDA. Applicable approval\nprocesses and ongoing requirements in international markets vary from country to country and may involve more time and expense than that required to obtain\napprovals in the U.S. We intend to meet these requirements ourselves or through distributors as required.\nIntellectual Property\nPursuant to the License Agreement, P&G has granted PCT a license to utilize P&G’s intellectual property, and PCT has granted a sublicense of P&G\nintellectual property back to P&G under the terms of the License Agreement, with a limited right to sublicense by P&G (the “Grant Back”) subject to volume and\ngeographic restrictions. Under the Grant Back, for five years after the effective date of the License Agreement, the aggregate tonnage that may be produced\nunder the Grant Back will be capped at 500,000 metric tons per year worldwide. Beyond year 5, that aggregate annual tonnage will be expanded to enable\nmodest expansion across each of the six regions worldwide (generally, North America, Europe, China, Asia, Africa and Latin America).\nPCT has a limited right to sublicense the technology to PCT affiliates and select third parties with the consent of P&G. All fourteen filed and granted patents are\nutility patents (as opposed to design patents and applications). All of the patents relate to the same core PCT technology processes. This patent estate covers\nthe proprietary process by which waste polypropylene is converted into ultra-pure recycled polypropylene, specifically the method for separating and purifying\npolymers from the reclaimed and contaminated polypropylene, polyethylene and other polymers. The License Agreement also governs the ownership of\nprocess improvements. Improvements (as defined in the License Agreement) invented by PCT are owned by PCT and are licensed back to P&G for the\npurpose of selling licensed product, while Improvements (as defined in the License Agreement) invented by P&G or jointly by P&G and PCT are owned by P&G\nand licensed to PCT. The license may become non-exclusive if PCT fails to make payments or undergoes a change of control without the prior written consent\nof P&G. If PCT defaults under the License Agreement and the License Agreement is terminated, P&G fails to perform its obligations under these agreements,\nor PCT’s relationship with P&G is otherwise damaged or severed, this could have a material adverse effect on PCT’s business, results of operations or financial\nperformance. In addition, P&G’s failure to consent to future sublicenses by PCT to PCT affiliates and select third parties would limit PCT’s ability to expand as\ncontemplated by its current business plan.\nThe License Agreement will terminate upon the later of (a) the expiration of the last Licensed Patent (as defined in the License Agreement) to expire and (b) the\nexpiry date of the warrant between PCT and P&G (which was executed on October 16, 2020). Under the License Agreement, fourteen Utility Patents were filed\nand granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”). Each Utility Patent will expire on the 20-year anniversary of the original application\nfiling date. Together, these fourteen Utility Patents make up the Licensed Patents.\nHuman Capital Resources\nEmployees & Demographics. As of December 31, 2023, PCT employed 146 team members. None of PCT’s employees are represented by a labor union. With\nrespect to demographics, approximately 29% of our employees are female and 71% are male. On December 1, 2023, PCT announced a reduction-in-force\n(“Separation”) of 22 employees, the majority of whom are not associated with the Company’s Ironton, Ohio facility. The reduction-in-force followed a zero-based\nbudgeting process at each function within the organization and was targeted toward optimizing the performance of the organization and retaining critical talent.\nTalent & Retention. With a keen focus on talent acquisition and retention, we have managed to hire some of the top talent in the industry. Our robust talent\nacquisition program enables us to identify the right candidates through various sources (i.e. professional networks and internal referrals). Additionally, we strive\nto promote internally, if applicable.\n10\nTable of Contents\nCompensation Practice & Pay Equality. As PCT evolves, Human Resources in partnership with the leadership team will continue to evaluate the existing\nworkforce to ensure that best practices are maintained across the entire team without risk of inequality. Pay structures will be reviewed annually to ensure best\npractices in a competitive market and, as part of that review, compensation will be realigned where appropriate for existing team members and new hires.\nWebsite Access to Securities and Exchange Commission Reports\nPCT makes available free of charge, in the “Investors – SEC Filings & Reports” section of its website at https://www.purecycle.com/, its annual reports on Form\n10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the\nExchange Act as soon as practicable after the Company files them with, or furnishes them to, the SEC. The information on the Company’s website is not\nincorporated by reference into this Annual report on Form 10-K. The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and\nother information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at www.sec.gov.\n11\nTable of Contents\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully review this section in addition to the other information appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial\nstatements and related notes, for important information regarding risks and uncertainties that affect us. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the\nonly ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors\nthat adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects could\nbe materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to PCT’s Status as a low revenue Early Commercial Stage Company\nPCT is a low revenue early commercial stage company, and may never achieve or sustain profitability.\nPCT is commercializing a recycling technology that was developed by The Procter & Gamble Company (“P&G”). P&G granted PCT a worldwide license under\nan Amended and Restated Patent License Agreement dated July 28, 2020, between P&G and PCT (the “License Agreement”) for a proprietary process of\nrestoring waste polypropylene into ultra-pure recycled (“UPR”) resin products through an extraction and filtration purification process (the “Technology”).\nPCT relies principally on the commercialization of UPR resin as well as the Technology and related licenses to generate future revenue growth. To date, such\nproducts and services have delivered minimal revenue. Also, UPR resin product offerings and partnering revenues are in their very early stages. PCT believes\nthat commercialization success is dependent upon the ability to significantly increase the number of purification plants, feed pre-processing facilities (“Feed\nPreP facilities”), feedstock suppliers and offtake partners as well as strategic partners that utilize UPR resin and the Technology via licensing agreements. PCT\nis an early commercial stage company that evaluates various strategies to achieve its financial goals and commercialization objectives on an ongoing basis. In\nthis regard, PCT’s production methodology is designed to achieve these objectives, including with respect to future plant size, capacity, cost, geographic\nlocation, sequencing, timing, and aggregation/disaggregation (with respect to Feed PreP facilities) and is subject to change as a result of modifications to\nbusiness strategy or market conditions. Furthermore, if demand for UPR resin products and the Technology does not increase as quickly as planned, PCT may\nbe unable to increase revenue levels as expected. PCT is currently not profitable. Even if PCT succeeds in increasing adoption of UPR resin products by target\nmarkets, maintaining and creating relationships with existing and new offtake partners, feedstock suppliers and customers, and developing and commercializing\nadditional plants, market conditions, particularly related to pricing and feedstock costs, may result in PCT not generating sufficient revenue to achieve or sustain\nprofitability.\nPCT’s business is not diversified.\nPCT’s initial commercial success depends on its ability to profitably operate its first commercial-scale plant in Ohio (the “Ironton Facility”) and the Feedstock\nEvaluation Unit (the “FEU”) and its ability to complete construction and profitably and successfully operate the first multi-line facility to be located in Augusta,\nGeorgia (the “Augusta Facility”), and future Feed PreP facilities.\nPCT’s continued commercial success depends on its ability to profitably and successfully operate the Ironton Facility, the Augusta Facility and future Feed PreP\nfacilities; to start and complete construction and profitably and successfully operate its first commercial-scale European plant located in Antwerp, Belgium (the\n“NextGen Facility”) and to start and complete construction and profitably and successfully operate its first commercial-scale Asian plant located in Ulsan, South\nKorea (the “South Korean Facility”).\nOther than the future production and sale of UPR resin products, there are currently no other lines of business or other material sources of revenue. Such lack of\ndiversification may limit PCT’s ability to adapt to changing business conditions and could have an adverse effect on PCT’s business, financial condition, results\nof operations and prospects.\n12\nTable of Contents\nThe License Agreement sets forth certain performance and pricing targets which, if missed, could result in a termination or conversion of the\nlicense granted under the License Agreement.\nPursuant to the License Agreement, P&G has granted PCT a license to utilize certain P&G intellectual property. The intellectual property is tied to the\nproprietary purification process by which waste polypropylene may be converted to UPR resin, referred to as the Technology. The License Agreement sets forth\ncertain performance targets for the Ironton Facility and future facilities which, if missed, could result in a termination of the license granted under the License\nAgreement (if PCT is unable to make UPR resin at certain production volumes and at certain prices within a certain time frame). The License Agreement also\nsets forth certain performance and pricing targets for the Ironton Facility and future facilities which, if missed, could result in conversion of the license to a non-\nexclusive license (if PCT’s UPR resin is unable to meet certain purification thresholds within a certain period of time after the start of the Project or PCT is\nunable or unwilling to provide P&G with UPR resin at certain prices from the first plant). In the event the License Agreement is terminated or converted to a non-\nexclusive license, this could have a material adverse effect on PCT’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nPCT’s outstanding secured and unsecured indebtedness, ability to incur additional debt and the provisions in the agreements governing PCT’s debt,\nand certain other agreements, could have a material adverse effect on PCT’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nAs of December 31, 2023, PCT had total consolidated debt of $516.6 million, including notes payable to related parties. PCT has not yet begun commercial\noperations and does not have any sources of material revenue. PCT’s debt service obligations could have important consequences to PCT for the foreseeable\nfuture, including the following: (i) PCT’s ability to obtain additional financing for capital expenditures, working capital or other general corporate purposes may be\nimpaired; (ii) a substantial portion of PCT’s cash flow from operating activities must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on PCT’s debt, thereby\nreducing the funds available to us for PCT’s operations and other corporate purposes; and (iii) PCT may be or become substantially more leveraged than some\nof its competitors, which may place PCT at a relative competitive disadvantage and make us more vulnerable to changes in market conditions and governmental\nregulations.\nPCT is required to maintain compliance with certain financial and other covenants under its debt agreements. There are and will be operating and financial\nrestrictions and covenants in certain of PCT’s debt agreements, including the Loan Agreement, as well as certain other agreements to which PCT is or may\nbecome a party. These limit, among other things, PCT’s or its subsidiaries’ ability to incur certain additional debt, create certain liens or other encumbrances,\nsell assets, and transfer ownership interests and transactions with affiliates of PCT. These covenants could limit PCT’s ability to engage in activities that may be\nin PCT’s best long-term interests. PCT’s failure, or perceived failure, to comply with certain covenants in these agreements could result in an Event of Default\n(as defined therein) under the various debt agreements, allowing lenders to accelerate the maturity for the debt under these agreements and to foreclose upon\nany collateral securing the debt. An Event of Default would also adversely affect PCT’s ability to access its borrowing capacity and pay debt service on its\noutstanding debt, likely resulting in acceleration of such debt or in a default under other agreements containing cross-default provisions. Under such\ncircumstances, PCT might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of its obligations. In addition, the limitations imposed by PCT’s financing\nagreements on its ability to pay dividends, incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair PCT’s ability to obtain other financing,\ngenerate sufficient cash flow from operations to enable PCT to pay its debt or to fund other liquidity needs. Such consequences would adversely affect PCT’s\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nPCT faces risks and uncertainties related to litigation, regulatory actions and investigations.\nPCT may become subject to, and may become a party to, a variety of litigation, other claims, suits, regulatory actions and investigations. For example, on or\nabout May 11, 2021, two putative class action complaints were filed against PCT, certain senior members of management and others asserting violations of the\nfederal securities laws, which were subsequently consolidated into a single complaint (the “Complaint”). The Complaint alleges that PCT, certain senior\nmembers of management and others made false and/or misleading statements in press releases and public filings regarding the Technology, PCT’s business\nand PCT’s prospects. Separately, a purported PCT shareholder, derivatively and purportedly on behalf of PCT, filed a shareholder derivative action in the\nUnited States District Court for the District of Delaware against certain senior members of PCT’s management, PCT’s directors and others alleging violations of\nSection 20(a) of the Exchange Act and breaches\n13\nTable of Contents\nof fiduciary duties and bringing claims for unjust enrichment and waste of corporate assets. Both the Complaint and the shareholder derivative action rely on\ninformation included in a research report published on May 6, 2021 by Hindenburg Research LLC (the “Hindenburg Report”). PCT may incur significant\nexpenses as a result of legal matters relating to the Hindenburg Report. Additionally, on or about September 29, 2023, a putative class action complaint was\nfiled against PCT, as well as certain officers and directors asserting violations of federal securities law. The complaint alleges certain directors and officers made\nmaterially false and misleading statements regarding its operations following a two-hour power outage that occurred in August 2023. The total cost associated\nwith these matters will depend on many factors, including the duration of these matters and any related finding.\nIn addition, from time to time, PCT may also be involved in legal proceedings and investigations arising in the ordinary course of business, including those\nrelating to employment matters, relationships with our feedstock suppliers and offtake partners as well as strategic partners, intellectual property disputes,\nadditional volatility in the market price of our securities, and other business matters. Any such claims or investigations may be time-consuming, costly, divert\nmanagement resources, or otherwise have a material adverse effect on PCT’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe results of litigation and other legal proceedings are inherently uncertain and adverse judgments or settlements may result in materially adverse monetary\ndamages or injunctive relief against PCT. Any claims or litigation, even if fully indemnified or insured, could damage PCT’s reputation and make it more difficult\nto compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future. The litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings described under Legal Proceedings\nin Note 14, Contingencies, to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are subject to future\ndevelopments and management’s view of these matters may change in the future.\nRisks Related to PCT’s Operations\nThe Ironton Facility will not be completed in the originally-expected timeframe. Further delays in commissioning and obtaining an independent\nengineer’s completion certificate could severely impact PCT’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nPCT will not be able to achieve full commissioning and the certification required by an independent engineer of the Ironton Facility in the expected timeframe or\nat all due to a variety of factors, including, achieving continuous operations of the Ironton Facility and producing recycled pellets at nameplate capacity for five\nconsecutive days. Failure to obtain the certification could severely impact PCT’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, and impact\nPCT’s ability to comply with certain covenants under its debt agreements, including the Loan Agreement.\nThe construction and commissioning of any new project, including the Augusta Facility and the Feed PreP facilities, is dependent on a number of contingencies,\nmany of which are beyond PCT’s control. There is also a risk that significant unanticipated costs or delays could arise due to, among other things, errors or\nomissions, unanticipated or concealed construction site conditions, including subsurface conditions, unforeseen technical issues or increases in plant and\nequipment costs, insufficiency of water supply and other utility infrastructure, or inadequate contractual arrangements. Should significant unanticipated costs\narise, this could have a material adverse impact on PCT’s business, financial performance and operations. No assurance can be given that construction will be\ncompleted, or will be completed without further delay, or as to whether PCT, which has provided a Guaranty of Completion of the Ironton Facility, will have\nsufficient funds available to complete construction. If the Ironton Facility is not completed, funds are not likely to be available to pay debt service on PCT’s\noutstanding debt.\nInitially, PCT will rely on a single facility for all of its operations.\nInitially, PCT will rely solely on the operations at the Ironton Facility. Adverse changes or developments affecting the Ironton Facility could impair PCT’s ability to\nproduce UPR resin and its business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Any shutdown or period of reduced production at the Ironton\nFacility, which may be caused by regulatory noncompliance or other issues, as well as other factors beyond its control, such as severe weather conditions,\nnatural disaster, fire, power interruption or outages, work stoppage, disease outbreaks or pandemics, equipment failure, delay in supply delivery, or shortages of\nmaterial, equipment, or labor, would significantly disrupt PCT’s ability to grow and produce UPR resin products in a timely manner, meet its contractual\nobligations and operate its business. PCT’s equipment is costly to replace or repair, and PCT’s\n14\nTable of Contents\nequipment supply chains may be disrupted in connection with pandemics, such as COVID-19, trade wars or other factors. If any material amount of PCT’s\nmachinery were damaged, it would be unable to predict when, if at all, it could replace or repair such machinery or find co-manufacturers with suitable\nalternative machinery, which could adversely affect PCT’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Performance guarantees may not\nbe sufficient to cover damages or losses, or the guarantors under such guarantees may not have the ability to pay. Any insurance coverage PCT has may not\nbe sufficient to cover all of its potential losses and may not continue to be available to PCT on acceptable terms, or at all.\nCybersecurity incidents and the failure to maintain the integrity of PCT’s systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties with which PCT does\nbusiness, could have a material adverse effect on PCT’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nPCT is subject to an increasing number of information technology vulnerabilities, threats and targeted computer crimes which pose a risk to the security of its\nsystems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of data. Disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that\nsupport PCT’s businesses, offtake partners, feedstock suppliers and customers, or cyber-attacks or security breaches of PCT’s networks or systems or of third\nparty suppliers and service providers, could result in the loss of customers and business opportunities, lawsuits, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention,\nreputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, and additional compliance costs, any of which could materially adversely affect PCT’s\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Increasing costs associated with cybersecurity protections may be costly and may also\nadversely affect the financial condition of PCT. While PCT attempts to mitigate these risks, PCT’s systems, data, networks, products, solutions and services\nremain potentially vulnerable to advanced and persistent cybersecurity threats.\nPCT also maintains and has access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information in its business that is subject to privacy and security laws,\nregulations and customer controls. Despite PCT’s efforts to protect such personal data or information, PCT’s facilities and systems and those of its customers,\nofftake partners, feedstock suppliers and third-party service providers may be vulnerable to cybersecurity incidents, theft, misplaced or loss of data,\nprogramming and/or human errors that could lead to the compromise of sensitive, confidential or personal data or information or unauthorized use or disruption\nof PCT’s systems and software.\nPCT may be unable to sufficiently protect its proprietary rights and may encounter disputes from time to time relating to its use of the intellectual\nproperty of third parties.\nPCT relies on its proprietary intellectual property, including registered trademarks and certain licensed intellectual property under the License Agreement and\nother documents to market, promote and sell UPR resin products. PCT monitors and protects against activities that might infringe, dilute, or otherwise harm its\ntrademarks and other intellectual property and relies on the relevant patent, trademark and other laws of the U.S. and other countries. However, PCT may be\nunable to prevent third parties from using its intellectual property without authorization. In addition, the laws of some non-U.S. jurisdictions, particularly those of\ncertain emerging markets, provide less protection for PCT’s proprietary rights than the laws of the U.S. and present greater risks of counterfeiting and other\ninfringement. To the extent PCT cannot protect its intellectual property, unauthorized use and misuse of PCT’s intellectual property could harm its competitive\nposition and have a material adverse effect on PCT’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nDespite PCT’s efforts to protect these rights, unauthorized third parties may attempt to duplicate or copy the proprietary aspects of its technology and\nprocesses. PCT’s competitors and other third parties independently may design around or develop similar technology or otherwise duplicate PCT’s services or\nproducts such that PCT could not assert its intellectual property rights against them. In addition, PCT’s contractual arrangements may not effectively prevent\ndisclosure of its intellectual property and confidential and proprietary information or provide an adequate remedy in the event of an unauthorized disclosure.\nMeasures in place may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of PCT’s intellectual property or proprietary information and the resulting loss of\ncompetitive advantage, and PCT may be required to litigate to protect its intellectual property and proprietary information from misappropriation or infringement\nby others, which is expensive, could cause a diversion of resources and may not be successful.\nPCT also may encounter disputes from time to time concerning intellectual property rights of others, and it may not prevail in these disputes. Third parties may\nraise claims against PCT alleging that PCT, or consultants or other third parties retained or indemnified by PCT, infringe on their intellectual property rights.\nSome third-party\n15\nTable of Contents\nintellectual property rights may be extremely broad, and it may not be possible for PCT to conduct its operations in such a way as to avoid all alleged violations\nof such intellectual property rights. Given the complex, rapidly changing and competitive technological and business environment in which PCT operates, and\nthe potential risks and uncertainties of intellectual property-related litigation, an assertion of an infringement claim against PCT may cause PCT to spend\nsignificant amounts to defend the claim, even if PCT ultimately prevails, pay significant money damages, lose significant revenues, be prohibited from using the\nrelevant systems, processes, technologies or other intellectual property (temporarily or permanently), cease offering certain products or services, or incur\nsignificant license, royalty or technology development expenses.\nMoreover, it has become common in recent years for individuals and groups to purchase intellectual property assets for the sole purpose of making claims of\ninfringement and attempting to extract settlements from companies such as PCT. Even in instances where PCT believes that claims and allegations of\nintellectual property infringement against it are without merit, defending against such claims is time consuming and expensive and could result in the diversion of\ntime and attention of PCT’s management and employees. In addition, although in some cases a third party may have agreed to indemnify PCT for such costs,\nsuch indemnifying party may refuse or be unable to uphold its contractual obligations. In other cases, insurance may not cover potential claims of this type\nadequately or at all, and PCT may be required to pay monetary damages, which may be significant.\nClimate change, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change may materially adversely affect our financial condition and\nbusiness operations.\nClimate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could present risks to PCT’s future\noperations from natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, wildfires or flooding. Such extreme weather\nconditions could pose physical risks to PCT’s facilities and disrupt operation of PCT’s supply chain and may impact operational costs. The impacts of climate\nchange on global resources may result in scarcity, which could in the future impact PCT’s ability to access sufficient equipment and materials in certain\nlocations and result in increased costs.\nAdditionally, concern over climate change could result in new legal or regulatory requirements designed to mitigate the effects of climate change on the\nenvironment. If such laws or regulations are more stringent than current legal or regulatory requirements, PCT may experience increased compliance burdens\nand costs to meet the regulatory obligations and may adversely affect raw material sourcing, manufacturing operations and the distribution of PCT’s products.\nPCT may be negatively impacted by volatility in the political and economic environment, such as the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East,\neconomic downturns and high interest rates, and a period of sustained inflation, which could have an adverse impact on PCT’s business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and prospects.\nTrade, monetary and fiscal policies, and political and economic conditions may substantially change, and credit markets may experience periods of constriction\nand variability. These conditions may impact PCT’s business. Further rising or prolonged high inflation may negatively impact PCT’s business and raise its\ncosts, specifically with respect to the construction of the Ironton Facility, the Augusta Facility, future purification facilities and various Feed PreP facilities. While\nPCT will take actions, wherever possible, to reduce the impact of the effects of inflation, in the case of sustained inflation, it could become increasingly difficult to\neffectively mitigate the increases to PCT’s costs. If PCT is unable to take actions to effectively mitigate the effect of the resulting higher costs, PCT’s business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely impacted.\nThe Federal Reserve recently raised interest rates multiple times in response to concerns about inflation and it may continue to hold them at their currently high\nrates longer than expected. Higher interest rates, coupled with reduced government spending and volatility in financial markets may increase economic\nuncertainty and affect PCT’s offtake partners, feedstock suppliers and potential customers. Similarly, the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine\nand the conflict in the Middle East has created extreme volatility in the global capital markets and is expected to have further global economic consequences,\nincluding disruptions of the global supply chain and energy markets. Furthermore, actual events involving limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance or other\nadverse developments that affect financial institutions, transactional counterparties or other companies in the financial services industry or the financial services\nindustry generally, or concerns or\n16\nTable of Contents\nrumors about any events of these kinds or other similar risks, have in the past and may in the future lead to market-wide liquidity concerns. Any such volatility,\ndisruptions or market-wide liquidity concerns may adversely affect PCT’s business or the third parties on whom it relies. If the equity and credit markets\ndeteriorate, including as a result of political or economic unrest or war, it may make necessary debt or equity financing, such as the financing necessary to fully\nfund the construction of the Augusta Facility, future purification facilities and currently contemplated and future Feed PreP facilities and otherwise finance PCT’s\nexpansion, more difficult to obtain in a timely manner or on favorable terms, more costly or more dilutive. Increased or sustained inflation can adversely affect\nPCT by increasing its costs, including labor and employee benefit costs. In addition, higher or sustained inflation, macro turmoil, uncertainty and market-wide\nliquidity concerns could also adversely affect PCT’s offtake partners, feedstock suppliers and potential customers, which could have an adverse impact on\nPCT’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Related to PCT’s Production of UPR Resin\nThere is no guarantee the Technology is scalable to commercial-scale operation.\nThe Technology is based upon generally available commercial equipment to process contaminated polypropylene into clean recycled polypropylene product.\nCertain of the equipment to be utilized in the Ironton Facility has not operated with the same feedstock in a commercial mode. While PCT has constructed the\nFEU to demonstrate the process using the same or similar equipment (except at a smaller scale) as the commercial-scale Ironton Facility, the FEU does not\noperate at a commercial-scale. The collective test data was used to design the Ironton Facility equipment for commercial scale and testing under the intended\noperating conditions and configuration for the commercial-scale operation to verify reproducibility of results including color, melt flow index, moldability (tensile\nmodulus and other measures) and the odor of the final PCT-produced polypropylene product. While that testing indicated that the FEU can generate recycled\npolypropylene product that on average meets all of its key parameter targets, PCT cannot guarantee these results will be achieved in commercial-scale\noperation. Further, of the four quality parameters for UPR resin, odor is the most difficult to characterize and measure. PCT’s goal is to generate product that will\nsignificantly reduce the odor of the offtake and be comparable or nearly comparable to virgin polypropylene with respect to level of odor, but PCT cannot\nguarantee that the Ironton Facility will be capable of achieving the quality parameters of UPR resin, performance guarantees or meeting the requirements of the\ncurrently applicable environmental permits. The Ironton Facility’s failure to achieve the quality parameters for UPR resin and performance guarantees or meet\nthe requirements of the currently applicable environmental permits could impact PCT’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects if the\npossible shortfalls versus specification are not effectively remedied per contract.\nFurthermore, PCT’s first multi-line facility, the Augusta Facility, which will be located in Augusta, Georgia, will be PCT’s first scaled up multi-line facility model.\nPCT is currently working on pre-engineering for the design and installation of multiple commercial lines at the Augusta Facility and there is no guaranty that\nthese efforts will be successful. If the Augusta Facility fails to achieve the expected efficiencies, including across the construction and permitting processes, as\nwell as fails to reduce average capital expenditures per plant and reduce overall operating costs, PCT’s business, financial condition, results of operations and\nprospects could be materially adversely impacted.\nPCT may not be successful in finding future strategic partners for continuing development of additional offtake and feedstock opportunities.\nPCT may seek to develop additional strategic partnerships to increase feedstock supply and offtake amount due to capital costs required to develop the UPR\nresin product or manufacturing constraints. PCT may not be successful in efforts to consummate existing strategic endeavors, or establish such strategic\npartnerships and other alternative arrangements for the UPR resin product or Technology because PCT’s research and development pipeline may be\ninsufficient, PCT’s product may be deemed to be at too early of a stage of development for collaborative effort or third parties may not view PCT’s product as\nhaving the requisite potential to demonstrate commercial success.\nIf PCT is unable to reach agreements with existing or future collaborators on a timely basis, on acceptable terms or at all, PCT may have to curtail the\ndevelopment of UPR resin product, reduce or delay the development program, delay potential commercialization, reduce the scope of any sales or marketing\nactivities or increase expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at PCT’s own expense. If\n17\nTable of Contents\nPCT elects to fund development or commercialization activities on its own, PCT may need to obtain additional expertise and additional capital, which may not be\navailable on acceptable terms or at all. If PCT fails to enter into collaborations and does not have sufficient funds or expertise to undertake the necessary\ndevelopment and commercialization activities, PCT may not be able to further develop product candidates and PCT’s business, financial condition, results of\noperations and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\nPCT’s failure to secure waste polypropylene could have a negative impact on PCT’s business, financial condition, results of operations and\nprospects.\nPCT’s ability to procure a sufficient quantity and quality of post-industrial and post-consumer waste that contains high levels of polypropylene as feedstock is\ndependent upon certain factors outside of PCT’s control including, but not limited to, changes to pricing levels for waste polypropylene, recycled polypropylene\nand non-recycled polypropylene, shortages in supply, interruptions affecting suppliers (including those due to operational restraints, industrial relations,\ntransportation difficulties, accidents or natural disasters), or the introduction of new laws or regulations that make access to waste polypropylene more difficult or\nexpensive. Additionally, while PCT believes it has sourced sufficient feedstock of desirable quality and with high levels of polypropylene, it cannot guarantee that\nfeedstock suppliers will have sufficient quantities available and at the appropriate specifications in accordance with their respective agreements with PCT. If\nfeedstock is not available to PCT in sufficient quantity and of requisite quality and with high levels of polypropylene, PCT’s business, financial condition, results\nof operations and prospects could be materially adversely impacted.\nBecause PCT’s global expansion requires sourcing feedstock and supplies from around the world (including Asia and Europe) changes to\ninternational trade agreements, tariffs, import and excise duties, taxes or other governmental rules and regulations could adversely affect PCT’s\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nPCT’s global expansion model will require sourcing feedstock from suppliers around the world. The U.S. federal government or other governmental bodies may\npropose changes to international trade agreements, tariffs, taxes and other government rules and regulations. If any restrictions or significant increases in costs\nor tariffs are imposed related to feedstock sourced from Asia, Europe, or elsewhere, as a result of amendments to existing trade agreements, and PCT’s supply\ncosts consequently increase, PCT may be required to raise UPR resin product prices, which may result in decreased margins, the loss of customers, and a\nmaterial adverse effect on PCT’s financial results. The extent to which PCT’s margins could decrease in response to any future tariffs is uncertain. PCT\ncontinues to evaluate the impact of effective trade agreements, as well as other recent changes in foreign trade policy on its supply chain, costs, sales and\nprofitability, which could negatively impact PCT’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Any such impact could be material.\nThere is no guarantee the Feed PreP facilities will be viable or achieve the expected efficiencies.\nIn conjunction with the Augusta Facility and other future purification facilities, PCT will also build and operate Feed PreP facilities in locations geographically\nnear the feed sources in an effort to optimize PCT’s supply chain economics. These Feed PreP facilities are expected to employ feedstock processing systems\nwith advanced sorting capabilities that can handle various types of plastics in addition to polypropylene (designated as no. 5 plastic), such as plastic bales\nbetween no. 1 and no. 7. There is no guarantee that the Feed PreP facilities will be successful. If the feedstock processing systems don’t operate as expected,\nor in a commercially viable manner or are constrained from receiving permits necessary to operate the facilities by city, country or state regulations; the Feed\nPreP facilities fail to achieve the expected efficiencies, including due to increased shipping costs; as well as fail to reduce average expenditures on feedstock\nand reduce overall operating costs, PCT’s business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be materially adversely impacted.\nThere is no guarantee the “Feedstock+” pricing model will be successful.\nPCT’s Feedstock+ pricing model for offtake agreements uses a formula based on: (i) a secondary materials per pound pricing index for curbside bales divided\nby a fixed polypropylene yield loss modifier plus (ii) a fixed base price per pound covering PCT’s operating and conversion costs. The Feedstock+ pricing model\nis designed to mitigate PCT’s operating margins by incorporating the feedstock market price fluctuations, upside and downside, into the UPR price. There is no\nguarantee that the “Feedstock+” pricing model will be successful and that most of or all of the counterparties will enter into offtake agreements with PCT using\nthis pricing model in sufficient numbers or at all. Additionally, counterparties may attempt to reduce or eliminate the fixed base price which would reduce and\npotentially eliminate the effort to de-risk PCT’s operating margins. If PCT is unable to\n18\nTable of Contents\nincorporate its “Feedstock+” pricing model into its future offtake agreements, in part or at all, or unable to negotiate a sufficiently high fixed base price or\nprocure feedstock above the secondary materials markets pricing index, PCT’s business, financial condition, and results of operations and prospects could be\nmaterially adversely impacted.\nPCT is subject to many hazards and operational risks at its manufacturing facility, that can result in potential injury to individuals, disrupt its\nbusiness, (including interruptions or disruptions in operations at its facilities), and subject PCT to liability and increased costs, (any of which could\nhave a material adverse effect on PCT’s business, financial condition and results of operations).\nPCT’s processes involve the controlled use of chemicals, including flammable and combustible materials that are potentially hazardous. As a result, PCT’s\noperations are subject to various industrial risks, including discharges or releases of flammable or hazardous materials, dangers resulting from confined\noperating spaces, fires, explosions, and mechanical failures. These risks can result in personal injury, loss of life, catastrophic damage to or destruction of\nproperty and equipment or environmental damage, and related legal proceedings, including those commenced by regulators, neighbors, or others. They may\nalso result in an unanticipated interruption or suspension of our operations and the imposition of liability. Notwithstanding PCT’s extensive safety procedures and\ntraining, relief and depressurization systems, emergency shutdown systems, safety instrumented systems and interlocks, fire and gas detection, and fire\nsuppression systems, the risk of injury or property damage cannot be completely eliminated. While PCT believes that it maintains adequate insurance\ncoverage, PCT cannot guarantee that it will be able to maintain adequate insurance at reasonable rates or that its insurance coverage will be adequate to cover\nfuture claims that may arise. In the event of an incident or accident, PCT’s business could be disrupted and PCT could be liable for damages, and any such\nliability could exceed PCT’s resources, and have a negative impact on its financial condition and results of operations. The loss or shutdown over an extended\nperiod of operations at any of PCT’s facilities or any losses relating to these risks could also have a material adverse impact on its business, financial condition,\nresults of operations and prospects.\nRisks Related to the Market for UPR Resin\nThe market for UPR resin is still in the development phase and the acceptance of UPR resin by manufacturers and potential customers is not\nguaranteed.\nThe customer approval process for UPR resin products may take longer than expected and certain potential customers may be slow to accept the product\nproduced by PCT or may not accept it at all. PCT has agreed to a strategic partnership term sheet to enter into an offtake agreement with a term of 20 years,\nwhereby PCT guarantees the UPR resin products to meet specific criteria for color and opacity. There is no odor specification in the offtake agreements. Any\nsuch changes to the strategic partnership term sheet may require modifications to PCT’s executed offtake agreements for (i) the Ironton Facility, and (ii) the\nAugusta Facility. Pursuant to the strategic partnership term sheet and PCT’s executed offtake agreements, PCT must provide samples of the product to each\ncustomer so that the customer may determine if the product meets specifications, regulatory and legal requirements, customer’s internal policies, and technical,\nsafety, and other qualifications for UPR resin use in the customer’s products. The inability of PCT to provide product of sufficient quantity and quality for sale\npursuant to the offtake agreements is likely to materially adversely affect PCT’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. The premium\npricing depicted in all recent offtake agreements may also adversely affect the acquisition of new customers. Furthermore, future market trends for recycled\nproduct, changes in brand owner strategies and changes in consumer preferences for circular or low carbon footprint products could reduce PCT’s customer’s\ndemand for UPR resin, which would be likely to materially adversely affect PCT’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nCertain of PCT’s offtake agreements are subject to index pricing, and fluctuation in index prices may adversely impact PCT’s financial results.\nPCT expects the price of its UPR resin to continue to command a premium over the price of virgin resin and generally not be subject to fluctuations in the price\nof virgin polypropylene, but there is no guarantee of this result. While most offtake agreements have been executed using the Feedstock + pricing model,\ncertain of PCT’s legacy strategic partnership agreements’ pricing formulas for UPR resin use a pricing formula based on fixed and index pricing using historical\nand forecast pricing for virgin resin produced from fossil fuels. If PCT is unable to modify the legacy terms to a Feedstock+ pricing or should the modeled index\nprice for virgin resin be\n19\nTable of Contents\nmaterially lower than the cost to produce UPR resin from waste polypropylene feedstock, PCT would have to absorb the cost difference between virgin resin\nand UPR resin production for those customers, and PCT’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be materially adversely\nimpacted.\nCompetition could reduce demand for PCT’s products or negatively affect PCT’s sales mix or price realization. Failure to compete effectively by\nmeeting consumer preferences, developing and marketing innovative solutions, maintaining strong customer service and distribution relationships,\nand expanding solutions capabilities and reach could adversely affect PCT’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWhile PCT expects to produce unique UPR resin products, PCT operates in a competitive global market for polypropylene sources — virgin and recycled\npolypropylene. Competitors or new entrants might develop new products or technologies which compete with PCT and its proprietary Technology. PCT cannot\npredict changes that might affect its competitiveness or whether existing competitors or new entrants might develop products that reduce demand for PCT’s\nUPR resin products. The development of new products or technologies which compete with PCT’s UPR resin products may have a material adverse effect on\nPCT’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIn addition, PCT has granted a sublicense of P&G intellectual property back to P&G under the terms of the License Agreement, with a limited right to sublicense\nby P&G (the “Grant Back”). Under the Grant Back, for five years after the effective date of the License Agreement, the aggregate tonnage that may be produced\nunder the Grant Back will be capped at a certain level per year worldwide. Beyond year 5, that aggregate annual tonnage will be expanded for each of the six\nregions worldwide. P&G has agreed that territory under the Grant Back will exclude the start of construction of a plant within a certain radius of the Ironton\nFacility for five years from the effective date of the License Agreement. If P&G is able to establish production, either on its own or through a sublicense\nagreement with another partner, in any territory, P&G production will remain capped within that territory beyond the 5 years. If P&G sublicenses the P&G\nintellectual property under the Grant Back to other manufacturers, UPR resin production and supply could increase, adversely impacting PCT’s business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Developments\nPCT may not be able to meet applicable regulatory requirements for the use of PCT’s UPR resin in food grade applications, and, even if the\nrequirements are met, complying on an ongoing basis with the numerous regulatory requirements applicable to the UPR resin and PCT’s facilities\nwill be time-consuming and costly.\nThe use of UPR resin in food grade applications is subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). The FDA has established certain\nguidelines for the use of recycled plastics in food packaging, as set forth in the “Guidance for Industry - Use of Recycled Plastics in Food Packaging: Chemistry\nConsiderations (August 2006).” In order for the UPR resin to be used in food grade applications, PCT will request one or more Letters of No Objection (“LNO”)\nfrom the FDA.\nOn September 10, 2021, PCT filed for an FDA LNO, for Conditions of Use A – H. Conditions of Use describe the temperature and duration at which a material\nshould be tested to simulate the way the material is intended to be used. Conditions of Use C – H address many consumer product packaging requirements,\nincluding applications for hot filled and pasteurized, as well as room temperature, refrigerated and frozen applications. Generally speaking, Conditions of Use A\nand B relate to extreme temperature applications. The September LNO submission also defines the feedstock sources for the Company’s planned commercial\nrecycling process, and the September LNO submission pertained to (i) food grade post-industrial recycled feedstocks and (ii) food grade curbside post-\nconsumer recycled feedstocks.\nThe FDA confirmed receipt of the submission on September 13, 2021 and followed up with additional questions and a request for clarification in a letter\nreceived by PCT on January 7, 2022. PCT responded to the FDA’s questions on February 17, 2022.\nOn September 6, 2022, PCT received two separate notifications from the FDA with respect to the following two feedstock sources:\n20\nTable of Contents\n(i) Food grade post-industrial recycled feedstocks: an FDA opinion letter approving Conditions of Use A – H and\n(ii) Food-grade post-consumer recycled feedstock from stadiums: an FDA LNO for Conditions of Use E – G.\nThe Company’s FDA food contact grades are capable of being used for all food types per the conditions of use listed and per all applicable authorizations in the\nfood contact regulations listed in the 21 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21).\nThe process for obtaining further LNOs will include FDA evaluation of both the PCT purification process, the Technology, as well as the recycled feedstock\nresin. The Company is conducting additional testing and plans to make further LNO submissions for additional post-consumer recycled feedstock sources and\nexpanded Conditions of Use. In addition, as needed, individual surrogate challenge testing and migration studies will be conducted to simulate articles in contact\nwith food. Surrogate challenge testing can be used in lieu of, or in conjunction with, migration testing for the FDA’s evaluation of PCT’s Technology. The need\nfor migration testing is informed by the results from the surrogate challenge testing.\nThe process of obtaining FDA regulatory approval requires the expenditure of substantial time, of up to one year, and significant financial resources. The FDA\ncould refuse to approve further LNO applications (in whole or in part), a decision may be delayed if the FDA has questions about the data or other aspects of\nthe filing, or the review schedule may be extended if there are a significant number of LNO requests pending since the FDA is under no time limit to decide on\nLNO requests. All of the above would have an adverse effect on PCT’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nFurthermore, changes in regulatory requirements, laws and policies, or evolving interpretations of existing regulatory requirements, laws and policies, may result\nin increased compliance costs, delays, capital expenditures and other financial obligations that could adversely affect PCT’s business, financial condition, results\nof operations and prospects.\nPCT expects to encounter regulations in most if not all of the countries in which PCT may seek to expand, and PCT cannot be sure that it will be able to obtain\nnecessary approvals in a timely manner or at all. If PCT’s UPR resin does not meet applicable regulatory requirements in a particular country or at all, then PCT\nmay face reduced market demand in those countries and PCT’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects will be adversely affected.\nThe various regulatory schemes applicable to PCT’s UPR resin will continue to apply following initial approval. Monitoring regulatory changes and ensuring our\nongoing compliance with applicable requirements is time-consuming and may affect PCT’s business, financial condition, results of operation and prospects. If\nPCT fails to comply with such requirements on an ongoing basis, PCT may be subject to fines or other penalties, or may be prevented from selling UPR resin\nproducts, and PCT’s business, financial condition, results of operation and prospects may be harmed.\nThe operation of and construction of the Ironton Facility is subject to governmental regulation.\nUnder the loan agreement entered into in connection with PCT’s outstanding Revenue Bonds (the “Loan Agreement”), PCT must: (i) not commence\nconstruction or operation of the Ironton Facility prior to receipt of all applicable permits and easements required for the particular phase of construction or\noperation; (ii) abide by the terms and conditions of all such permits and easements; and (iii) operate the Ironton Facility at all times in the manner required or\npermitted by such permits and easements.\nPCT has not identified any technical or engineering circumstances that it believes would prevent the issuance of the key permits and approvals required for\nconstruction and operation of the Ironton Facility in the ordinary course consistent with the planned construction of the Ironton Facility. Delays in or failure to\nobtain and maintain any required permit or approval, or delay in satisfying or failure to satisfy any condition or requirement or any approval or permit could delay\nor prevent completion of the Ironton Facility or result in additional costs or reduced revenues. Federal, state and local statutory and regulatory requirements\napplicable to construction and operation of the Ironton Facility are subject to change. No assurance can be given that PCT or any other affected party will be\nable to comply with such changes. Additional statutory or regulatory requirements may be imposed upon both the Ironton Facility and the Augusta Facility, as\nwell as any additional facilities, which might materially increase costs of operation or maintenance.\n21\nTable of Contents\nLegislative, regulatory or judicial developments could affect PCT’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nPCT is subject to extensive air, water and other environmental and workplace safety laws and regulations at the federal and state level. In addition, PCT will be\nsubject to additional regulatory regimes upon expanding to new regions, including foreign regulatory authorities in the European Union (“EU”) such as the\nEuropean Commission, the European Food Safety Authority (“EFSA”), and similar regulatory authorities elsewhere, such as in Asia. Some of these laws require\nor may require PCT to operate under a number of environmental permits. These laws, regulations and permits can often require pollution control equipment or\noperational changes to limit actual or potential impacts to the environment. These laws, regulations and permit conditions may change and become more\ndifficult to comply with. A violation of these laws, regulations or permit conditions could result in substantial fines, damages, criminal sanctions, permit\nrevocations and/or a plant shutdown. Any such action may have a material adverse effect on PCT’s business, financial condition, results of operations and\nprospects.\nRisks Related to Human Capital Management\nPCT is dependent on management and key personnel, and PCT’s business would suffer if it fails to retain its key personnel and attract additional\nhighly skilled employees.\nPCT’s success is dependent on the specialized skills of its management team and key operating personnel. This may present particular challenges as PCT\noperates in a highly specialized industry sector, which may make replacement of its management team and key operating personnel difficult. A loss of the\nmanagers or key employees, or their failure to satisfactorily perform their responsibilities, could have an adverse effect on PCT’s business, financial condition,\nresults of operations and prospects.\nPCT’s future success will depend on its ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified personnel for all areas of its organization,\nparticularly research and development, recycling technology, operations and sales. Trained and experienced personnel are in high demand and may be in short\nsupply. Many of the companies with which PCT competes for experienced employees have greater resources than PCT does and may be able to offer more\nattractive terms of employment. In addition, PCT invests significant time and expense in training employees, which increases their value to competitors that may\nseek to recruit them. PCT may not be able to attract, develop and maintain the skilled workforce necessary to operate its business, and labor expenses may\nincrease as a result of a shortage in the supply of qualified personnel, which will negatively impact PCT’s business, financial condition, results of operations and\nprospects.\nRisks Related to PCT’s common stock\nCertain current and former stockholders of PCT have the right to elect a certain number of directors to PCT’s board of directors.\nPursuant to a letter agreement entered into between Pure Crown LLC (“Pure Crown”) and PCT, dated October 5, 2020, Pure Crown is entitled to select one\ndirector to the board of directors of PCT (the “Pure Crown Director”), and Pure Crown designated Ms. Tanya Burnell as the current Pure Crown Director. For so\nlong as Pure Crown has this right to select one director to the board of PCT, any vacancy with respect to the Pure Crown Director may only be filled by Pure\nCrown.\nFurthermore, pursuant to the board representation agreement, dated March 7, 2022, between PCT and Sylebra Capital Management (an entity affiliated with\nthe Pre-PIPE Investors, “Sylebra Capital”) in connection with the Offering (as defined below), Sylebra Capital has been granted the right to designate (i) one\nperson to be nominated for election to the Board so long as Sylebra Capital together with its affiliates beneficially owns at least 10.0% of the Company’s\ncommon stock, and (ii) two persons to be nominated for election to the Board so long as Sylebra Capital together with its affiliates beneficially owns at least\n15.0% of the Company’s common stock, subject to certain exceptions, including that Sylebra Capital together with its affiliates will not be entitled to designate\nmore than two nominees. Accordingly, Sylebra Capital is currently entitled to designate two directors for nomination, and has designated Jeff Fieler (as an\naffiliate of the Pre-PIPE holders) and Dan Coombs to serve on the board of PCT. Further, Jeff Fieler served as Interim Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) of PCT\nfrom December 1, 2023, following Lawrence C. Somma’s resignation as CFO, to February 19, 2024, upon the appointment of Jaime Vasquez as CFO.\n22\nTable of Contents\nFuture offerings of debt or offerings or issuances of equity securities by PCT may adversely affect the market price of PCT’s common stock or\notherwise dilute all other stockholders.\nIn the future, PCT may attempt to obtain financing or further increase PCT’s capital resources by issuing additional shares of PCT’s common stock or offering\ndebt or other equity securities, including commercial paper, medium-term notes, senior or subordinated notes, debt securities convertible into equity or shares of\npreferred stock. PCT also expects to grant equity awards to employees, directors, and consultants under PCT’s stock incentive plans. The implementation of\nPCT’s business strategy could require substantial additional capital in excess of cash from operations. PCT would expect to obtain the capital required for the\nimplementation of its business strategy through a combination of additional issuances of equity, corporate indebtedness and/or cash from operations, which\nmay be effectuated through private financings.\nIssuing additional shares of PCT’s common stock or other equity securities or securities convertible into equity may dilute the economic and voting rights of\nPCT’s existing stockholders or reduce the market price of PCT’s common stock or both. Upon liquidation, holders of such debt securities and preferred shares, if\nissued, and lenders with respect to other borrowings would receive a distribution of PCT’s available assets prior to the holders of PCT’s common stock.\nPreferred shares, if issued, could have a preference with respect to liquidating distributions or a preference with respect to dividend payments that could limit\nPCT’s ability to pay dividends to the holders of PCT’s common stock. PCT’s decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions\nand other factors beyond PCT’s control, which may adversely affect the amount, timing and nature of PCT’s future offerings.\nConversion of the Convertible Notes may dilute the ownership interest of PCT stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of our common\nstock.\nThe conversion of some or all of the Convertible Notes may dilute the ownership interests of PCT stockholders. Upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, PCT\nhas the option to pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of PCT common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of PCT common stock. If PCT\nelects to settle the conversion obligation in shares of PCT common stock or a combination of cash and shares of PCT common stock, any sales in the public\nmarket of PCT common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of PCT common stock. In addition, the existence of\nthe Convertible Notes and/or the affiliate Convertible Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Convertible Notes\nand/or the affiliate Convertible Notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of the Convertible Notes and/or the affiliate Convertible\nNotes into shares of PCT common stock could depress the price of PCT common stock.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nPCT may be unable to obtain additional financing to fund the operations and growth of the business.\nPCT requires additional financing to fund its operations and growth. The failure to secure additional financing could have a material adverse effect on the\ncontinued development and growth of PCT. Such financings may result in dilution to stockholders, issuance of securities with priority as to liquidation and\ndividend and other rights more favorable than common stock, imposition of debt covenants and repayment obligations, or other restrictions that may adversely\naffect its business. In addition, PCT may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if it believes that it has\nsufficient funds for current or future operating plans. There can be no assurance that financing will be available to PCT on favorable terms, or at all. The inability\nto obtain financing when needed may make it more difficult for PCT to operate its business or implement its growth plans.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nInformation about cybersecurity risks and PCT’s risk management processes is collected, analyzed and considered as part of PCT’s overall enterprise risk\nmanagement program. PCT has a cybersecurity risk management program intended to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of PCT’s information\nsystems and data by assessing, identifying, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats.\n23\nTable of Contents\nPCT’s cybersecurity risk management program includes:\n• risk assessments designed to help identify cybersecurity risks to PCT’s information systems, data, services, and its broader enterprise IT environment;\n• a security team principally responsible for managing PCT’s cybersecurity risk assessment processes, PCT’s security controls, and PCT’s response to\ncybersecurity incidents;\n• the use of certain external service providers, where appropriate, to assess, test or otherwise assist with aspects of PCT’s security processes;\n• cybersecurity awareness training of PCT’s employees, incident response personnel and senior management;\n• a cybersecurity incident response plan that includes procedures for responding to cybersecurity incidents; and\n• a third-party cyber risk management process for third-parties that interact with our systems and data including, among other things, a security assessment\nand contracting program for such third-parties based on their risk profile.\nAs of the date of this Form 10-K, PCT has not identified risks as a result of prior cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, PCT’s operations, business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. PCT faces certain ongoing risks from cybersecurity threats\nthat, if realized, are reasonably likely to materially affect PCT, including PCT’s operations, business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. See\n“Risk Factors – Cybersecurity incidents and the failure to maintain the integrity of PCT’s systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties with which PCT does\nbusiness, could have a material adverse effect on PCT’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.”\nCybersecurity Governance\nPCT’s Board considers cybersecurity risk as part of its risk oversight. Oversight of cybersecurity and other information technology risks, as well as\nmanagement’s implementation of PCT’s cybersecurity risk management program, is the responsibility of the Board.\nWhile the Board has delegated to the Audit and Finance Committee the responsibility to discuss with management and the independent auditors PCT’s\nunderlying policies and guidelines with respect to risk assessment and risk management, including with respect to cybersecurity, data privacy, data security and\ncontinuity, not less than once annually, the full Board receives a briefing from management on PCT’s cybersecurity risk management program and ongoing\ninitiatives and strategies to address and monitor specific cybersecurity risks. Presentations on cybersecurity matters are provided to the Board by PCT’s\ninformation technology (“IT”) leadership. In addition, management updates the Audit and Finance Committee and the Board, as necessary, regarding any\nsignificant cybersecurity incidents, to the extent any occur. PCT’s Director of IT has over 20 years of experience in cybersecurity management and information\nsystems. Management along with third-party assistance from a recognized expert in unified cyber security and compliance expertise, monitors, manages, and\nassesses PCT’s risks from cybersecurity threats.\nItem 2. Properties\nPCT owns the land that will be used for the Ironton Facility located in Lawrence County, Ohio. PCT, through a subsidiary, also leases a building and its\napproximately two acres of land located diagonally from the FEU to use for PCT’s operations from the Lawrence Economic Development Commission. The\nlease was executed in May of 2021 and expires in May 2026, though PCT may extend the lease for up to three additional five-year terms.\nPCT leases its corporate headquarters office space, which consists of approximately 14,232 square feet located at 5950 Hazeltine National Drive, Suite 300,\nOrlando, Florida 32822, and expires in 2027.\n24\nTable of Contents\nIn 2021, the Company entered into an operating lease of commercial land and building for its first Feed PreP facility in Winter Garden, Florida, which expires in\nAugust 2032.\nOn June 30, 2023, the Company and The Augusta Economic Development Authority (“AEDA”) executed a lease for a 150-acre tract in Augusta, Georgia, with\nthe ability to lease an adjacent second tract totaling approximately 50 acres, subject to various milestones. This property will house PCT’s first U.S. multi-line\nfacility. The land, buildings and equipment for the facility will be owned by the AEDA and will be leased to the Company under a legal sale-leaseback structure\nthat will provide certain local property tax incentives to the Company as lessee of the property. During the lease term and at the conclusion of the lease in 2044,\nthe Company will have the right to acquire title to the property from the AEDA for a nominal cost.\nIn 2023, the Company entered into an operating lease of commercial land and building for a feed PreP facility in Denver, Pennsylvania, which is expected to\ncommence mid to late 2024 with an initial term of 15 years and total minimum lease payments of $52.3 million.\nIn January 2023, the Company signed a real estate lease at the Port of Antwerp-Bruges’ NextGen District, where it plans to build its first purification facility in\nEurope, with an initial term of 30 years and total minimum lease payments over the term of the lease of approximately €27.7 million, subject to annual inflation\nadjustments. This lease commenced at the end of June 2023.\nEffective September 1, 2023, the Company executed an operating lease for a lab facility in Durham, North Carolina.\nItem 3.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis provides information which PCT’s management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of PCT’s\nconsolidated results of operations and financial condition. The discussion should be read together with the audited consolidated financial statements, together\nwith related notes thereto, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this “Management’s\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” to “we”, “us”, “our”, and “the Company” are intended to mean the business and\noperations of PCT and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nOverview\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc. (“PCT” or “Company”) is a Florida-based corporation focused on commercializing a patented purification recycling technology (the\n“Technology”), originally developed by The Procter & Gamble Company (“P&G”), for restoring waste polypropylene into resin, called ultra-pure recycled (“UPR”)\nresin, which has nearly identical properties and applicability for reuse as virgin polypropylene. PCT has a global license for the Technology from P&G. PCT’s\ngoal is to create an important new segment of the global polypropylene market that will assist multinational entities in meeting their sustainability goals, providing\nconsumers with polypropylene-based products that are sustainable, and reducing overall polypropylene waste in the world’s landfills and oceans.\nPCT’s process includes two steps: Feed Pre-Processing (“Feed PreP”) and the use of PCT’s recycling technology for purification. The Feed PreP step will\ncollect, sort, and prepare polypropylene waste (“feedstock”) for purification. The purification step is a purification recycling process that uses a combination of\nsolvent, temperature, and pressure to return the feedstock to near-virgin condition through a novel configuration of commercially available equipment and unit\noperations. The purification process puts the plastic through a physical extraction process using super critical fluids that both extract and filter out contaminants\nand purify the color, opacity, and odor of the plastic without changing the bonds of the polymer. By not altering the chemical makeup of the polymer, the\nCompany is able to use significantly less energy and reduce production costs as compared to virgin resin.\nThe Ironton Facility\nPCT commenced commissioning activities at its first commercial-scale plant in Lawrence County, Ohio (referred to herein as the “Ironton Facility”), in April 2023,\nachieved mechanical completion of the plant and commenced pellet production from post-industrial and post-consumer materials later in 2023. On June 28,\n2023, the independent construction monitor reviewing construction and commissioning of the Ironton Facility issued its certification confirming commencement\nof production of post-industrial recycled pellets, which was required to achieve a key milestone in connection with the Ironton Facility financing. The Ironton\nFacility leverages the existing infrastructure of PCT’s pilot facility known as the Feedstock Evaluation Unit (the “FEU”), which became operational in 2019, and\nthe Ironton Facility is expected to have UPR resin capacity of approximately 107 million pounds/year when fully operational. PCT sold an immaterial amount of\nUPR resin in 2023 but has not yet reached significant continuous operational volumes. PCT has experienced intermittent mechanical challenges during the\ncommissioning process including, but not limited to, limits in the rates at which certain contaminants can currently be removed from the purification process, as\nwell as challenges with continuous operations of the pelletizing system for finished product. While these mechanical issues are not uncommon for first-of-its kind\nmanufacturing facilities, the down-time needed to correct these issues is delaying the Ironton Facility reaching consistent sustainable production rates. We\nexpect the Ironton Facility to be fully operational later in 2024.\nAs of December 31, 2023, PCT anticipates that up to $12.5 million will be needed to complete the investment in the Ironton Facility, which relates to a\nperformance guarantee payment due after successful completion of a performance testing milestone.\nThe Augusta Facility\nIn July 2021, PCT reached an agreement with The Augusta Economic Development Authority (“AEDA”) to build its first U.S. facility with multiple lines for both\nFeed PreP and purification (“multi-line facility”) in Augusta, Georgia (the “Augusta Facility”). PCT expects the approximately 200-acre location to eventually\ninclude up to\n30\nTable of Contents\neight production lines, which are expected to collectively have UPR resin production capacity of approximately 1 billion pounds per year. When fully operational,\neach purification line at the Augusta Facility is expected to have annual production capacity of approximately 130 million pounds of PCT’s UPR resin. PureCycle\nhas allocated 40% of the Augusta Facility output, for Lines 1 and 2, to existing customers and expects that additional offtake agreements will continue to be\nnegotiated.\nOn June 30, 2023, PCT and the AEDA executed an Economic Development Agreement (“EDA”) related to the Company’s plans to construct the Augusta\nFacility. Pursuant to the EDA, PCT expects to receive certain property tax abatement benefits as well as certain other incentives, including site infrastructure\ndevelopment assistance (“Incentive Benefits”). In order to receive the Incentive Benefits under Phase One (as defined below) of the Augusta Project, PCT will\nbe obligated to create 82 full-time jobs with investments of at least $440 million no later than December 31, 2026. Through December 31, 2023, PCT has\ninvested approximately $84.9 million for pre-construction engineering and long-lead equipment for the benefit of Phase One investments. If PCT elects to\nactivate the second phase of the Augusta Project, PCT will be required to create an additional 25 full-time jobs and investments of $295 million no later than\nDecember 31, 2028. To the extent PCT fails to achieve an average of 80% of the jobs and investment commitments in any year over the 20-years of each\nphase, PCT will be required to make a repayment to the AEDA of a pro rata portion of the total value of the Incentive Benefits received by PCT in such year.\nAlso on June 30, 2023, PCT entered into a series of agreements with the AEDA to construct phase one (“Phase One”) of the Augusta Facility. PCT is leasing\n150 acres of land (“Real Property”) owned by the AEDA and will construct buildings, building equipment, and other structures (the “Improvements”) on the land.\nPCT will also acquire and install the necessary processing, warehousing, and other equipment, as well as conveyors and pipelines (the “Equipment”, together\nwith the Real Property and the Improvements, the “Augusta Project”). The Improvements and Equipment will be transferred to the AEDA and leased back by\nPCT. As noted above, PCT anticipates that the first portion of Phase One, will consist of one purification line and construction commenced prior to the end of\n2023. Also as noted above, construction of the first purification line must be completed by December 31, 2026.\nThe legal sale-leaseback structure provides the Incentive Benefits to PCT as lessee of the Augusta Project. PCT will remain the owner of the Improvements and\nEquipment for accounting purposes during the term of the lease as PCT will have the right to acquire title to the Augusta Project for a nominal amount during\nthe term and at the conclusion of the arrangement, which has an initial expiration date in 2044. The payments PCT makes to the AEDA during the term of the\narrangement are not otherwise expected to be material.\nAt the end of 2023, the Company commenced site preparation activities, including debris removal and site stabilization activities, and\ncontinued with payments to vendors for certain long lead-time equipment. Pursuant to the EDA, PCT must also show continuous\nconstruction progress, with regard to the first purification line under the first phase of the Augusta Project during 2024 or risk losing certain\nfuture Incentive Benefits. Market conditions remain challenging and have created uncertainty as to the timing or likelihood of success of\nthe currently anticipated project financing for the Augusta Facility. As a result, PCT is currently pursuing various structures for project\nfinancing of the Augusta Facility. While PCT remains confident in its ability to finance the Augusta Facility, it is limiting its expenses and\nadjusting its timeline in light of this uncertainty. If PCT is unable to raise additional debt or equity, when desired, or on terms favorable to\nPCT, PCT’s business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nFeedstock Pricing\nPCT sees a robust pipeline of demand for its recycled polypropylene and PCT is seeing market acceptance of its “Feedstock+” pricing model for its UPR resin.\nThe “Feedstock+” pricing model divides the market cost of feedstock by a set yield-loss and adds a fixed price, which effectively passes on the cost of feedstock\nand de-risks PCT’s operating margin volatility.\nFor the Ironton Facility, PCT’s feedstock price was linked, in part, to changes in the Chemical Market Analysis, the index for virgin polypropylene, in a price\nschedule that contained a fixed, collared price around an index price range, which was further adjusted based on the percentage of polypropylene in the\nfeedstock supplied. For the Augusta Facility and future purification facilities, PCT plans to link the feedstock price, in part, to the\n31\nTable of Contents\nprice of a no. 5 plastic bale of polypropylene as reported by recyclingmarkets.net (“Feedstock Market Pricing”). PCT will procure both feedstock in line with\nFeedstock Market Pricing as well as low value feedstocks that can be processed by PCT, below Feedstock Market Pricing for the Augusta Facility.\nPreP Facilities\nIn conjunction with the Augusta Facility, PCT also plans to build and operate Feed PreP facilities in locations geographically near the feed sources to optimize\nPCT’s supply chain economics. During the third quarter of 2022, PCT experienced challenges obtaining the necessary water and sewer permits to construct its\nfirst planned Feed PreP facility in Central Florida. PCT is evaluating its available recourses to obtain these permits, as well as potential legal remedies with\nregard to its obligations for the remaining 8 years of its 11-year lease agreement for the Central Florida facility. PCT is also evaluating alternative preprocessing\nsites in other locations. Also, on August 24, 2022, PCT signed a lease for a future PreP facility in Denver, Pennsylvania, which is expected to be operationally\nready in late 2024, provided we obtain the financing necessary for operational readiness. Throughout the second half of 2021, PCT developed a feedstock\nprocessing system with advanced sorting capabilities that can handle various types of plastics in addition to polypropylene (designated as no. 5 plastic). PCT’s\nenhanced sorting should allow PCT to process plastic bales between no. 1 and no. 7. PCT’s new Feed PreP facilities will extract polypropylene and ship it to\nPCT’s purification lines, while the non-polypropylene feed will be sorted, baled, and subsequently sold on the open market.\nLetter of No Objection Submission and the Granting of FDA Food Packaging Clearances for Certain Feedstocks\nOn September 10, 2021, PCT filed for a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) Letter of No Objection (“LNO”), for Conditions of Use A – H. Conditions of\nUse describe the temperature and duration at which a material should be tested to simulate the way the material is intended to be used. Conditions of Use C –\nH address many consumer product packaging requirements, including applications for hot filled and pasteurized, as well as room temperature, refrigerated and\nfrozen applications. Generally speaking, Conditions of Use A and B relate to extreme temperature applications. The LNO submission also defines the feedstock\nsources for the Company’s planned commercial recycling process, and this LNO submission pertained to (i) food grade post-industrial recycled feedstocks and\n(ii) food grade curbside post-consumer recycled feedstocks.\nThe FDA confirmed receipt of the submission on September 13, 2021 and followed up with additional questions and requests for clarification in a letter received\nby PCT on January 7, 2022. PCT responded to the FDA’s questions on February 17, 2022.\nOn September 6, 2022, PCT received two separate notifications from the FDA with respect to the following two feedstock sources:\n(i) Food grade post-industrial recycled feedstocks: an FDA opinion letter approving Conditions of Use A – H and\n(ii) Food-grade post-consumer recycled feedstock from stadiums: an FDA LNO for Conditions of Use E – G.\nThe Company’s FDA food contact grades are capable of being used for all food types per the conditions of use listed and per all applicable authorizations in the\nfood contact regulations listed in the 21 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21).\nThe Company is conducting additional testing and plans to make further LNO submissions for additional post-consumer recycled feedstock sources and\nexpanded Conditions of Use.\nFuture Expansion\nOn January 17, 2023, the Company announced its first European purification facility will be in Antwerp, Belgium. On October 20, 2022, the Company executed\na Joint Venture Agreement with SK geo centric Co., Ltd., to develop a UPR purification facility in Ulsan, South Korea. The parties will each hold an equal stake\nin the joint venture with completion of construction activities, pending necessary financing. The Company is also planning to expand its production capabilities\ninto Asia through negotiation of joint ventures with Mitsui & Co. Ltd. in Japan for in-country production and sales. Future expansion is dependent on successful\ncompletion of project financing.\n32\nTable of Contents\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nPCT generated an immaterial amount of revenue late in 2023 but has not yet reached significant continuous (i) operational volumes at the Ironton Facility or (ii)\nsignificant revenue generation. The Ironton Facility is expected to be fully operational later in 2024.\nOperating Costs\nOperating expenses to date have consisted mainly of personnel costs (including wages, salaries and benefits) and other costs directly related to operations at\nPCT’s operating facilities, including rent, depreciation, repairs and maintenance, utilities and supplies. Costs attributable to the design and development of the\nIronton Facility, Augusta Facility, and Feed PreP facilities in Central Florida and Denver, Pennsylvania, are capitalized and, when placed in service, will be\ndepreciated over the expected useful life of the asset. We expect our operating costs to increase as we continue to scale operations and increase headcount.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs related to the development of the Technology, the facilities and equipment that will use the\nTechnology to purify recycled polypropylene, and the processes needed to collect, sort, and prepare feedstock for purification. These include mainly personnel\ncosts, depreciation for long-lived assets, third-party consulting costs, and the cost of various recycled waste. We expect our research and development\nexpenses to increase for the foreseeable future as we increase investment in feedstock evaluation, including investment in new front-end feedstock mechanical\nseparators to improve feedstock purity and increase the range of feedstocks PCT can process economically. In addition, we are increasing our in-house\nfeedstock analytical capabilities, which will include additional supporting equipment and personnel.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses for our corporate, executive, finance and other administrative\nfunctions and professional services, including legal, audit and accounting services. We expect our selling, general, and administrative expenses to increase for\nthe foreseeable future as we scale headcount with the growth of our business, and as a result of operating as a public company, including compliance with the\nrules and regulations of the SEC, legal, audit, additional insurance expenses, investor relations activities, and other administrative and professional services.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our operating results for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021:\nYears ended December 31,\n$ % $ %\n(in thousands, except %) 2023 2022 Change Change 2021 Change Change\nCosts and expenses\nOperating costs $ 52,392 $ 23,724 $ 28,668 121 % $ 8,273 $ 15,451 187 %\nResearch and development 6,607 4,350 2,257 52 % 3,692 658 18 %\nSelling, general and administrative 54,902 53,244 1,658 3 % 57,615 (4,371) (8)%\nTotal operating costs and expenses 113,901 81,318 32,583 40 % 69,580 11,738 17 %\nInterest expense 31,368 2,312 29,056 1257 % 7,473 (5,161) (69)%\nInterest Income (10,863) (4,953) (5,910) 119 % (821) (4,132) 503 %\nChange in fair value of warrants (33,824) 5,842 (39,666) (679)% 1,476 4,366 296 %\nOther expense (income) 483 227 256 113 % (206) 433 (210)%\nProvision for income taxes 650 — 650 N/A — — — %\nNet loss $ 101,715 $ 84,746 $ 16,969 20 % $ 77,502 $ 7,244 9 %\n33\nTable of Contents\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\nOperating Costs\nThe increase was attributable to higher depreciation expense related to assets supporting operations of $11.5 million due primarily to placing the Ironton Facility\nassets in service in the second quarter of 2023, increased operational site costs of $8.0 million related to commissioning and operating the Ironton Facility,\nhigher employee costs of $5.5 million due primarily to increased headcount at the Ironton Facility, higher rent for operating facilities of $2.6 million, $0.5 million\nrelated to increased operational consulting due primarily to on-site third party assistance for Ironton Facility mechanical completion and commissioning activities,\nand $0.6 million of other net increases.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nThe increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to $1.1 million increased employee costs related to higher headcount of employees\naligned to research and development activities, $0.5 million increase in depreciation related to assets supporting research and development, and $0.6 million\nincrease in operational site costs related to facilities used in research and development.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nThe increase was attributable to higher professional, legal, and public company expenses of $3.5 million primarily related to bondholder waiver negotiations and\nthe AEDA transaction, higher insurance expenses of $1.4 million, and higher equity-based compensation of $0.7 million related to issuance of additional awards\nin 2023 and continued vesting of awards from previous years, offset by decreased employee costs of $3.6 million primarily due to reduction in bonus expense\ndriven by lower expected attainment of organizational goals over the prior period, as well as a net $0.3 million decrease in other SG&A costs.\nInterest expense\nThe increase was attributable to additional financing incurred in the second and third quarters of 2023, including closing of $250.0 million of green convertible\nsenior notes in August 2023, as well as ceasing capitalization of interest on the Revenue Bonds beginning in June 2023 as the plant is now in service.\nInterest income\nThe increase was attributable to higher interest earned on PCT’s investment portfolio and money market funds due to rising interest rates.\nChange in fair value of warrants\nThe increased benefit was attributable to the change in fair value of the Company’s liability-classified warrants, of which the primary drivers of the change in\nvaluation related to changes in the underlying price of PCT’s common stock, as well as fluctuations in volatility and reduction in the warrant terms with the\npassage of time.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021\nRefer to Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-\nK for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 for the results of operations discussion for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the fiscal year\nended December 31, 2021. This comparison was immaterially impacted by certain reclassifications to conform with the report classifications for these prior\nperiods.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIn 2023, PCT commenced commercial operations and sold an immaterial amount of UPR resin but has not yet reached significant continuous operational\nvolumes. PCT’s ongoing operations have, to date, been funded by a combination of equity financing through the issuance of units and debt financing through\nthe issuance of various debt instruments. The following is a summary of the components of our current liquidity. The Debt Securities Available for Sale represent\ninvestment holdings in highly liquid debt securities and commercial paper with an average maturity of less than one year. The Restricted Cash is restricted in\nterms of use primarily based on the\n34\nTable of Contents\nLoan Agreement and requires PureCycle: Ohio LLC, an Ohio limited liability company (“PCO”), to use the proceeds of the Revenue Bonds exclusively to\nconstruct and equip the Ironton Facility, fund a debt service reserve fund for the Series 2020A Bonds (as defined below), finance capitalized interest, and pay\nthe costs of issuing the Revenue Bonds. On March 5, 2024, a subsidiary of the Company Purchased (as defined below) the majority of the outstanding\nRevenue Bonds. In connection with the Purchase, the Indenture (as defined below) was amended and supplemented and substantially all covenants and\nEvents of Default (as defined below) contained in the Indenture, the Loan Agreement and certain of such other Financing Documents (as defined below) were\neliminated.

Further, PCT placed funds in an escrow account to support certain initial construction commitments for the Augusta\nFacility. These funds are recorded in Restricted Cash below.\n(in millions) December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nCash $ 73.4 $ 63.9\nDebt Securities Available for Sale 48.2 98.6\nUnrestricted Liquidity $ 121.6 $ 162.5\nLess: Other Ironton Set-aside — 54.6\nAvailable Unrestricted Liquidity $ 121.6 $ 107.9\nIronton Facility Construction $ — $ 13.2\nLiquidity Reserve 150.1 50.5\nCapitalized Interest and Debt Reserve 36.1 38.0\nOther Required Reserves Ironton 24.4 21.2\nAugusta Construction Escrow 14.4 39.4\nLetters of Credit and Other Collateral 4.1 1.3\nRestricted Cash (current and non-current) $ 229.1 $ 163.6\nRevenue Bonds $ 234.6 $ 233.5\nGreen Convertible Notes 220.7 —\nEquipment Financing Payable 21.6 —\nPure Plastic Note Payable 39.7 —\nAdd: Discount and Issuance Costs 47.6 16.1\nGross Bonds and Notes Payable $ 564.2 $ 249.6\nAs of December 31, 2023, PCT had $121.6 million of Available Unrestricted Liquidity and had Restricted Cash of $229.1 million. On March 15, 2023, PCT\nentered into a $150.0 million revolving credit facility with Sylebra Capital (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement\nmay be used for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. There are currently no borrowings under the Revolving Credit\nFacility.\nPCT sold an immaterial amount of UPR resin in 2023. Due to intermittent mechanical challenges during the\ncommissioning process of the Ironton Facility, the Ironton Facility has not yet reached the point of producing\nsignificant continuous operational volumes. While these mechanical issues are not uncommon for a first-of-its\nkind manufacturing facility, the downtime needed to correct these issues is a significant contributing factor to the delay of the Ironton Facility reaching the point\nof producing significant continuous operational volumes. We expect the Ironton Facility to be fully operational later in 2024.\nIn 2023, PCT negotiated the Second Limited Waiver (as defined below) with the Revenue Bondholders to remedy the September Milestone Event of Default (as\ndefined below) related to the Ironton Facility’s failure to meet the September Milestone – see Note 3 (“Notes Payable and Debt Instruments”) to the Notes to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K for additional information. Pursuant to the Second Limited Waiver,\nthe September Milestone Event of Default was waived, various Milestones were amended and extended and certain additional requirements were imposed\nupon PCT and its subsidiaries. PCO was unable to produce 4.45 million pounds of pellets from its feedstock for thirty\n35\nTable of Contents\nconsecutive days by December 31, 2023, and certain required performance testing of the Ironton Facility was not complete by February 28, 2024, each as\nrequired by the Second Limited Waiver, and therefore PCO entered a 90-day cure period after which point an Event of Default will be deemed to have\noccurred. Further, PCO expected to fail to meet certain annually calculated financial ratios as required. As described in further detail below, on March 5, 2024, a\nsubsidiary of the Company Purchased the majority of the outstanding Revenue Bonds and, in connection with such Purchase substantially all covenants and\nEvents of Default contained in the Indenture, including the potential Events of Defaults related to certain annually calculated financial ratios and missed\nmilestones referenced herein, the Loan Agreement and certain of such other Financing Documents were eliminated. See “Management’s Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Indebtedness - Revenue Bonds” for more information.\nAs of December 31, 2023, PCT anticipates that up to $12.5 million will be needed to complete the investment in the Ironton Facility, which relates to a\nperformance guarantee payment due after successful completion of a performance testing milestone. PCT also has other capital commitments of approximately\n$53.8 million related to long-lead equipment and pre-construction work for the Augusta Facility and $7.8 million for equipment and leases related to future Feed\nPreP and purification facilities, both in the U.S. and internationally. Moreover, there are interest payments of at least $38.0 million, as well as other ongoing\nmonthly costs associated with managing the Company.\nPursuant to the requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 205-40, Disclosure of\nUncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, management must evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the\naggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the date the consolidated financial\nstatements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are issued. This evaluation does not take into consideration the potential mitigating effect of\nmanagement’s plans that have not been fully implemented or are not within control of the Company as of the date the financial statements are issued. When\nsubstantial doubt exists under this methodology, management evaluates whether the mitigating effect of its plans sufficiently alleviates substantial doubt about\nthe Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The mitigating effect of management’s plans, however, is only considered if both (1) it is probable that the\nplans will be effectively implemented within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued, and (2) it is probable that the plans, when\nimplemented, will mitigate the relevant conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year\nafter the date that the consolidated financial statements are issued.\nPCT believes that its current level of Unrestricted Available Liquidity is not sufficient to fund operations, outstanding commitments, and further its future growth\nplans. The conditions described above raise substantial doubt regarding PCT’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least one year from the\ndate of issuance of the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn an effort to alleviate these conditions, PCT entered into two agreements. On March 5, 2024, a subsidiary of the Company Purchased 99% of the outstanding\nRevenue Bonds pursuant to the Purchase Agreement (as defined below). In connection with the Purchase, the Indenture was amended and supplemented and\nsubstantially all covenants and Events of Default contained in the Indenture, the Loan Agreement and certain of such other Financing Documents were\neliminated. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Indebtedness –\nRevenue Bonds” for more information. The Purchase reduced unrestricted liquidity by $74.5 million and restricted liquidity by $184.6 million. Also, on March 1,\n2024, PCT increased the Revolving Credit Facility from $150.0 million to $200.0 million, extended the maturity date to September 30, 2025, and obtained a\ncarveout to permit the Company to purchase the Revenue Bonds, pursuant to an amendment to the Credit Agreement with the Company (the “Borrower”),\nPureCycle Technologies Holdings Corp. and PureCycle Technologies, LLC (the “Guarantors”), Sylebra Capital Partners Master Fund, LTD, Sylebra Capital\nParc Master Fund, and Sylebra Capital Menlo Master Fund (collectively, the “Lenders”), and Madison Pacific Trust Limited (the “Administrative Agent” and\n“Security Agent”). Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement may be used for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate\npurposes – see Note 3 (“Notes Payable and Debt Instruments”) to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for additional information. Further, PCT intends to and has the ability to re-market some or all of the Purchased Revenue Bonds based on\nthe need for additional liquidity. The re-marketing process may require the addition of certain covenants to enhance the marketability of the Purchased Revenue\nBonds. The ability to\n36\nTable of Contents\nre-market the Purchased Revenue Bonds with any such additional new covenants would require a further amendment to, or waiver of, provisions included\nwithin the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Credit Agreement. After considering management’s plans to mitigate these conditions, including adjustment\nof expenditure timing and execution of the amendment to the Sylebra Revolving Credit Facility, PCT believes this substantial doubt has been alleviated and it\nhas sufficient liquidity to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months.\nPCT’s future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the funding mechanism and construction schedule of the Augusta Facility and other\nanticipated facilities outside the United States, build-out of multiple Feed PreP facilities, funding needs to support other business opportunities, funding for\ngeneral corporate purposes, and other challenges or unforeseen circumstances. As a low-revenue operating company, PCT continually reviews its cash\noutlays, pace of hiring, professional services and other spend, and capital commitments to proactively manage those needs in tandem with our Available\nUnrestricted Liquidity balance. For future growth and investment, PCT expects to seek additional debt or equity financing from outside sources, which it may not\nbe able to raise on terms favorable to PCT, or at all. If PCT is unable to raise additional debt or sell additional equity when desired, or if PCT is unable to\nmanage its cash outflows, PCT’s business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected. In addition, any financing arrangement\nmay have potentially adverse effects on PCT and/or its stockholders. Debt financing (if available and undertaken) will increase expenses, must be repaid\nregardless of operating results and may involve restrictions limiting PCT’s operating flexibility. If PCT consummates an equity financing to raise additional funds,\nthe percentage ownership of its existing stockholders will be reduced, and the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of\nthe current holders of PCT’s common stock.\nPCT has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on its financial condition, changes in financial\ncondition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. PCT does not have any\noff-balance sheet arrangements or interests in variable interest entities that would require consolidation. Note that while certain legally binding offtake\narrangements have been entered into with customers, these arrangements are not unconditional and definite agreements subject only to customer closing\nconditions, and do not qualify as off-balance sheet arrangements required for disclosure.\nCash Flows\nA summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated is as follows:\nYears ended December 31,\n$ % $ %\n(in thousands, except %) 2023 2022 Change Change 2021 Change Change\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (94,906) $ (65,478) $ (29,428) 45 % $ (54,507) $ 10,971 (20)%\nNet cash used in investing activities (102,103) (218,387) 116,284 (53)% (305,575) (87,188) 29 %\nNet cash provided by financing activities 272,000 247,530 24,470 10 % 293,366 45,836 16 %\nCash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 227,523 263,858 (36,335) (14)% 330,574 66,716 20 %\nCash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 302,514 $ 227,523 $ 74,991 33 % $ 263,858 $ 36,335 14 %\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nThe $29.4 million increase in net cash used in operating activities for the year ending December 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 was primarily\nattributable to higher cash payments for production inventory of approximately $5.0 million, higher cash paid related to employee costs of approximately $4.5\nmillion, increase in interest payments classified as operating cash flows of $9.1 million due to ceasing of interest capitalization on the Revenue Bonds in June\n2023, $5.9 million in additional interest and security deposit payments related to an equipment financing liability, higher lease payments for operating facilities\nand\n37\nTable of Contents\nequipment rentals of approximately $3.2 million, and an increase in cash payments related to operating expenses of $7.1 million primarily driven by an increase\nin operational site costs at the Ironton Facility, and $0.5 million other net operating cash outflows, partially offset by higher interest income of $5.9 million driven\nprimarily by interest earned on the Company’s investment portfolio.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nThe $116.3 million decrease in net cash used in investing activities for the year ending December 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 was\nattributable to $134.8 million lower investment purchases and $133.3 million lower capital expenditure payments, offset by $151.8 million of lower maturities and\nsales of investments.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nThe $24.5 million increase in net cash provided by financing activities for the year ending December 31, 2023 related to the same period in 2022 was primarily\nattributable to $285.1 million debt financing raised in 2023 compared to $250.0 million raised in 2022 related to proceeds from the 2022 PIPE Offering, lower\nshare repurchase activity related to withholding on equity vesting of $0.3 million in 2023 compared to 2022, offset by $11.1 million in debt issuance costs and\nLOC fees related to new financing arrangements incurred in 2023 compared to equity issuance costs in 2022 of $0.8 million, as well as $0.6 million higher\nrepayments on equipment financing in 2023 compared to 2022.\nIndebtedness\nRevenue Bonds\nOn October 7, 2020, the Southern Ohio Port Authority (“SOPA”) issued certain revenue bonds (“Revenue Bonds”) pursuant to an Indenture of Trust dated as of\nOctober 1, 2020 (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Indenture”), between SOPA and UMB Bank, N.A., as\nTrustee (“Trustee”), and loaned the proceeds from their sale to PureCycle: Ohio LLC (“PCO”), an Ohio limited liability company and indirect wholly-owned\nsubsidiary of PCT, pursuant to a Loan Agreement dated as of October 1, 2020, between SOPA and PCO (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise\nmodified from time to time, the “Loan Agreement”), to be used to (i) acquire, construct and equip the Ironton Facility (referred to within the Loan Agreement as\nthe “Ohio Phase II Facility” and, together with the FEU (referred to within the Loan Agreement as the “Phase I Facility”), the “Project”); (ii) fund a debt service\nreserve fund for the Series 2020A Bonds; (iii) finance capitalized interest; and (iv) pay the costs of issuing the Revenue Bonds. The Revenue Bonds were\noffered in three series, including (i) Exempt Facility Revenue Bonds (PureCycle Project), Tax-Exempt Series 2020A (“Series 2020A Bonds”); (ii) Subordinate\nExempt Facility Revenue Bonds (PureCycle Project), Tax-Exempt Series 2020B (“Series 2020B Bonds”); and (iii) Subordinated Exempt Facility Revenue Bonds\n(PureCycle Project), Taxable Series 2020C (“Series 2020C Bonds”).\nOn March 15, 2023, SOPA, the Trustee, PCT, PCTO Holdco LLC (the pledgor under an Equity Pledge and Security Agreement (as defined in the Indenture),\npursuant to which the pledgor pledged certain interests to secure obligations of PCO under various Financing Documents relating to the Revenue Bonds and\nPCO (collectively, the “Company Parties”) entered into a Limited Waiver and First Supplemental Indenture (the “Limited Waiver”), supplementing the Indenture\nand amending the Loan Agreement and the amended and restated Guaranty (as defined in the Indenture), and pursuant to which the Holders (as defined in the\nIndenture) of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Series 2020A Bonds outstanding (the “Majority Holders”) consented to the Limited Waiver, based\non stated conditions, of a Specified Event of Default (as defined below) under the Indenture and the Loan Agreement.\nUnder the terms of the Loan Agreement, PCO was required to cause the Ironton Facility to be completed by December 1, 2022. The Ironton Facility was not\ncompleted by that date due to a variety of challenges resulting from, among other things, the COVID-19 outbreak, the ongoing military conflict between Russia\nand Ukraine, and certain U.S. weather-related events (the “First Specified Event of Default”).\nSubject to the following conditions, the First Specified Event of Default is waived in exchange for PCO’s agreement to meet certain milestones toward\ncompleting the Ironton Facility, to deposit additional equity aggregating approximately $87.3 million with the Trustee for various purposes and to make certain\nother representations and warranties; provided, however, that any failure to comply with the terms of the Limited Waiver shall be an immediate Event of Default\nunder the Indenture and Loan Agreement, which will be deemed\n38\nTable of Contents\nto have occurred on January 2, 2023 with respect to any requirements to pay accrued and unpaid interest at the Default Rate.\nPCO has agreed to, among other things, achieve the following milestones (together, the “Milestones”): (i) closure by it or its direct or indirect parent entity of a\nfinancing transaction by March 31, 2023 that provides at least $150 million of working capital which may be used to support the Ironton Facility (which is satisfied\nby the closing of the Revolving Credit Facility); (ii) mechanical completion of the Ironton Facility by June 30, 2023; (iii) meet certain targeted production and\nperformance targets during 2023; (iv) completion of the Ironton Facility by December 31, 2023; and (v) meet certain Ironton Facility pellet production targets by\nJanuary 31, 2024 up to the Ironton Facility’s nameplate production capacity of 107 million pounds per year.\nThe additional approximate $87.3 million of equity to be deposited with the Trustee is comprised of: (i) a deposit, by March 31, 2023, of $50 million in an account\ncontrolled by the Trustee; (ii) a deposit of approximately $25 million in the Equity Account of the Project Fund (as such terms are used in the Indenture) to fund\nremaining construction costs; (iii) an aggregate deposit of approximately $12.3 million into the Capitalized Interest Accounts (as defined in the Indenture) for the\nBonds to pay capitalized interest on the Revenue Bonds through June 30, 2024. The Limited Waiver also requires that the Liquidity Reserve of approximately\n$50 million remain in the Liquidity Reserve Escrow Fund (as such term is used in the Indenture) for a period beyond the completion date of the Ironton Facility\nuntil certain production requirements have been met, and only thereafter may the balance in that fund be reduced based on certain conditions to $25 million,\nwhich must remain therein as long as Series 2020A Bonds remain outstanding. The Trustee also released $13.2 million from the Trustee account for the\nRevenue Bonds for use as part of the remaining investment in 2023 to complete the Ironton Facility in accordance with the Limited Waiver.\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Ironton Facility failed to meet one such Milestone related to certain targeted production and performance targets, specifically, it\nfailed to produce 4.45 million pounds of pellets from its feedstock in a single month by that date (“September Milestone”). This created an Event of Default under\nthe Limited Waiver (the “September Milestone Event of Default”).\nAs a result of the September Milestone Event of Default, on November 8, 2023, the Limited Waiver parties entered into a Limited Waiver and Second\nSupplemental Indenture (the “Second Limited Waiver”) pursuant to which the September Milestone Event of Default was waived, various Milestones were\namended and extended and certain additional requirements were imposed upon PCT and its subsidiaries. The principal terms of the Second Limited Waiver,\ninclude, but are not limited to, the following:\ni. PCO will deposit an additional $50,000,000 (the “Trustee Account Deposit”) in the Trustee Account (as defined in the Limited Waiver), such that at least\n$100,000,000 (the “Aggregate Trustee Deposit”) shall be on deposit in the Trustee Account so long as any Revenue Bonds remain outstanding; provided,\nthat if no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, $50,000,000 of funds in the Trustee Account shall be released back to PCO upon\nsatisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 4.11(a) of the amended and restated Guaranty.\nii. subject to there being no default or event of default and compliance with the other terms of the Second Limited Waiver, once per quarter, PCO (and the\nGuarantor, if applicable) may request the release to PCO (or the Guarantor, as applicable) of any investment income or earnings with respect to amounts\nin the Trustee Account and the Liquidity Reserve Escrow Fund that have been invested pursuant to the terms of the Indenture or the Liquidity Reserve\nEscrow Agreement (as applicable).\niii. PCO shall have produced 4.45 million pounds of pellets from its feedstock for thirty consecutive days by December 31, 2023, which shall be evidenced by\na certificate signed by an Authorized Representative of PCO and by the Construction Monitor certifying thereto and delivered to the Trustee;\niv. performance testing of the Ironton Facility shall be complete by no later than February 28, 2024, which shall be evidenced by a certificate signed by an\nAuthorized Representative of PCO and by the Construction Monitor certifying thereto and delivered to the Trustee;\nv. completion of the Project, including the acquisition, construction and equipping of the Ironton Facility, shall occur by no later than March 31, 2024, which\nshall be evidenced by a Certificate of Completion delivered to the Trustee;\n39\nTable of Contents\nvi. PCO shall have produced 8.90 million pounds of pellets from its feedstock for thirty consecutive days by April 30, 2024, which shall be evidenced by a\ncertificate signed by an Authorized Representative of PCO and by the Construction Monitor certifying thereto and delivered to the Trustee; and PCO shall\nhave fully-ramped production at the Ironton Facility to nameplate capacity of 107 million pounds per year produced from its feedstock by no later than\nApril 30, 2024, which shall be evidenced by a certificate signed by an Authorized Representative of PCO and by the Construction Monitor certifying\nthereto and delivered to the Trustee; and\nvii. the milestones referenced in (iii) – (vi) above (each, a “Revised Milestone”), shall replace the corresponding Milestones in the Limited Waiver. If PCO\nfails to meet any of the Revised Milestones, no Event of Default shall have occurred until PCO has failed to meet such Revised Milestone on the date that\nis ninety days after such Revised Milestone date; provided, however, that during such ninety-day period, PCO will pay interest from the date of the\nRevised Milestone requirement until the date that the Revised Milestone is satisfied at the Default Rate, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in\nthe Indenture, the Loan Agreement, the First Limited Waiver or the other Financing Documents or Bond documents (each as defined in the Indenture),\nPCO shall not have any access to any funds in the Trust Estate or otherwise held with the Trustee or a third-party (including, without limitation, funds in\nthe Operating Revenue Escrow Fund and the Liquidity Reserve Escrow Fund (terms used as defined in the Indenture) pursuant to the Financing\nDocuments until the date that such Milestone is satisfied.\nOn February 10, 2024, PCO announced that it had agreed in principle with the Majority Holders that PCO or an affiliate of PCO would purchase (“Purchase”)\nfrom Holders for cash, upon the terms and subject to the conditions to be set forth in a definitive purchase agreement, by and among PCO and any Holder of\nBonds that elects to be a party to the purchase agreement (each, a “Seller” and collectively, “Sellers”), any and all Bonds held by Sellers at a purchase price\nequal to $1,050 per $1,000 principal amount of the Bonds purchased, which amount is calculated in part to compensate the Sellers for default interest accruing\nfrom January 2, 2023 through December 31, 2023, as well as other accrued and unpaid interest from the last interest payment to, but not including, the Closing\nDate of the Purchase (as defined below) as consideration for consent to the Third Supplemental Indenture, by and among SOPA, PCO, the Guarantor, PCTO\nHoldco LLC and the Trustee (the “Third Supplemental Indenture”), which sets forth certain proposed amendments to the Bond Documents (“Proposed\nAmendments”) that will eliminate a substantial portion of the covenants, Events of Default, and other material terms and protections for the benefit of the Holders\ncontained in the Indenture, the Loan Agreement, the Guaranty and other transaction documents that are permitted by the terms of the Indenture and/or the Loan\nAgreement to be eliminated with the consent of Majority Holders. The Purchase will occur only if Sellers include at least the Majority Holders and if Sellers\nconsent to the Proposed Amendments. The Purchase Price shall not include any default or penalty interest accruing from January 1, 2024, that may otherwise\nbe owed to Sellers, and each Seller will waive its respective right to such default or penalty interest as additional compensation for the Purchase.\nAs of March 5, 2024, (the “Closing Date”) PCO and the Majority Holders closed on the Purchase Agreement and Consent (“Purchase Agreement”) comprising\nthe definitive purchase agreement and, as additional consideration, the consent to the Third Supplemental Indenture, including the Proposed Amendments\ndescribed therein. PureCycle Technologies LLC, an affiliate of PCO and the Guarantor under the Guaranty, will be the purchaser (“Purchaser”) of Bonds under\nthe Purchase Agreement. The Purchase Agreement was executed by each Holder that elects to sell its Bonds to the Purchaser and by PCO and the Purchase\nwas effective on the Closing Date.\nThe Third Supplemental Indenture amended and supplemented the Indenture and certain of the other Financing Documents by, among other things and without\nlimitation, eliminating substantially all covenants and Events of Default contained in the Indenture, the Loan Agreement and certain of such other financing\ndocuments including, but not limited, to the following changes:\n• elimination of the Milestones and Revised Milestones;\n• amendments extending the Outside Completion Date to December 31, 2030;\n• amendments to the definition of each of “Outstanding,” “Bonds Outstanding,” and “Outstanding Bonds” in the Indenture such that any Bonds owned by or\non behalf of PureCycle or an affiliate of PureCycle or\n40\nTable of Contents\nthe Issuer or an affiliate of the Issuer will have the same approval voting or consent rights as other Holders;\n• elimination of the requirement to produce sufficient annual gross revenues in order to provide a Senior Debt Service Coverage Ratio (“DSCR”) equal to at\nleast 150% for each fiscal year, and a ratio of at least 110% of net income available for debt service;\n• elimination of certain financial prerequisites that placed limitations on the issuance of additional senior parity indebtedness, subordinate indebtedness and\nnon-parity indebtedness;\n• elimination of the DSCR requirement for certain equipment liens;\n• elimination of delivery of interim financial statements on a quarterly basis for PCO and the Guarantor;\n• elimination of requirement for an unqualified opinion of the independent certified public accountant for year-end financials for PCO;\n• elimination of quarterly operating statements and monthly reconciliation statements;\n• elimination of the Operating Revenue Escrow Fund;\n• elimination of the restrictions on distributions by PCO on any of its membership interests, including management fees;\n• elimination of the requirement to disclose transactions with affiliates to the Trustee and bondholders and to seek approval of Majority Holders for affiliate\ntransactions.\n• elimination of the requirement that offtake contracts provide revenues to PCO sufficient to meet a Senior Parity Coverage Requirement ratio (“SPCR”) of\n125% for any fiscal year, commencing December 31, 2023;\n• elimination of the requirement that feedstock supply contracts provide feedstock to PCO sufficient to permit PCO to meet a Senior Parity Coverage\nRequirement ratio (“SPCR”) of 125% for any fiscal year, commencing December 31, 2023;\n• elimination of the requirement that the Guarantor replenish the Contingency Account from the Liquidity Reserve Escrow Fund and replenish the Liquidity\nReserve Escrow Fund;\n• amendments providing that the occurrence of an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default under the Loan Agreement, the Mortgage or the Tax\nCompliance Agreement, each as defined in the Indenture) will not be an Event of Default under the Indenture; and\n• provide for a potentially earlier termination of the Guaranty and release of funds remaining in the Liquidity Reserve Escrow Fund after the Purchase;\n• provide for the release of funds (solely to the extent such release may be effectuated with the consent of the Majority Holders) on deposit in accounts in\nthe Trust Estate (as defined in the Indenture) in an amount proportionate to the percentage of aggregate principal amount of Bonds that are submitted for\nPurchase (with such released funds being used by the Purchaser, together with other available funds of the Purchaser, to effectuate the Purchase); and\n• amendments to various escrow accounts and other funds managed by the Trustee and US Bank to permit the release of funds from such accounts in an\namount proportionate to the percentage of aggregate principal amount of Bonds purchased by PCO or an affiliate of PCO from time to time.\nThe Purchase closed on March 5, 2024, and was funded with funds released from the Trust Estate, the Liquidity Reserve Escrow Fund, and available cash from\nPCO or an affiliate thereof.\n41\nTable of Contents\nSylebra Credit Facility\nOn March 15, 2023, PCT entered into a $150 million revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) pursuant to a Credit Agreement (the “Revolving\nCredit Agreement”) dated as of March 15, 2023, with PureCycle Technologies Holdings Corp. and PureCycle Technologies, LLC (the “Guarantors”), Sylebra\nCapital Partners Master Fund, LTD, Sylebra Capital Parc Master Fund, and Sylebra Capital Menlo Master Fund (collectively, the “Lenders”), and Madison\nPacific Trust Limited (the “Administrative Agent” and “Security Agent”), which had an original maturity on June 30, 2024 and was subsequently extended. The\nLenders and their affiliates are greater than 5% beneficial owners of PCT.\nBorrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement may be used for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes and satisfies the\nfinancing obligation imposed upon PCT by the First Limited Waiver.\nAmounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest at a variable annual rate equal to Term SOFR (as defined in the Revolving Credit\nAgreement) in effect for such period plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is equal to (i) 5.00% from the Closing Date through June 30, 2023, (ii)\n10.00% from July 1, 2023 through September 30, 2023, (iii) 12.50% from October 1, 2023 through December 31, 2023, (iv) 15.00% from January 1, 2024\nthrough March 31, 2024, and (v) 17.50% thereafter. PCT is also required to pay (i) an up-front fee equal to 0.75% times $150 million—the total aggregate\ncommitment for the Revolving Credit Facility—to the Lenders, payable at closing and (ii) a commitment fee equal to 0.25% per annum based on the actual daily\nunused amount of the Revolving Credit Facility, payable quarterly. Subject to timely prior written notice and payment of breakage fees, if any, PCT may at any\ntime and from time to time (i) terminate all or any portion of the commitments under the Revolving Credit Agreement and/or (ii) prepay all or any portion of any\noutstanding borrowings.\nThe Revolving Credit Agreement contains representations, covenants and events of default that are customary for financing transactions of this nature. Events\nof default in the Revolving Credit Agreement include, among others: (a) non-payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts; (b) default of specific\ncovenants; (c) breach of representations and warranties; (d) cross-defaults to other indebtedness in an amount greater than $1 million, subject to certain\nexceptions; (e) bankruptcy and insolvency proceedings; (f) inability to pay debts or attachment; (g) judgments; and (h) change of control. Upon the occurrence of\nan event of default, the Administrative Agent shall, at the request of, or may, with the consent of, the Required Lenders (as defined in the Revolving Credit\nAgreement) terminate the loan commitments, accelerate all loans and exercise on behalf of itself and the Lenders all rights and remedies available to it and the\nLenders under the Revolving Credit Agreement and the other loan documents.\nAmounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Guarantors, and are secured by a security interest in substantially all of the\nassets of PCT. Any majority-owned direct or indirect subsidiaries of PCT formed after the closing date of the Revolving Credit Facility will also be required to\nguaranty the obligations under the Revolving Credit Agreement and grant security interests in substantially all of their respective assets.\nOn May 8, 2023, PCT entered into the First Amendment to Credit Agreement, by and among PCT, as borrower, PureCycle Technologies, LLC and PureCycle\nTechnologies Holdings Corp., as Guarantors, the lenders party thereto, and Madison Pacific Trust Limited, as administrative agent and as security agent (the\n“Sylebra Amendment”) in connection with PCT’s $150 million Revolving Credit Facility governed by the Revolving Credit Agreement. The Sylebra Amendment,\namong other things: (i) permits PCT’s entry into the Term Loan Facility, (ii) provides for a new basket under the Revolving Credit Agreement’s indebtedness\nnegative covenant allowing for offerings of unsecured convertible promissory notes of up to $200,000,000, (iii) provides for new baskets under the Revolving\nCredit Agreement’s indebtedness and lien negative covenants of up to $90,000,000 in additional equipment financings and (iv) exempts the proceeds of any\nsuch convertible notes offerings from the requirement for mandatory prepayments under the Revolving Credit Agreement.\nOn August 4, 2023, the Company entered into the Second Amendment to Credit Agreement, by and among the Company, as borrower, PureCycle\nTechnologies, LLC and PureCycle Technologies Holdings Corp., as Guarantors, the lenders party thereto, and Madison Pacific Trust Limited, as administrative\nagent and as security agent (the “Second Amendment”), in connection with the Company’s $150 million Revolving Credit\n42\nTable of Contents\nFacility governed by the Revolving Credit Agreement, to extend the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility to March 31, 2025.\nOn August 21, 2023, the Company further amended the Revolving Credit Agreement to (i) increase the amount available to the Company under the\nindebtedness covenant basket for offerings of unsecured convertible notes from $200,000,000 to $250,000,000 and (ii) make certain changes to the restricted\npayments covenant and the events of default section in order to permit the Notes (as described below).\nThere were no funds drawn on the Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2023. The up-front commitment fee and other related fees of $2.1 million are\nbeing amortized over the term of the contract. During 2023 there were $1.2 million and $0.9 million recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets\nduring March and September 2023, respectively.\nOn March 1, 2024, PCT increased the Revolving Credit Facility from $150.0 million to $200.0 million, extended the maturity date to September 30, 2025, and\nobtained a carveout to permit the Company to purchase the Revenue Bonds, pursuant to an amendment to the Credit Agreement with the Company (the\n“Borrower”), PureCycle Technologies Holdings Corp. and PureCycle Technologies, LLC (the “Guarantors”), Sylebra Capital Partners Master Fund, LTD, Sylebra\nCapital Parc Master Fund, and Sylebra Capital Menlo Master Fund (collectively, the “Lenders”), and Madison Pacific Trust Limited (the “Administrative Agent”\nand “Security Agent”). Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement may be used for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate\npurposes – see Note 3 (“Notes Payable and Debt Instruments”) to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual\nReport on Form 10‑K for additional information.\nEquipment Financing\nCSC Leasing Co.\nOn May 8, 2023, the Company, through PureCycle PreP LLC, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a Master Lease Agreement\n(the “Master Lease Agreement”) with CSC Leasing Co. (“CSC”). Pursuant to the Master Lease Agreement, the Company and CSC agreed to enter into\nschedules that establish the specific terms and conditions of leasing certain equipment, machines, devices, features and any other items listed in each\nequipment lease schedule. The Master Lease Agreement commenced on the date set forth above and continues in effect until the later time that it is terminated,\neither by CSC at the end of any lease term, or by the Company upon three months written notice prior to the expiration of a lease term.\nAlso on May 8, 2023, the Company, also through PureCycle PreP LLC, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into an Equipment\nProcurement Agreement (the “Equipment Agreement”) with CSC. Under the terms of the Equipment Agreement, CSC has agreed to finance, acquire and/or\npurchase certain equipment (the “Equipment”) from third-party vendors and/or manufacturers (each, a “Vendor”), so that CSC may lease the Equipment to the\nCompany pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Master Lease Agreement. Prior to entering into formal lease schedules under the Master Lease\nAgreement, the Company will lease from CSC certain Equipment pursuant to the terms of the Equipment Agreement.\nIn connection with the above, CSC has funded $19.8 million for purposes of procuring equipment from a Vendor, which had previously been ordered by the\nCompany prior to entering into these agreements with CSC. CSC will lease this equipment back to the Company under a 36 month lease, which will commence\nwhen 1) the Company accepts delivery of the equipment at its operating location and 2) all final bills from Vendor are paid. The Company has determined that it\ndid not relinquish control of the assets to the buyer-lessor under these arrangements. Therefore, the Company has accounted for this transaction as a failed\nsale-leaseback transaction whereby it has continued recording these assets in the consolidated balance sheet and also recorded a financing obligation for the\nconsideration paid by the buyer-lessor. The Company currently expects the lease term to commence in 2024, and the repayment schedule below assumes\npayments under the 36 month term commence on December 1, 2024.\nThe Company is also required to make monthly payments under the agreements during the period between funding of the construction obligation and delivery of\nthe equipment, which began in June 2023 and are equal to a monthly lease rate factor of approximately 3.1% of the outstanding amount funded by CSC (the\n“Lease Rate Factor”). The Company has determined that these payments represent a cost of borrowing under the financing arrangement and has recorded the\npayments as interest expense in the consolidated statements of\n43\nTable of Contents\ncomprehensive income (loss). The Company incurred $4.6 million of interest expense related to these obligations for the year ended December 31, 2023. The\nLease Rate Factor is indexed to the WSJ Prime Rate as published by the Wall Street Journal and may be increased for every five basis point change in the\nindex prior to final commencement of the 36 month lease term. Upon commencement of the 36 month lease term, the payments will be characterized as\nrepayment of debt, and the expected coupon rate for the 36 month term is 7.25%.\nThe Master Lease Agreement contains representations, covenants and events of default that are customary for financing transactions of this nature. Events of\ndefault in the Master Lease Agreement include, among others: (a) non-payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts; (b) default of specific covenants; (c)\nbreach of representations and warranties; (d) discontinuation of authorized electronic payments without CSC’s consent; (e) failure to furnish proof of insurance;\n(f) bankruptcy and insolvency proceedings; and (g) any unauthorized conveyance or transfer of the Equipment to a third party. Upon the occurrence of an event\nof default, CSC may accelerate all unpaid rents and exercise all rights and remedies available to it under the Master Lease Agreement and Equipment\nAgreement. Amounts due under the lease are guaranteed by PCT.\nOther Equipment Financing\nPCT has executed other equipment sale leasebacks which qualify as financing arrangements, with a total of $1.8 million outstanding as of December 31, 2023.\nThe Pure Plastic Term Loan Facility\nOn May 8, 2023, the Company entered into a $ 40.0 million Term Loan Facility pursuant to the Term Loan Credit Agreement dated as of May 8, 2023, among\nthe Guarantors and Pure Plastic LLC (as Lender, Administrative Agent, and Security Agent), which matures on December 31, 2025. The Term Loan Credit\nAgreement was amended on August 21, 2023. Affiliates of the Lender are greater than 5% beneficial owners of the Company. Balances related to the Term\nLoan Credit Agreement are recorded within related party note payable in the consolidated balance sheets and, in certain instances, the Term Loan Credit\nAgreement is referred to as the “Related party note payable.”\nBorrowings under the Term Loan Credit Agreement may be used to repay indebtedness for borrowed money of PCT, to pay fees and expenses associated with\nthe Term Loan Credit Agreement and the other loan documents and for general corporate purposes not in contravention of any law or of any loan document.\nThe Term Loan Facility is structured as a single-draw, delayed draw term loan. The Lender funded the term loan on May 17, 2023 (the “Funding Date”).\nAmounts outstanding under the Term Loan Credit Agreement will bear interest at a variable annual rate equal to Term SOFR (as defined in the Term Loan\nCredit Agreement) in effect for such period plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is equal to 7.5% and the interest rate for the outstanding term loan\nwas 12.9% as of December 31, 2023. The Company is also required to pay, on the Funding Date, (i) a closing fee to the Lenders, equal to 2.00% times the\naggregate principal amount of the term loans funded by the Lenders on the Funding Date, (ii) a commitment fee to the Lenders equal to 1.00% times the\naggregate principal amount of each Lender’s commitments on the Funding Date, (iii) a syndication fee to the Administrative Agent equal to 0.50% times the\naggregate commitments of the Lenders on the Funding Date and (iv) a monitoring fee equal to $200,000 to the Administrative Agent for the account of the\nAdministrative Agent and the Security Agent on the Funding Date and each anniversary of the Funding Date until maturity of the term loan. Additionally, the\nterm loan will be issued with a 5.00% original issue discount. Subject to timely prior written notice, payment of breakage fees, if any, and payment of a\nprepayment premium equal to (i) 12% if such prepayment occurs during the first year following the closing date or (ii) 8% thereafter, the Company may at any\ntime and from time to time voluntarily prepay all or any portion of any outstanding borrowings. The Company incurred $3.4 million of interest cost during the year\nended December 31, 2023. The interest due to date of $3.1 million was paid entirely in kind, which increased the principal amount of the Term Loan Facility by\nthis amount (the “PIK Interest”). The Company has the contractual right to pay all interest payments in kind and may make this election for all interest payments\nfor the duration of the Term Loan Facility. The repayment schedule presented in “Note 3 - Notes Payable and Debt Instruments” does not contemplate future\nPIK Interest.\nThe Term Loan Credit Agreement contains representations, covenants and events of default that are customary for financing transactions of this nature. Events\nof default in the Term Loan Credit Agreement include, among others: (a) non-payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts; (b) default of specific\ncovenants; (c) breach of representations and warranties; (d) cross-defaults to other indebtedness in an amount greater than $1\n44\nTable of Contents\nmillion, subject to certain exceptions; (e) bankruptcy and insolvency proceedings; (f) inability to pay debts or attachment; (g) judgments; and (h) change of\ncontrol. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the Administrative Agent shall, at the request of, or may, with the consent of, the Required Lenders (as\ndefined in the Term Loan Credit Agreement) accelerate all loans and exercise on behalf of itself and the Lenders all rights and remedies available to it and the\nLenders under the Term Loan Credit Agreement and the other loan documents.\nAmounts outstanding under the Term Loan Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Guarantors, and are secured by a security interest in substantially all of the\nassets of the Company. Subject to certain limited exceptions, any majority-owned direct or indirect subsidiaries of the Company formed after the closing date of\nthe Term Loan Facility will also be required to guaranty the obligations under the Term Loan Credit Agreement and grant security interests in substantially all of\ntheir respective assets.\nOn August 21, 2023, the Company amended the Term Loan Credit Agreement to (i) increase the amount available to the Company under the indebtedness\ncovenant basket for offerings of unsecured convertible notes from $200,000,000 to $250,000,000 and (ii) make certain changes to the restricted payments\ndefinition and the restricted payments covenant in order to permit the Notes.\nOn March 1, 2024, PCT amended the Term Loan Credit Agreement to (i) increase the amount available to the Company under the permitted indebtedness\ncovenant basket for the Revolving Credit Facility from $150,000,000 to $200,000,000 and (ii) obtain a carve out to permit the Company to purchase the\nRevenue Bonds.\nGreen Convertible Notes\nOn August 24, 2023, the Company completed the private offering of $250.0 million total aggregate principal amount of 7.25% Green Convertible Senior Notes\ndue 2030 (the “Notes”). Each $1,000 principal amount at maturity of the Notes was issued at a price of $900. An amount equal to the difference between the\nissue price and the principal amount at maturity will accrete from the original issue date through August 15, 2027. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of\nthe Company. Entities affiliated with Sylebra Capital Management purchased $50.0 million aggregate principal amount at maturity of Notes.\nThe net proceeds from this offering, excluding any offering expenses, were approximately $218.5 million, after deducting the initial purchaser’s discounts and\nfees paid to our financial advisor. The Company intends to allocate an amount equal to the net proceeds from this offering to the financing and refinancing of\nrecently completed and future Eligible Green Projects (as defined below) in the United States. In particular, the Company intends to allocate the net proceeds\nfrom this offering to make payments on certain long-lead items and fund initial outside battery limits engineering design work, both associated with a multi-line\npurification facility to be built in Augusta, Georgia. Pending such allocation, the Company intends to use the remaining net proceeds for general corporate\npurposes. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has allocated $209.0 million of the proceeds to Eligible Green Projects, which includes historical spend\nthrough December 31, 2023, related to Augusta purification lines 1 and 2, as well as the PreP facilities in process that will provide feedstock for the Augusta\nFacility. Funds remaining to allocate, as of December 31, 2023, are $9.5 million.\n“Eligible Green Projects” means: (i) investments in acquisitions of buildings; (ii) building developments or redevelopments; (iii) renovations in existing buildings;\nand (iv) tenant improvement projects, in each case, that have received, or are expected to receive, in the three years prior to the issuance of the Notes or\nduring the term of the Notes, a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver, Gold or Platinum certification (or environmentally equivalent\nsuccessor standards).\nIn connection with the issuance of the Notes, the Company entered into an Indenture, dated August 24, 2023 (the “Indenture”), with U.S. Bank Trust Company,\nNational Association, as trustee. The Indenture includes customary covenants and sets forth certain events of default after which the Notes may be declared\nimmediately due and payable and sets forth certain types of bankruptcy or insolvency events of default involving the Company after which the Notes become\nautomatically due and payable. The events of default, as set forth in the Indenture and subject in certain cases to customary grace and cure periods, include\ncustomary events including a default in the payment of principal or interest, failure to comply with the obligation to deliver amounts due upon conversion, failure\nto give certain notices, failure to comply with the obligations in respect of certain merger transactions, defaults under certain other indebtedness and certain\nevents of bankruptcy and insolvency.\n45\nTable of Contents\nThe Notes will mature on August 15, 2030, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. The Notes will bear interest at a rate of 7.25% per annum on the\nprincipal amount at maturity from August 24, 2023, payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on February 15,\n2024.\nHolders of the Notes may convert all or any portion of their Notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day\nimmediately preceding the maturity date. Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of its common stock or a\ncombination of cash and shares of its common stock, at the Company’s election. The conversion rate will initially be 67.4764 shares of common stock per\n$1,000 principal amount at maturity of notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $14.82 per share of common stock), which represents a\nconversion premium of approximately 50% to the $9.88 per share closing price of the Company’s common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market on August 21,\n2023. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events. In addition, following certain corporate events described in the\nIndenture that occur prior to August 15, 2027, or upon the issuance of a notice of redemption (as described below) prior to August 15, 2027 for an optional\nredemption, the Company will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its Notes in connection with such a\ncorporate event or elects to convert its notes called (or deemed called) for optional redemption during the related redemption period.\nHolders of the Notes have the right to require the Company to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their Notes on August 15, 2027 at a repurchase price\nequal to 100% of the principal amount at maturity of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, August 15, 2027. In\naddition, if the Company undergoes a fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture), holders of the Notes may require the Company to repurchase their\nNotes at a cash repurchase price equal to 100% of the accreted principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but\nexcluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.\nThe Company may not redeem the Notes prior to August 20, 2025. The Company may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Notes (subject to certain\nexceptions and restrictions specified in the Indenture), at its option, on or after August 20, 2025 and on or before the 40th scheduled trading day immediately\nbefore the maturity date, at a cash redemption price equal to 100% of the accreted principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid\ninterest to, but excluding, the redemption date, but only if the last reported sale price per share of the Company’s common stock exceeds 130% of the\nconversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading\nday of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides a notice of redemption to the\nholders of the Notes. No sinking fund is provided for the Notes.\nFinancial Assurance\nOn March 14, 2023, PCT secured a surety bond in the amount of $25.0 million to provide financial assurance related to its performance under a certain vendor\ncontract, which expires at the earlier of satisfaction of the obligation, termination of the related vendor contract, or one year from issuance (subject to renewal\nwithin one year). On February 14, 2024, PCT renewed the surety bond in the amount of $25.0 million and it will expire at the earlier of satisfaction of the\nobligation, termination of the related vendor contract, or one year from the renewal date, which is March 14, 2024.\nThese financial instruments are issued in the normal course of business and are not considered company indebtedness. Because PCT currently has no liability\nfor these financial assurance instruments, they are not reflected in its consolidated balance sheets.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021\nRefer to Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-\nK for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 for the liquidity and capital resources discussion for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the\nfiscal year ended December 31, 2021.\n46\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires\nus to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the\nbalance sheet date, as well as the reported expenses incurred during the reporting period. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on\nvarious other assumptions believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and\nliabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences could be material to our financial statements.\nWe believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more\nsignificant areas involving management’s judgments and estimates.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K, we believe that the following accounting policies require a greater degree of judgment\nand complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results\nof operations.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that PCT will continue as a going concern; however, the conditions\ndescribed above raise substantial doubt about PCT’s ability to do so, which management believes has been alleviated through its plans to mitigate these\nconditions and obtain additional unrestricted liquidity.\nLong-Lived Assets Impairment Assessment\nThe Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired and the undiscounted\nnet cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying value. If the net carrying value exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss\nexists and is calculated based on either estimated salvage value or estimated orderly liquidation value.\nDuring 2023, PCT identified certain impairment triggers relating to our asset group, but the undiscounted pre-tax cash flow analysis did not result in an\nimpairment. Refer to Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The undiscounted pre-tax cash flows were\nbased on significant assumptions including management’s best estimates of the expected future cash flows, and the estimated useful lives of the asset group.\nThese estimates required considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions such as future commodity prices, margins on UPR\nResin, operating rates and capital expenditures including repairs and maintenance. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions\nmade for purposes of our impairment determination will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future.\nWarrants\nThe Company measures the warrants issued to nonemployees at the fair value of the equity instruments issued as of the warrant issuance date and recognizes\nthat amount as selling, general, and administrative expense in accordance with the vesting terms of the warrant agreement. In the event that the terms of the\nwarrants qualify as a liability, the Company accounts for the instrument as a liability recorded at fair value each reporting period through earnings.\nThe Company has determined that warrants issued to RTI (“RTI Warrants”) and its private warrants are a Level 3 fair value measurement and has used the\nBlack-Scholes option pricing model to value these warrants, which requires the input of the following subjective assumptions:\na) The expected dividends,\nb) The volatility of our common stock price over the expected term,\nc) The length of time warrant holders will retain the warrants before exercising them (“expected\n47\nTable of Contents\nterm”), and\nd) The risk-free interest rate over the warrant’s expected term.\nA summary of how each significant assumption was developed for our warrant liabilities is as follows:\n● Expected dividend yield: The dividend yield is assumed to be zero since PCT has not historically paid dividends\n● Expected volatility: The expected volatility was based on PCT’s capital structure and volatility of PCT’s stock or publicly-traded warrants.\n● Expected term: The expected term is determined based on the expected amount of time the warrants will be held before they are exercised.\n● Risk-free interest rate: The risk-free interest rate was based upon quoted market yields for the United States Treasury instruments with terms that were\nconsistent with the expected term of the warrants.\nThe Company has determined that the Series A Warrants are a level 2 fair value measurement with the only input being the market price of its publicly-traded\nwarrants.\nRTI Warrants\nThe Company initially determined the warrants issued to RTI (“RTI Warrants”) in connection with terms of a professional services agreement were equity\nclassified. Accordingly, the warrant units were held at their initial fair value with no subsequent remeasurement.\nIn connection with the Business Combination discussed in Note 1 (“Organization”) to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company\nmodified the RTI warrant agreement to purchase 971.0 thousand shares of PCT common stock instead of Legacy PCT Class C Units on November 20, 2020.\nRTI can exercise these warrants upon the first anniversary of Closing of the Business Combination. The warrants expire on December 31, 2024. In connection\nwith the closing of the Business Combination, the Company determined the warrants issued are liability classified under ASC 480. Accordingly, the warrants will\nbe held at their initial fair value and remeasured at fair value at each subsequent reporting date with changes in the fair value presented in the statements of\ncomprehensive loss.\nA summary of the significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the RTI Warrants as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 is as follows:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nExpected annual dividend yield — % — %\nExpected volatility 118.1 % 99.7 %\nRisk-free rate of return 4.7 % 4.4 %\nExpected option term (years) 1.0 2.0\nThe Company recognized $2.2 million and $1.5 million of benefit and $5.2 million of expense related to the change in fair value of the RTI warrant liability for the\nyears ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nPublic and Private Warrants\nUpon the closing of the Business Combination, there were approximately 5.9 million outstanding public and private warrants to purchase shares of the\nCompany’s common stock that were issued by ROCH prior to the Business Combination. The public warrants are accounted for as equity classified warrants as\nthey were determined to be indexed to the Company’s stock and meet the requirements for equity classification. The Company has determined the private\nwarrants are liability classified. Accordingly, the warrants were held at their initial fair value and remeasured at fair value at each subsequent reporting date with\nchanges in the fair value presented in the statements of comprehensive loss.\n48\nTable of Contents\nA summary of the significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the private warrants as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 is as follows:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nExpected annual dividend yield — % — %\nExpected volatility 100.2 % 105.1 %\nRisk-free rate of return 4.1 % 4.2 %\nExpected option term (years) 2.2 3.2\nThe Company recognized $0.5 million, $0.2 million and $3.7 million of benefit related to the change in fair value of the private warrant liability for the years\nended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nIf factors change, and we utilize different assumptions, the calculated warrant liabilities and related change in fair value may differ significantly in future periods.\nHigher volatility and longer expected terms result in an increase to the warrant liabilities and related change in fair value at each measurement date. Future\nwarrant liabilities will increase to the extent that we issue additional warrants, as well as any increase in the market price of PCT’s common stock. If there are\nany modifications or cancellations, this may impact the warrant liabilities and related expense or benefit recognized. Change in fair value of warrant liabilities is\npresented as its own line item within the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.\nFor further information regarding PCT’s warrant liabilities, see Note 6 (“Warrants”) to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing elsewhere\nin this Annual Report on Form 10‑K.\nSeries A Warrants\nUpon closing of the 2022 Pipe Offering, there were approximately 17.9 million outstanding Series A Warrants to purchase shares of the Company’s common\nstock, which were determined to be liability classified. Accordingly, the warrants were and will be held at their initial fair value and will be remeasured at fair\nvalue at each subsequent reporting date with changes in the fair value presented in the statements of comprehensive loss.\nAs these warrants have similar redemption features and the same exercise price as the Company’s publicly-traded warrants, the market price of the publicly-\ntraded warrants is utilized to value the Series A Warrants. Future warrant liabilities will increase to the extent that there are increases in the market price of the\npublicly-traded warrants. If there are any modifications or cancellations, this may impact the warrant liabilities and related expense or benefit recognized.\nChange in fair value of warrant liabilities is presented as its own line item within the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. The Company recognized\n$31.1 million of benefit and $7.5 million of expense for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\nFor further information regarding PCT’s warrant liabilities, see Note 6 (“Warrants”) to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing elsewhere\nin this Annual Report on Form 10‑K.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee the audited consolidated financial statements and Note 2 to the audited consolidated financial statements and audited consolidated financial statements\nincluded elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information about recent accounting pronouncements, the timing of their adoption, and our\nassessment, to the extent we have made one, of their potential impact on our financial condition and our results of operations.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInflation Risk\nThe primary inflationary factors affecting our operations are labor, materials, and energy costs related to construction of our purification plants and Feed PreP\nfacilities. Continued inflationary pressures could affect the global and U.S. economies and could have an adverse impact on our construction costs. While we\nexpect to partially offset inflation and other changes in the costs of construction through our pricing strategies, coupled with more efficient purchasing practices,\nproductivity improvements and greater economies of scale, there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful.\n49\nTable of Contents\nInvestments in Debt Securities\nOur investment policy is established by the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and is reviewed as needed. Pursuant to this investment policy, as\nof December 31, 2023, all investments were in debt securities and cash and cash equivalents, which are considered to be available-for-sale and are marked-to-\nmarket. We do not use any swaps, options, futures or forward contracts to hedge or enhance our investment portfolio. We manage the market risk related to\nthese investments by holding only highly liquid, minimum “A” rated securities. The weighted average maturity of our investment portfolio is 0.07 years.\nCommodity Market Risk\nThe plastics manufacturing industry is extremely price competitive because of the commodity-like nature of virgin polypropylene resin and its correlation to the\nprice of crude oil. The demand for recycled plastics can also fluctuate with the price of crude oil. If crude oil prices materially decline for an extended period, the\ncost to manufacture our UPR resin may become comparatively higher than the cost to manufacture virgin polypropylene resin. We believe that the current\nshifting market expectations toward sustainable sourcing of consumer plastics provides some protection from the risk related to fluctuating commodity prices.\nRaw Material Price Risk\nWe will purchase feedstock for our purification process from various sources. While many of the categories of feedstock we source are available from\nindependent suppliers, feedstock containing high levels of polypropylene is subject to fluctuations in price and availability attributable to a number of factors,\nincluding general economic conditions, commodity price fluctuations, the demand by competitors and other industries for the same raw materials and the\navailability of complementary and substitute materials. The profitability of our business also depends on the availability and proximity of these raw materials to\nour Feed PreP facilities and purification plants. The choice of feedstock to be used at our facilities is determined primarily by the price, availability, and\npolypropylene purity and content of waste polypropylene procured. Additionally, the high cost of transportation could favor suppliers located in closer proximity to\nour facilities. If the quality and polypropylene content of the feedstock is lower, the quality of our UPR resin and efficiencies of our purification process may\nsuffer. Changes in consumer behavior regarding consumption of products utilizing polypropylene, as well as consumer desire for UPR resin could also impact\nour business. Increases in feedstock and other raw material costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of\noperations. Attempts to hedge against these raw material fluctuations may be insufficient, and our results could be materially impacted if the costs of materials\nincrease. We believe our Feedstock+ pricing model, principally applicable to contracts signed for the Augusta Facility, provides certain protection from the risk\nof increased prices in obtaining and processing raw materials utilized in our purification process.\n50\nTable of Contents\nItem 8.

(a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as\nof December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in\nthe period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements\npresent fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash\nflows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”), and our report dated March 6, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion.\nGoing concern\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has sustained recurring losses from operations and has a net capital deficiency.\nManagement’s evaluation of the events and conditions and management’s plans to mitigate these matters are also described in Note 1.\nBasis for opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial\nstatements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in\naccordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to\nassess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such\nprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included\nevaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical audit matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to\nbe communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial\nstatements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nGoing concern analysis\nAs described further in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has sustained recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company has Available Unrestricted Liquidity of $121.6 million, Restricted Cash of $229.1 million and a positive working capital of\n52\nTable of Contents\n$107.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company incurred a net loss of $101.7 million and net cash used in operating activities was\n$94.9 million. The conditions described in Note 1 raise substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least\none year from the date of issuance of the financial statements; however, management believes its plans to mitigate these conditions alleviate substantial doubt\nand it believes the Company will be able to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued.\nWe identified the going concern analysis and evaluation of the related disclosures as a critical audit matter. The principal considerations for our determination\nthat the going concern analysis is a critical audit matter are the significant judgements and assumptions made by management in developing the cash flow\nforecast. There was a high degree of auditor judgement and subjectivity in performing our procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of the cash flow forecast.\nOur audit procedures related to the going concern analysis included the following, among others:\n• We tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls relating to management’s going concern analysis.\n• We obtained management’s cash flow forecast covering the going concern assessment period to March 2025. We tested the accuracy of underlying data\nused in preparing the cash flow forecast by determining whether there was adequate support, including agreeing committed financing to contractual\nsupport.\n• We evaluated the reasonableness of the cash flow forecast by comparing to historical operating results to consider management’s ability to accurately\nforecast and performing sensitivity analysis on cash expenditures and commitments.\n• We performed testing over the significant assumptions used in developing management’s cash flow forecast to assess accuracy. The key assumptions\nevaluated by the audit team included the following:\n• the probability of marketing and reselling the Revenue Bonds repurchased by the Company and potential terms of such transactions\n• the probability of the Ironton Plant operating at a level to provide significant cash inflows in 2024\n• We evaluated management’s forecasted cash needs in the context of other audit evidence obtained, including but not limited to, Board of Director and\ncommittee minutes, presentations, and communications with investors and third parties, and significant contracts entered during 2023 and subsequent to\nyear-end to determine whether the other audit evidence supported or contradicted the cash flow forecast.\n• We tested the subsequent event activity including, but not limited to, the repurchase of the Revenue Bonds and additional financing arrangements entered\nthrough March 6, 2024.\n• We assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures included within the consolidated financial statements relating to liquidity and going concern.\n/s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2019.\nSouthfield, Michigan\nMarch 6, 2024\n53\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nBoard of Directors and Stockholders\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\nOpinion on internal control over financial reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of PureCycle Technologies, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of\nDecember 31, 2023, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of\nthe Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2023, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by COSO.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated\nfinancial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, and our report dated March 6, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on\nthose financial statements.\nBasis for opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of\ninternal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our\nresponsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered\nwith the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules\nand regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating\neffectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We\nbelieve that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and\nthe preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect\nthe transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being\nmade only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely\ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nOther information\nWe do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on management’s remediation of previously reported material weaknesses in internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2022.\n/s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP\nSouthfield, Michigan\nMarch 6, 2024\n54\nTable of Contents\nPureCycle Technologies,

The\nLegacy PCT unitholders will be entitled to 2.0 million shares if after one year after the Closing and prior to or as of the third anniversary of the Closing, the\nclosing price of the common stock is greater than or equal to $18.00 over any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period. The Legacy PCT unitholders will\nbe entitled to 2.0 million shares upon the Ironton Facility becoming operational, as certified by Leidos Engineering, LLC (“Leidos”), an independent engineering\nfirm, in accordance with criteria established in agreements in connection with construction of the plant.\nUnless the context otherwise requires, “Registrant,” “PureCycle,” “Company,” “PCT,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to PureCycle Technologies, Inc., and its\nsubsidiaries at and after the Closing and give effect to the Closing. “Legacy PCT”, “ROCH” and “ParentCo” refer to PureCycle Technologies LLC, ROCH and\nParentCo, respectively, prior to the Closing.\n61\nTable of Contents\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\nPrivate Placement Offering\nOn March 7, 2022, the Company entered into subscription agreements (the “Subscription Agreements”) with certain investors (the “2022 PIPE Investors”),\npursuant to which the Company agreed to sell to the Investors, in a private placement, shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share,\nand Series A warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock (the “Series A Warrants”) at a price of $7.00 per share of Common Stock and one-half (1/2) of one\nSeries A Warrant (the “2022 PIPE Offering”).\nOn March 17, 2022, the Company closed the 2022 PIPE Offering and issued to the 2022 PIPE Investors an aggregate of 35,714,272 shares of Common Stock\nand Series A Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 17,857,136 shares of Common Stock. The Company received approximately $250.0 million in gross\nproceeds from the 2022 PIPE Offering. The Company incurred approximately $0.8 million of expenses primarily related to advisory fees in conjunction with the\n2022 PIPE Offering.\nRefer to Note 6 – Warrants for further information.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company. The consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S.\nDollars. Intercompany balances and transactions were eliminated upon consolidation. The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect all\nadjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to present a fair statement of the results for the\nperiods presented.\nReclassifications\nCertain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with the report classifications for the year ended December 31, 2023. Specifically, noting the\nCompany reclassified certain expenses between Operating costs, Research and development, and Selling, general, and administrative to more accurately\nreflect the activities of the business. Total operating costs and expenses did not change for prior years.\nImmaterial Corrections Related to Prior Periods\nWe have identified an immaterial correction to certain 2023 quarters related to depreciation expense associated with the Ironton Purification Plant assets\n(Machinery & Equipment) placed in service during the period presented herein. We evaluated the effect of this correction on the consolidated financial\nstatements for the year ended December 31, 2023 in accordance with the guidance in ASC 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, ASC 250-10-S99-\n1, Assessing Materiality, and ASC 250-10-S99-2, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year\nFinancial Statements. We have concluded that the 2023 prior periods are not materially misstated. Accordingly, we have reflected the 2023 prior period impacts\nand associated revisions for these periods presented herein.\nThe revision increased property, plant and equipment, net and decreased depreciation expense by $ 1.2 million for the three and six months ended June 30,\n2023, and $3.6 million and $4.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The revisions would have increased basic and diluted EPS by\n$0.01 and $0.01 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and $ 0.02 and $0.03 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nLiquidity and Going Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that PCT will continue as a going concern; however, the conditions\ndescribed below raise substantial doubt about PCT’s ability to do so, which management believes has been alleviated through its plans to mitigate these\nconditions and obtain additional unrestricted liquidity.\n62\nTable of Contents\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\nThe Company has sustained recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations since its inception. As reflected in the accompanying consolidated\nfinancial statements, the Company has begun limited commercial operations but does not have any significant sources of revenue.\nThe following is a summary of the components of our current liquidity (in thousands):\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nCash and cash equivalents $ 73,411 $ 63,892\nDebt securities available for sale $ 48,226 $ 98,592\nUnrestricted liquidity $ 121,637 $ 162,484\nLess: Other Ironton set-aside $ — $ 54,560\nAvailable unrestricted liquidity $ 121,637 $ 107,924\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents (current and non-current) $ 229,103 $ 163,631\nWorking capital $ 107,035 $ 197,916\nAccumulated deficit $ (344,240) $ (242,525)\nFor the twelve months ended\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nNet loss (101,715) $ (84,746)\nAs of December 31, 2023, PCT had $121.6 million of Available Unrestricted Liquidity and had Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents of $ 229.1 million. On\nMarch 15, 2023, PCT entered into a $150.0 million revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement\nmay be used for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. There are currently no borrowings under the Revolving Credit\nFacility.\nPCT sold an immaterial amount of UPR resin in 2023. Due to intermittent mechanical challenges during the commissioning process of the Ironton Facility, the\nIronton Facility has not yet reached the point of producing significant continuous operational volumes. While these mechanical issues are not uncommon for a\nfirst-of-its kind manufacturing facility, the downtime needed to correct these issues is a significant contributing factor to the delay of the Ironton Facility reaching\nthe point of producing significant continuous operational volumes. We expect the Ironton Facility to be fully operational later in 2024.\nIn 2023, PCT negotiated the Second Limited Waiver (as defined below) with the Revenue Bondholders to remedy the September Milestone Event of Default (as\ndefined below) related to the Ironton Facility’s failure to meet the September Milestone – see Note 3 (“Notes Payable and Debt Instruments”) to the Notes to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Pursuant to the Second Limited Waiver, the September Milestone Event of Default was waived,\nvarious Milestones were amended and extended and certain additional requirements were imposed upon PCT and its subsidiaries. PCO was unable to produce\n4.45 million pounds of pellets from its feedstock for thirty consecutive days by December 31, 2023, and certain required performance testing of the Ironton\nFacility was not complete by February 28, 2024, each as required by the Second Limited Waiver, and therefore PCO entered a 90-day cure period after which\npoint an Event of Default will be deemed to have occurred. Further, PCO expected to fail to meet certain annually calculated financial ratios as required. As\ndescribed in further detail below, on March 5, 2024, a subsidiary of the Company Purchased the majority of the outstanding Revenue Bonds and, in connection\nwith such Purchase substantially all covenants and Events of Default contained in the Indenture, including the potential Events of Defaults related to certain\nannually calculated financial ratios and missed milestones referenced herein, the Loan Agreement\n63\nTable of Contents\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\nand certain of such other Financing Documents were eliminated. See Note 3 - Notes Payable and Debt for more information.\nAs of December 31, 2023, PCT anticipates that up to $12.5 million will be needed to complete the investment in the Ironton Facility, which relates to a\nperformance guarantee payment due after successful completion of a performance testing milestone. PCT also has other capital commitments of approximately\n$53.8 million related to long-lead equipment and pre-construction work for the Augusta Facility and $ 7.8 million for equipment and leases related to future Feed\nPreP and purification facilities, both in the U.S. and internationally. Moreover, there are interest payments of at least $38.0 million, as well as other ongoing\nmonthly costs associated with managing the Company.\nPursuant to the requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 205-40, Disclosure of\nUncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, management must evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the\naggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the date the consolidated financial\nstatements are issued. This evaluation does not take into consideration the potential mitigating effect of management’s plans that have not been fully\nimplemented or are not within control of the Company as of the date the financial statements are issued. When substantial doubt exists under this methodology,\nmanagement evaluates whether the mitigating effect of its plans sufficiently alleviates substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going\nconcern. The mitigating effect of management’s plans, however, is only considered if both (1) it is probable that the plans will be effectively implemented within\none year after the date that the financial statements are issued, and (2) it is probable that the plans, when implemented, will mitigate the relevant conditions or\nevents that raise substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the consolidated financial\nstatements are issued.\nPCT believes that its current level of Unrestricted Available Liquidity is not sufficient to fund operations, outstanding commitments, and further its future growth\nplans. The conditions described above raise substantial doubt regarding PCT’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least one year from the\ndate of issuance of the consolidated financial statements.\nIn an effort to alleviate these conditions, PCT entered into two agreements. On March 5, 2024, a subsidiary of the Company Purchased 99% of the outstanding\nRevenue Bonds pursuant to the Purchase Agreement (as defined below). In connection with the Purchase, the Indenture was amended and supplemented and\nsubstantially all covenants and Events of Default contained in the Indenture, the Loan Agreement and certain of such other Financing Documents were\neliminated. The Purchase reduced unrestricted liquidity by $74.5 million and restricted liquidity by $184.6 million. Also, on March 1, 2024, PCT increased the\nRevolving Credit Facility from $150.0 million to $200.0 million, extended the maturity date to September 30, 2025, and obtained a carveout to permit the\nCompany to purchase the Revenue Bonds, pursuant to an amendment to the Credit Agreement with the Company (the “Borrower”), PureCycle Technologies\nHoldings Corp. and PureCycle Technologies, LLC (the “Guarantors”), Sylebra Capital Partners Master Fund, LTD, Sylebra Capital Parc Master Fund, and\nSylebra Capital Menlo Master Fund (collectively, the “Lenders”), and Madison Pacific Trust Limited (the “Administrative Agent” and “Security Agent”).\nBorrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement may be used for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes – see Note 3\n(“Notes Payable and Debt Instruments”) to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for\nadditional information. Further, PCT intends to and has the ability to re-market some or all of the Purchased Revenue Bonds based on the need for additional\nliquidity. The re-marketing process may require the addition of certain covenants to enhance the marketability of the Purchased Revenue Bonds. The ability to\nre-market the Purchased Revenue Bonds with any such additional new covenants would require a further amendment to, or waiver of, provisions included\nwithin the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Credit Agreement. After considering management’s plans to mitigate these conditions, including adjustment\nof expenditure timing and execution of the amendment to the Sylebra Revolving Credit Facility, PCT believes this substantial doubt has been alleviated and it\nhas sufficient liquidity to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months.\n64\nTable of Contents\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\nPCT’s future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the funding mechanism and construction schedule of the Augusta Facility and other\nanticipated facilities outside the United States, build-out of multiple Feed PreP facilities, funding needs to support other business opportunities, funding for\ngeneral corporate purposes, and other challenges or unforeseen circumstances. As a low-revenue operating company, PCT continually reviews its cash\noutlays, pace of hiring, professional services and other spend, and capital commitments to proactively manage those needs in tandem with our Available\nUnrestricted Liquidity balance. For future growth and investment, PCT expects to seek additional debt or equity financing from outside sources, which it may not\nbe able to raise on terms favorable to PCT, or at all. If PCT is unable to raise additional debt or sell additional equity when desired, or if PCT is unable to\nmanage its cash outflows, PCT’s business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected. In addition, any financing arrangement\nmay have potentially adverse effects on PCT and/or its stockholders. Debt financing (if available and undertaken) will increase expenses, must be repaid\nregardless of operating results and may involve restrictions limiting PCT’s operating flexibility. If PCT consummates an equity financing to raise additional funds,\nthe percentage ownership of its existing stockholders will be reduced, and the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of\nthe current holders of PCT’s common stock.\nNOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nGoing Concern\nRefer to Note 1 – Organization for further discussion.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at date of inception to be cash and cash equivalents. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents balance represents cash and money market funds deposited with financial institutions, as well\nas commercial paper and US treasuries with maturities of 90 days or less at acquisition. These balances may exceed federally insured limits; however, the\nCompany believes the risk of loss is low. Actively traded money market funds are measured at their net asset value (“NAV”) and classified as Level 1. The\nCompany’s remaining cash equivalents are classified as Level 2 and measured at amortized cost, which is a reasonable estimate of fair value because of the\nshort time between the purchase of the instrument and its expected realization.\nRestricted Cash\nProceeds from the issuance of revenue bonds are restricted for use in construction of the Ironton Facility. Amounts required by the Limited Waiver (refer to Note\n3 – Notes Payable and Debt Instruments) were also placed in restricted cash for various future uses. Cash pledged as collateral for leased properties is also\ndeemed restricted and included within this definition. Restricted cash that is expected to be spent or released from restriction within twelve months is classified\nas current on the consolidated balance sheet. Restricted cash that is expected to be spent or released from restriction after twelve months is classified as\nnoncurrent on the consolidated balance sheet.\nInvestments\nThe Company accounts for its investment in Debt Securities in accordance with ASC 320, Investments – Debt Securities. The fair value for fixed-rate debt\nsecurities is based on quoted market prices for the same or similar debt instruments and is classified as Level 2. All investment holdings as of December 31,\n2023 and 2022 have been classified as Available for Sale. The Company classifies its Debt Securities investments as current assets as they are highly liquid\nand the related funds are available for use in current operations.\nBond Issuance Costs\nThe Company has incurred costs which are directly attributable to the Company’s revenue bond financing. These costs include items such as document\npreparation costs, underwriting fees, and other external, incremental expenses paid to advisors that directly relate to the financing. Upon successful completion\nof the bond offering in 2020, these costs were reclassified to reduce the carrying amount of the bond liability and will\n65\nTable of Contents\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\nbe amortized ratably over the term of the bond using the effective interest method. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 the Company\nincurred $0, $0 and $4.0 million, respectively, of capitalized bond issuance costs. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company has capitalized bond\nissuance costs totaling $10.2 million and $11.1 million, which are recorded as an offset to Bonds payable - non-current on the consolidated balance sheet.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company’s property, plant and equipment consists of building, land, office equipment and furniture, machinery and\nequipment, fixtures and furnishings and construction in progress. All property, plant and equipment are located within the United States. Property, plant and\nequipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated over their estimated useful lives, unless the useful life is indefinite, using the straight-line method over the\nfollowing table:\nBuilding 10-39 years\nLand Indefinite\nOffice equipment and furniture 3-5 years\nMachinery and equipment 3-30 years\nFixtures and Furnishings 5-7 years\nConstruction in progress relates to costs capitalized in conjunction with major improvements that have not yet been placed in service, and accordingly are not\ncurrently being depreciated. The Company capitalizes interest cost incurred on funds used to construct property, plant and equipment. In accordance with ASC\n835, Interest, the Company capitalizes all interest incurred on tax exempt project indebtedness. The capitalized interest is recorded as part of the asset to which\nit relates over the asset’s estimated useful life. Interest cost capitalized as of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 totaled $ 7.1 million, $17.1 mil and $17.1\nmillion, respectively.\nThe Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired and the undiscounted\nnet cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying value. If the net carrying value exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss\nexists and is calculated based on either estimated salvage value or estimated orderly liquidation value.\nDuring 2023, the Company determined that there were indicators of impairment directly and indirectly related to not achieving reliably, consistent operations.\nSpecifically, missed operational milestones and certain failed debt service coverage covenants related to the Revenue Bonds. After grouping the long-lived\nassets at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities, PCT estimated\nthe future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the use of the long-lived asset group. PCT then compared the estimated undiscounted cash\nflows to the carrying amount of the long-lived asset group. Based on this test, it was determined that the estimated undiscounted cash flows were in excess of\nthe carrying amount of the long-lived asset group and, accordingly, the long-lived asset group is fully recoverable as of December 31, 2023.\nOperating Costs\nOperating costs are expensed as incurred. Operating costs consist of facility employee personnel costs, expense for supplies and materials, depreciation,\ntransportation and other operating related expense.\nResearch and Development Costs\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses consist of expenses for services provided by third parties,\nand payroll and benefits of those employees engaged in research, design and development activities, costs related to design tools, license expenses related to\nintellectual property, and supplies and services.\n66\nTable of Contents\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses are expensed as incurred. Selling, general, and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs, allocated\nfacilities expenses, facility rent, repairs and utilities, office insurance, travel, sales and marketing costs.\nIncome Taxes\nPrior to the Business Combination on March 17, 2021, the Company was a limited liability company (“LLC”) and had elected to be treated as a partnership for\nincome tax purposes, with the Company’s taxable income or loss being allocated to its stockholders. As an LLC, the Company was not directly liable for income\ntaxes for federal purposes. The Company was, however, subject to annual state LLC franchise taxes and state LLC fees. As of the date of the Business\nCombination, the operations of the Company ceased to be taxed as a partnership resulting in a change in tax status for federal and state income tax purposes.\nManagement has evaluated the Company’s tax positions, including its previous status as a pass-through entity for federal and state tax purposes, and has\ndetermined that the Company has taken no uncertain tax positions that require adjustment to the consolidated financial statements. The Company’s reserve for\npenalties and interest (“P&I”) related to uncertain tax positions was zero as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. As a policy election, the Company will accrue\nfuture P&I on unrecognized tax benefits through income tax expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.\nNet Loss Per Share\nThe Company computes net loss per share in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings per Share. Basic (loss) earnings per share is computed by dividing (loss)\nincome available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per\nshare is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted- average number of shares of common shares outstanding during the\nperiod increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued,\nusing the treasury stock method.\nEquity-Based Compensation\nThe Company issues grants of incentive shares to select employees and service providers. The equity-based compensation cost for the incentive shares is\nmeasured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is the vesting\nperiod. The Company evaluates modifications in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation (“ASC 718”). The Company accounts for\nforfeitures as they occur for its equity-based awards.\nWarrants\nThe Company evaluates all of its financial instruments, including issued warrants, to determine if such instruments are liability classified, pursuant to ASC 480,\nDistinguishing Liabilities from Equity (“ASC 480”) or derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives pursuant to ASC 815, Derivatives and\nHedging (“ASC 815”). The classification of instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed at the\nend of each reporting period. Issuance costs incurred with the Business Combination that are attributable to liability classified warrants are expensed as\nincurred.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the\nreported amounts of expenses for the period presented. The Company's most significant estimates and judgments involve valuation of the Company's liability-\nclassified warrants and related fair value assumptions. Although these\n67\nTable of Contents\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\nestimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that the Company may undertake in the future, actual results may be\ndifferent from these estimates.\nSegment Information\nUnder ASC 280, Segment Reporting, operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise where discrete financial information is available that is\nevaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\"), in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company has\none component. Therefore, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, who is also the CODM, makes decisions and manages the Company's operations as a\nsingle operating segment, which is conducting business as a plastic recycler. To date, the Company has limited operations and measures performance on a\nconsolidated basis.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company applies fair value accounting in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements (“ASC 820”) for valuation of financial instruments. ASC 820\ndefines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value and making disclosures about fair value measurements. This framework applies to all\nfinancial assets and liabilities that are being measured and reported at fair value and for disclosures of fair value.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-09—Income Taxes (Topic 740):\nImprovements to Income Tax Disclosures, which enhances the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The amendments in this\nUpdate address investor requests for more transparency about income tax information through improvements to income tax disclosures primarily related to the\nrate reconciliation and income taxes paid information and includes certain other amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures. The\nupdated standard is effective for our annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that\nthe updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting, which\nexpands annual and interim disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The\nupdated standard is effective for our annual periods beginning in fiscal 2025 and interim periods beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2026. Early adoption is\npermitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses of Financial Instruments (“ASU\n2016-13”), which, together with subsequent amendments, amends the requirement on the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial\nassets held. The Company adopted the ASU during the first quarter of 2023 using a prospective approach. The adoption of the ASU did not have a material\nimpact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nThere have been no other recent accounting pronouncements, changes in accounting pronouncements or recently adopted accounting guidance during fiscal\n2023 that are of significance or potential significance to us.\n68\nTable of Contents\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\nNOTE 3 – NOTES PAYABLE AND DEBT INSTRUMENTS\nThe Company’s debt balances consist of the following at December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nYears ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nRevenue Bonds $ 249,550 $ 249,550\nEquipment Financing Payable 21,509 —\nGreen Convertible Notes 250,000 —\n$ 521,059 $ 249,550\nLess: Original issue discount and debt issuance costs classified as a reduction to long-term debt (44,203) (16,037)\nLess: Current portion (9,148) —\nLong-term debt, less current portion $ 467,708 $ 233,513\nPure Plastic Note Payable $ 43,125 $ —\nLess: Original issuance discount and debt issuance costs classified as a reduction to note payable (3,429) —\nRelated party note payable $ 39,696 $ —\nRevenue Bonds\nOn October 7, 2020, the Southern Ohio Port Authority (“SOPA”) issued certain revenue bonds (“Revenue Bonds”) pursuant to an Indenture of Trust dated as of\nOctober 1, 2020 (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Indenture”), between SOPA and UMB Bank, N.A., as\nTrustee (“Trustee”), and loaned the proceeds from their sale to PureCycle: Ohio LLC (“PCO”), an Ohio limited liability company and indirect wholly-owned\nsubsidiary of PCT, pursuant to a Loan Agreement dated as of October 1, 2020, between SOPA and PCO (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise\nmodified from time to time, the “Loan Agreement”), to be used to (i) acquire, construct and equip the Ironton Facility (referred to within the Loan Agreement as\nthe “Ohio Phase II Facility” and, together with the FEU (referred to within the Loan Agreement as the “Phase I Facility”), the “Project”); (ii) fund a debt service\nreserve fund for the Series 2020A Bonds; (iii) finance capitalized interest; and (iv) pay the costs of issuing the Revenue Bonds.

In addition, 100% of revenue attributable to the production of\nthe Ironton Facility must be deposited into an operating revenue escrow fund held by U.S. Bank National Association, as escrow agent. Funds in the trust\naccounts and operating revenue escrow account will be disbursed by the Trustee when certain conditions are met, and will be used to pay costs and\nexpenditures related to the development of the Ironton Facility, make required interest and principal payments (including sinking fund redemption amounts) and\nany premium, in certain circumstances required under the Indenture, to redeem the Revenue Bonds.\nAs conditions for closing the Revenue Bonds, Legacy PCT contributed $60.0 million in equity at closing and PureCycle and certain affiliates contributed an\nadditional $40.0 million in equity upon the Closing of the Business Combination. PureCycle provided the Liquidity Reserve for construction of the Ironton Facility\nof $50.0 million and deposited the amount upon the Closing of the Business Combination. In addition, PureCycle must maintain at least $ 75.0 million of cash on\nits balance sheet as of July 31, 2021 and $100.0 million of cash on its balance sheet as of January 31, 2022, including the Liquidity Reserve. The Company has\nmet this requirement and continues to maintain that cash balance at December 31, 2023.\nThe Revenue Bonds are recorded within Bonds payable in the consolidated balance sheet. The Company incurred $19.3 million, $19.4 million, and $19.3 million\nof interest cost during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 respectively. As the Revenue Bond proceeds were used to construct the\nCompany’s property, plant and equipment, the interest costs related to the tax-exempt portion of the Revenue Bonds have been capitalized within Property,\nPlant and Equipment. The Company capitalized $7.1 million, $17.1 million, and $17.1 million of interest cost during the twelve months ended December 31,\n2023, 2022, and 2021 respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the fair value of the Revenue Bonds was $193.9 million, which was determined using inputs\ncharacteristic of a Level 2 fair value measurement. Although the Company has determined the estimated fair value using available market information and\ncommonly accepted valuation methodologies, considerable judgment is required in interpreting the information and in developing the estimated fair value.\nTherefore, this estimate is not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company, or holders of the instruments, could realize in a current market\nexchange.\nIn connection with its obligations under that certain Security Agreement dated as of October 7, 2020, between PCO, as debtor, and the Trustee, as secured\nparty, entered into when the Revenue Bonds were issued (the “Security Agreement”), PCO must deliver consent and agreements (“Consents”) to the Trustee\nwith respect to each agreement entered into in connection with the Project, each of which agreements is required under the Loan Agreement to be assigned to\nthe Trustee. The forms of the Consents relating to a certain feedstock supply agreement from one supplier of feedstock to the Project (the “Supplier”) and from\ntwo purchasers of offtake from the Project (“Offtaker 2” and “Offtaker 3” and together with the Supplier, the “Counterparties”) delivered to the Trustee contained\nterms inconsistent with the form of the Consent required under the Security Agreement. On May 11, 2021, the Guaranty was amended and restated in an\namended and restated guaranty of completion (the “ARG”) executed by PureCycle and delivered to the Trustee, which broadens the purposes for which draws\nby the Trustee on the Liquidity Reserve may be utilized, extends the period during which the Liquidity Reserve must be maintained, includes conditions that\nwould permit a reduction in the amount of the Liquidity Reserve required to be maintained by PureCycle, and includes conditions precedent to the elimination of\nthe requirement that PureCycle replenish the Liquidity Reserve and to the termination of the ARG and the escrow agreement under which the Liquidity Reserve\nis held by the escrow agent (the “Escrow Agreement”), upon which termination, the balance of the Liquidity Reserve will be returned to PureCycle. So long as\nthere are any Series 2020A Bonds outstanding under the Indenture, the ARG and the Escrow Agreement will remain in place upon the conditions stated in the\nARG. The terms of the ARG are summarized as follows: The Liquidity Reserve shall be maintained in the amount of $50.0 million, subject to replenishment by\nPureCycle until certain conditions stated in the ARG relating to the following have been met: (i) the completion of construction and acquisition of the Project, (ii)\nthe payment of all Project costs, and (iii) the replacement of the assigned agreements of the Counterparties underlying the Consents which have expired or\nterminated, with one or more agreements between counterparties and PCO upon terms at least as favorable to PCO as the expired or terminated agreements of\nthe Counterparties, (a) for which a Consent that conforms to the form of Consent required by the Security Agreement is executed by the counterparties and\nprovided to the Trustee, (b) which, in the case of\n70\nTable of Contents\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\nsupply of feedstock to the Project, provide in the aggregate for the supply of at least the minimum and maximum volumes of feedstock meeting substantially\nsimilar feedstock specifications as the Supplier had committed to supply, and (c) which, in the case of purchase of offtake from the Project, provide in the\naggregate for the purchase of the minimum and maximum volumes of offtake from the Project meeting substantially similar specifications as Offtaker 2 and\nOfftaker 3 had committed to purchase from PCO. When the conditions stated in (i), (ii) and (iii) above have been satisfied but so long as there are Series 2020A\nBonds outstanding under the Indenture, the Escrow Agreement shall remain in place but the Liquidity Reserve amount shall be reduced to $25 million and\nPureCycle shall no longer be required to replenish the amount of the reduced Liquidity Reserve if and when disbursements are made therefrom. If the\nconditions of (i) and (ii) have been met but only a portion of the feedstock and offtake contracted for by the Counterparties, respectively, has been replaced\nunder replacement agreements as aforesaid in (iii) above, then the Liquidity Reserve amount may be reduced only by the applicable proportion of the amounts\nstated in the ARG which evidence the intent of the parties of the amount of value representing the supply or offtake of the agreements of the Counterparties.\nWhen the conditions precedent of (i), (ii), and (iii) have been satisfied and there are no longer any Series 2020A Bonds then outstanding, then PureCycle shall\nhave no obligation to maintain the reduced Liquidity Reserve, the ARG and the Escrow Agreement shall terminate and the balance on deposit in the Liquidity\nReserve escrow fund held by the escrow agent shall be returned to PureCycle.\nAs long as any Series 2020A Bonds remain outstanding under the Indenture, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Loan Agreement or\nIndenture, if the Trustee takes control of the Liquidity Reserve held by the escrow agent, such funds may be used for any purpose, including the payment of\ndebt service on the Series 2020A Bonds, as may be determined by the Trustee or directed by a majority of the holders of the Series 2020A Bonds then\noutstanding.\nOn March 15, 2023, SOPA, the Trustee, PCT, PCTO Holdco LLC (the pledgor under an Equity Pledge and Security Agreement (as defined in the Indenture),\npursuant to which the pledgor pledged certain interests to secure obligations of PCO under various Financing Documents relating to the Revenue Bonds and\nPCO (collectively, the “Company Parties”) entered into a Limited Waiver and First Supplemental Indenture (the “Limited Waiver”), supplementing the Indenture\nand amending the Loan Agreement and the amended and restated Guaranty (as defined in the Indenture), and pursuant to which the Holders (as defined in the\nIndenture) of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Series 2020A Bonds outstanding (the “Majority Holders”) consented to the Limited Waiver, based\non stated conditions, of a Specified Event of Default (as defined below) under the Indenture and the Loan Agreement.\nUnder the terms of the Loan Agreement, PCO was required to cause the Ironton Facility to be completed by December 1, 2022. The Ironton Facility was not\ncompleted by that date due to a variety of challenges resulting from, among other things, the COVID-19 outbreak, the ongoing military conflict between Russia\nand Ukraine, and certain U.S. weather-related events (the “First Specified Event of Default”).\nSubject to the following conditions, the First Specified Event of Default is waived in exchange for PCO’s agreement to meet certain milestones toward\ncompleting the Ironton Facility, to deposit additional equity aggregating approximately $87.3 million with the Trustee for various purposes and to make certain\nother representations and warranties; provided, however, that any failure to comply with the terms of the Limited Waiver shall be an immediate Event of Default\nunder the Indenture and Loan Agreement, which will be deemed to have occurred on January 2, 2023 with respect to any requirements to pay accrued and\nunpaid interest at the Default Rate.\nPCO has agreed to, among other things, achieve the following milestones (together, the “Milestones”): (i) closure by it or its direct or indirect parent entity of a\nfinancing transaction by March 31, 2023 that provides at least $150 million of working capital which may be used to support the Ironton Facility (which is\nsatisfied by the closing of the Revolving Credit Facility); (ii) mechanical completion of the Ironton Facility by June 30, 2023; (iii) meet certain targeted production\nand performance targets during 2023; (iv) completion of the Ironton Facility by December 31, 2023; and (v) meet certain Ironton Facility pellet production targets\nby January 31, 2024 up to the Ironton Facility’s nameplate production capacity of 107 million pounds per year.\n71\nTable of Contents\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\nThe additional approximate $87.3 million of equity to be deposited with the Trustee is comprised of: (i) a deposit, by March 31, 2023, of $ 50 million in an account\ncontrolled by the Trustee; (ii) a deposit of approximately $25 million in the Equity Account of the Project Fund (as such terms are used in the Indenture) to fund\nremaining construction costs; (iii) an aggregate deposit of approximately $12.3 million into the Capitalized Interest Accounts (as defined in the Indenture) for the\nSeries 2020A Bonds, Series 2020B Bonds and Series 2020C Bonds to pay capitalized interest on the Revenue Bonds through June 30, 2024. The Limited\nWaiver also requires that the Liquidity Reserve of approximately $50 million remain in the Liquidity Reserve Escrow Fund (as such term is used in the\nIndenture) for a period beyond the completion date of the Ironton Facility until certain production requirements have been met, and only thereafter may the\nbalance in that fund be reduced based on certain conditions to $25 million, which must remain therein as long as Series 2020A Bonds remain outstanding. The\nTrustee also released $13.2 million from the Trustee account for the Revenue Bonds for use as part of the remaining investment in 2023 to complete the Ironton\nFacility in accordance with the Limited Waiver.\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Ironton Facility failed to meet one such Milestone related to certain targeted production and performance targets, specifically, it\nfailed to produce 4.45 million pounds of pellets from its feedstock in a single month by that date (“September Milestone”). This created an Event of Default under\nthe Limited Waiver (the “September Milestone Event of Default”).\nAs a result of the September Milestone Event of Default, on November 8, 2023, the Limited Waiver parties entered into a Limited Waiver and Second\nSupplemental Indenture (the “Second Limited Waiver”) pursuant to which the September Milestone Event of Default was waived, various Milestones were\namended and extended and certain additional requirements were imposed upon PCT and its subsidiaries. The principal terms of the Second Limited Waiver,\ninclude, but are not limited to, the following:\ni. PCO will deposit an additional $50,000,000 (the “Trustee Account Deposit”) in the Trustee Account (as defined in the Limited Waiver), such that at least\n$100,000,000 (the “Aggregate Trustee Deposit”) shall be on deposit in the Trustee Account so long as any Revenue Bonds remain outstanding; provided,\nthat if no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, $50,000,000 of funds in the Trustee Account shall be released back to PCO upon\nsatisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 4.11(a) of the amended and restated Guaranty.\nii. subject to there being no default or event of default and compliance with the other terms of the Second Limited Waiver, once per quarter, PCO (and the\nGuarantor, if applicable) may request the release to PCO (or the Guarantor, as applicable) of any investment income or earnings with respect to amounts\nin the Trustee Account and the Liquidity Reserve Escrow Fund that have been invested pursuant to the terms of the Indenture or the Liquidity Reserve\nEscrow Agreement (as applicable).\niii.

(“CSC”). Pursuant to the Master Lease Agreement, the Company and CSC agreed to enter into\nschedules that establish the specific terms and conditions of leasing certain equipment, machines, devices, features and any other items listed in each\nequipment lease schedule. The Master Lease Agreement commenced on the date set forth above and continues in effect until the later time that it is terminated,\neither by CSC at the end of any lease term, or by the Company upon three months written notice prior to the expiration of a lease term.\nAlso on May 8, 2023, the Company, also through PureCycle PreP LLC, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into an Equipment\nProcurement Agreement (the “Equipment Agreement”) with CSC. Under the terms of the Equipment Agreement, CSC has agreed to finance, acquire and/or\npurchase certain equipment (the “Equipment”) from third-party vendors and/or manufacturers (each, a “Vendor”), so that CSC may lease the Equipment to the\nCompany pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Master Lease Agreement. Prior to entering into formal lease schedules under the Master Lease\nAgreement, the Company will lease from CSC certain Equipment pursuant to the terms of the Equipment Agreement.\nIn connection with the above, CSC has funded $19.8 million for purposes of procuring equipment from a Vendor, which had previously been ordered by the\nCompany prior to entering into these agreements with CSC. CSC will lease this equipment back to the Company under a 36 month lease, which will commence\nwhen 1) the Company accepts delivery of the equipment at its operating location and 2) all final bills from Vendor are paid. The Company has determined that it\ndid not relinquish control of the assets to the buyer-lessor under these arrangements. Therefore, the Company has accounted for this transaction as a failed\nsale-leaseback transaction whereby it has continued recording these assets in the consolidated balance sheet and also recorded a financing obligation for the\nconsideration paid by the buyer-lessor. The Company currently expects the lease term to commence in 2024, and the repayment schedule below assumes\npayments under the 36 month term commence on December 1, 2024.\nThe Company is also required to make monthly payments under the agreements during the period between funding of the construction obligation and delivery of\nthe equipment, which began in June 2023 and are equal to a monthly lease rate factor of approximately 3.1% of the outstanding amount funded by CSC (the\n“Lease Rate Factor”). The Company has determined that these payments represent a cost of borrowing under the financing arrangement and has recorded the\npayments as interest expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). The Company incurred $4.6 million of interest related to these\nobligations for the twelve months ending December 31, 2023. The Lease Rate Factor is indexed to the WSJ Prime Rate as published by the Wall Street Journal\nand may be increased for every five basis point change in the index prior to final commencement of the 36 month lease term. Upon commencement of the 36\nmonth lease term, the payments will be characterized as repayment of debt, and the expected coupon rate for the 36 month term is 7.25%.\nThe Master Lease Agreement contains representations, covenants and events of default that are customary for financing transactions of this nature. Events of\ndefault in the Master Lease Agreement include, among others: (a) non-payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts; (b) default of specific covenants; (c)\nbreach of representations and warranties; (d) discontinuation of authorized electronic payments without CSC’s consent; (e) failure to furnish proof of insurance;\n(f) bankruptcy and insolvency proceedings; and (g) any unauthorized conveyance or transfer of the Equipment to a third party. Upon the occurrence of an event\nof default, CSC may accelerate all unpaid rents and exercise all rights and remedies available to it under the Master Lease Agreement and Equipment\nAgreement. Amounts due under the lease are guaranteed by PCT.\nOther Equipment Financing\nThe Company has executed other equipment sale leasebacks which qualify as financing arrangements, with a total of $ 1.8 million outstanding as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\n75\nTable of Contents\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\nSylebra Credit Facility\nOn March 15, 2023, PCT entered into a $150 million revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) pursuant to a Credit Agreement (the “Revolving\nCredit Agreement”) dated as of March 15, 2023, with PureCycle Technologies Holdings Corp. and PureCycle Technologies, LLC (the “Guarantors”), Sylebra\nCapital Partners Master Fund, LTD, Sylebra Capital Parc Master Fund, and Sylebra Capital Menlo Master Fund (collectively, the “Lenders”), and Madison\nPacific Trust Limited (the “Administrative Agent” and “Security Agent”), which matures on June 30, 2024.

The Company incurred $3.4 million of interest cost during the\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2023. The interest due to date of $3.1 million was paid entirely in kind, which increased the principal amount of the Term\nLoan Facility by this amount (the “PIK Interest”). The Company has the contractual right to pay all interest payments in kind and\n77\nTable of Contents\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\nmay make this election for all interest payments for the duration of the Term Loan Facility.

An amount equal to the difference between the issue price and the principal amount at maturity will accrete from the original issue date through August\n15, 2027. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company. Entities affiliated with Sylebra Capital Management purchased $50.0 million aggregate\nprincipal amount at maturity of Notes.\nThe net proceeds from this offering were approximately $218.50 million, after deducting the initial purchaser’s discounts and fees paid to our financial advisor.\nThe Company intends to allocate an amount equal to the net proceeds from this offering to the financing and refinancing of recently completed and future\nEligible Green Projects (as defined below) in the United States. In particular, the Company intends to allocate the net proceeds from this offering to make\npayments on certain long-lead items and fund initial outside battery limits engineering design work, both associated with a multi-line purification facility to be built\nin Augusta, Georgia.

The Indenture includes customary covenants and sets forth certain events of default after which the Notes may be declared\nimmediately due and payable and sets forth certain types of bankruptcy or insolvency events of default involving the Company after which the Notes become\nautomatically due and payable. The events of default, as set forth in the Indenture and subject in certain cases to customary grace and cure periods, include\ncustomary events including a default in the payment of principal or interest, failure to comply with the obligation to deliver amounts due upon conversion, failure\nto give certain notices, failure to comply with the obligations in respect of certain merger transactions, defaults under certain other indebtedness and certain\nevents of bankruptcy and insolvency.\nThe Notes will mature on August 15, 2030 (the “Maturity Date”), unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. The Notes will bear interest at a rate of\n7.25% per annum on the principal amount at maturity from August 24, 2023, payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year,\nbeginning on February 15, 2024.\nHolders of the Notes may convert all or any portion of their Notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day\nimmediately preceding the maturity date. Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of its common stock or a\ncombination of cash and shares of its common stock, at the Company’s election. The conversion rate will initially be 67.4764 shares of common stock per\n$1,000 principal amount at maturity of notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $14.82 per share of common stock), which represents a\nconversion premium of approximately 50% to the $9.88 per share closing price of the Company’s common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market on August 21,\n2023. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events. In addition, following certain corporate events described in the\nIndenture that occur prior to August 15, 2027, or upon the issuance of a notice of redemption (as described below) prior to August 15, 2027 for an optional\nredemption, the Company will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its Notes in connection with such a\ncorporate event or elects to convert its notes called (or deemed called) for optional redemption during the related redemption period.\nHolders of the Notes have the right to require the Company to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their Notes on August 15, 2027 at a repurchase price\nequal to 100% of the principal amount at maturity of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, August 15, 2027. In\naddition, if the Company undergoes a fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture), holders of the Notes may require the Company to repurchase their\nNotes at a cash repurchase price equal to 100% of the accreted principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but\nexcluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.\nThe Company may not redeem the Notes prior to August 20, 2025.

Refer to Note 12 – Fair Value of Financial Instruments for further information.\nPublic Warrants and Private Warrants\nThe Company has outstanding public and private warrants which entitle each holder to exercise its warrants only for a whole number of shares of Common\nStock. Each whole warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase one whole share of the Company’s common stock at a price of $11.50 per share at the\nlater of the closing of the Business Combination or one year after ROCH’s initial public offering, provided that the Company has an effective registration\nstatement under the Securities Act covering the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating to them is\navailable and such shares are registered, qualified or exempt from registration under the securities, or blue sky, laws of the state of residence of the holder. The\nwarrants will expire five years after March 17, 2021, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. The private warrants are identical to the public warrants, except\nthat the private warrants and the common stock issuable upon exercise of the private warrants were not transferable, assignable or salable until after March 17,\n2021, subject to certain limited exceptions. Additionally, the private warrants are non-redeemable so long as they are held by the initial holder or any of its\npermitted transferees. If the private warrants are held by someone other than the initial holder or its permitted transferees, the private warrants will be\nredeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the public warrants.\nThe Company may redeem the outstanding warrants in whole, but not in part, at a price of $ 0.01 per warrant upon a minimum of 30 days’ prior written notice of\nredemption, if and only if the last sale price of the Company’s common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share for any 20-trading days within a 30-day trading\nday period ending three business days before the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders. If the Company calls the warrants for\nredemption, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the warrants to do so on a cashless basis. In no event will the\nCompany be required to net cash settle the warrant exercise. The public warrants are accounted for as equity classified warrants as they were determined to be\nindexed to the Company’s stock and meet the requirements for equity classification.\nThe Company has classified the private warrants as a warrant liability as there is a provision within the warrant agreement that allows for private warrants to be\nexercised via a cashless exercise while held by the Sponsor and affiliates of the Sponsor, but would not be exercisable at any time on a cashless basis if\ntransferred and held by another investor. Therefore, the Company will classify the private warrants as a liability pursuant to ASC 815 until the private warrants\nare transferred from the initial purchasers or any of their permitted transferees.\nThere were approximately 5.7 million Public Warrants and 0.2 million Private Placement warrants outstanding at December 31, 2023 and 2022. The Company\nrecognized $0.5 million, $0.2 million and $3.7 million of benefit related to the change in fair value of the Private Warrants for the years ended December 31,\n2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Refer to Note 12 – Fair Value of Financial Instruments for further information.\nSeries A Warrants\nUpon the closing of the 2022 PIPE Offering, the Company issued approximately 17.9 million Series A Warrants to the 2022 PIPE Investors to purchase shares of\nthe Company’s common stock. Each whole warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase one whole share of the Company’s Common Stock at a price of\n$11.50 per share any time after September 17, 2022 (the “Initial Exercise Date”), provided that the Company has an effective registration statement under the\nSecurities Act covering the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating to them is available and such\nshares are registered, qualified or exempt from registration under the securities, or blue sky, laws of the state of residence of the holder. Pursuant to the warrant\nagreement, a warrant holder may exercise its warrants only for a whole number of shares of Common Stock. The warrants will expire on March 17, 2026.\nThe Company may redeem the outstanding Series A Warrants in whole, but not in part, at a price of $ 0.01 per warrant upon a minimum of 30 days’ prior written\nnotice of redemption, if and only if the last sale price of the Company’s common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share for any 20-trading days within a 30-\ntrading day\n85\nTable of Contents\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\nperiod commencing after the Series A Warrants become exercisable and ending three business days before the Company sends the notice of redemption to the\nwarrant holders. If the Company calls the Series A Warrants for redemption, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the\nwarrants to do so on a cashless basis. In no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the warrant exercise.\nThe agreements governing the Series A Warrants (the “Series A Warrant Agreements”) provide for a Black Scholes value calculation (“Black Scholes Value”) in\nthe event of certain transactions (“Fundamental Transactions”), which includes a floor on volatility utilized in the value calculation at 100% or greater.\nThe Company has determined this provision introduces leverage to the holders of the Series A Warrants that could result in a value that would be greater than\nthe settlement amount of a fixed-for-fixed option on the Company’s own equity shares. Therefore, the Company has classified the Series A Warrants as a\nliability pursuant to ASC 815.\nAs of December 31, 2023, there were approximately 17.9 million Series A Warrants outstanding. The Company recognized $31.1 million of benefit for the year\nended December 31, 2023 and $7.5 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2022. Refer to Note 12 – Fair Value of Financial Instruments for further\ninformation.\nNOTE 7 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nSylebra Credit Facility\nOn March 15, 2023, PCT entered into the Revolving Credit Facility pursuant to the Revolving Credit Agreement with the Guarantors, Lenders, and the\nAdministrative Agent, which matures on March 31, 2025. The Revolving Credit Facility was amended on May 8, 2023, August 4, 2023 and August 21, 2023.\nThe Lenders and their affiliates are greater than 5% beneficial owners of PCT. Refer to Note 3 - Notes Payable and Debt Instruments for further information.\nThe Pure Plastic Term Loan Facility\nOn May 8, 2023, the Company entered into a $40.0 million Term Loan Facility pursuant to the Term Loan Credit Agreement dated as of May 8, 2023, among the\nGuarantors and Pure Plastic LLC (as Lender, Administrative Agent, and Security Agent), which matures on December 31, 2025. The Term Loan Credit\nAgreement was amended on August 21, 2023. Affiliates of the Lender are greater than 5% beneficial owners of the Company. Balances related to the Term\nLoan Credit Agreement are recorded within related party note payable in the consolidated balance sheets and, in certain instances, the Term Loan Credit\nAgreement is referred to as the “Related party note payable.” Refer to Note 3 - Notes Payable and Debt Instruments for further information.\nGreen Convertible Notes\nOn August 24, 2023, the Company completed the private offering of the Notes. Entities affiliated with a greater than 5% beneficial owner of the Company\npurchased $50.0 million aggregate principal amount at maturity of the Notes. Refer to Note 3 - Notes Payable and Debt Instruments for further information.\nNOTE 8 – NET LOSS PER SHARE\nThe Company follows the two-class method when computing net loss per common share when shares are issued that meet the definition of participating\nsecurities. The two-class method requires income available to common shareholders for the period to be allocated between common and participating securities\nbased upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income for the period had been distributed. The two-class method also requires losses for the\nperiod to be allocated between common and participating securities based on their respective rights if the participating security contractually participates in\nlosses. As holders of participating securities do not have a contractual obligation to fund losses, undistributed net losses are not allocated to nonvested\nrestricted stock for purposes of the loss per share calculation.\n86\nTable of Contents\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\nPresented in the table below is a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator for the basic and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) calculations for the years\nended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands, except per share data):\nYears ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nNumerator:\nNet loss attributable to PureCycle $ (101,715) $ (84,746) $ (77,502)\nLess cumulative earnings to participating warrants — — —\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders $ (101,715) $ (84,746) $ (77,502)\nDenominator:\nWeighted average common shares outstanding, basic 163,865 155,957 102,913\nNet loss per share attributable to common stockholder, basic $ (0.62) $ (0.54) $ (0.75)\nPresented in the table below is a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator for the diluted EPS calculations for the years ended December 31, 2023,\n2022 and 2021 (in thousands):\nYears ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nNumerator:\nNet loss attributable to PureCycle $ (101,715) $ (84,746) $ (77,502)\nLess change in fair value of dilutive warrants (2,233) (1,505) (3,666)\nLess income attributable to participating warrants — — —\nNet loss attributable to common shareholders $ (103,948) $ (86,251) $ (81,168)\nDenominator:\nWeighted average common shares outstanding, basic 163,865 155,957 102,913\nAdd common equivalent shares from warrants 148 195 68\nWeighted average common shares outstanding, diluted 164,013 156,152 102,981\nNet loss per share attributable to common stockholder, diluted $ (0.63) $ (0.55) $ (0.79)\nCertain outstanding common share equivalents were excluded from the computation of diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders\nfor the periods presented as including them would have been anti-dilutive.

Legacy PCT and P&G entered\ninto an Amended and Restated Patent License Agreement on July 28, 2020 (the “Amended and Restated Patent License Agreement”). PCT and P&G entered\ninto a side letter agreement on February 12, 2021 amending certain provisions of the Amended and Restated License Agreement (the “Side Letter Agreement”\nand, together with the Original Patent License Agreement and the Amended and Restated Patent License Agreement, the “License Agreement”). The License\nAgreement outlines three phases with specific deliverables for each phase. During Phase 1 of the agreement, P&G provides Legacy PCT with up to one full-\ntime employee to assist in the execution of Legacy PCT’s research and development activities. During Phase 2, P&G provides up to two full-time employees to\nassist in the execution of Legacy PCT’s research and development activities. In April 2019, Legacy PCT elected to enter into Phase 3 of the agreement and\nprepaid a royalty payment in the amount of $2.0 million, which will be reduced against future royalties payable as sales occur. Phase 3 of the agreement relates\nto the commercial manufacture period for the manufacture of the licensed product. This phase includes the construction of the first commercial plant for\n88\nTable of Contents\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\nthe manufacture of the licensed product, details on the commercial sales capacity and the pricing of the licensed product to P&G and to third parties. Where the\nCompany has made royalty payments to its product development partners, the Company expenses such payments as incurred unless it has determined that is\nit probable that such prepaid royalties have future economic benefit to the Company. In such cases prepaid royalties will be reduced as royalties would\notherwise be due to the partners.\nEffective April 1, 2023, the Company and P&G executed a Second Side Letter, dated March 27, 2023, amending the date by which commercial sales must be\nmaintained at 70% of nameplate capacity under Section 4.4 of the License Agreement from April 15, 2023 to December 31, 2024.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company is in Phase 3 of the agreement and has recorded $ 2.0 million within prepaid expenses and other current assets in the\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nOn November 13, 2019, Legacy PCT entered into a patent sublicense agreement with Impact Recycling Limited (“Impact”) through the term of the patents. The\nagreement outlines an initial license fee of $2.5 million and royalties on production using the license. In 2020, Legacy PCT paid $ 0.9 million of the initial license\nfee, and during the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company paid the remaining $1.6 million of the initial fee. The initial license fee of $2.5 million is\nrecorded in prepaid expenses and other non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheets and will be ratably amortized over the term of the underlying\npatent using the straight-line method. In May 2021, the Company began using the technology covered by the Impact agreement and commenced amortization\nas of this date.\nBlock and Release Agreement\nOn June 23, 2020, Legacy PCT entered into a block and release agreement with Total Petrochemicals & Refining S.A./N.V. (“Total”). Upon execution of the\nagreement, Total made a prepayment consisting of a payment of $5.0 million for future receipt of resin consisting of recycled polypropylene (“recycled PP”). The\nprepayment was placed in an escrow account until the “release condition” of the Company closing the bond offering and overall capital funding of at least\n$370.0 million has occurred. After the Company successfully raised the required capital, the $5.0 million was released to the Company in 2021 and recorded as\ndeferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets.\nNOTE 11 - INCOME TAXES\nHistorically, Legacy PCT was a limited liability company which had elected to be treated as a partnership for income tax purposes. As such, the Company was\nnot directly liable for income taxes for federal purposes. As of the date of the Business Combination (March 2021), the operations of the Company ceased to be\ntaxed as a partnership resulting in a change in tax status for federal and state income tax purposes. This change in tax status requires immediate recognition of\nany deferred tax assets or liabilities as of the transaction date as the Company will now be directly liable for income taxes. The recognition of these initial\ndeferred balances, if any, would be recorded as additional tax expense in the period of the transaction. In addition, the Company will accrue current and\ndeferred tax expense based on ongoing activity from that date.\nLoss from continuing operations before income taxes, classified by source of income, were as follows (in thousands):\nYears ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nDomestic $ (100,432) $ (84,746) $ (77,502)\nForeign (633) — —\nTotal $ (101,065) $ (84,746) $ (77,502)\n89\nTable of Contents\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\nThe components of the provision (benefit) for income taxes were as follows (in thousands):\nYears ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nCurrent:\nFederal $ — $ — $ —\nState and local — — —\nForeign — — —\nTotal current provision (benefit) $ — $ — $ —\nDeferred:\nFederal 650 — —\nState and local — — —\nForeign — — —\nTotal deferred provision (benefit) $ 650 $ — $ —\nTotal provision (benefit) for income taxes $ 650 $ — $ —\nThe effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rates as follows (in thousands):\nYears ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nTax at statutory federal rate $ (21,224) 21.0 % $ (17,797) 21.0 % $ (16,275) 21.0 %\nRates different than the statutory rate — — % — — % 2,677 (3.5)%\nState income tax (3,114) 3.1 % (1,433) 1.7 % — — %\nCompensation expense 1,228 (1.2)% 805 (0.9)% 2,973 (3.8)%\nWarrant expense and other permanent items (6,920) 6.8 % 1,247 (1.5)% 241 (0.3)%\nChange in tax status — — % — — % (4,100) 5.3 %\nTax Credits (22,329) 22.1 % (3,571) 4.2 % — — %\nPrior period adjustment 1,083 (1.1)% (1,880) 2.2 % — — %\nTax rate change (474) 0.5 % (712) 0.8 % — — %\nValuation allowance 52,399 (51.8)% 24,136 (28.5)% 15,205 (19.6)%\nOther 1 — % (795) 0.9 % (721) 0.9 %\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes $ 650 (0.6)% $ — — % $ — — %\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities result primarily from temporary differences in the recognition of various expenses for tax and financial statement\npurposes, and from the recognition of the tax benefits of net operating loss carryforwards.\n90\nTable of Contents\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\nThe components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows (in thousands):\nYears ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nDeferred tax assets:\nNet operating losses and tax credit carry-forward $ 104,625 $ 32,918\nStock-based compensation 2,292 1,837\nStart-up expenses 9,950 10,301\nProperty, plant, and equipment — —\nInterest expense carryforwards — —\nDeferred revenue 1,391 1,370\nLease liabilities 4,092 4,604\nOther 946 859\nGross deferred tax asset $ 123,296 $ 51,889\nLess valuation allowance (91,739) (39,340)\nNet deferred tax asset $ 31,557 $ 12,549\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nResearch and experimental expenses — (1,662)\nProperty, plant, and equipment (27,437) (5,821)\nRight of use assets (4,056) (4,415)\nOther accruals (714) (651)\nTotal deferred tax liability $ (32,207) $ (12,549)\nNet deferred tax asset (liability) $ (650) $ —\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company has $340.4 million of gross U.S. federal net operating loss carryforward, $8.7 million post apportioned gross state net of\noperating loss carryforwards, and $26.2 million of research and development tax credit carryforwards. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $ 128.8\nmillion of gross U.S. federal net operating loss carryforward, $2.0 million post apportioned gross state net of operating loss carryforwards, and $ 3.9 million of\nresearch and development tax credit carryforwards. The attributes will be available to offset future income tax liabilities. The U.S. federal net operating losses\ncan be carried forward indefinitely, the state net operating losses in certain jurisdictions can be carried forward indefinitely while certain jurisdictions expire at\nvarious dates, and the research and development tax credit can be carried forward for up to 20 years.\nValuation allowances are established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The valuation allowance on\nour deferred tax assets was $91.7 million as of December 31, 2023 and 39.3 million as of December 31, 2022, resulting in a net change of $ 52.4 million year-\nover-year. The valuation allowance mainly relates to U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, credit carryforwards, and start-up expenses. As the\nCompany has generated nominal revenue from inception, insufficient projected taxable income and lack of other sources of taxable income gives rise to need of\na valuation allowance.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company has reported a minimal foreign loss which resulted in unbenefited accumulated losses for foreign operations. As a\nresult there is no potential deferred tax liability on the outside basis of foreign investments as of December 31, 2023. The Company did not perform any\nactivities in foreign locations prior to 2023.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company has not recorded an amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions for the current or\nprior year planned tax filing positions. No unrecognized tax benefits are applicable for prior periods.\n91\nTable of Contents\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\nThe Company files returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in various state jurisdictions based on existing tax laws. The Company remains generally subject\nto examination in the U.S. for year beginning on or after January 1, 2019, however, for any tax years prior to March 2021, such audits are not expected to\nimpact the Company while the Company operated as a flow-through entity. The Company is not currently under audit in any jurisdiction.\nThe Company actively monitors domestic and global tax law changes to account for the effects in the period the legislation is enacted, as applicable.\nNOTE 12 – FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the\nmeasurement date and sets out a fair value hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or\nliabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). Inputs are broadly defined as assumptions market participants would use in pricing\nan asset or liability. Assets and liabilities carried at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:\nLevel 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.\nLevel 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, and fair value is determined\nthrough the use of models or other valuation methodologies\nLevel 3 - Inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. The inputs\ninto the determination of fair value are based upon the best information in the circumstances and may require significant management judgment or estimation.\n92\nTable of Contents\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\nLiabilities measured and recorded at Fair Value on a recurring basis\nAs of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company’s financial assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis were\nclassified within the fair value hierarchy as follow (in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets\nCash equivalents $ 36,277 $ 35,215 $ — $ 71,492 $ 4,271 $ 46,979 $ — $ 51,250\nRestricted cash equivalents -\ncurrent $ 25,692 $ — $ — $ 25,692 $ 68,850 $ — $ — $ 68,850\nRestricted cash equivalents -\nnoncurrent $ 203,411 $ — $ — $ 203,411 $ 94,781 $ — $ — $ 94,781\nInvestments:\nCommercial paper, available for sale $ — $ 46,049 $ — $ 46,049 $ — $ 32,756 $ — $ 32,756\nCorporate Bonds, available for sale $ — $ — $ — $ — — 58,442 — 58,442\nUS Treasury Notes, available for sale 2,177 — — 2,177 — — — —\nMunicipal bonds, available for sale — — — — — 7,394 — 7,394\nTotal investments $ 2,177 $ 46,049 $ — $ 48,226 $ — $ 98,592 $ — $ 98,592\nLiabilities\nWarrant liability:\nRTI warrants $ — $ — $ 1,437 $ 1,437 $ — $ — $ 3,670 $ 3,670\nPrivate warrants — — 265 265 — — 784 784\nSeries A Warrants — $ 20,357 — $ 20,357 — 51,429 — 51,429\nTotal warrant liability $ — $ 20,357 $ 1,702 $ 22,059 $ — $ 51,429 $ 4,454 $ 55,883\nThe Company determined that cash equivalents of $46.9 million, related to December 31, 2022, should be reclassified from Level 1 to Level 2 classification, as\nthese were commercial paper assets with maturity dates less than 90 days.\nMeasurement of the Private Warrants\nThe private warrants are measured at fair value on a recurring basis using a Black-Scholes model. The private warrants are classified as Level 3 for both initial\nmeasurement upon close of the Business Combination and subsequent measurement using the following assumptions:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nExpected annual dividend yield — % — %\nExpected volatility 100.2 % 105.1 %\nRisk-free rate of return 4.1 % 4.2 %\nExpected option term (years) 2.2 3.2\nThe expected term of the warrants granted are determined based on the duration of time the warrants are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate is\nbased on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of\n93\nTable of Contents\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\ngrant. The expected volatility was based on the implied volatility calculated for the Company’s public warrants, which have similar characteristics to the private\nwarrants. The dividend yield on the Company’s warrants is assumed to be zero as the Company has not historically paid dividends. The fair value of the\nunderlying Company shares was determined using the Black-Scholes calculation.\nThe aggregate values of the private warrants were $0.3 million and $0.8 million on December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\nA summary of the private warrants activity from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023 is as follows (in thousands):\nFair value\n(Level 3)\nBalance at December 31, 2022 $ 784\nChange in fair value (519)\nBalance at December 31, 2023 $ 265\nRefer to Note 6 – Warrants for further information.\nMeasurement of the RTI warrants\nSignificant changes in any of the significant unobservable inputs in isolation would not result in a materially different fair value estimate. The interrelationship\nbetween these inputs is insignificant.\nThe Company has determined its warrant to be a Level 3 fair value measurement and has remeasured using the Black-Scholes option pricing model to\ncalculate its fair value as of December 31, 2023 using the following assumptions:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nExpected annual dividend yield — % — %\nExpected volatility 118.1 % 99.7 %\nRisk-free rate of return 4.7 % 4.4 %\nExpected option term (years) 1.0 2.0\nThe expected term of the warrants granted are determined based on the duration of time the warrants are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate is\nbased on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. For December 31, 2023, the expected volatility was calculated based on the specific\nvolatility of PCT’s publicly-traded common stock. For December 31, 2022, the expected volatility was based on the Company’s capital structure and volatility of\nsimilar entities referred to as guideline companies. In determining similar entities, the Company considered industry, stage of life cycle, size and financial\nleverage. The dividend yield on the Company’s warrants is assumed to be zero as the Company has not historically paid dividends. The fair value of the\nunderlying Company shares was determined using the Binomial Tree model calculation.\nThe Company has an option to repurchase the Warrants at any time. The maximum fair value of the Warrants is limited by the fair value of the repurchase\noption, which cannot exceed $15.0 million.\nChanges in Level 3 liabilities measured at fair value from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2022 are as follows (in thousands):\nFair value\n(Level 3)\nBalance at December 31, 2022 $ 3,670\nChange in fair value $ (2,233)\nBalance at December 31, 2023 $ 1,437\n94\nTable of Contents\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\nMeasurement of the Series A Warrants\nThe Series A Warrants meet the definition of derivative instruments and are measured at fair value on a recurring basis using the market price of the Company’s\npublicly traded warrants, with changes in fair value recorded in current earnings. The Company has determined the publicly traded warrants to be an\nappropriate proxy to value the Series A Warrants as both warrants have similar redemption features and the same exercise price. The Series A Warrants are\nclassified as Level 2 for both initial measurement at issuance and subsequent measurement each period. The Series A Warrants were initially valued at\n$43.9 million upon closing of the 2022 PIPE Offering.\nAssets and liabilities recorded at carrying value\nIn determining the appropriate levels, the Company performs a detailed analysis of the assets and liabilities that are subject to fair value measurements.\nThe Company records cash and cash equivalents and accounts payable at cost, which approximates fair value due to their short-term nature or stated rates.\nThe Company records debt at cost.\nNOTE 13 - AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS\nThe Company classifies its investments in debt securities as available-for-sale. Debt securities are comprised of highly liquid investments with minimum “A”\nrated securities and, as of December 31, 2023, consist of corporate entity commercial paper and securities and municipal bonds. The debt securities are\nreported at fair value with unrealized gains or losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note\n12, \"Fair Value of Financial Instruments,\" for information related to the fair value measurements and valuation methods utilized.\nThe following table represents the Company’s available-for-sale investments by major security type as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 (in\nthousands):\nDecember 31, 2023\nGross Unrealized\nAmortized Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Losses Total Fair Value\nCommercial Paper $ 46,069 $ — $ (20) $ 46,049\nUS Treasury Notes 2,175 2 — 2,177\nCorporate Bonds — — — —\nMunicipal Bonds — — — —\nTotal $ 48,244 $ 2 $ (20) $ 48,226\nDecember 31, 2022\nGross Unrealized\nAmortized Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Losses Total Fair Value\nCommercial Paper $ 32,997 $ — $ (241) $ 32,756\nCorporate Bonds 58,791 — (349) 58,442\nMunicipal Bonds 7,446 — (52) 7,394\nTotal $ 99,234 $ — $ (642) $ 98,592\n95\nTable of Contents\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\nThe following table summarizes the fair value and amortized cost bases of the Company’s available-for-sale investments by contractual maturity of\nDecember 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 (in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nAmortized Cost Fair Value Amortized Cost Fair Value\nDue within one year $ 48,244 $ 48,226 $ 92,253 $ 91,669\nDue after one year through 5 years — — 6,981 6,923\nTotal $ 48,244 $ 48,226 $ 99,234 $ 98,592\nDebt securities as of December 31, 2023 had an average remaining maturity of 0.07 years.\nThe Company reviews available-for-sale investments for other-than-temporary impairment loss periodically. The Company considers factors such as the\nduration, severity and the reason for the decline in value, the potential recovery period and our intent to sell. For debt securities, we also consider whether (i) it\nis more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the debt securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis and (ii) the amortized cost basis\ncannot be recovered as a result of credit losses. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company did not recognize any other-than-\ntemporary impairment losses. All marketable securities with unrealized losses have been in a loss position for less than twelve months, and the Company does\nnot anticipate any material losses upon maturity of these investments. The fair value for fixed-rate debt securities is based on quoted market prices for the same\nor similar debt instruments and is classified as Level 2. The fair value for the Company's other securities holdings, primarily under commercial paper, equals the\ncarrying value and is classified as Level 2.\nNOTE 14 – CONTINGENCIES\nFinancial Assurance\nOn March 14, 2023, PCT secured a surety bond in the amount of $25.0 million to provide financial assurance related to its performance under a certain vendor\ncontract, which expires at the earlier of satisfaction of the obligation, termination of the related vendor contract, or one year from issuance (subject to renewal\nwithin one year). PCT may issue additional surety bonds in the future to provide financial assurance regarding performance under contracts with other parties.\nThese financial instruments are issued in the normal course of business and are not considered company indebtedness. Because PCT currently has no liability\nfor these financial assurance instruments, they are not reflected in its consolidated balance sheets.\nLegal Proceedings\nPCT is subject to legal and regulatory actions that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. The assessment as to whether a loss is probable or\nreasonably possible, and as to whether such loss or a range of such losses is estimable, often involves significant judgment about future events, and the\noutcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. Other than as described below, there is no material pending or threatened litigation against PCT that remains\noutstanding as of December 31, 2023.\nShareholder Securities Litigation\nBeginning on or about May 11, 2021, two putative class action complaints were filed against PCT, certain senior members of management and others, asserting\nviolations of federal securities laws under Section 10(b) and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The complaints generally allege that the applicable defendants\nmade false and/or misleading statements in press releases and public filings regarding the Technology, PCT’s business and PCT’s prospects. The first putative\nclass action complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida by William C. Theodore against PCT and certain senior members of\nmanagement (the “Theodore Lawsuit”). The second putative class action complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida by David\nTennenbaum against PCT, certain senior members of management and others (the “Tennenbaum Lawsuit”). On July 14, 2021, the court granted a motion to\nconsolidate the Theodore\n96\nTable of Contents\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\nand Tennenbaum Lawsuits (consolidated as the “Theodore Lawsuit”) and on July 27, 2021, Tennenbaum filed a motion to voluntarily dismiss his complaint\nwithout prejudice. On August 5, 2021, the Court entered an order appointing Mariusz Ciecko and Robert Ciecko as Co-Lead Plaintiffs (“Lead Plaintiffs”) and\nPomerantz LLP as Lead Counsel.\nOn September 27, 2021, the Lead Plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint. The consolidated amended complaint seeks to represent a class of\ninvestors who purchased or otherwise acquired PCT’s securities between November 16, 2020, and May 5, 2021, certification of the alleged class, as well as\ncompensatory and punitive damages. The consolidated amended complaint relies on information included in a research report published by Hindenburg\nResearch LLC.\nOn November 12, 2021, PCT and the individual defendants affiliated with PCT (“PCT Defendants”) and Byron Roth each filed separate motions to dismiss Lead\nPlaintiffs’ amended complaint. Additional submissions by the parties were filed in December 2021 and January 2022.\nOn August 4, 2022, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida dismissed the Theodore Lawsuit, without prejudice. Plaintiffs filed their second\namended complaint on August 18, 2022 in which they seek to represent a class of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired PCT’s securities between\nNovember 16, 2020, and November 10, 2021, and alleged violations of Section 10(b) and Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act. On September 15, 2022, the PCT\nDefendants and Byron Roth each filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint, and the parties filed additional responsive pleadings in October\n2022. On June 15, 2023, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida granted the PCT Defendants’ motion solely with regard to named defendant\nTamsin Ettefagh, but denied the motion as to all other defendants. On June 30, 2023, the PCT Defendants filed a Motion for Reconsideration. Further, on July\n14, 2023, each of the PCT and Roth Defendants filed their respective Answers and Counterclaims. The Motion for Reconsideration remains pending.\nOn November 30, 2023 Lead Plaintiffs filed their motion to certify two classes: a Section 14(a) class and a Section 10(b) class. On January 17, 2024, Lease\nPlaintiffs amended their motion for class certification to seek certification of only the Section 10(b) class. On January 23, 2024, PCT, the Individual Defendants\nand Bryon Roth submitted a join opposition to Lead Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. Plaintiffs’ reply in support of their motion for class certification is due\non February 21, 2024. The parties are engaged in discovery, which is currently scheduled to close in July 2024.\nOn September 29, 2023, Jay Southgate, a purported shareholder, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against PCT,\nand certain senior members of management (“Individual Southgate Defendants”), asserting violations of federal securities laws under Section 10(b) and Section\n20(a) of the Exchange Act. The complaints generally allege that the applicable defendants made false and/or misleading statements in press releases and\npublic filings between August 8, 2023 and September 13, 2023, regarding the status of commissioning activities at the Ironton Facility, and specifically the\nimpact of a power outage at the Ironton Facility in August 2023 and subsequent seal system failure in September 2023. Purported shareholders have filed\nmotions to be appointed lead plaintiff in the action, which remain pending. At this stage of the litigation, neither PCT nor the Individual Southgate Defendants\nhave answered the complaint, moved to dismiss the complaint, or otherwise responded to the complaint.\nPCT, the PCT Defendants and the individual Southgate Defendants intend to vigorously defend against the Theodore Lawsuit and the Southgate Lawsuits.\nGiven the stage of the litigation, PCT cannot reasonably estimate at this time whether there will be any loss, or if there is a loss, the possible range of loss, that\nmay arise from the unresolved Theodore and Southgate Lawsuits.\nDerivative Litigation\nOn November 3, 2021, Byung-Gook Han, a purported PCT shareholder, derivatively and purportedly on behalf of PCT, filed a shareholder derivative action in\nthe United States District Court for the District of Delaware (Byung-Gook Han v. Otworth et. al., Case No. 1:21-cv-01569-UNA) against certain senior members\nof PCT’s management, PCT’s directors and Byron Roth, who was subsequently dismissed (collectively, the “Individual Han Defendants”), alleging violations of\nSection 20(a) of the Exchange Act and breaches of fiduciary duties and\n97\nTable of Contents\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\nbringing claims for unjust enrichment and waste of corporate assets (“Han Derivative Suit\"). The Han Derivative Suit generally alleges that the Individual Han\nDefendants made materially false and misleading statements in press releases, webinars and other public filings regarding the Technology, PCT’s business,\nPCT’s prospects, and the background and experience of the Individual Han Defendants. The Han Derivative Suit seeks unspecified monetary damages, reform\nof the company's corporate governance and internal procedures, unspecified restitution from the Individual Han Defendants, and costs and fees associated with\nbringing the action. On January 19, 2022, the court in the Han Derivative Suit granted the parties’ joint stipulation to stay the Han Derivative Suit and\nadministratively closed the matter pending the disposition of the motions to dismiss in the Class Action Lawsuits.\nOn January 27, 2022, Patrick Ayers, a purported PCT shareholder, derivatively and purportedly on behalf of PCT, filed a shareholder derivative action in the\nUnited States District Court of the District of Delaware, captioned Patrick Ayers v. Otworth et. al., Case No. 1:22-cv-00110, against certain members of PCT’s\nmanagement, PCT’s directors and others (collectively, the “Individual Ayers Defendants”), alleging violations of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act and breaches\nof fiduciary duties, as well as claims for unjust enrichment, gross mismanagement, contribution, and indemnification (“Ayers Derivative Suit\"). The Ayers\nDerivative Suit generally alleges that the Individual Ayers Defendants made materially false and misleading statements in press releases, webinars and other\npublic filings regarding the Technology, PCT’s business, PCT’s prospects, and the background and experience of the Individual Ayers Defendants. The Ayers\nDerivative Suit seeks unspecified monetary damages, declaratory relief, unspecified disgorgement and restitution from the Individual Ayers Defendants, and\ncosts and fees associated with bringing the action.\nAt this stage of the litigation, neither PCT nor the Individual Ayers Defendants have answered Ayers’ complaint, moved to dismiss the complaint, or otherwise\nresponded to the complaint. On March 17, 2022, the court granted the parties’ joint stipulation to stay the Ayers Derivative Suit and administratively closed the\nmatter pending the disposition of the motions to dismiss in the Class Action Lawsuits. Should the Ayers Derivative Suit be reopened in the future, the Individual\nAyers Defendants intend to vigorously defend against the Ayers Derivative Suit. Given the stage of the litigation, PCT cannot reasonably estimate at this time\nwhether there will be any loss, or if there is a loss, the possible range of loss, that may arise from the unresolved Ayers Derivative Suit.\nAfter the court in the Theodore Lawsuit ruled on the second motion to dismiss, the stay in the derivative actions was lifted. Ayers and Han (collectively the\n“Derivative Plaintiffs”), PCT and the Individual Ayers and Han Defendants (collectively, the “Individual Derivative Defendants”) filed a joint stipulation to\nconsolidate the related derivative actions on June 26, 2023. The court granted the motion to consolidate the derivative actions on June 27, 2023 and ordered\nthe Consolidated Derivative Action to be captioned In re: PureCycle Technologies, Inc. Derivative Litigation, Lead Case No. 21-1569-RGA (D. Del.)\n(“Consolidated Derivative Litigation”). In light of the Motion for Reconsideration in the Theodore Lawsuit, the Derivative Plaintiffs, PCT, and Individual Derivative\nDefendants filed a joint stipulation to continue the stay of the Consolidated Derivative Litigation until thirty days after the court in the Class Action rules on the\nMotion for Reconsideration. Because the Motion for Reconsideration in the Theodore Lawsuit remains pending, the stay of the Consolidated Derivative\nLitigation remains in effect.\nShould the Consolidated Derivative Litigation be reopened in the future, the Individual Derivative Defendants intend to vigorously defend against the\nConsolidated Derivative Litigation. Given the stage of the litigation, PCT cannot reasonably estimate at this time whether there will be any loss, or if there is a\nloss, the possible range of loss, that may arise from the unresolved Consolidated Derivative Litigation.\nIn the future, PCT may become party to additional legal matters and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. While PCT is unable to predict the\noutcome of the above or future matters, it does not believe, based upon currently available facts, that the ultimate resolution of any such pending matters will\nhave a material adverse effect on its overall financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\n98\nTable of Contents\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\nDenham-Blythe Arbitration\nOn October 7, 2020, PCO, a subsidiary of PCT and Denham-Blythe Company, Inc. (“DB”) executed an Engineering, Procurement, and Construction Agreement\nfor certain construction activities associated with the Ironton Facility (“EPC Contract”).\nOn June 16, 2023, following unsuccessful efforts at mediating various disputes over certain unapproved change orders and payment applications, DB filed a\ndemand for binding arbitration (“Arbitration Demand”) with the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), seeking approximately $17.0 million related to certain\nfee applications, change orders and amounts currently held in retainage by PCO, and, on June 21, 2023, filed a mechanics lien in Lawrence County, Ohio for\nthe same sum. On July 20, 2023, PCO filed its Answer and Counterclaim, in which PCO contends that various deficiencies in DB’s work resulted in damages to\nPCO in excess of DB’s $17.0 million Arbitration Demand, including, but not limited to, the following: DB’s insufficient and incomplete engineering drawings and\npackages, insufficient and unorganized material management, insufficient and inefficient contractor management, insufficient and rudimentary schedule\nmanagement, incomplete and inefficient procurement procedures, and that the Company was required to undertake significant re-work at additional cost\nresulting from DB’s failure to adequately perform its obligations under the EPC Contract. On September 14, 2023, DB filed a motion with the AAA seeking to\njoin ThermalTech Engineering, Inc., and ThermalTech Turnkey Solutions LLC, a subcontractor engaged by DB to provide engineering services for the Ironton\nProject. In an order dated December 7, 2023, the AAA granted DB’s request to join ThermalTech Engineering, Inc., and ThermalTech Turnkey Solutions LLC.\nOn August 30, 2023, DB filed a breach of contract claim against PCO and others in Lawrence County Ohio, alleging the same facts contained in its arbitration\ndemand, as well as an action to foreclose on a lien filed in Lawrence County, Ohio. Concurrently DB requested the complaint be stayed pending the resolution\nof all issues in the arbitration.\nPCO intends to vigorously defend itself against DB’s claims and to pursue recovery of damages resulting from DB’s failure to perform adequately under the EPC\nContract. Given the stage of the arbitration, PCT cannot reasonably estimate at this time whether there will be any loss, or if there is a loss, the possible range\nof loss, that may result from the Arbitration Demand.\nOther Matters\nOn February 3, 2023, the Company received a books and records demand pursuant to Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, from a purported\nstockholder of the Company, in connection with the stockholder’s investigation of, among other matters, potential breaches of fiduciary duty, mismanagement,\nself-dealing, corporate waste or other violations of law by the Company’s Board with respect to these matters. We are currently unable to predict the outcome of\nthis matter.\nOn October 6, 2023 and October 27, 2023, the Company received two additional books and records demands pursuant to Section 220 of the Delaware General\nCorporation Law, from two purported stockholders of the Company, in connection with the stockholders’ investigation of, among other matters, potential\nbreaches of fiduciary duty, mismanagement, self-dealing, corporate waste or other violations of law by the Company’s Board with respect to these matters. We\nare currently unable to predict the outcome of this matter.\nNOTE 15 - Leases\nUnder ASC Topic 842, a lease is a contract, or part of a contract, that conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant or equipment (i.e., an\nidentified asset) for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Company’s contracts determined to be, or contain, a lease include explicitly or implicitly\nidentified assets where the Company has the right to substantially all of the economic benefits of the assets and has the ability to direct how and for what\npurpose the assets are used during the lease term. Leases are classified as either operating or financing. For operating leases, the Company has recognized a\nlease liability equal to the present value of the remaining lease payments, and a right of use asset equal to the lease liability, subject to certain adjustments,\nsuch as for prepaid rents. The Company used its incremental borrowing rate to\n99\nTable of Contents\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\ndetermine the present value of the lease payments. The Company’s incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest that it would have to borrow on a\ncollateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. The Company determined the incremental\nborrowing rates for its leases by applying its applicable borrowing rate, with adjustment as appropriate for lease currency and lease term.\nThe Company enters into contracts to lease real estate, equipment and vehicles. The Company’s most individually significant lease liability relates to a real\nestate lease with an initial contract lease term of 30 years. The Company’s most significant lease liabilities in aggregate value relate to real estate leases that\nhave initial contract lease terms ranging from 1 to 30 years. Under ASC Topic 842, the lease term at the lease commencement date is determined based on the\nnon-cancellable period for which the Company has the right to use the underlying asset, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if\nthe Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option, periods covered by an option to terminate the lease if the Company is reasonably certain not to\nexercise that option, and periods covered by an option to extend (or not to terminate) the lease in which the exercise of the option is controlled by the lessor.\nThe Company considered a number of factors when evaluating whether the options in its lease contracts were reasonably certain of exercise, such as length of\ntime before option exercise, expected value of the leased asset at the end of the initial lease term, importance of the lease to overall operations, costs to\nnegotiate a new lease, and any contractual or economic penalties.\nOperating leases result in a straight-line lease expense, while finance leases result in a front-loaded expense pattern. The assets associated with financing\nleases have been included in property, plant and equipment in the consolidated balance sheet. Depreciation on financing lease assets is included in operating\ncosts on the consolidated statement of comprehensive loss. The Company does not sublease any of its material leased assets to third parties and the\nCompany is not party to any lease contracts with related parties. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any residual value guarantees or restrictive\ncovenants.\nThe Company has made an accounting policy election not to recognize right of use assets and lease liabilities for leases with a lease term of 12 months or less,\nincluding renewal options that are reasonably certain to be exercised, that also do not include an option to purchase the underlying asset that is reasonably\ncertain of exercise. Instead, lease payments for these leases are recognized as lease cost on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nASC Topic 842 includes a number of reassessment and re-measurement requirements for lessees based on certain triggering events or conditions, including\nwhether a contract is or contains a lease, assessment of lease term and purchase options, measurement of lease payments, assessment of lease classification\nand assessment of the discount rate. The Company reviewed the reassessment and re-measurement requirements and did not identify any events or conditions\nduring the year ended December 31, 2023 that required a reassessment or re-measurement. For the year ended December 31, 2023, PCT included the\nCompany’s right-of-use assets and other long-lived assets in its overall impairment analysis. Refer to Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for\nfurther information regarding the Company’s assessment of impairment indicators related to its property, plant and equipment.\nCertain of the Company’s leases include variable lease costs to reimburse the lessor for real estate tax and insurance expenses, and certain non-lease\ncomponents that transfer a distinct service to the Company, such as common area maintenance services. The Company has elected not to separate the\naccounting for lease components and non-lease components, for all classes of leased assets.\nOn August 24, 2022, the Company signed a real estate lease for a future feedstock preprocessing facility in Denver, Pennsylvania with an initial term of 15\nyears and total minimum lease payments of $52.3 million. The lease is expected to commence mid to late 2024.\nIn January 2023, the Company signed a real estate lease at the Port of Antwerp-Bruges’ NextGen District, where it plans to build its first purification facility in\nEurope, with an initial term of 30 years and total minimum lease payments of €27.7 million, subject to annual inflation adjustments. This lease commenced at the\nend of June 2023.\n100\nTable of Contents\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\nThe components of lease expense and supplemental cash flow information related to leases for the period are as follows (in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nLease Cost\nOperating lease cost $ 4,171 $ 2,227\nShort-term lease cost 1,175 360\nTotal lease cost $ 5,346 $ 2,587\nOther Information\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities\nOperating cash flows from operating leases $ 3,772 $ 2,895\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities $ 13,578 $ 8,427\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (in years) - operating leases 15.4 7.7\nDiscount Rates\nWeighted-average discount rate - operating leases 6.1 % 4.7 %\n101\nTable of Contents\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\nThe supplemental balance sheet information related to leases for the period is as follows (in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nOperating Leases\nOperating lease right-of-use assets $ 29,799 $ 19,136\nAccrued expenses $ 2,535 $ 2,188\nOperating lease right-of-use liabilities 27,253 16,620\nTotal operating lease liabilities $ 29,788 $ 18,808\nMaturities of the Company’s lease liabilities are as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ending Operating Leases\n2024 $ 4,187\n2025 4,596\n2026 4,502\n2027 4,098\n2028 2,857\nThereafter 30,381\nTotal future minimum lease payments $ 50,621\nLess: Imputed interest (20,833)\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 29,788\nAEDA Sale-leaseback Transaction\nOn June 30, 2023, PCT entered into a series of agreements with The Development Authority of Augusta, Georgia (the “AEDA”) to construct phase one (“Phase\nOne”) of its first U.S. multi-line facility in Augusta, Georgia. PCT is leasing 150 acres of land (“Real Property”) owned by the AEDA and will construct buildings,\nbuilding equipment, and other structures (the “Improvements”) on the land. PCT will also acquire and install the necessary processing, warehousing, and other\nequipment, as well as conveyors and pipelines (the Equipment”, together with the Real Property and the Improvements, the “Augusta Project”). The\nImprovements and Equipment will be transferred to the AEDA and leased back by PCT. PCT anticipates that the first portion of Phase One will consist of one\npurification line and commenced in December 2023. PCT is obligated to spend at least $440 million toward the construction of Phase One. Construction of the\nfirst purification line must be completed by December 31, 2026, but PCT expects that it will be completed sooner. Through December 31, 2023, PCT has\ninvested approximately $84.9 million for pre-construction engineering and long-lead equipment for the benefit of Phase One investments.\nThe legal sale-leaseback structure provides local property tax incentives to PCT as lessee of the Augusta Project. PCT will remain the owner of the\nImprovements and Equipment for accounting purposes during the term of the lease as PCT will have the right to acquire title to the Augusta Project for a\nnominal amount during the term and at the conclusion of the arrangement, which has an initial expiration date in 2044. The payments PCT makes to the AEDA\nduring the term of the arrangement are not otherwise expected to be material.\nNOTE 16 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nIn connection with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the period ended December 31, 2023, management has evaluated events\nthrough March 6, 2024 to determine whether any events required recognition or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements. The following subsequent\nevents were identified through the date of these consolidated financial statements:\n102\nTable of Contents\nPureCycle Technologies, Inc.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\nOn March 14, 2023, PCT secured a surety bond in the amount of $25.0 million to provide financial assurance related to its performance under a certain vendor\ncontract, which expires at the earlier of satisfaction of the obligation, termination of the related vendor contract, or one year from issuance (subject to renewal\nwithin one year). On February 14, 2024, PCT renewed the surety bond in the amount of $25.0 million and it will expire at the earlier of satisfaction of the\nobligation, termination of the related vendor contract, or one year from the renewal date, which is March 14, 2024.\nOn March 5, 2024, a subsidiary of the Company repurchased 99% of the outstanding Revenue Bonds with $74.5 million of unrestricted cash and $184.6 million\nof restricted cash. See Note 3 - Notes Payable and Debt Instruments for further details.\nOn March 1, 2024 PCT amended the Revolving Credit Facility to increase the Facility to $ 200.0 million, extend the maturity to September 30, 2025, and to\nobtain a carve out to permit the Company to purchase the Revenue Bonds.\nOn March 1, 2024, PCT amended the Term Loan Credit Agreement to (i) increase the amount available to the Company under the permitted indebtedness\ncovenant basket for the Revolving Credit Facility from $150,000,000 to $200,000,000 and (ii) obtain a carve out to permit the Company to purchase the\nRevenue Bonds.\n103\nTable of Contents\nITEM 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nITEM 9A. Controls and Procedure\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nPCT’s management, with the participation of its principal executive and financial officers, has evaluated the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and\nprocedures in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act, as amended, is recorded,\nprocessed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, including ensuring that such information is accumulated\nand communicated to management (including the principal executive and financial officers) as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required\ndisclosure. Based on such evaluation, PCT’s principal executive and financial officers have concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures were\neffective as of December 31, 2023 (the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K), our principle executive and financial officers have\nconcluded that the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, present fairly, in all material respects, our financial\nposition, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with GAAP.\nRemediation of Previously Reported Material Weaknesses\nAs previously reported in PCT’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, management identified certain material\nweaknesses in PCT’s internal control over financial reporting, described as follows:\n• PCT’s lack of formal processes and controls resulted in an ineffective control environment, which led to an inadequate review of the financial\nstatements and financial reporting; and\n• PCT did not design and maintain effective controls over certain information technology (“IT”) controls for certain information systems that are\nrelevant to the preparation of its financial statements, specifically with respect to user access, to ensure appropriate segregation of duties that adequately\nrestrict user access to financial applications, programs, and data to appropriate company personnel.\nPrior to becoming a public company in March 2021, management began taking steps to identify and implement changes to PCT’s internal controls over financial\nreporting to remediate the control deficiencies described above that led to the material weaknesses, with continued improvements being introduced throughout\n2022 and 2023. These measures include:\n• Designing and implementing formal controls over certain IT processes (including improved internal and external resources) to aid us in limiting\nuser access, as well as improving monitoring and review of change management over IT systems that are relevant to the financial activities of PCT.\n• Designed and implementing formal controls for preparation and review of financial statements and disclosures, including more rigorous review\nand evaluation of disclosure requirements that may be applicable to PCT’s reporting.\nThese actions resulted in an improved internal control environment that was in place for a sufficient period of time to allow for PCT’s management to conclude,\nbased on evidence obtained in validating the design and implementation of these controls, that these material weaknesses have been fully remediated as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting and Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm\nManagement of the Company, including the principal executive and financial officers, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control\nover financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act, which requires that internal controls are designed to provide\nreasonable assurance as to the reliability of the Company’s financial reporting and the preparation of the consolidated\n104\nTable of Contents\nfinancial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and includes those policies and\nprocedures that:\n• pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the\nCompany;\n• provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the issuer are being made only in accordance with authorizations of\nmanagement and directors of the Company; and\n• provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets\nthat could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with\nthe policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement of the Company assessed the effectiveness of PCT’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the Internal\nControl - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on this\nevaluation, management of the Company has concluded that PCT’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023. The\neffectiveness of PCT's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 has been audited by Grant Thornton LLP, an independent registered\npublic accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included herein.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in PCT’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are\nreasonably likely to materially affect, PCT’s internal control over financial reporting.\nITEM 9B.

(the “Company”, “PCT”, “we”, “our” and “us”) is intended as a\nsummary only and is qualified in its entirety by reference to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (as amended, the\n“Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation”) and Second Amended and Restated Bylaws (“Second Amended and Restated Bylaws”),\nwhich are filed as Exhibits 3.1 through 3.4 to our Annual Report on Form 10-K of which this Exhibit 4.1 is a part. We encourage you to read\nthese documents and the applicable portion of the Delaware General Corporation Law, as amended (the “DGCL”), and our Amended and\nRestated Certificate of Incorporation and our Second Amended and Restated Bylaws carefully and in their entirety because they describe your\nrights as a holder of shares of our Common Stock.\nCommon Stock\nOur authorized capital stock consists of 450,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Common Stock”), and\n25,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share.\nHolders of the Company’s Common Stock are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of\nstockholders. The holders of the Company’s Common Stock do not have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors. Upon the\nCompany’s liquidation, dissolution or winding up and after payment in full of all amounts required to be paid to creditors and to the holders of\npreferred stock having liquidation preferences, if any, the holders of the Company’s Common Stock will be entitled to receive pro rata the\nCompany’s remaining assets available for distribution. Holders of the Company’s Common Stock do not have preemptive, subscription,\nredemption or conversion rights. The Company’s Common Stock will not be subject to further calls or assessment by the Company. There will\nbe no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the Company’s Common Stock. All shares of the Company’s Common Stock that\nare outstanding are fully paid and non-assessable. The rights, powers, preferences and privileges of holders of the Company’s Common Stock\nwill be subject to those of the holders of any shares of the Company’s preferred stock the Company may authorize and issue in the future.\nWhen a quorum is present at any meeting, any matter other than the election of directors to be voted upon by the stockholders at such\nmeeting will be decided by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of shares of stock present or represented at the meeting and entitled\nto vote (meaning that of the shares present or represented at the meeting and entitled to vote, a majority of them must be voted “for” the\nproposal for it to be approved).\nAt all meetings of stockholders for the election of directors at which a quorum is present, directors shall be elected by the affirmative\nvote of the majority of the votes cast (meaning the number of shares voted “for” a nominee must exceed the number of shares voted “against”\nsuch nominee). If any nominee for director in an uncontested election receives a greater number of votes “against” his or her election than\nvotes “for” such election, such person must promptly tender his or her resignation to the Board of Directors following certification of the vote.\nIf the number of nominees for election at any such meeting exceeds the number of directors to be elected at such meeting, however, directors\nshall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast (meaning that the number of director nominees who receive the highest number of shares voted\n“for” their election are elected).\nPreferred Stock\nThe Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the Company’s board of directors to establish one or more series of\npreferred stock. Unless required by law or by the Nasdaq Capital Market (“NASDAQ”), the authorized shares of preferred stock will be\navailable for issuance without further action by you. The Company’s board of directors is authorized to fix from time to time before issuance\nthe number of preferred shares to be included in any such series and the designation, powers, preferences and relative participating, optional or\nother rights, if any, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof. The authority of the Company’s board of directors with respect to\neach such series will include, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the determination of any or all of the following:\n• the number of shares of any series and the designation to distinguish the shares of such series from the shares of all other series;\n• the voting powers, if any, and whether such voting powers are full or limited in such series;\n• the redemption provisions, if any, applicable to such series, including the redemption price or prices to be paid;\n• whether dividends, if any, will be cumulative or noncumulative, the dividend rate of such series, and the dates and preferences of\ndividends on such series;\n• the rights of such series upon the voluntary or involuntary dissolution of, or upon any distribution of the assets of, the Company;\n• the provisions, if any, pursuant to which the shares of such series are convertible into, or exchangeable for, shares of any other class or\nclasses or of any other series of the same or any other class or classes of stock, or any other security, of the Company or any other\ncorporation or other entity, and the rates or other determinants of conversion or exchange applicable thereto;\n• the right, if any, to subscribe for or to purchase any securities of the Company or any other corporation or other entity;\n• the provisions, if any, of a sinking fund applicable to such series; and\n• any other relative, participating, optional, or other special powers, preferences or rights and qualifications, limitations, or restrictions\nthereof;\n• all as may be determined from time to time by the Company’s board of directors and stated or expressed in the resolution or resolutions\nproviding for the issuance of such preferred stock (collectively, a “Preferred Stock Designation”).\nThe Company could issue a series of preferred stock that could, depending on the terms of the series, impede or discourage an acquisition\nattempt or other transaction that some, or a majority, of the holders of the Company’s Common Stock might believe to be in their best interests\nor in which the holders of the Company’s Common Stock might receive a premium for their Company Common Stock over its market price.\nAdditionally, the issuance of preferred stock may adversely affect the rights of holders of the Company’s Common Stock by restricting\ndividends on the Company’s Common Stock, diluting the voting power of the Company’s Common Stock or subordinating the liquidation\nrights of the Company’s Common Stock. As a result of these or other factors, the issuance of preferred stock could have an adverse impact on\nthe market price of the Company’s Common Stock. The Company has no current plans to issue any series of preferred stock.\nWarrants\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had 5,877,313 warrants issued and outstanding (the “Warrants”). Pursuant to the Warrant Agreement (as\ndefined below), a warrantholder may exercise its Warrants only for a whole number of shares of Common Stock. This means that only a whole\nWarrant may be exercised at any given time by a warrantholder. No fractional Warrants\nwere issued upon separation of the Units (as defined below) and only whole Warrants trade on NASDAQ. Each Warrant became exercisable\non May 4, 2021 and will expire five years after the completion of the Business Combination (as defined in the Merger Agreement), or earlier\nupon redemption. The shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants have been registered under the Company’s\nregistration statement on Form S-1, as amended (File No. 333-251034), which was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange\nCommission on July 1, 2021 (the “Form S-1), and, on April 1, 2022, a Company registration statement on Form S-3 (File Nos. 333-251034 and\n333-257423) was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission and serves as a post-effective amendment to the Form S-1\npursuant to Rule 429 under the Securities Act.\nThe outstanding Warrants may be called for redemption, in whole and not in part, at a price of $.01 per Warrant:\n• at any time after the Warrants become exercisable,\n• upon not less than 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption to each Warrant holder,\n• if, and only if, the reported last sale price of the shares of Common Stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share, for any 20 trading days\nwithin a 30-day trading period commencing after the Warrants become exercisable and ending on the third business day prior to the\nnotice of redemption to Warrant holders, and\n• if, and only if, there is a current registration statement in effect with respect to the shares of Common Stock underlying such Warrants at\nthe time of redemption and for the entire 30-day trading period referred to above and continuing each day thereafter until the date of\nredemption.\nThe right to exercise will be forfeited unless the Warrants are exercised prior to the date specified in the notice of redemption. On and after\nthe redemption date, a record holder of a Warrant will have no further rights except to receive the redemption price for such holder’s Warrant\nupon surrender of such Warrant.\nThe redemption criteria for the Warrants have been established at a price which is intended to provide Warrant holders a reasonable\npremium to the initial exercise price and provide a sufficient differential between the then-prevailing share price and the Warrant exercise price\nso that if the share price declines as a result of a redemption call, the redemption will not cause the share price to drop below the exercise price\nof the Warrants.\nIf the Warrants are called for redemption as described above, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise\nWarrants to do so on a “cashless basis.” In such event, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the Warrants for that number\nof shares of Common Stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares of Common Stock underlying\nthe Warrants, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the Warrants and the “fair market value” (defined below) by (y) the\nfair market value. The “fair market value” for this purpose shall mean the average reported last sale price of the Common Stock for the 10\ntrading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of Warrants. Whether we\nwill exercise our option to require all holders to exercise their Warrants on a “cashless basis” will depend on a variety of factors including the\nprice of the Common Stock at the time the Warrants are called for redemption, ongoing cash needs at such time and concerns regarding\ndilutive share issuances.\nThe Warrants have been issued in registered form under a warrant agreement (the “Warrant Agreement”) between Continental Stock\nTransfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent, and Roth CH Acquisition I Co. (“ROCH”). The Warrant Agreement provides that the terms of\nthe Warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct\nany defective provision, but requires the approval, by written consent or vote, of the holders of a majority of the then outstanding Warrants in\norder to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders.\nThe exercise price and number of shares of common stock issuable on exercise of the Warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances\nincluding in the event of a share dividend, extraordinary dividend or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, the\nWarrants will not be adjusted for issuances of shares of Common Stock at a price below the applicable exercise price.\nThe Warrants may be exercised upon surrender of the Warrant certificate on or prior to the expiration date at the offices of the warrant\nagent, with the exercise form on the reverse side of the Warrant certificate completed and executed as indicated, accompanied by full payment\nof the exercise price, by certified or official bank check, for the number of Warrants being exercised. The Warrant holders do not have the\nrights or privileges of holders of shares of Common Stock and any voting rights until they exercise their warrants and receive shares of\ncommon stock. After the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon exercise of the Warrants, each holder will be entitled to one vote for each\nshare held of record on all matters to be voted on by stockholders.\nWarrant holders may elect to be subject to a restriction on the exercise of their Warrants such that an electing Warrant holder would not be\nable to exercise their Warrants to the extent that, after giving effect to such exercise, such holder would beneficially own in excess of 9.9% of\nthe shares of Common Stock outstanding.\nNo fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the Warrants. If, upon exercise of the Warrants, a holder would be entitled to receive a\nfractional interest in a share, upon exercise, the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued to the Warrant holder will be rounded down to\nthe nearest whole number.\nUnits\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had 56,364 units issued and outstanding (the “Units”). All Units outstanding reflect a unit consisting of one\nshare of Common Stock and three-quarters of one redeemable Warrant to purchase Common Stock.\nDividends\nWe have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our Common Stock and do not presently intend to pay any cash dividends in the\nforeseeable future. The payment of dividends is subject to the discretion of the Company’s board of directors. Our board of directors bases its\ndecisions regarding dividends on, among other things, general business conditions, our financial results, contractual, legal and regulatory\nrestrictions regarding dividend payments and any other factors that the board may consider relevant.\nListing\nOur Common Stock, Warrants and Units trade on NASDAQ under the symbols “PCT,” “PCTTW” and “PCTTU,” respectively.\nAnnual Stockholder Meetings\nThe Second Amended and Restated Bylaws provide that annual stockholder meetings will be held wholly or partially by means of remote\ncommunication or at such place, within or without the State of Delaware, on such date and at such time as may be determined by the\nCompany’s board of directors, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company (the “Chief Executive Officer”) or the chairman of the board of\ndirectors of the Company (the “Chairman”) and as will be designated in the notice of the annual meeting.\nAnti-Takeover Effects of the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Second Amended and Restated\nBylaws and Certain Provisions of Delaware Law\nThe Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Second Amended and Restated Bylaws contain and the DGCL contains\nprovisions, which are summarized in the following paragraphs, that are intended to enhance the likelihood of continuity and stability in the\ncomposition of the Company’s board of directors. These provisions are intended to avoid costly takeover battles, reduce the Company’s\nvulnerability to a hostile change of control and enhance the ability of the Company’s board of directors to maximize stockholder value in\nconnection with any unsolicited offer to acquire the Company. However, these provisions may have an anti-takeover effect and may delay,\ndeter or prevent a merger or acquisition of the Company by means of a tender offer, a proxy contest or other takeover attempt that a stockholder\nmight consider in its best interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the prevailing market price for the shares of the\nCompany’s Common Stock held by stockholders.\nAuthorized but Unissued Capital Stock\nDelaware law does not require stockholder approval for any issuance of authorized shares. However, the listing requirements of NASDAQ,\nwhich would apply if and so long as the Company’s Common Stock remains listed on NASDAQ, require stockholder approval of certain\nissuances equal to or exceeding 20% of the then outstanding voting power or then outstanding number of shares of common stock. Additional\nshares that may be used in the future may be issued for a variety of corporate purposes, including future public offerings, to raise additional\ncapital or to facilitate acquisitions.\nThe Company’s board of directors may generally issue preferred shares on terms calculated to discourage, delay or prevent a change of\ncontrol of the Company or the removal of the Company’s management. Moreover, the Company’s authorized but unissued shares of preferred\nstock will be available for future issuances without stockholder approval and could be utilized for a variety of corporate purposes, including\nfuture offerings to raise additional capital, to facilitate acquisitions and employee benefit plans.\nOne of the effects of the existence of unissued and unreserved common stock or preferred stock may be to enable the Company’s board of\ndirectors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management, which issuance could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to\nobtain control of the Company by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise, and thereby protect the continuity of the\nCompany’s management and possibly deprive the Company’s stockholders of opportunities to sell their shares of the Company’s Common\nStock at prices higher than prevailing market prices.\nRemoval of Directors; Vacancies\nSubject to the rights, if any, of the holders of any series of preferred stock to elect additional directors under circumstances specified in a\nPreferred Stock Designation, any director may be removed from office by the stockholders at any time, with or without cause and, in each case,\nonly by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the outstanding voting stock, voting together as a single class,\nat any annual meeting or special meeting of the stockholders where the notice of which states that the removal of a director or directors is\namong the purposes of the meeting and identifies the director or directors proposed to be removed.\nSubject to the rights, if any, of the holders of any future series of preferred stock to elect additional directors under circumstances specified in a\nPreferred Stock Designation , newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the number of directors and any vacancies on the\nboard of directors resulting from death, disability, resignation, disqualification, removal, or other cause will be filled solely by the affirmative\nvote of a majority of the remaining directors then in office, even though less than a quorum of the board of directors, or by a sole remaining\ndirector. Any director elected in accordance with the preceding sentence will hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until\nsuch director’s successor is duly elected and qualified or until his or her earlier death, disability, resignation, disqualification or removal. No\ndecrease in the number of directors constituting the board of directors may shorten the term of any incumbent director.\nSpecial Stockholder Meetings\nSubject to the rights of the holders of any future series of preferred stock, special meetings of stockholders may be called only (i) by the\nChairman, (ii) by the Chief Executive Officer, or (iii) by the Secretary of the Company (the “Secretary”) acting at the request of the Chairman,\nthe Chief Executive Officer or a majority of the total number of directors that the Company would have if there were no vacancies on its board\nof directors. At any annual meeting or special meeting of stockholders, only such business will be conducted or considered as has been brought\nbefore such meeting in the manner provided in the Second Amended and Restated Bylaws.\nRequirements for Advance Notification of Director Nominations and Stockholder Proposals\nThe Second Amended and Restated Bylaws establish advance notice procedures with respect to stockholder proposals and the nomination of\ncandidates for election as directors, other than nominations made by or at the direction of the board of directors or a committee of the board of\ndirectors. In order for any matter to be properly brought before a meeting, a stockholder will have to comply with advance notice requirements\nand provide the Company with certain information. Generally, to be timely, a stockholder’s notice relating to any nomination or other business\nto be brought before an annual meeting must be delivered to the Secretary at the Company’s principal executive offices not less than 90 days\nnor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders. Notwithstanding the\nforegoing, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the board of directors at the annual meeting is increased effective after the\ntime period for which nominations would otherwise be due and there is no public announcement by the Company naming the nominees for the\nadditional directorships at least 100 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year’s annual meeting, a stockholder’s notice will also\nbe considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for the additional directorships, if it will be delivered to the Secretary at the principal\nexecutive offices of the Company not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which such public announcement is\nfirst made by the Company.\nTo be timely, a stockholder’s notice relating to the nomination of a director to the Company’s board of directors to be brought before a\nspecial meeting, if permitted, will be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not earlier than the close of\nbusiness on the 120th day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such special\nmeeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees\nproposed by the board of directors to be elected at such meeting. The Second Amended and Restated Bylaws also specify requirements as to\nthe form and content of a stockholder’s notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing notice requirements, the notice requirements will not apply to\ndirector nominations pursuant the Pure Crown Side Letter (as defined in the Second Amended and Restated Bylaws).\nThese notice provisions may defer, delay or discourage a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer’s\nown slate of directors or otherwise attempting to influence or obtain control of the Company.\nConsent of Stockholders in Lieu of Meeting\nSubject to the rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock, any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders may be\ntaken only at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and may not be taken without a meeting by means of any consent in\nwriting of such stockholder.\nDissenters’ Rights of Appraisal and Payment\nUnder the DGCL, with certain exceptions, the Company’s stockholders will have appraisal rights in connection with a merger or\nconsolidation of the Company. Pursuant to the DGCL, stockholders who properly request and perfect appraisal rights in connection with such\nmerger or consolidation will have the right to receive payment of the fair value of their shares as determined by the Delaware Court of\nChancery.\nStockholders’ Derivative Actions\nUnder the DGCL, any of the Company’s stockholders may bring an action in the Company’s name to procure a judgment in the Company’s\nfavor, also known as a derivative action, provided that the stockholder bringing the action is a holder of the Company’s shares at the time of\nthe transaction to which the action relates or such stockholder’s stock thereafter devolved by operation of law.\nAmendment of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation\nThe Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that the Company reserves the right at any time from time to time to\namend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. Notwithstanding any\ninconsistent provision of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or any provision of law that might otherwise permit a lesser\nvote or no vote, but in addition to any affirmative vote of the holders of any series of preferred stock required by law, (a) until the date (the\n\"Sunset Date\") of the first annual meeting of the stockholders that is held after March 17, 2026, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least\n66 2⁄3% of the voting power, and (b) following the Sunset Date, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power, in the\ncase of each of (a) and (b), of the outstanding capital stock entitled to vote, voting together as a single class, will be required to amend, alter,\nchange or repeal, or adopt any provision inconsistent with, certain provisions, as noted in the Amended and Restated Certificate of\nIncorporation, or the definition of any capitalized terms used therein or any successor provision.\nAmendment of the Second Amended and Restated Bylaws\nThe Second Amended and Restated Bylaws may be amended in any respect or repealed at any time, either (a) at any meeting of\nstockholders, provided that any amendment or supplement proposed to be acted upon at any such meeting has been properly described or\nreferred to in the notice of such meeting, or (b) by the Company’s board of directors, provided that no amendment adopted by the board of\ndirectors may vary or conflict with any amendment adopted by the stockholders in accordance with the Amended and Restated Certificate of\nIncorporation and the Second Amended and Restated Bylaws. Notwithstanding the foregoing and anything contained in the Second Amended\nand Restated Bylaws, certain provisions of the Second Amended and Restated Bylaws may not be amended or repealed by the stockholders,\nand no provision inconsistent therewith may be adopted by the stockholders, without (a) until the Sunset Date, the affirmative vote of the\nholders of at least 66 2⁄3% of the Company’s outstanding capital stock entitled to vote, voting together as a single class and (b) following the\nSunset Date, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the Company’s outstanding capital stock entitled to vote, voting together as a\nsingle class.\nExclusive Forum Selection\nThe Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that, unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an\nalternative forum, (a) the Court of Chancery (the “Chancery Court”) of the State of Delaware (or, in the event that the Chancery Court does not\nhave jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive\nforum for (i) any derivative action, suit or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (ii) any action, suit or proceeding asserting a claim of\nbreach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer, employee or stockholder of the Company to the Company or to the Company’s\nstockholders, (iii) any action, suit or proceeding arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or the Second Amended and Restated Bylaws\nor the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (as either may be amended and/or restated from time to time) or as to which the\nDGCL confers jurisdiction on the Chancery Court, or (iv) any action, suit or proceeding asserting a claim against the Company governed by\nthe internal affairs doctrine; and (b) subject to the preceding provisions, the federal district courts of the United States will be the exclusive\nforum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. If any action the\nsubject matter of which is within the scope of clause (a) of the immediately preceding sentence is filed in a court other than the courts in the\nState of Delaware (a “Foreign Action”) in the name of any stockholder, such stockholder will be deemed to have consented to (1) the personal\njurisdiction of the state and federal courts in the State of Delaware in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce the\nprovisions of clause (a) of the immediately preceding sentence and (2) having service of process made upon such stockholder in any such\naction by service upon such stockholder’s counsel in the Foreign Action as agent for such stockholder. Any person or entity purchasing or\notherwise acquiring or holding any interest in any security of the Company will be deemed to have notice of and consented to such provisions\nof the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits\nbrought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Securities Act the Exchange Act, or any other claim for which the federal courts of the\nUnited States have exclusive jurisdiction. Unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district\ncourts of the United States of America shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution\nof any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act.\nLimitations on Liability and Indemnification of Officers and Directors\nThe DGCL authorizes corporations to limit or eliminate the personal liability of directors and certain officers to corporations and their\nstockholders for monetary damages for breaches of directors’ fiduciary duties, subject to certain exceptions. The Amended and Restated\nCertificate of Incorporation includes a provision that eliminates the personal liability of directors for monetary damages for any breach of\nfiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted under the DGCL. The\neffect of these provisions is to eliminate the rights of the Company and its stockholders, through stockholders’ derivative suits on the\nCompany’s behalf, to recover monetary damages from a director for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, including breaches resulting from\ngrossly negligent behavior. However, exculpation does not apply to any director for any breach of the director’s duty of loyalty to the\nCompany or its stockholders, or if the director has acted in bad faith, knowingly or intentionally violated the law, authorized illegal dividends\nor redemptions or derived an improper benefit from his or her actions as a director.\nThe Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that the Company must indemnify and advance expenses to the Company’s\ndirectors and officers to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL. The Company also is expressly authorized to maintain insurance, at its\nexpense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or\nother enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Company would have the power to indemnify such person against\nsuch expense, liability or loss under the DGCL. The Company believes that these indemnification and advancement provisions and insurance\nare useful to attract and retain qualified directors and executive officers.\nThe limitation of liability, advancement and indemnification provisions in the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation may\ndiscourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. These provisions also may have the effect\nof reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and officers, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise\nbenefit the Company and its stockholders. In addition, your investment may be adversely affected to the extent the Company pays the costs of\nsettlement and damage awards against directors and officers pursuant to these indemnification provisions.\nExhibit 10.45\nSECOND AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT\nThis SECOND AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT, dated as of March 1, 2024 (this “Amendment”), is entered into by and\namong (a) PURECYCLE TECHNOLOGIES, INC., a Delaware corporation (the “Borrower”), (b) the Guarantors (as defined herein), (c) the Lenders\n(as defined herein), (d) PURE PLASTIC LLC, as Administrative Agent (in such capacity, the “ Administrative Agent”), and (e) PURE PLASTIC\nLLC, as Security Agent (in such capacity, the “Security Agent”).\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENTS:\nWHEREAS, the Borrower, the Guarantors, the Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the Security Agent are party to that certain Credit\nAgreement, dated as of May 8, 2023, as amended by that certain First Amendment to Credit Agreement dated as of August 21, 2023 (the “Credit\nAgreement” and, the Credit Agreement as amended and modified by this Amendment, the “ Amended Credit Agreement”).

(the “Company”) has adopted this Compensation Clawback Policy (the “Policy”) to\nempower the Company to recover Covered Compensation (as defined below) erroneously awarded to a Covered Officer (as defined\nbelow) in the event of an Accounting Restatement (as defined below).\nNotwithstanding anything in this Policy to the contrary, at all times, this Policy remains subject to interpretation and operation in\naccordance with the final rules and regulations promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), the final\nlisting standards adopted by the Stock Exchange, and any applicable SEC or Stock Exchange guidance or interpretations issued from\ntime to time regarding such Covered Compensation recovery requirements (collectively, the “Final Guidance”). Questions regarding\nthis Policy should be directed to the Company’s General Counsel.\nPolicy Statement\nUnless a Clawback Exception (as defined below) applies, the Company will recover reasonably promptly from each Covered Officer\nthe Covered Compensation Received (as defined below) by such Covered Officer in the event that the Company is required to prepare\nan accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under the\nsecurities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is\nmaterial to the previously issued financial statements, or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the\ncurrent period or left uncorrected in the current period (each, an “Accounting Restatement”). If a Clawback Exception applies with\nrespect to a Covered Officer, the Company may forgo such recovery under this Policy from such Covered Officer.\nCovered Officers\nFor purposes of this Policy, “Covered Officer” is defined as any current or former “Section 16 officer” of the Company within the\nmeaning of Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act, as determined by the Board or the Compensation Committee of the Board (the\n“Committee”). Covered Officers include, at a minimum, “executive officers” as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act and\nidentified under Item 401(b) of Regulation S-K.\nCovered Compensation\nFor purposes of this Policy:\n• “Covered Compensation” is defined as the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation (as defined below) Received during\nthe applicable Recovery Period (as defined below) that exceeds the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation that otherwise\nwould have been Received during such Recovery Period had it been\ndetermined based on the relevant restated amounts, and computed without regard to any taxes paid.\nIncentive-Based Compensation Received by a Covered Officer will only qualify as Covered Compensation if: (i) it is\nReceived on or after October 2, 2023; (ii) it is Received after such Covered Officer begins service as a Covered Officer; (iii)\nsuch Covered Officer served as a Covered Officer at any time during the performance period for such Incentive-Based\nCompensation; and (iv) it is Received while the Company has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or\na national securities association.\nFor Incentive-Based Compensation based on stock price or total shareholder return, where the amount of erroneously\nawarded Covered Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in an Accounting\nRestatement, the amount of such Incentive-Based Compensation that is deemed to be Covered Compensation will be based\non a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on the stock price or total shareholder return upon\nwhich the Incentive-Based Compensation was Received, and the Company will maintain and provide to the Stock Exchange\ndocumentation of the determination of such reasonable estimate.\n• “Incentive-Based Compensation” is defined as any compensation that is granted, earned, or vested based wholly or in part\nupon the attainment of a Financial Reporting Measure (as defined below). For purposes of clarity, Incentive-Based\nCompensation includes compensation that is in any plan, other than tax-qualified retirement plans, including long term\ndisability, life insurance, and supplemental executive retirement plans, and any other compensation that is based on such\nIncentive-Based Compensation, such as earnings accrued on notional amounts of Incentive-Based Compensation contributed\nto such plans.\n• “Financial Reporting Measure” is defined as a measure that is determined and presented in accordance with the accounting\nprinciples used in preparing the Company’s financial statements, and any measures that are derived wholly or in part from\nsuch measures. Stock price and total shareholder return are also Financial Reporting Measures.\n• Incentive-Based Compensation is deemed “Received” in the Company’s fiscal period during which the Financial Reporting\nMeasure specified in the Incentive-Based Compensation award is attained, even if the payment or grant of the Incentive-\nBased Compensation occurs after the end of that period.\nRecovery Period\nFor purposes of this Policy, the applicable “Recovery Period” is defined as the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding\nthe Trigger Date (as defined below) and, if applicable, any transition period resulting from a change in the Company’s fiscal year within\nor immediately following those three completed fiscal years (provided, however, that if a transition period between the last day of the\nCompany’s previous fiscal year end and the first day of its new fiscal year comprises a period of nine to 12 months, such period would\nbe deemed to be a completed fiscal year).\n2\nFor purposes of this Policy, the “Trigger Date” as of which the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement is the\nearlier to occur of: (i) the date that the Board, applicable Board committee, or officers authorized to take action if Board action is not\nrequired, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare the Accounting Restatement or (ii)\nthe date a court, regulator, or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare the Accounting Restatement.\nClawback Exceptions\nThe Company is required to recover all Covered Compensation Received by a Covered Officer in the event of an Accounting\nRestatement unless (i) one of the following conditions are met and (ii) the Committee has made a determination that recovery would be\nimpracticable in accordance with Rule 10D-1 under the Exchange Act (under such circumstances, a “Clawback Exception” applies):\n• the direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered (and the\nCompany has already made a reasonable attempt to recover such erroneously awarded Covered Compensation from such\nCovered Officer, has documented such reasonable attempt(s) to recover, and has provided such documentation to the Stock\nExchange);\n• recovery would violate home country law that was adopted prior to November 28, 2022 (and the Company has already\nobtained an opinion of home country counsel, acceptable to the Stock Exchange, that recovery would result in such a\nviolation, and provided such opinion to the Stock Exchange); or\n• recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to\nemployees of the Company, to fail to meet the requirements of Section 401(a)(13) or Section 411(a) of the Internal Revenue\nCode and regulations thereunder.
