(Nasdaq: GTX)** (\"Garrett\" or the \"Company\"), a leading differentiated automotive technology provider, today announced its financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\n“Garrett delivered solid financial performance in the third quarter amid industry softness, increased competitive pressure on global OEMs, compounded by some impact from short-term customer vehicle platform mix.” said Olivier Rabiller, President and CEO of Garrett. “Our outstanding operating performance allowed us to expand our adjusted EBITDA margin by 160 basis points year-over-year to 17.4% and generated $71 million in adjusted free cash flow while we continue to execute on our capital allocation priorities, including $226 million of share repurchases through the first three quarters of 2024.”\n\n“In the quarter, we continued to win across all turbo vehicle verticals. More specifically, our new range of large turbos enabled us to secure critical wins on gen-sets to serve the growing need for backup power generation equipment for data centers. Additionally, we continue to see increased momentum with our customers for our differentiated, zero-emission high-speed electric solutions. We have achieved significant progress this quarter with our high-speed electric powertrain solution, including closing important partnership agreements in the commercial vehicle space that will lead to mass production as early as 2027.”\n\n**$ millions (unless otherwise noted)**| **Q3 2024**| **Q3 2023**| **2024 YTD**| **2023 YTD**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nNet sales| 826| 960| 2,631| 2,941  \nCost of goods sold| 660| 784| 2,108| 2,374  \nGross profit| 166| 176| 523| 567  \nGross profit %| 20.1%| 18.3%| 19.9%| 19.3%  \nSelling, general and administrative expenses| 53| 59| 178| 178  \nIncome before taxes| 76| 70| 244| 279  \nNet income| 52| 57| 182| 209  \nNet income margin| 6.3%| 5.9%| 6.9%| 7.1%  \nAdjusted EBITDA*| 144| 152| 445| 490  \nAdjusted EBITDA margin*| 17.4%| 15.8%| 16.9%| 16.7%  \nNet cash provided by operating activities| 67| 74| 277| 330  \nAdjusted free cash flow*| 71| 57| 201| 285  \n  \n_* See reconciliations to the nearest GAAP measures below._\n\n**__Results of Operations__**\n\n**Net sales** for the third quarter of 2024 were $826 million, representing a decrease of 14% (including a favorable impact of $1 million or 0% due to foreign currency translation) compared with $960 million in the third quarter of 2023. This decrease was driven by lower light vehicle sales due to industry softness in Europe and China, competitive pressure on global OEMs and short-term customer vehicle platform mix impacts. Net sales also decreased due to pricing, net of inflation pass-through, driven by commodity deflation, partially offset by favorable product mix.\n\n**Cost of goods sold** for the third quarter of 2024 decreased to $660 million from $784 million in the third quarter of 2023, primarily driven by $113 million of lower sales volumes, $16 million of commodity, transportation and energy deflation and $38 million of productivity net of labor inflation. These decreases were partially offset by $32 million of unfavorable product mix and $6 million of higher research and development (\"R&D\") costs, reflecting Garrett's continued investment in new turbo and zero emission technologies.\n\n**Gross profit** totaled $166 million for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to $176 million in the third quarter of 2023, with a gross profit percentage for the third quarter of 2024 of 20.1% as compared to 18.3% in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in gross profit was primarily driven by $46 million from lower volumes, $13 million from lower pricing, net of inflation pass-through, driven by commodity deflation, $6 million from higher R&D costs and $4 million due to foreign currency impact. These decreases were partially offset by $16 million of commodity, transportation and energy deflation, $33 million of productivity, net of labor inflation and $10 million of favorable product mix.\n\n**Selling, general and administrative**(“SG&A”) expenses for the third quarter of 2024 decreased to $53 million from $59 million in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was mainly driven by $5 million of lower professional service and legal fees, $2 million of lower bad debt expense and $2 million of lower IT-related costs, partially offset by $2 million of higher repositioning costs and $1 million of unfavorable foreign exchange impact.\n\n**Interest expense** in the third quarter of 2024 was $37 million as compared to $48 million in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by $10 million of lower debt issuance cost amortization and $9 million of lower interest expense due to a different notional amount of debt outstanding during the period. In addition, we recorded $4 million of gains on our interest derivatives in the current year, in comparison to $7 million of gains in the prior year. We also recognized $9 million of marked-to-market remeasurement losses during the quarter on our undesignated interest rate swap contracts, in comparison to $5 million of marked-to-market remeasurement losses in the prior year.\n\n**Non-operating income** for the third quarter of 2024 was $1 million of income as compared to $2 million in the third quarter of 2023, with the decrease primarily driven by lower equity income due to the sale of an equity interest in an unconsolidated joint venture.\n\n**Tax expense** for the third quarter of 2024 was $24 million as compared to $13 million in the third quarter of 2023, mainly driven by the global mix of earnings, partially offset by adjustments to tax reserves due to expiration of statute of limitations.\n\n**Net income** for the third quarter of 2024 was $52 million as compared to $57 million in the third quarter of 2023. The $5 million decrease was primarily due to $10 million of lower gross profit and $11 million of higher tax expense. These decreases were partially offset by $11 million of lower interest expense and $6 million of lower SG&A expense.\n\n**Net cash provided by operating activities** totaled $67 million in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to $74 million in the third quarter of 2023, representing a decrease of $7 million. This decrease was primarily due to $15 million in lower net income excluding non-cash charges and $9 million of unfavorable impacts from working capital changes, partially offset by $17 million of favorable impacts from changes in other assets and liabilities.\n\n**__Non-GAAP Financial Measures__**\n\n**Adjusted EBITDA** decreased to $144 million in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to $152 million in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was mainly due to lower volumes as discussed above, commodity deflation impact on pricing net of inflation pass-through as well as unfavorable foreign exchange impact. These decreases were partially offset by strong operational performance through productivity, net of labor inflation, commodity, transportation and energy inflation and favorable product mix.\n\n**Adjusted free cash flow** was $71 million in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to $57 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily driven by $13 million of favorable impact from working capital changes (net of factoring), $14 million of lower cash paid for interest and $4 million of lower capital expenditures. These increases were partially offset by $8 million of lower adjusted EBITDA, $5 million of higher cash paid for taxes and $4 million of unfavorable impact from changes in other assets and liabilities.\n\n**__Liquidity and Capital Resources__**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, Garrett had $696 million in available liquidity, including $96 million in cash and cash equivalents and $600 million of undrawn commitments under its revolving credit facility. As of June 30, 2024, Garrett had $698 million in available liquidity, including $98 million in cash and cash equivalents and $600 million of undrawn commitments under its revolving credit facility.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, total principal amount of debt outstanding was $1,495 million, down from $1,497 million as of June 30, 2024, due to repayments made on the 2021 Dollar Term Facility.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, we repurchased $52 million of our common stock under our authorized share repurchase program and we had remaining repurchase capacity of $124 million as of September 30, 2024. During the first six months of 2024, our repurchases of common stock were $174 million.\n\n**__Full Year 2024 Outlook__**\n\nGarrett is updating its outlook for the full year 2024 for certain GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures.\n\n**Full Year 2024 Outlook**| **Prior Outlook**  \n---|---  \nNet sales (GAAP)| $3.40 billion to $3.50 billion| $3.50 billion to $3.65 billion  \nNet sales growth at constant currency (Non-GAAP)*| -12% to -10%| -9% to -5%  \nNet income (GAAP)| $240 million to $255 million| $245 million to $285 million  \nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP)*| $585 million to $605 million| $583 million to $633 million  \nNet cash provided by operating activities (GAAP)| $348 million to $398 million| $355 million to $455 million  \nAdjusted free cash flow (Non-GAAP)*| $300 million to $350 million| $300 million to $400 million  \n  \n_* See reconciliations to the nearest GAAP measures below._\n\nGarrett’s full year 2024 outlook, as of October 24, 2024, includes the following expectations:\n\n  * 2024 light vehicle production down 3% vs. 2023\n  * 2024 commercial vehicle production down 1% including on- and off-highway\n  * RD&E of ~4.7% of sales, with greater than 50% on zero-emission technologies\n  * Capital expenditures ~2.5% of sales, with greater than 30% on zero-emission technologies\n  * Stable FX environment (EUR/$ at 1.08)\n\n\n\n**__Conference Call__**\n\nGarrett will hold a conference call at 8:30 am EDT / 2:30 pm CET on Thursday, October 24, 2024, to discuss its results.

Forward-looking statements are any statements other than statements of historical fact and can be identified by words such as “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “goal,” “seek,” “believe,” “project,” “estimate,” “expect,” “strategy,” “future,” “likely,” “may,” “should,” “will,” and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements represent our current judgment about possible future activities, events, or developments that we intend, expect, project, believe, or anticipate will or may occur in the future. In making these statement, we rely upon assumptions and analysis based on our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, and expected future developments, as well as other factors we consider appropriate under the circumstances. We believe these judgments are reasonable, but these statements are not guarantees of any future performance, events, or results, and actual performance, events, or results may differ materially from those envisaged by our forward-looking statements due to a variety of important factors, many of which are described in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including risks related to the automotive industry, the competitive landscape and our ability to compete, and macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, among others. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update publicly or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or other factors that affect the subject of these statement, except where we are expressly required to do so by law.\n\n**__Non-GAAP Financial Measures__**\n\nThis communication includes the following non-GAAP financial measures, which are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”): constant currency sales growth, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted free cash flow. We believe these measures are useful to investors and management in understanding our ongoing operations and analysis of ongoing operating trends and are important indicators of operating performance because they exclude the effects of certain non-operating items, therefore making them more closely reflect our operational performance. Our calculation of these non-GAAP measures, including a reconciliation of such measures to the most closely related GAAP measure, are set forth in the Appendix to this presentation. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences between companies in the method of calculation. As a result, the use of these non-GAAP measures has limitations and should not be considered superior to, in isolation from, or as a substitute for, related GAAP measures. For additional information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures, see our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.​\n\n**__About Garrett Motion Inc.__**\n\nGarrett Motion is a differentiated technology leader, serving automotive customers worldwide for close to 70 years.

We define “EBITDA” as our net income calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, plus the sum of interest expense net of interest income, tax expense and depreciation. We define “Adjusted EBITDA” as EBITDA, plus the sum of stock compensation expense, repositioning costs, foreign exchange (gain) loss on debt net of related hedging gains (loss), discounting costs on factoring, gain on sale of equity investment, other non-operating income, capital structure transformation expenses, net reorganization items and loss on extinguishment of debt (if any). Adjusted EBITDA now also adjusts for acquisition and divestiture expenses, and debt refinancing and redemption costs, but no adjustments were made to the prior period as there were no similar adjustments in the prior period. We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are important indicators of operating performance and provide useful information for investors because:\n\n  * EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA exclude the effects of income taxes, as well as the effects of financing and investing activities by eliminating the effects of interest-related charges and depreciation expenses and therefore more closely measure our operational performance; and\n  * certain adjustment items, while periodically affecting our results, may vary significantly from period to period and have disproportionate effect in a given period, which affects the comparability of our results.\n\n\n\nIn addition, our management may use Adjusted EBITDA in setting performance incentive targets to align performance measurement with operational performance.\n\n(2) Reflects interest income of $0 million and $1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $3 million and $6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n(3) Stock compensation expense includes only non-cash expenses.\n\n(4) Reflects the non-service component of net periodic pension income.\n\n(5) Reflects the incremental third-party costs incurred for the sale of an equity interest in an unconsolidated joint venture.\n\n(6) Reflects the third-party incremental costs that were directly attributable to the transformation of the Company's capital structure through the partial repurchase and subsequent conversion of the remaining outstanding Series A Preferred Stock into a single class of common stock in June 2023.\n\n(7) Reflects the third-party costs directly attributable to the repricing of our 2021 Dollar Term Facility.\n\n(8) Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales.\n\n**Reconciliation of Constant Currency Sales % Change****(1)**\n\n**Three Months Ended****September 30,**| **Nine Months Ended****September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \n** _Garrett_**  \nReported sales % change| (14| )%| 2| %| (11| )%| 9| %  \nLess: Foreign currency translation| 0| %| 3| %| (1| )%| (1| )%  \nConstant currency sales % change| (14| )%| (1| )%| (10| )%| 10| %  \n**_Gasoline_**  \nReported sales % change| (19| )%| 10| %| (14| )%| 17| %  \nLess: Foreign currency translation| 0| %| 1| %| (1| )%| (2| )%  \nConstant currency sales % change| (19| )%| 9| %| (13| )%| 19| %  \n**_Diesel_**  \nReported sales % change| (21| )%| (4| )%| (15| )%| 3| %  \nLess: Foreign currency translation| 1| %| 5| %| (1| )%| 0| %  \nConstant currency sales % change| (22| )%| (9| )%| (14| )%| 3| %  \n**_Commercial vehicles_**  \nReported sales % change| 0| %| (13| )%| (6| )%| 2| %  \nLess: Foreign currency translation| 0| %| 1| %| (1| )%| (1| )%  \nConstant currency sales % change| 0| %| (14| )%| (5| )%| 3| %  \n**_Aftermarket_**  \nReported sales % change| (1| )%| 3| %| 2| %| 4| %  \nLess: Foreign currency translation| 0| %| 3| %| (1| )%| 0| %  \nConstant currency sales % change| (1| )%| 0| %| 3| %| 4| %  \n**_Other Sales_**  \nReported sales % change| (13| )%| 23| %| (5| )%| 2| %  \nLess: Foreign currency translation| (1| )%| 4| %| (2| )%| (1| )%  \nConstant currency sales % change| (12| )%| 19| %| (3| )%| 3| %  \n  \n(1) We define constant currency sales growth as the year-over-year change in reported sales relative to the comparable period, excluding the impact on sales from foreign currency translation.

(Nasdaq: GTX)** (\"Garrett\" or the \"Company\"), a leading differentiated automotive technology provider, today announced its financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\n“Garrett delivered solid financial performance in the third quarter amid industry softness, increased competitive pressure on global OEMs, compounded by some impact from short-term customer vehicle platform mix.” said Olivier Rabiller, President and CEO of Garrett. “Our outstanding operating performance allowed us to expand our adjusted EBITDA margin by 160 basis points year-over-year to 17.4% and generated $71 million in adjusted free cash flow while we continue to execute on our capital allocation priorities, including $226 million of share repurchases through the first three quarters of 2024.”\n\n“In the quarter, we continued to win across all turbo vehicle verticals. More specifically, our new range of large turbos enabled us to secure critical wins on gen-sets to serve the growing need for backup power generation equipment for data centers. Additionally, we continue to see increased momentum with our customers for our differentiated, zero-emission high-speed electric solutions. We have achieved significant progress this quarter with our high-speed electric powertrain solution, including closing important partnership agreements in the commercial vehicle space that will lead to mass production as early as 2027.”\n\n**$ millions (unless otherwise noted)**| **Q3 2024**| **Q3 2023**| **2024 YTD**| **2023 YTD**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nNet sales| 826| 960| 2,631| 2,941  \nCost of goods sold| 660| 784| 2,108| 2,374  \nGross profit| 166| 176| 523| 567  \nGross profit %| 20.1%| 18.3%| 19.9%| 19.3%  \nSelling, general and administrative expenses| 53| 59| 178| 178  \nIncome before taxes| 76| 70| 244| 279  \nNet income| 52| 57| 182| 209  \nNet income margin| 6.3%| 5.9%| 6.9%| 7.1%  \nAdjusted EBITDA*| 144| 152| 445| 490  \nAdjusted EBITDA margin*| 17.4%| 15.8%| 16.9%| 16.7%  \nNet cash provided by operating activities| 67| 74| 277| 330  \nAdjusted free cash flow*| 71| 57| 201| 285  \n  \n_* See reconciliations to the nearest GAAP measures below._\n\n**__Results of Operations__**\n\n**Net sales** for the third quarter of 2024 were $826 million, representing a decrease of 14% (including a favorable impact of $1 million or 0% due to foreign currency translation) compared with $960 million in the third quarter of 2023. This decrease was driven by lower light vehicle sales due to industry softness in Europe and China, competitive pressure on global OEMs and short-term customer vehicle platform mix impacts. Net sales also decreased due to pricing, net of inflation pass-through, driven by commodity deflation, partially offset by favorable product mix.\n\n**Cost of goods sold** for the third quarter of 2024 decreased to $660 million from $784 million in the third quarter of 2023, primarily driven by $113 million of lower sales volumes, $16 million of commodity, transportation and energy deflation and $38 million of productivity net of labor inflation. These decreases were partially offset by $32 million of unfavorable product mix and $6 million of higher research and development (\"R&D\") costs, reflecting Garrett's continued investment in new turbo and zero emission technologies.\n\n**Gross profit** totaled $166 million for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to $176 million in the third quarter of 2023, with a gross profit percentage for the third quarter of 2024 of 20.1% as compared to 18.3% in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in gross profit was primarily driven by $46 million from lower volumes, $13 million from lower pricing, net of inflation pass-through, driven by commodity deflation, $6 million from higher R&D costs and $4 million due to foreign currency impact. These decreases were partially offset by $16 million of commodity, transportation and energy deflation, $33 million of productivity, net of labor inflation and $10 million of favorable product mix.\n\n**Selling, general and administrative**(“SG&A”) expenses for the third quarter of 2024 decreased to $53 million from $59 million in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was mainly driven by $5 million of lower professional service and legal fees, $2 million of lower bad debt expense and $2 million of lower IT-related costs, partially offset by $2 million of higher repositioning costs and $1 million of unfavorable foreign exchange impact.\n\n**Interest expense** in the third quarter of 2024 was $37 million as compared to $48 million in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by $10 million of lower debt issuance cost amortization and $9 million of lower interest expense due to a different notional amount of debt outstanding during the period. In addition, we recorded $4 million of gains on our interest derivatives in the current year, in comparison to $7 million of gains in the prior year. We also recognized $9 million of marked-to-market remeasurement losses during the quarter on our undesignated interest rate swap contracts, in comparison to $5 million of marked-to-market remeasurement losses in the prior year.\n\n**Non-operating income** for the third quarter of 2024 was $1 million of income as compared to $2 million in the third quarter of 2023, with the decrease primarily driven by lower equity income due to the sale of an equity interest in an unconsolidated joint venture.\n\n**Tax expense** for the third quarter of 2024 was $24 million as compared to $13 million in the third quarter of 2023, mainly driven by the global mix of earnings, partially offset by adjustments to tax reserves due to expiration of statute of limitations.\n\n**Net income** for the third quarter of 2024 was $52 million as compared to $57 million in the third quarter of 2023. The $5 million decrease was primarily due to $10 million of lower gross profit and $11 million of higher tax expense. These decreases were partially offset by $11 million of lower interest expense and $6 million of lower SG&A expense.\n\n**Net cash provided by operating activities** totaled $67 million in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to $74 million in the third quarter of 2023, representing a decrease of $7 million. This decrease was primarily due to $15 million in lower net income excluding non-cash charges and $9 million of unfavorable impacts from working capital changes, partially offset by $17 million of favorable impacts from changes in other assets and liabilities.\n\n**__Non-GAAP Financial Measures__**\n\n**Adjusted EBITDA** decreased to $144 million in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to $152 million in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was mainly due to lower volumes as discussed above, commodity deflation impact on pricing net of inflation pass-through as well as unfavorable foreign exchange impact. These decreases were partially offset by strong operational performance through productivity, net of labor inflation, commodity, transportation and energy inflation and favorable product mix.\n\n**Adjusted free cash flow** was $71 million in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to $57 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily driven by $13 million of favorable impact from working capital changes (net of factoring), $14 million of lower cash paid for interest and $4 million of lower capital expenditures. These increases were partially offset by $8 million of lower adjusted EBITDA, $5 million of higher cash paid for taxes and $4 million of unfavorable impact from changes in other assets and liabilities.\n\n**__Liquidity and Capital Resources__**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, Garrett had $696 million in available liquidity, including $96 million in cash and cash equivalents and $600 million of undrawn commitments under its revolving credit facility. As of June 30, 2024, Garrett had $698 million in available liquidity, including $98 million in cash and cash equivalents and $600 million of undrawn commitments under its revolving credit facility.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, total principal amount of debt outstanding was $1,495 million, down from $1,497 million as of June 30, 2024, due to repayments made on the 2021 Dollar Term Facility.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, we repurchased $52 million of our common stock under our authorized share repurchase program and we had remaining repurchase capacity of $124 million as of September 30, 2024. During the first six months of 2024, our repurchases of common stock were $174 million.\n\n**__Full Year 2024 Outlook__**\n\nGarrett is updating its outlook for the full year 2024 for certain GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures.\n\n**Full Year 2024 Outlook**| **Prior Outlook**  \n---|---  \nNet sales (GAAP)| $3.40 billion to $3.50 billion| $3.50 billion to $3.65 billion  \nNet sales growth at constant currency (Non-GAAP)*| -12% to -10%| -9% to -5%  \nNet income (GAAP)| $240 million to $255 million| $245 million to $285 million  \nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP)*| $585 million to $605 million| $583 million to $633 million  \nNet cash provided by operating activities (GAAP)| $348 million to $398 million| $355 million to $455 million  \nAdjusted free cash flow (Non-GAAP)*| $300 million to $350 million| $300 million to $400 million  \n  \n_* See reconciliations to the nearest GAAP measures below._\n\nGarrett’s full year 2024 outlook, as of October 24, 2024, includes the following expectations:\n\n  * 2024 light vehicle production down 3% vs. 2023\n  * 2024 commercial vehicle production down 1% including on- and off-highway\n  * RD&E of ~4.7% of sales, with greater than 50% on zero-emission technologies\n  * Capital expenditures ~2.5% of sales, with greater than 30% on zero-emission technologies\n  * Stable FX environment (EUR/$ at 1.08)\n\n\n\n**__Conference Call__**\n\nGarrett will hold a conference call at 8:30 am EDT / 2:30 pm CET on Thursday, October 24, 2024, to discuss its results.

Forward-looking statements are any statements other than statements of historical fact and can be identified by words such as “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “goal,” “seek,” “believe,” “project,” “estimate,” “expect,” “strategy,” “future,” “likely,” “may,” “should,” “will,” and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements represent our current judgment about possible future activities, events, or developments that we intend, expect, project, believe, or anticipate will or may occur in the future. In making these statement, we rely upon assumptions and analysis based on our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, and expected future developments, as well as other factors we consider appropriate under the circumstances. We believe these judgments are reasonable, but these statements are not guarantees of any future performance, events, or results, and actual performance, events, or results may differ materially from those envisaged by our forward-looking statements due to a variety of important factors, many of which are described in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including risks related to the automotive industry, the competitive landscape and our ability to compete, and macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, among others. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update publicly or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or other factors that affect the subject of these statement, except where we are expressly required to do so by law.\n\n**__Non-GAAP Financial Measures__**\n\nThis communication includes the following non-GAAP financial measures, which are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”): constant currency sales growth, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted free cash flow. We believe these measures are useful to investors and management in understanding our ongoing operations and analysis of ongoing operating trends and are important indicators of operating performance because they exclude the effects of certain non-operating items, therefore making them more closely reflect our operational performance. Our calculation of these non-GAAP measures, including a reconciliation of such measures to the most closely related GAAP measure, are set forth in the Appendix to this presentation. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences between companies in the method of calculation. As a result, the use of these non-GAAP measures has limitations and should not be considered superior to, in isolation from, or as a substitute for, related GAAP measures. For additional information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures, see our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.​\n\n**__About Garrett Motion Inc.__**\n\nGarrett Motion is a differentiated technology leader, serving automotive customers worldwide for close to 70 years.

We define “EBITDA” as our net income calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, plus the sum of interest expense net of interest income, tax expense and depreciation. We define “Adjusted EBITDA” as EBITDA, plus the sum of stock compensation expense, repositioning costs, foreign exchange (gain) loss on debt net of related hedging gains (loss), discounting costs on factoring, gain on sale of equity investment, other non-operating income, capital structure transformation expenses, net reorganization items and loss on extinguishment of debt (if any). Adjusted EBITDA now also adjusts for acquisition and divestiture expenses, and debt refinancing and redemption costs, but no adjustments were made to the prior period as there were no similar adjustments in the prior period. We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are important indicators of operating performance and provide useful information for investors because:\n\n  * EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA exclude the effects of income taxes, as well as the effects of financing and investing activities by eliminating the effects of interest-related charges and depreciation expenses and therefore more closely measure our operational performance; and\n  * certain adjustment items, while periodically affecting our results, may vary significantly from period to period and have disproportionate effect in a given period, which affects the comparability of our results.\n\n\n\nIn addition, our management may use Adjusted EBITDA in setting performance incentive targets to align performance measurement with operational performance.\n\n(2) Reflects interest income of $0 million and $1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $3 million and $6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n(3) Stock compensation expense includes only non-cash expenses.\n\n(4) Reflects the non-service component of net periodic pension income.\n\n(5) Reflects the incremental third-party costs incurred for the sale of an equity interest in an unconsolidated joint venture.\n\n(6) Reflects the third-party incremental costs that were directly attributable to the transformation of the Company's capital structure through the partial repurchase and subsequent conversion of the remaining outstanding Series A Preferred Stock into a single class of common stock in June 2023.\n\n(7) Reflects the third-party costs directly attributable to the repricing of our 2021 Dollar Term Facility.\n\n(8) Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales.\n\n**Reconciliation of Constant Currency Sales % Change****(1)**\n\n**Three Months Ended****September 30,**| **Nine Months Ended****September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \n** _Garrett_**  \nReported sales % change| (14| )%| 2| %| (11| )%| 9| %  \nLess: Foreign currency translation| 0| %| 3| %| (1| )%| (1| )%  \nConstant currency sales % change| (14| )%| (1| )%| (10| )%| 10| %  \n**_Gasoline_**  \nReported sales % change| (19| )%| 10| %| (14| )%| 17| %  \nLess: Foreign currency translation| 0| %| 1| %| (1| )%| (2| )%  \nConstant currency sales % change| (19| )%| 9| %| (13| )%| 19| %  \n**_Diesel_**  \nReported sales % change| (21| )%| (4| )%| (15| )%| 3| %  \nLess: Foreign currency translation| 1| %| 5| %| (1| )%| 0| %  \nConstant currency sales % change| (22| )%| (9| )%| (14| )%| 3| %  \n**_Commercial vehicles_**  \nReported sales % change| 0| %| (13| )%| (6| )%| 2| %  \nLess: Foreign currency translation| 0| %| 1| %| (1| )%| (1| )%  \nConstant currency sales % change| 0| %| (14| )%| (5| )%| 3| %  \n**_Aftermarket_**  \nReported sales % change| (1| )%| 3| %| 2| %| 4| %  \nLess: Foreign currency translation| 0| %| 3| %| (1| )%| 0| %  \nConstant currency sales % change| (1| )%| 0| %| 3| %| 4| %  \n**_Other Sales_**  \nReported sales % change| (13| )%| 23| %| (5| )%| 2| %  \nLess: Foreign currency translation| (1| )%| 4| %| (2| )%| (1| )%  \nConstant currency sales % change| (12| )%| 19| %| (3| )%| 3| %  \n  \n(1) We define constant currency sales growth as the year-over-year change in reported sales relative to the comparable period, excluding the impact on sales from foreign currency translation.
