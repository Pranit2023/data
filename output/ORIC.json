(Nasdaq: ORIC), a clinical stage oncology company focused on developing treatments that address mechanisms of therapeutic resistance, today reported financial results and operational updates for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n“We are encouraged by the growing evidence supporting the potential best-in-class profiles of ORIC-114 and ORIC-944, and we continue to steadily advance both programs towards the initiation of registrational studies next year,” said Jacob M. Chacko, M.D., president and chief executive officer. “Preclinical data presented at the ENA conference highlighted ORIC-114's potential for superior potency and selectivity in targeting EGFR exon 20 insertions and other atypical mutations, building on previously reported clinical data in NSCLC patients. For ORIC-944, the clinical trial collaboration and supply agreements we secured with Bayer and Johnson and Johnson have helped us further advance our combination studies in prostate cancer. We remain laser-focused on execution across our clinical and preclinical pipeline and look forward to reporting updated data in 2025.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 and Other Recent Highlights:**\n\n**_ORIC-114_****: a brain penetrant, orally bioavailable, irreversible EGFR/HER2 inhibitor**\n\n  * Presented preclinical data demonstrating potential best-in-class properties, including potency and selectivity, of ORIC-114 to treat NSCLC harboring EGFR exon 20 insertions and other atypical mutations at the EORTC-NCI-AACR Symposium on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics.\n  * Expect to report updated Phase 1b data in the first half of 2025.\n\n\n\n**_ORIC-944_****: a potent and selective allosteric inhibitor of PRC2**\n\n  * Initiated dosing of ORIC-944 in combination with NUBEQA® (darolutamide) and in combination with ERLEADA® (apalutamide) in the ongoing Phase 1b trial for prostate cancer in first half of 2024.\n  * Entered into clinical trial collaboration and supply agreements with Bayer and Johnson & Johnson to support the ongoing Phase 1b trial of ORIC-944 in combinations with AR inhibitors for the treatment of prostate cancer.\n\n\n\n**_Corporate Highlights:_**\n\n  * Expanded the leadership team with the appointment of industry veteran Keith Lui as Senior Vice President of Commercial and Medical Affairs.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * **Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments** : Cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $282.4 million as of September 30, 2024, which the company expects will be sufficient to fund its operating plan into late 2026.\n  * **R &D Expenses**: Research and development (R&D) expenses were $31.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $22.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of $8.8 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, R&D expenses were $82.1 million, compared to $60.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of $21.4 million. The increases were due to a net increase in external expenses related to the advancement of product candidates and discovery programs, as well as higher personnel costs, including additional non-cash-stock-based compensation.\n  * **G &A Expenses**: General and administrative (G&A) expenses were $7.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $6.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of $0.8 million.
