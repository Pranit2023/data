Please refer to the table titled \"GAAP Reconciliation and Management's Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" at the end of this press release for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures.  \n  \n**Operating Results**\n\n**Net Income and Earnings Per Share**\n\nNet income totaled $12.8 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $10.8 million for the second quarter of 2024 and $5.6 million for the third quarter of 2023. Net income available to common shareholders totaled $11.6 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $9.6 million for the second quarter of 2024 and $4.4 million for the third quarter of 2023. The quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily due to an increase in net interest income, resulting from loan growth and higher rates on loans, and a slightly lower provision for credit loss during the third quarter of 2024. Dividends on our Series A Convertible Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock (\"Series A Preferred Stock\") totaled $1.2 million for each of the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024.\n\nBasic and diluted earnings per share were $0.85 per share and $0.74 per share, respectively, in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $0.70 per share and $0.63 per share, respectively, in the second quarter of 2024 and $0.32 per share for both basic and diluted in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n**Net Interest Margin and Net Interest Income**\n\nThe net interest margin for the third quarter of 2024 was 3.73%, compared to 3.62% for the second quarter of 2024 and 3.71% for the third quarter of 2023. The yield on loans for the third quarter of 2024 was 7.90%, compared to 7.86% for the second quarter of 2024 and 7.57% for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nNet interest income totaled $40.4 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 3.9% from $38.9 million for the second quarter of 2024 and an increase of 14.5% from $35.3 million for the third quarter of 2023. Interest income totaled $82.7 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 1.8% from $81.2 million for the second quarter of 2024 and an increase of 19.2% from $69.4 million for the third quarter of 2023. Interest and fees on loans increased $2.4 million, or 3.2%, compared to the second quarter of 2024, and increased $10.1 million, or 15.4%, compared to the third quarter of 2023. Interest expense in the third quarter of 2024 remained consistent with the second quarter of 2024 at $42.3 million and $42.4 million, respectively.\n\n**Noninterest Income and Noninterest Expense**\n\nNoninterest income totaled $2.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $2.9 million for the second quarter of 2024 and $1.9 million for the third quarter of 2023. The sequential decrease in noninterest income was primarily due to losses recorded on the sale of a corporate bond and two mortgage-backed securities during the third quarter of 2024.\n\nNoninterest expense remained consistent at $25.6 million for the second and third quarters of 2024, and down from $27.5 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nThe efficiency ratio improved to 59.57% for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 61.39% for the second quarter of 2024 and 74.07% for the third quarter of 2023.\n\n**Balance Sheet Highlights**\n\n**Loan Portfolio and Composition**\n\nFor the quarter ended September 30, 2024, gross loans increased to $3.89 billion, an increase of $131.7 million, or 3.5%, from $3.76 billion as of June 30, 2024, and an increase of $329.9 million, or 9.3%, from $3.56 billion as of September 30, 2023. Commercial and industrial and real estate loans accounted for the majority of the loan growth for the third quarter of 2024, with commercial and industrial loans increasing $137.9 million and real estate loans increasing $33.0 million from the second quarter of 2024. The growth was partially offset by a $39.0 million decrease in municipal loans from June 30, 2024.\n\n**Asset Quality**\n\nNonperforming loans at September 30, 2024 were comparable to June 30, 2024 at $24.0 million and $24.4 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the nonperforming loans to total loans ratio was 0.62%, compared to 0.65% as of June 30, 2024.\n\nThe provision for credit loss recorded for the third quarter of 2024 was $1.1 million and the allowance for credit losses of $39.7 million represented 1.02% of the $3.89 billion in gross loans outstanding as of September 30, 2024.\n\nThe Company recorded net recoveries of $57,000 and net charge-offs of $24,000 for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n**Deposits and Composition**\n\nDeposits totaled $3.99 billion as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 3.6% from $3.86 billion as of June 30, 2024, and an increase of 9.5% from $3.65 billion as of September 30, 2023. Noninterest-bearing demand deposits increased from $464.5 million as of June 30, 2024, to $489.8 million as of September 30, 2024 and represented 12.3% of total deposits as of September 30, 2024, compared to 12.0% of total deposits as of June 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, interest-bearing demand deposits decreased $62.3 million, or 2.2%, time deposits increased $177.9 million, or 36.2%, and savings accounts decreased $2.1 million, or 6.2%, respectively, from June 30, 2024.\n\nThe average cost of deposits was 4.18% for the third quarter of 2024, representing a 4-basis point decrease from the second quarter of 2024 and a 45-basis point increase from the third quarter of 2023. The year-over-year increase was due to interest-bearing demand deposit growth and the increase in rates paid on interest-bearing demand deposits.\n\n**Earnings Conference Call**\n\nThird Coast has scheduled a conference call to discuss its 2024 third quarter results, which will be broadcast live over the Internet, on Thursday, October 24, 2024, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time / 10:00 a.m. Central Time.

Management's Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures****(unaudited)**\n\nOur accounting and reporting policies conform to GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) and the prevailing practices in the banking industry. However, we also evaluate our performance based on certain additional financial measures discussed in this earnings release as being non-GAAP financial measures. Specifically, we review Tangible Common Equity, Tangible Book Value Per Share, Tangible Common Equity to Tangible Assets, and Return on Average Tangible Common Equity for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We classify a financial measure as a non-GAAP financial measure if that financial measure excludes or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding or including amounts, that are not included or excluded, as the case may be, in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP as in effect from time to time in the United States in our statements of income, balance sheets or statements of cash flows. Non-GAAP financial measures do not include operating and other statistical measures or ratios, or statistical measures calculated using exclusively financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\n\nThe non-GAAP financial measures that we discuss in this earnings release should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable or other financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, the manner in which we calculate the non-GAAP financial measures that we discuss in this earnings release may differ from that of other companies reporting measures with similar names. It is important to understand how other banking organizations calculate their financial measures with names similar to the non-GAAP financial measures we have discussed in this earnings release when comparing such non-GAAP financial measures. \n\nManagement believes the following non-GAAP financial measures assist investors in understanding the financial condition of the company:\n\n  * **_Tangible Common Equity._** The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for tangible common equity is total shareholders' equity. We believe that this measure is important to many investors in the marketplace who are interested in the relative changes from period to period of tangible common equity.\n  * **_Tangible Book Value Per Share._** The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for tangible book value per share is book value per share. We believe that the tangible book value per share measure is important to many investors in the marketplace who are interested in changes from period to period in book value per share exclusive of changes in intangible assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets have the effect of increasing total book value while not increasing our tangible book value.\n  * **_Tangible Common Equity to Tangible Assets._** The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for tangible common equity is total shareholders' equity, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for tangible assets is total assets, and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for tangible common equity to tangible assets is total shareholders' equity to total assets. We believe that this measure is important to many investors in the marketplace who are interested in the relative changes from period to period of tangible common equity to tangible assets, each exclusive of changes in intangible assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets have the effect of increasing both total shareholders' equity and assets while not increasing our tangible common equity or tangible assets.\n  * **_Return on Average Tangible Common Equity._** The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for average tangible common equity is average shareholders' equity, and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for return on average tangible common equity is return on average common equity. We believe that this measure is important to many investors in the marketplace who are interested in the relative changes from period to period of return on average tangible common equity, exclusive of changes in intangible assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets have the effect of increasing average shareholders' equity while not increasing our tangible common equity.\n\n\n\nThe calculations of these non-GAAP financial measures are as follows:\n\n**Three Months Ended** | **Nine Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \n**(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share data)** | **September 30** | **June 30** | **March 31** | **December 31** | **September30** | **September30** | **September 30**  \n**Tangible Common Equity:**  \nTotal shareholders' equity | $ | 450,548 | $ | 434,998 | $ | 423,618 | $ | 411,974 | $ | 400,331 | $ | 450,548 | $ | 400,331  \nLess: Preferred stock including additional paid in capital | 66,117 | 66,225 | 66,225 | 66,225 | 66,225 | 66,117 | 66,225  \nTotal common equity | 384,431 | 368,773 | 357,393 | 345,749 | 334,106 | 384,431 | 334,106  \nLess: Goodwill and core deposit intangibles, net | 18,882 | 18,922 | 18,963 | 19,003 | 19,043 | 18,882 | 19,043  \n**Tangible common equity** | $ | 365,549 | $ | 349,851 | $ | 338,430 | $ | 326,746 | $ | 315,063 | $ | 365,549 | $ | 315,063  \nCommon shares outstanding at end of period | 13,667,591 | 13,665,505 | 13,652,888 | 13,604,665 | 13,600,211 | 13,667,591 | 13,600,211  \nBook Value Per Share | $ | 28.13 | $ | 26.99 | $ | 26.18 | $ | 25.41 | $ | 24.57 | $ | 28.13 | $ | 24.57  \n**Tangible Book Value Per Share** | $ | 26.75 | $ | 25.60 | $ | 24.79 | $ | 24.02 | $ | 23.17 | $ | 26.75 | $ | 23.17  \n**Tangible Assets:**  \nTotal assets | $ | 4,627,770 | $ | 4,474,119 | $ | 4,660,403 | $ | 4,396,074 | $ | 4,215,792 | $ | 4,627,770 | $ | 4,215,792  \nAdjustments: Goodwill and core deposit intangibles, net | 18,882 | 18,922 | 18,963 | 19,003 | 19,043 | 18,882 | 19,043  \nTangible assets | $ | 4,608,888 | $ | 4,455,197 | $ | 4,641,440 | $ | 4,377,071 | $ | 4,196,749 | $ | 4,608,888 | $ | 4,196,749  \nTotal Common Equity to Total Assets | 8.31 | % | 8.24 | % | 7.67 | % | 7.86 | % | 7.93 | % | 8.31 | % | 7.93 | %  \n**Tangible Common Equity to Tangible Assets** | 7.93 | % | 7.85 | % | 7.29 | % | 7.46 | % | 7.51 | % | 7.93 | % | 7.51 | %  \n**Average Tangible Common Equity:**  \nAverage shareholders' equity | $ | 446,124 | $ | 433,510 | $ | 420,646 | $ | 407,972 | $ | 402,049 | $ | 433,473 | $ | 393,602  \nLess: Average preferred stock including additional paid in capital | 66,223 | 66,225 | 66,225 | 66,225 | 66,225 | 66,224 | 66,225  \nAverage common equity | 379,901 | 367,285 | 354,421 | 341,747 | 335,824 | 367,249 | 327,377  \nLess: Average goodwill and core deposit intangibles, net | 18,906 | 18,946 | 18,987 | 19,027 | 19,068 | 18,946 | 19,108  \nAverage tangible common equity | $ | 360,995 | $ | 348,339 | $ | 335,434 | $ | 322,720 | $ | 316,756 | $ | 348,303 | $ | 308,269  \nNet Income | $ | 12,775 | $ | 10,796 | $ | 10,367 | $ | 9,689 | $ | 5,578 | $ | 33,938 | $ | 23,712  \nLess: Dividends declared on preferred stock | 1,198 | 1,184 | 1,171 | 1,197 | 1,184 | 3,553 | 3,539  \nNet Income Available to CommonShareholders | $ | 11,577 | $ | 9,612 | $ | 9,196 | $ | 8,492 | $ | 4,394 | $ | 30,385 | $ | 20,173  \nReturn on Average Common Equity(A) | 12.12 | % | 10.53 | % | 10.44 | % | 9.86 | % | 5.19 | % | 11.05 | % | 8.24 | %  \n**Return on Average Tangible CommonEquity(A)** | 12.76 | % | 11.10 | % | 11.03 | % | 10.44 | % | 5.50 | % | 11.65 | % | 8.75 | %  \n  \n___________  \n---  \n(A) Interim periods annualized.  \n  \n_Contact:_ Ken Dennard / Natalie HairstonDennard Lascar Investor Relations(713) 529-6600TCBX@dennardlascar.com\n\n![Cision](https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=DA38431&sd=2024-10-23) View original content:<https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/third-coast-bancshares-inc-reports-2024-third-quarter-financial-results-302284912.html>\n\nSOURCE Third Coast Bancshares\n\n[View All News](https://ir.thirdcoast.bank/news/default.aspx)\n\n### Investor Contacts\n\nDennard Lascar Investor RelationsKen Dennard / Natalie Hairston\n\ntcbx@dennardlascar.com\n\nJohn McWhorter, EVP, CFO\n\njmcwhorter@thirdcoast.bank\n\n### Quick Links\n\n  * [SEC Filings](https://ir.thirdcoast.bank/financials/sec-filings/default.aspx)\n  * [Transfer Agent](/resources/investor-contacts/default.aspx#transfer-paragraph)\n  * [Shareholder Login](https://lsp.continentalstock.com/hlogin)\n\n\n\n### Investor Email Alerts\n\nTo opt-in for investor email alerts, please enter your email address in the field below and select at least one alert option.

These forward-looking statements reflect our current views with respect to, among other things, future events and our financial performance. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as \"may,\" \"should,\" \"could,\" \"predict,\" \"potential,\" \"believe,\" \"looking ahead,\" \"will likely result,\" \"expect,\" \"continue,\" \"will,\" \"anticipate,\" \"seek,\" \"estimate,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"projection,\" \"would\" and \"outlook,\" or the negative version of those words or other comparable words or phrases of a future or forward-looking nature. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our industry, management's beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond our control. Accordingly, we caution you that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date made, actual results may prove to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. There are or will be important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in these forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, the following: interest rate risk and fluctuations in interest rates; market conditions and economic trends generally and in the banking industry; our ability to maintain important deposit relationships; our ability to grow or maintain our deposit base; our ability to implement our expansion strategy; our ability to pay dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock; credit risk associated with our business; and changes in key management personnel. For a discussion of additional factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, please see the risk factors discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), and our other filings with the SEC._\n\n_The foregoing factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read together with the other cautionary statements included in this press release. If one or more events related to these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may differ materially from what we anticipate. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we do not undertake any obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict which will arise. In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements._\n\n_Contact:_ Ken Dennard / Natalie HairstonDennard Lascar Investor Relations(713) 529-6600TCBX@dennardlascar.com\n\n![Cision](https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=DA05402&sd=2024-09-19) View original content:<https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/third-coast-bancshares-inc-declares-quarterly-cash-dividend-on-its-6-75-series-a-convertible-non-cumulative-preferred-stock-302253359.html>\n\nSOURCE Third Coast Bancshares\n\n[View All News](https://ir.thirdcoast.bank/news/default.aspx)\n\n### Investor Contacts\n\nDennard Lascar Investor RelationsKen Dennard / Natalie Hairston\n\ntcbx@dennardlascar.com\n\nJohn McWhorter, EVP, CFO\n\njmcwhorter@thirdcoast.bank\n\n### Quick Links\n\n  * [SEC Filings](https://ir.thirdcoast.bank/financials/sec-filings/default.aspx)\n  * [Transfer Agent](/resources/investor-contacts/default.aspx#transfer-paragraph)\n  * [Shareholder Login](https://lsp.continentalstock.com/hlogin)\n\n\n\n### Investor Email Alerts\n\nTo opt-in for investor email alerts, please enter your email address in the field below and select at least one alert option.
