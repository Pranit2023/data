In the first half of 2024, our adjusted net loss and adjusted EBITDA both narrowed year over year by 25.9% and 27.3%, respectively. We will remain committed to optimizing operating efficiency, setting the stage for our future development.\"\n\n**Unaudited First Half 2024 Financial Results**\n\n**_Net Revenues_**\n\nNet revenues in the first half of 2024 decreased by 64.9% to RMB32.3 million (US$4.4 million) from RMB92.2 million in the same period of the prior year.\n\n  * **Offline marketing services.** Net revenues generated from auto shows decreased by 71.2% to RMB19.9 million (US$2.7 million) in the first half of 2024 from RMB69.3 million in the same period of the prior year, and net revenues generated from special promotion events decreased by 62.0% to RMB0.2 million (US$31 thousand) in the first half of 2024 from RMB0.6 million in the same period of the prior year. The decrease in revenues from offline marketing services was primarily due to a reduction in customer marketing budgets, resulting in a decrease in the number of offline activities.\n  * **Referral service for a commercial bank.** Net revenues generated from referral service for a commercial bank decreased by 100.0% to nil in the first half of 2024 from RMB2.6 million in the same period of the prior year, primarily because the Company has ceased operation of the referral services since April 1, 2022.\n  * **Online marketing services.** Net revenues generated from online marketing services decreased by 70.7% to RMB2.6 million (US$0.4 million) in the first half of 2024 from RMB8.8 million in the same period of the prior year, primarily due to the decrease in the live streaming events held by the Company as the change in the key customers resulted in a failure to continue cooperations.\n  * **Other services.** Net revenues from other services decreased by 12.7% to RMB9.6 million (US$1.3 million) in the first half of 2024 from RMB11.0 million in the same period of the prior year, primarily due to the decrease in referral services.\n\n\n\n**_Gross Profit_**\n\nGross profit decreased by 61.7% to RMB22.4 million (US$3.1 million) in the first half of 2024 from RMB58.4 million in the same period of the prior year. Gross margin was 69.2% in the first half of 2024 compared to 63.4% in the same period of the prior year, primarily attributable to the change in our revenue composition.\n\n**_Total Operating Expenses and Loss from Operations_**\n\nTotal operating expenses decreased by 38.5% to RMB69.8 million (US$9.6 million) in the first half of 2024 from RMB113.6 million in the same period of the prior year.\n\n  * Selling and marketing expenses decreased by 54.7% to RMB36.5 million (US$5.0 million) in the first half of 2024 from RMB80.7 million in the same period of the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in promotion expenses as a result of decreased volume of offline events.\n  * General and administrative expenses increased by 2.6% to RMB24.3 million (US$3.3 million) in the first half of 2024 from RMB23.7 million in the same period of the prior year, primarily due to an increase in general and administrative staff compensation expenses, partially offset the decrease in allowance for doubtful accounts.\n  * Research and development expenses increased by 13.4% to RMB8.7 million (US$1.2 million) in the first half of 2024 from RMB7.7 million in the same period of the prior year, primarily due to an increase in research and development staff compensation expenses.\n  * Impairment of long-lived assets decreased by 80.2% to RMB0.3 million (US$41 thousand) in the first half of 2024 from RMB1.5 million in the same period of the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in impairment in relation to right-of-use assets.\n\n\n\nAs a result of the foregoing, loss from operations decreased by 14.0% to RMB47.5 million (US$6.5 million) in the first half of 2024 from RMB55.2 million in the same period of the prior year.\n\n**_Net loss attributable to the Company's Shareholders and Non-GAAP Measures_**\n\nNet loss attributable to the Company's shareholders in the first half of 2024 increased by 32.5% to RMB40.7 million (US$5.6 million) from RMB30.7 million in the same period of the prior year.

(1)\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was a loss of RMB26.8 million (US$3.7 million) in the first half of 2024 compared with a loss of RMB36.8 million in the same period of the prior year. (1)\n\n(1) For details on the calculation of and reconciliation to the nearest GAAP measures for each of adjusted net loss attributable to the Company's shareholders, adjusted net loss per ordinary share and adjusted EBITDA, please refer to \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" and \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP and GAAP Results.\"  \n---  \n  \n**_Balance Sheet and Cash Flow_**\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company had RMB5.0 million (US$0.7 million) in cash and cash equivalents and RMB4.3 million (US$0.6 million) in restricted cash.

Unless otherwise noted, all translations from Renminbi to U.S. dollars in this press release were made at a rate of RMB7.2672 to US$1.00, the noon buying rate in effect on June 28, 2024, in the City of New York for cable transfers in Renminbi per U.S. dollar as certified for customs purposes by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. No representation is made that the Renminbi amounts could have been, or could be, converted, realized or settled into U.S. dollars at that rate on June 28, 2024, or at any other rate.\n\n**Safe Harbor Statement**\n\nThis announcement contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended and as defined in the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, the Company's business plans and development, business outlook, as well as the length and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the Company's business and industry, which can be identified by terminology such as \"may,\" \"will,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"aim,\" \"estimate,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"believe,\" \"potential,\" \"continue,\" \"is/are likely to\" or other similar expressions. Such statements are based upon management's current expectations and current market and operating conditions, and relate to events that involve known or unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the Company's control. Further information regarding these and other risks, uncertainties or factors is included in the Company's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required under law.\n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nTo supplement the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial information, which is presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company also uses adjusted net loss attributable to the Company's shareholders, adjusted net loss per ordinary share and adjusted EBITDA as additional non-GAAP financial measures. The Company presents these non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by the Company's management to evaluate its operating performance. The Company also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the Company's consolidated results of operations in the same manner as its management and in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of the Company's peer companies.\n\nThe Company defines adjusted net loss as net loss excluding share-based compensation expenses, impairment of long-lived assets and change in fair value of warrant liability. The Company defines adjusted net loss per ordinary share as adjusted net loss divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as net loss excluding depreciation and amortization, interest income, net, share-based compensation expenses, impairment of long-lived assets and change in fair value of warrant liability. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the Company's operating results. These non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for the impact of items that the Company does not consider indicative of the operational performance of the Company's business, and should not be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to net loss or any other measure of performance or as an indicator of the Company's operating performance.\n\nIn addition, the non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using these non-GAAP financial measures is that they do not reflect all items of income and expense that affect the Company's operations. Depreciation and amortization, interest income, net, share-based compensation expenses, impairment of long-lived assets and change in fair value of warrant liability have been and may continue to be incurred in the Company's business and are not reflected in the presentation of these non-GAAP measures. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures to the Company's data. The Company encourages investors and others to review the Company's financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. Investors are encouraged to compare the historical non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\n\n**About TuanChe**\n\nFounded in 2010, TuanChe Limited (NASDAQ: TC) is a leading integrated automotive marketplace in China.

These\nforward-looking statements include, without limitation, the Company’s business plans and development, business\noutlook, as well as the length and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the Company’s business and\nindustry, which can be identified by terminology such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “aim,” “estimate,”\n“intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “potential,” “continue,” “is/are likely to” or other similar expressions. Such statements\nare based upon management’s current expectations and current market and operating conditions, and relate to events\nthat involve known or unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, all of which are difficult to predict and many of\nwhich are beyond the Company’s control. Further information regarding these and other risks, uncertainties or factors\nis included in the Company’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company does not\nundertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or\notherwise, except as required under law.\n4\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial information, which is presented in\naccordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company also uses adjusted net loss attributable to the Company’s shareholders,\nadjusted net loss per ordinary share and adjusted EBITDA as additional non-GAAP financial measures. The Company\npresents these non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by the Company’s management to evaluate its\noperating performance. The Company also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful\ninformation to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the Company’s consolidated results of operations\nin the same manner as its management and in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of\nthe Company’s peer companies.\nThe Company defines adjusted net loss as net loss excluding share-based compensation expenses, impairment of long-\nlived assets and change in fair value of warrant liability. The Company defines adjusted net loss per ordinary share as\nadjusted net loss divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA\nas net loss excluding depreciation and amortization, interest income, net, share-based compensation expenses,\nimpairment of long-lived assets and change in fair value of warrant liability. The Company believes that these non-\nGAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the\nCompany’s operating results. These non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for the impact of items that the\nCompany does not consider indicative of the operational performance of the Company’s business, and should not be\nconsidered in isolation or construed as an alternative to net loss or any other measure of performance or as an indicator\nof the Company’s operating performance.\nIn addition, the non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance\nwith U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations\nof using these non-GAAP financial measures is that they do not reflect all items of income and expense that affect the\nCompany’s operations. Depreciation and amortization, interest income, net, share-based compensation expenses,\nimpairment of long-lived assets and change in fair value of warrant liability have been and may continue to be incurred\nin the Company’s business and are not reflected in the presentation of these non-GAAP measures. Further, these non-\nGAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Other\ncompanies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures to\nthe Company’s data. The Company encourages investors and others to review the Company’s financial information\nin its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. Investors are encouraged to compare the historical non-GAAP\nfinancial measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\n5\nAbout TuanChe\nFounded in 2010, TuanChe Limited (NASDAQ: TC) is a leading integrated automotive marketplace in China.\nTuanChe offers services to connect automotive consumers with various industry players such as automakers, dealers\nand other automotive service providers.
