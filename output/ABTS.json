After accounting for direct costs of revenue\namounting to $2.68 million, primarily electricity costs of $1.1 million and depreciation of $1.27 million, the gross profit from the mining operation was\n$0.75 million.\nThe loss before tax of the group was $0.14 million after accounting for administrative and general overheads.his result compares favorably with the\nprevious period when the loss was $3.5 million. Administrative and general overheads during the period almost doubled to 1.11 million compared to $0.7\nmillion as new staff were added to support production on a 24/7 basis as well as an increase on maintenance and insurance costs now that the data center\nwas fully operational.\nIn April, the Company further improved its water supply and since then, all production lines have been kept running. During the peak construction periods,\na 100,000-gallon reservoir helps to subsidize any shortages from the water company during the day and is replenished at night when consumption is much\nlower. The hydro cooling method introduced with the new batch of machines helps to reduce noise and dust instead of the traditional air cooling by fans.\nThere is no substantial change in the Balance Sheet of the Group except that more Ant-miner machines were purchased for $0.86 million and a piece of\nproperty in Wisconsin acquired for $0.65 million in the period to June. Cash and cash balances dwindled to $0.4 million as of June 30, 2024.\nWith the halving of mining rewards in late in April, production output will be much lower for the rest of 2024. However, the Company will maintain a strict\ncontrol of its costs and hopes to secure more hosting contracts to improve on its revenue.\nExhibit 99.2\nABITS GROUP INC\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nAs of\nJune 30, 2024\nNote (Unaudited) December 31, 2023\nASSETS\nCurrent Assets\nCash and cash equivalents $ 396,583 $ 884,199\nOther receivables and prepayments 3 370,801 774,345\nTotal current assets 767,384 1,658,544\nDigital assets 4 1,546,184 1,194,157\nProperty, equipment and vehicles 5 9,888,446 9,465,567\nConstruction-in-progress - -\nTOTAL ASSETS 12,202,014 12,318,268\nLIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nOther payables and accruals $ 920,700 $ 1,005,608\nStockholders’ Equity\nPreferred stock, $0.001010 par value, authorized; 50,000,000 shares,\n5,000,000 shares issued and outstanding as of June 30, 2024 and\nDecember,31 2023 $ 5,050 $ 5,050\nCommon stock, $0.001 par value, authorized: 50,000,000 shares.

Organization and nature of operations\nThe Company was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands (BVI) on May 18, 2021. On August 17, 2021, the Company completed a re-domicile merger\nwith its predecessor company, Moxian, Inc, wherein it acquired all the assets, liabilities, rights, obligations and operations of the latter and its subsidiaries,\nthrough an exchange of an identical number of shares.\nOn December 28, 2021 in a Special Meeting of shareholders, the Company approved the issue of up to 20 million new ordinary shares of the Company, at a\nprice of $2.50 per share to certain non-US based accredited investors. On February 11, 2022 the Company completed this private placement and issued 16\nmillion new shares, raising $40 million, which it has used in bitcoin mining operations.\nThe Company operates in the United States of America through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Abit USA Inc which has a mining facility in the town of\nDuff, Eastern Tennessee.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the activities of the Company and each of the following entities:\nName of entity Background Ownership\nAbit Hong Kong Limited Investment Holding 100% owned by Moxian (BVI) Inc\nAbit USA Inc. Bitcoin Mining 100% owned by Abit Hong Kong Limited\nBeijing BitMarix Co. Ltd. Inhouse Treasury and Administration 100% owned by Abit Hong Kong Limited\nAbits Inc Bitcoin Mining 100% owned by Abit Hong Kong Limited\n2. Summary of principal accounting policies\nBasis of presentation and consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in\nthe United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and include all the subsidiaries of the Group. The financial year-end of the Company is December 31 while\nthat of the predecessor company is September 30. The consolidated results are presented as of the period ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023. All inter\ncompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in the consolidation.\nFair value of financial instruments\nThe Company follows the provisions of ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.” ASC 820 clarifies the definition of fair value, prescribes\nmethods for measuring fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:\nLevel 1-Observable inputs such as unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date.\nLevel 2-Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and\nliabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market\ndata.\nLevel 3-Inputs are unobservable inputs that reflect management’s assumptions based on the best available information.\nThe carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, prepayments, deposits and other receivables, accruals and other payables, loans from related parties and\nunrelated party approximate their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments.\nF-5\nABITS GROUP INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n2. Summary of principal accounting policies (continued)\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the accompanying consolidated\nfinancial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates required to be made by\nmanagement include but not limited to, useful lives of property and equipment, provision for doubtful accounts, intangible assets valuation, inventory\nvaluation, value added recoverable valuation and deferred tax assets valuation. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash includes cash on hand and demand deposits in accounts maintained with commercial banks. The Company considers all highly liquid investment\ninstruments with an original maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.\nThe Company considers all short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and have original maturities of three\nmonths or less to be cash equivalents.\nPrepayments, deposits and other receivables\nPrepayments and deposits represent amounts advanced to suppliers. The suppliers usually require advance payments or deposits when the Company makes\npurchase or orders service and the prepayments and deposits will be utilized to offset the Company’s future payments. Other receivables mainly consist of\nvarious cash advances to employees for business needs. These amounts are unsecured, non-interest bearing and generally short-term in nature.\nAllowances are recorded when utilization and collection of amounts due are in doubt. Delinquent prepayments, deposits and other receivables are written-\noff after management has determined that the likelihood of utilization or collection is not probable and known bad debts are written off against the\nallowances when identified.\nProperty, Equipment and Vehicles, net\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Significant additions or improvements extending useful lives\nof assets are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line\nmethod over the estimated useful lives as follows:\nElectronic and mining equipment 3-6 years\nFurniture and fixtures 3-6 years\nVehicles 3 years\nIntangible assets, net\nIntangible assets, comprising Intellectual property rights (“IP rights”) and software, which are separable from property and equipment, are stated at cost\nless accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of 3- 10 years.\nF-6\nABITS GROUP INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n2. Summary of principal accounting policies (continued)\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nThe Company classifies its long-lived assets into: (i) computer and office equipment; (ii) furniture and fixtures, (iii) leasehold improvements, and (iv)\nfinite-lived intangible assets.\nLong-lived assets held and used by the Company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value\nof such assets may not be fully recoverable. It is possible that these assets could become impaired as a result of technology, economy or other industry\nchanges. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group to be tested for possible impairment, the Company first compares undiscounted cash\nflows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset or asset group is not\nrecoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Fair value is\ndetermined through various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models, relief from royalty income approach, quoted market values and\nthird-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary.\nThe Company makes various assumptions and estimates regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair values of the\nrespective assets. The assumptions and estimates used to determine future values and remaining useful lives of long-lived assets are complex and\nsubjective. They can be affected by various factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as the\nCompany’s business strategy and its forecasts for specific market expansion.\nDigital assets\nDigital assets are included in non-current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Digital assets purchased are recorded at cost and digital\nassets awarded to the Company through its mining activities are accounted for in connection with the Company’s revenue recognition policy disclosed\nbelow.\nDigital assets held are accounted for as intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized but\nassessed for impairment annually, or more frequently, when events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that it is more likely than not that the\nindefinite-lived asset is impaired. Impairment exists when the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, which is measured using the quoted price of the\ndigital assets at the time its fair value is being measured. In testing for impairment, the Company has the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to\ndetermine whether it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. If it is determined that it is not more likely than not that an impairment exists, a\nquantitative impairment test is not necessary. If the Company concludes otherwise, it is required to perform a quantitative impairment test. To the extent an\nimpairment loss is recognized, the loss establishes the new cost basis of the asset.\nMeanwhile, on December 13, 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-08, which addresses the accounting and disclosure requirements for certain crypto assets.\nThe new guidance requires entities to subsequently measure certain crypto assets at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in net income in each\nreporting period. For all entities, the ASU’s amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, including interim periods within\nthose years. Early adoption is permitted. If an entity adopts the amendments in an interim period, it must adopt them as of the beginning of the fiscal year\nthat includes that interim period.\nEffective January 1, 2023, the Company early adopted ASU 2023-08, which requires entities to measure crypto assets at fair value with changes recognized\nin the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss) each reporting period.\nThe Company’s digital assets are within the scope of ASU 2023-08 and the transition guidance requires a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the beginning\nof the current fiscal year for any difference between the carrying amount of the Company’s digital assets and fair value.\nPurchases of digital assets by the Company, if any, will be included within investing activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows,\nwhile digital assets awarded to the Company through its mining activities are included within operating activities on the accompanying consolidated\nstatements of cash flows. The sales of digital assets are included within investing activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows and\nany realized gains or losses from such sales are included in “realized gain (loss) on exchange of digital assets” in the consolidated statements of operations\nand comprehensive income (loss). The Company accounts for its gains or losses in accordance with the first-in first-out method of accounting.\nRevenue recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”).\nThe Company has entered into digital asset mining pools by executing contracts with mining pool operators to provide computing power to the mining\npool. The Company’s enforceable right to compensation begins only when, and lasts as long as, the Company provides computing power to the mining\npool operator and is created as power is provided over time. The only consideration due to the Company relates to the provision of computing power. The\ncontracts are terminable at any time by and at no cost to the Company, and by the pool operator under certain conditions specified in the contract. Providing\ncomputing power in digital asset transaction verification services is an output of the Company’s ordinary activities. Providing such computing power is the\nonly performance obligation in the Company’s contracts with mining pool operators.\nThe transaction consideration the Company receives, if any, is noncash consideration in the form of bitcoin. Changes in the fair value of the noncash\nconsideration due to form of the consideration (changes in the market price of Bitcoin) are not included in the transaction price and therefore, are not\nincluded in revenue. Certain mining pool operators charge fees to cover the costs of maintaining the pool and are deducted from amounts we may otherwise\nearn and are treated as a reduction to the consideration received. Fees fluctuate and historically have been no more than approximately 2% per reward\nearned, on average.\nF-7\n2. Summary of principal accounting policies (continued)\nRevenue recognition (continued)\nIn exchange for providing computing power, the Company is entitled to either:\na Full-Pay-Per-Share pay out of bitcoin based on a contractual formula, which primarily calculates the hash rate provided by the Company to the mining\npool as a percentage of total network hash rate, and other inputs. The Company is entitled to consideration even if a block is not successfully placed by the\nmining pool operator. The contract is in effect until terminated by either party.\nThe consideration is all variable. Because it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue will not occur and the Company is able to calculate\nthe payout based on the contractual formula, noncash revenue is estimated and recognized based on the spot price of Bitcoin determined using the\nCompany’s primary trading platform for bitcoin at the inception of each contract, which is determined to be daily. Non cash consideration is measured at\nfair value at contract inception. Fair value of the crypto asset consideration is determined using the quoted price on the Company’s primary trading\nplatform for bitcoin at the beginning of the contract period at the single bitcoin level (one bitcoin). This amount is estimated and recognized in revenue\nupon inception, which is when hash rate is provided.\nOr:\na fractional share of the fixed Bitcoin award the mining pool operator receives (less digital asset transaction fees to the mining pool operator which are\nimmaterial and are recorded as a deduction from revenue) for successfully adding a block to the blockchain based on a proportion of the Company’s\n“scoring hash rate” to the pool’s “scoring hash rate” where the scoring hash rate as defined by the pool is the exponential moving average of the hash\npower contributed by the Company or by all pool members combined. The Company’s fractional share of the bitcoin reward is based on the proportion of\ncomputing power the Company contributed to the mining pool operator to the total computing power contributed by all mining pool participants in solving\nthe current algorithm.\nIncome taxes\nThe Company utilizes ASC Topic 740 (“ASC 740”) “Income taxes”, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected\nfuture tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred income taxes\nare recognized for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at\neach period end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.\nValuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nF-8\nABITS GROUP INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n2. Summary of principal accounting policies (continued)”\nIncome taxes (continued)\nASC 740 “Income taxes” clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. This interpretation requires that an entity recognizes in the financial\nstatements the impact of a tax position, if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the\nposition. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or\nmeasurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company has elected to classify interest and penalties related to\nunrecognized tax benefits, if and when required, as part of income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company evaluate the\nlevel of authority for each uncertain tax position (including the potential application of interest and penalties) based on the technical merits, and measure\nthe unrecognized benefits associated with the tax positions.\nForeign currency transactions and translation\nThe reporting currency of the Company is United States Dollars (the “USD”) and the functional currency of the PRC subsidiary is the Renminbi\n(“RMB”).The functional currency of ABit Hong Kong is the Hong Kong Dollar (the “HKD”).\nFor financial reporting purposes, the financial statements of the various subsidiaries are prepared using their respective functional currencies, translated into\nthe reporting currency, USD so to be consolidated with the Company’s. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the reporting\ncurrency are translated into the reporting currency at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated using\naverage rates prevailing during the reporting period. Adjustments resulting from the translation are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other\ncomprehensive income in stockholders’ deficiency. Translation losses are recognized in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nThe exchange rates applied are as follows:\nBalance sheet items, except for equity accounts June 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nRMB:USD 7.1268 7.0827\nHKD:USD 7.8087 7.8157\nItems in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss, and statements cash flows:\nJune 30, 2024 June 30, 2023\nRMB:USD 7.1162 6.9291\nHKD:USD 7.8187 7.8392\nEarnings per share\nBasic gain per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period while the effects of potential common\nshares outstanding during the period are included in diluted earnings per share.\nFASB Accounting Standard Codification Topic 260 (“ASC 260”), “Earnings Per Share,” requires that employee equity share options, non-vested shares and\nsimilar equity instruments granted to employees be treated as potential common shares in computing diluted earnings per share. Diluted earnings per share\nshould be based on the actual number of options or shares granted and not yet forfeited, unless doing so would be anti-dilutive. The Company uses the\n“treasury stock” method for equity instruments granted in share-based payment transactions provided in ASC 260 to determine diluted earnings per share.\nAntidilutive securities represent potentially dilutive securities which are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings or loss per share as their impact\nwas antidilutive.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic\n740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (“ASU 2019-12”). ASU 2019-12 simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain\nexceptions and enhances and simplifies various aspects of the income tax accounting guidance in ASC 740. ASU 2019-12 was effective January 1, 2021.\nThe adoption of ASU 2019-12 did not have any impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statement presentation or disclosures.\nF-9\nABITS GROUP INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n2. Summary of principal accounting policies (continued)\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements (continued)\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt — Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—\nContracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity (“ASU 2020-06”).\nASU 2020-06 simplifies the accounting for convertible debt by eliminating the beneficial conversion and cash conversion accounting models. Upon\nadoption of ASU 2020-06, convertible debt proceeds, unless issued with a substantial premium or an embedded conversion feature that is not clearly and\nclosely related to the host contract, will no longer be allocated between debt and equity components. This modification will reduce the issue discount and\nresult in less non-cash interest expense in financial statements. ASU 2020-06 also updates the earnings per share calculation and requires entities to assume\nshare settlement when the convertible debt can be settled in cash or shares. For contracts in an entity’s own equity, the type of contracts primarily affected\nby ASU 2020-06 are freestanding and embedded features that are accounted for as derivatives under the current guidance due to a failure to meet the\nsettlement assessment by removing the requirements to (i) consider whether the contract would be settled in registered shares, (ii) consider whether\ncollateral is required to be posted, and (iii) assess shareholder rights. ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. Early\nadoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and only if adopted as of the beginning of such fiscal year. The\nCompany adopted ASU 2020-06 effective January 1, 2021. The adoption of ASU 2020-06 did not have any impact on the Company’s consolidated\nfinancial statement presentation or disclosures.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) (“ASU 2016-13”), which requires entities to measure\nall expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable\nforecasts. ASU 2016-13 replaces the existing incurred loss model and is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at\namortized cost. ASU 2016-13 is to be adopted on a modified retrospective basis. As a smaller reporting company, ASU 2016-13 will be effective for the\nCompany for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption\nof ASU 2016-13 will have on its consolidated financial statement presentations and disclosures.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (Topic 350), Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment (“ASU\n2017-04”). ASU 2017-04 eliminates Step 2 of the two-step goodwill impairment test, under which a goodwill impairment loss was measured by comparing\nthe implied fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. ASU 2017-04 requires only a one-step quantitative\nimpairment test, whereby a goodwill impairment loss is measured as the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value (not to exceed the\ntotal goodwill allocated to that reporting unit). Adoption of the ASUs is on a modified retrospective basis. As a smaller reporting company, the standard\nwill be effective for the Company for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company is currently evaluating the\nimpact that the adoption of ASU 2017-04 will have on its consolidated financial statement presentation or disclosures.\nIn May 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-04, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt — Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50),\nCompensation — Stock Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives and Hedging — Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Issuer’s\nAccounting for Certain Modifications or Exchanges of Freestanding Equity-Classified Written Call Options (“ASU 2021-04”). ASU 2021-04 provides\nguidance as to how an issuer should account for a modification of the terms or conditions or an exchange of a freestanding equity-classified written call\noption (i.e., a warrant) that remains classified after modification or exchange as an exchange of the original instrument for a new instrument. An issuer\nshould measure the effect of a modification or exchange as the difference between the fair value of the modified or exchanged warrant and the fair value of\nthat warrant immediately before modification or exchange and then apply a recognition model that comprises four categories of transactions and the\ncorresponding accounting treatment for each category (equity issuance, debt origination, debt modification, and modifications unrelated to equity issuance\nand debt origination or modification). ASU 2021-04 is effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim\nperiods within those fiscal years. An entity should apply the guidance provided in ASU 2021-04 prospectively to modifications or exchanges occurring on\nor after the effective date. Early adoption is permitted for all entities, including adoption in an interim period. If an entity elects to early adopt ASU 2021-\n04 in an interim period, the guidance should be applied as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. The adoption of ASU 2021-\n04 is not expected to have any impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statement presentation or disclosures.\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance.\nThis update requires certain annual disclosures about transactions with a government that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting\nmodel by analogy. This update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021, and early application is permitted. This guidance should\nbe applied either prospectively to all transactions that are reflected in financial statements at the date of initial application and new transactions that are\nentered into after the date of initial application or retrospectively to those transactions. The Company does not expect the impact of this guidance to have a\nmaterial impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company’s management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, authoritative guidance, if currently adopted, would have\na material impact on the Company’s financial statement presentation or disclosures.\nF-10\nABITS GROUP INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n3.

Income taxes\nThe Company and its subsidiaries file separate income tax returns.\nUnited States of America\nAbit USA Inc. was incorporated in April 2022 and will have to file a tax return for the year ending December 31, 2022.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”) was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code.\nChanges include, but are not limited to, a U.S. corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the\ntransition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed\nrepatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017. As the Company has a September 30 fiscal year-end, the lower corporate income tax\nrate will be phased in, resulting in a U.S. statutory federal rate of approximately 24.5% for our fiscal year ending September 30, 2018, and 21% for\nsubsequent fiscal years. Accordingly, we have to remeasure our deferred tax assets on net operating loss carryforward in the U.S. at the lower enacted\ncooperated tax rate of 21%. However, this re-measurement has no effect on the Company’s income tax expenses as the Company has provided a 100%\nvaluation allowance on its deferred tax assets previously.\nAdditionally, the Tax Act imposes a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of historical earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and future foreign earnings\nare subject to U.S. taxation. The change in rate has caused us to remeasure all U.S. deferred income tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences and\nnet operating loss (NOL) carryforwards and recorded a one-time income tax payable in 8 years.\nBritish Virgin Islands\nAbits Group Inc is incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. Under the current laws of the British Virgin Islands, Abits Group Inc is not subject to tax on\nincome or capital gains. In addition, upon payments of dividends by Abits Group Inc, no British Virgin Islands withholding tax is imposed.\nHong Kong\nAbit Hong Kong did not earn any income that was derived in Hong Kong since its incorporation and is therefore not to any Hong Kong profits tax.\nF-12\nABITS GROUP INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n6. Income taxes (continued)\nPRC\nEffective from January 1, 2008, the PRC’s statutory income tax rate is 25%. The Company’s PRC subsidiaries are subject to income tax rate of 25%, unless\notherwise specified.\nThe Company’s effective income tax rate was 0% for the period of six months to June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023.

After accounting for direct costs of revenue\namounting to $2.68 million, primarily electricity costs of $1.1 million and depreciation of $1.27 million, the gross profit from the mining operation was\n$0.75 million.\nThe loss before tax of the group was $0.14 million after accounting for administrative and general overheads.his result compares favorably with the\nprevious period when the loss was $3.5 million. Administrative and general overheads during the period almost doubled to 1.11 million compared to $0.7\nmillion as new staff were added to support production on a 24/7 basis as well as an increase on maintenance and insurance costs now that the data center\nwas fully operational.\nIn April, the Company further improved its water supply and since then, all production lines have been kept running. During the peak construction periods,\na 100,000-gallon reservoir helps to subsidize any shortages from the water company during the day and is replenished at night when consumption is much\nlower. The hydro cooling method introduced with the new batch of machines helps to reduce noise and dust instead of the traditional air cooling by fans.\nThere is no substantial change in the Balance Sheet of the Group except that more Ant-miner machines were purchased for $0.86 million and a piece of\nproperty in Wisconsin acquired for $0.65 million in the period to June. Cash and cash balances dwindled to $0.4 million as of June 30, 2024.\nWith the halving of mining rewards in late in April, production output will be much lower for the rest of 2024. However, the Company will maintain a strict\ncontrol of its costs and hopes to secure more hosting contracts to improve on its revenue.\nFor more information, please visit www.abitsgroup.com or email ir@abitgrp.com.\nABITS GROUP INC\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nAs of\nJune 30, 2024\nNote (Unaudited) December 31, 2023\nASSETS\nCurrent Assets\nCash and cash equivalents $ 396,583 $ 884,199\nOther receivables and prepayments 3 370,801 774,345\nTotal current assets 767,384 1,658,544\nDigital assets 4 1,546,184 1,194,157\nProperty, equipment and vehicles 5 9,888,446 9,465,567\nConstruction-in-progress - -\nTOTAL ASSETS 12,202,014 12,318,268\nLIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nOther payables and accruals $ 920,700 $ 1,005,608\nStockholders’ Equity\nPreferred stock, $0.001010 par value, authorized; 50,000,000 shares,\n5,000,000 shares issued and outstanding as of June 30, 2024 and\nDecember,31 2023 $ 5,050 $ 5,050\nCommon stock, $0.001 par value, authorized: 50,000,000 shares.

In July 2022, the Company divested its entire interest in Moxian (Hong Kong)\nLimited, or Moxian HK, with the result that it no longer has any substantial business operations in the PRC, other than certain administrative functions\nconducted by a wholly owned indirect subsidiary located in Beijing. To reflect that change, the Company changed its name to Abits Group Inc as it now\nsolely operates in the bitcoin mining industry, with principal operations in the United States through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Abit USA Inc.\nBecause of the Company’s past history in operating in China, it could be subject to investigative action by the Chinese authorities but as of the\ndate of this report, the Company has not received any formal notification of such action. Whilst the Company acknowledges that such risks exist at any\ntime, it also believes that repeating them in great depth serves no purpose and can preclude a proper reading of this report.\n1\nThe Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act\nOur ordinary shares may be prohibited from trading on a national exchange or “over-the-counter” markets under the HFCAA if the PCAOB is unable to\ninspect our auditors for two consecutive years. Pursuant to the HFCAA enacted in December 2020 and related legislation, if the SEC determines that a\ncompany has filed an audit report issued by a registered public accounting firm that has not been subject to inspection by the PCAOB for two consecutive\nyears, the SEC is required to prohibit such company’s securities from being traded on a national securities exchange or in the over the counter trading\nmarket in the U.S.\nPursuant to the HFCAA, the PCAOB issued a Determination Report on December 16, 2021, which found that the PCAOB was unable to inspect or\ninvestigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong. In addition, the PCAOB’s report identified the\nspecific registered public accounting firms which are subject to these determinations. In June 2022, we were conclusively identified by the SEC as a\nCommission-Identified Issuer under the HFCAA following the filing of our annual report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021,\nwhich contained the audit report issued by Centurion ZD CPA & Co. (“Centurion”), a registered public accounting firm headquartered in Hong Kong that\nthe PCAOB had determined it was previously unable to inspect or investigate completely because of a position taken by an authority in such jurisdiction.\nEffective June 30, 2022, we appointed Audit Alliance LLP (“Audit Alliance”) as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year\nending December 31, 2022 and accepted the resignation of Centurion, effective on the same date.\nOn August 26, 2022, the PCAOB signed a Statement of Protocol (SOP) Agreement with the CSRC and the MOF of the PRC regarding cooperation in the\noversight of PCAOB-registered public accounting firms in the PRC and Hong Kong to establish a method for the PCAOB to conduct inspections of\nPCAOB-registered public accounting firms in the PRC and Hong Kong, as contemplated by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. On December 15, 2022, the PCAOB\ndetermined that the PCAOB was able to secure complete access to inspect and investigate registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland\nChina and Hong Kong and vacated its previous 2021 adverse determinations. However, should the PCAOB fails to have complete access in the future, the\nPCAOB will consider the need to issue a new determination.\nOur current auditor, Audit Alliance LLP, is based in the Republic of Singapore and has been inspected by the PCAOB on a regular basis. Our auditor is not\namong the PCAOB-registered public accounting firms headquartered in the PRC or Hong Kong that are subject to PCAOB’s determination.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, in the future, if it is later determined that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate our auditor completely, or if there is\nany regulatory change or step taken by PRC regulators that does not permit our auditor to provide audit documentations to the PCAOB for inspection or\ninvestigation, our investors may be deprived of the benefits of such inspection. Any audit reports not issued by auditors that are completely inspected or\ninvestigated by the PCAOB, or a lack of PCAOB inspections of audit work undertaken in China that prevents the PCAOB from regularly evaluating our\nauditors’ audits and their quality control procedures, could result in a lack of assurance that our financial statements and disclosures are adequate and\naccurate, which could result in limitation or restriction to our access to the U.S. capital markets and trading of our securities, including trading on the\nnational exchange or “over-the-counter” markets, may be prohibited under the HFCAA.\nForeign Private Issuer\nAs an offshore holding company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, we are qualified as a “foreign private issuer” within the meaning of the rules\nunder the Exchange Act. As such, we are exempt from certain rules under the Exchange Act that are applicable to U.S. domestic issuers. Moreover, we are\nnot required to provide as many Exchange Act reports, or as frequently or as promptly, as U.S. domestic issuers. We are also not required to provide the\nsame level of disclosure on certain issues. In addition, as a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, we are permitted to adopt certain home\ncountry practices in relation to corporate governance matters that differ significantly from that applied to the U.S. domestic issuers under the Nasdaq listing\nrules. These exemptions and practices may afford less protection to our shareholders than they would enjoy if we were a U.S. domestic issuer.\nSelected Financial Data\nThe following table presents the selected consolidated financial information of our Company as of December 31, 2023, December 31, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021. The selected consolidated statements of operations data and the selected consolidated balance sheets data have been derived from our\naudited consolidated financial statements, of which that for the year ended December 31, 2023 and December 31. 2022 are included in this annual report.\nThese audited consolidated financial statements begin on F-1 and are prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted\nin the United States, or U.S. GAAP.

Risk Factors\nAn investment in our ordinary shares involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with\nall other information contained in this annual report, including the matters discussed under the headings “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Operating\nand Financial Review and Prospects” before you decide to invest in our ordinary shares. If any of the following risks, or any other risks and uncertainties\nthat are not presently foreseeable to us, actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and our future growth prospects\ncould be materially and adversely affected.\nSummary Of Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to a number of risks, including risks that may prevent us from achieving our business objectives or may adversely affect\nour business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects. These risks are discussed more fully below and include, but are not\nlimited to, risks related to:\nGeneral Risks\n● Failure to manage our liquidity and cash flows may materially and adversely affect our financial conditions and results of operations. As a result,\nwe may need additional capital, and financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\n● We have a history of operating losses, and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability; we have recently shifted our bitcoin mining\nbusiness, and we may not be successful in this business.\n● Our results of operation may fluctuate significantly and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business.\n● We may acquire other businesses, form joint ventures or acquire other companies or businesses that could negatively affect our operating results,\ndilute our stockholders’ ownership, increase our debt or cause us to incur significant expense; notwithstanding the foregoing, our growth may\ndepend on our success in uncovering and completing such transactions.\n● From time to time, we may evaluate and potentially consummate strategic investments or acquisitions, which could require significant\nmanagement attention, disrupt our business and adversely affect our financial results.\nRisks Related to Bitcoin Mining\n● Our results of operations are expected to vary with Bitcoin price volatility.\n● Our mining operating costs outpace our mining revenues, which could seriously harm our business or increase our losses.\n● We have an evolving business model which is subject to various uncertainties.\n● Regulatory changes or actions may alter the nature of an investment in us or restrict the use of cryptocurrencies in a manner that adversely affects\nour business, prospects or operations.\n● The development and acceptance of cryptographic and algorithmic protocols governing the issuance of and transactions in cryptocurrencies is\nsubject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate.\n● Banks and financial institutions may not provide banking services, or may cut off services, to businesses that engage in bitcoin-related activities or\nthat accept cryptocurrencies as payment, including financial institutions of investors in our securities.\n● We may face risks of Internet disruptions, which could have an adverse effect on the price of cryptocurrencies.\n● Acceptance and/or widespread use of bitcoin is uncertain.\n● The decentralized nature of bitcoin systems may lead to slow or inadequate responses to crises, which may negatively affect our business.\n● Our bitcoins may be subject to loss, theft or restriction on access.\n● There is a lack of liquid markets, and possible manipulation of blockchain/bitcoin-based assets.\n● Incorrect or fraudulent bitcoin transactions may be irreversible.\n● Our reliance primarily on a single model of miner may subject our operations to increased risk of mine failure.\n● Our future success will depend in large part upon the value of bitcoin; the value of bitcoin may be subject to pricing risk and has historically been\nsubject to wide swings.\n● Cryptocurrencies, including those maintained by or for us, may be exposed to cybersecurity threats and hacks.\n3\n● We are subject to risks associated with our need for significant electrical power. Government regulators may potentially restrict the ability of\nelectricity suppliers to provide electricity to mining operations, such as ours.\n● We may not adequately respond to price fluctuations and rapidly changing technology, which may negatively affect our business.\nRisks Involving Intellectual Property\n● Bitcoin and bitcoin mining operations rely on software and specialized technology.\n● We may not be able to prevent others from unauthorized use of our intellectual property, which could harm our business and competitive position.\n● We may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims, which may be expensive to defend and may disrupt our business and operations\n● Our platform and internal systems rely on software that is highly technical, and if it contains undetected errors, our business could be adversely\naffected.\nRisks Related to Our Ordinary Shares\n● Our ordinary shares may be thinly traded and you may be unable to sell at or near ask prices or at all if you need to sell your shares to raise money\nor otherwise desire to liquidate your shares.\n● We are not likely to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\n● You may face difficulties in protecting your interests as a shareholder, as the laws of British Virgin Islands provides substantially less protection\nwhen compared to the laws of the United States and it may be difficult for a shareholder of ours to effect service of process or to enforce\njudgements obtained in the United States courts.\n● Volatility in our ordinary shares price may subject us to securities litigation.\n● We may be unable to comply with the applicable continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, which may adversely impact our\naccess to capital markets and may cause us to default certain of our agreements\nGeneral Risks\nIf we are unable to successfully execute our bitcoin mining, it would adversely affect our financial and business condition and results of operations.\nAs of the date of this Report, the Company operates in one self-owned mining site in Duff, Tennessee. New mining sites are always being\nexplored but none has yet to be developed. This dependence on one site has its risks on local factors such as a power failure or adverse weather conditions.\nIf we cannot execute the bitcoin mining, it would seriously affect our financial and business condition and deepen the losses of the Company.\nFailure to manage our liquidity and cash flows may materially and adversely affect our financial conditions and results of operations. As a result, we\nmay need additional capital, and financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nThe Company is new to bitcoin mining and is operating in the United States for the first time. If we fail to manage our liquidity and cash flows, it\nwill seriously affect our financial condition and results of operations. We may need additional financing and such access may be limited or at unacceptable\nterms.\nWe have a history of operating losses, and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability; we have recently begun to conduct our bitcoin mining\noperations, and we may not be successful in this business.\nWe are not profitable and have incurred losses since our inception. We expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and these\nlosses could increase as we continue to work to develop our business. We were previously engaged in the business of mobile payments which we ceased\noperation in June 2018. Whilst we had continued with the digital advertising business, it later proved to be increasingly difficult because of restrictions on\nonline gaming by the PRC government, which was a key business of our then clients. Starting in March 2022, we diversified into the bitcoin mining\nbusiness and subsequently divested all of the equity in Moxian HK and the digital advertising business conducted by Moxian HK’s subsidiaries. Our\ncurrent operations and business strategy are new, are in an industry that is relatively itself new and evolving and are subject to the risks discussed below.\nEven if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods.\nOur results of operation may fluctuate significantly and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business.\nOur results of operations, including the levels of our net revenues, expenses, net loss and other key metrics, may vary significantly in the future\ndue to a variety of factors, some of which are outside of our control, and period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful,\nespecially given our limited operating history. Accordingly, the results for any one quarter are not necessarily an indication of future performance.\nFluctuations in quarterly results may adversely affect the market price of our ordinary shares. Factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly financial\nresults include:\n● the amount and timing of operating expenses related to our new business operations and infrastructure;\n● fluctuations in the price of bitcoin; and\n● general economic, industry and market conditions.\n4\nWe may acquire other businesses, form joint ventures or acquire other companies or businesses that could negatively affect our operating results, dilute\nour stockholders’ ownership, increase our debt or cause us to incur significant expense; notwithstanding the foregoing, our growth may depend on our\nsuccess in uncovering and completing such transactions.\nWe are actively seeking other business opportunities, however, we cannot offer any assurance that acquisitions of businesses, assets and/or\nentering into strategic alliances or joint ventures will be successful. We may not be able to find suitable partners or acquisition candidates and may not be\nable to complete such transactions on favorable terms, if at all. If we make any acquisitions, we may not be able to integrate these acquisitions successfully\ninto our existing infrastructure. In addition, in the event we acquire any existing businesses we could assume unknown or contingent liabilities.\nAny future acquisitions also could result in the issuance of stock, incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or future write-offs of intangible assets\nor goodwill, any of which could have a negative impact on our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. Integration of an acquired\ncompany may also disrupt ongoing operations and require management resources that otherwise would be focused on developing and expanding our\nexisting business. We may experience losses related to potential investments in other companies, which could harm our financial condition and results of\noperations. Further, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, strategic alliance or joint venture if such investments do not materialize.\nTo finance any acquisitions or joint ventures, we may choose to issue ordinary shares, preferred stock or a combination of debt and equity as\nconsideration, which could significantly dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders or provide rights to such preferred stock holders in priority over\nour common stock holders. Additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. If the price of our common stock is low or\nvolatile, we may not be able to acquire other companies or fund a joint venture project using stock as consideration.\nFrom time to time we may evaluate and potentially consummate strategic investments or acquisitions, which could require significant management\nattention, disrupt our business and adversely affect our financial results.\nWe may evaluate and consider strategic investments, combinations, acquisitions or alliances in both the bitcoin mining business. These\ntransactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations if consummated. If we are able to identify an appropriate business\nopportunity, we may not be able to successfully consummate the transaction and, even if we do consummate such a transaction, we may be unable to obtain\nthe benefits or avoid the difficulties and risks of such transaction.\nStrategic investments or acquisitions will involve risks commonly encountered in business relationships, including:\n● difficulties in assimilating and integrating the operations, personnel, systems, data, technologies, products and services of the acquired business;\n● inability of the acquired technologies, products or businesses to achieve expected levels of revenue, profitability, productivity or other benefits;\n● difficulties in retaining, training, motivating and integrating key personnel;\n● diversion of management’s time and resources from our normal daily operations;\n● difficulties in successfully incorporating licensed or acquired technology and rights into our businesses;\n● difficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies within the combined organizations;\n● difficulties in retaining relationships with customers, employees and suppliers of the acquired business;\n● risks of entering markets, including the U.S., in which we have limited or no prior experience;\n5\nWe may not make any investments or acquisitions, or any future investments or acquisitions may not be successful, may not benefit our business\nstrategy, may not generate sufficient revenues to offset the associated acquisition costs or may not otherwise result in the intended benefits. In addition, we\ncannot assure you that any future investment in or acquisition of new businesses or technology will lead to the successful development of new or enhanced\nloan products and services or that any new or enhanced loan products and services, if developed, will achieve market acceptance or prove to be profitable.\nOur loss of any of our management team, our inability to execute an effective succession plan, or our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel,\ncould adversely affect our business.\nOur success and future growth will depend to a significant degree on the skills and services of our management, including our Chief Executive\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer. We will need to continue to grow our management in order to alleviate pressure on our existing team and in order to\ncontinue to develop our business. If our management, including any new hires that we may make, fails to work together effectively and to execute our plans\nand strategies on a timely basis, our business could be harmed. Furthermore, if we fail to execute an effective contingency or succession plan with the loss\nof any member of management, the loss of such management personnel may significantly disrupt our business.\nThe loss of key members of management could inhibit our growth prospects. Our future success also depends in large part on our ability to attract,\nretain and motivate key management and operating personnel. As we continue to develop and expand our operations, we may require personnel with\ndifferent skills and experiences, and who have a sound understanding of our business and the bitcoin industry. The market for highly qualified personnel in\nthis industry is very competitive and we may be unable to attract such personnel. If we are unable to attract such personnel, our business could be harmed.\nWe incur significant costs and demands upon management and accounting and finance resources as a result of complying with the laws and\nregulations affecting public companies; if we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate and timely\nfinancial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, our ability to operate our business and our reputation.\nAs a public reporting company, we are required to, among other things, maintain a system of effective internal control over financial reporting.\nEnsuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on\na timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently. Substantial work will continue to be required to further\nimplement, document, assess, test and remediate our system of internal controls.\nIf our internal control over financial reporting is not effective, we may be unable to issue our financial statements in a timely manner, we may be\nunable to obtain the required audit or review of our financial statements by our independent registered public accounting firm in a timely manner or we\nmay be otherwise unable to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the SEC, our common stock listing on Nasdaq could be suspended or\nterminated and our stock price could materially suffer. In addition, we or members of our management could be subject to investigation and sanction by the\nSEC and other regulatory authorities and to stockholder lawsuits, which could impose significant additional costs on us and divert management attention.\nBecause cryptocurrencies may be determined to be investment securities, we may inadvertently violate the Investment Company Act and incur large\nlosses as a result and potentially be required to register as an investment company or terminate operations and we may incur third party liabilities.\nWe are engaged in the mining of bitcoins which the SEC said is currency and not securities. We therefore believe that we are not engaged in the\nbusiness of investing, reinvesting, or trading in securities, and we do not hold ourselves out as being engaged in those activities. However, under the\nInvestment Company Act a company may be deemed an investment company under section 3(a)(1)(C) thereof if the value of its investment securities is\nmore than 40% of its total assets (exclusive of government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis.\n6\nIf, as a result of our investments and our mining activities, including investments in which we do not have a controlling interest, the investment\nsecurities we hold could exceed 40% of our total assets, exclusive of cash items and, accordingly, we could determine that we have become an inadvertent\ninvestment company. The bitcoins we own, acquire or mine may be deemed an investment security by the SEC, although we do not believe any of the\ncryptocurrencies we own, acquire or mine are securities. An inadvertent investment company can avoid being classified as an investment company if it can\nrely on one of the exclusions under the Investment Company Act. One such exclusion, Rule 3a-2 under the Investment Company Act, allows an inadvertent\ninvestment company a grace period of one year from the earlier of (a) the date on which an issuer owns securities and/or cash having a value exceeding\n50% of the issuer’s total assets on either a consolidated or unconsolidated basis and (b) the date on which an issuer owns or proposes to acquire investment\nsecurities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of such issuer’s total assets (exclusive of government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated\nbasis. We may take actions to cause the investment securities held by us to be less than 40% of our total assets, which may include acquiring assets with our\ncash and bitcoin on hand or liquidating our investment securities or bitcoin or seeking a no-action letter from the SEC if we are unable to acquire sufficient\nassets or liquidate sufficient investment securities in a timely manner.\nAs the Rule 3a-2 exception is available to a company no more than once every three years, and assuming no other exclusion were available to us,\nwe would have to keep within the 40% limit for at least three years after we cease being an inadvertent investment company. This may limit our ability to\nmake certain investments or enter into joint ventures that could otherwise have a positive impact on our earnings. In any event, we do not intend to become\nan investment company engaged in the business of investing and trading securities.\nClassification as an investment company under the Investment Company Act requires registration with the SEC. If an investment company fails to\nregister, it would have to stop doing almost all business, and its contracts would become voidable. Registration is time consuming and restrictive and would\nrequire a restructuring of our operations, and we would be very constrained in the kind of business we could do as a registered investment company.\nFurther, we would become subject to substantial regulation concerning management, operations, transactions with affiliated persons and portfolio\ncomposition, and would need to file reports under the Investment Company Act regime. The cost of such compliance would result in the Company\nincurring substantial additional expenses, and the failure to register if required would have a materially adverse impact to conduct our operations.\nWe face risks similar to that of the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, which could significantly disrupt our operations and financial results.\nAlthough the outbreak of the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) appears to be over, we believe that our results of operations, business and financial\ncondition could be adversely impacted by the effects of any outbreak of any severe virus affecting public health.\nThe continued spread of the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) or the occurrence of other epidemics and the imposition of public health measures\nand travel and business restrictions will adversely affect impact our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. In addition, we have\nexperienced and will experience disruptions to our business operations resulting from quarantines, self-isolations, or other movement and restrictions on the\nability of our employees to perform their jobs. If we are unable to effectively service our miners, our ability to mine bitcoin will be adversely affected as\nminers go offline, which would have an adverse effect on our business and the results of our operations.\n7\nIf we cannot maintain our corporate culture as we grow, we could lose the innovation, collaboration and focus that contribute to our business.\nWe believe that a critical component of our success is our corporate culture, which we believe fosters innovation, encourages teamwork and\ncultivates creativity. As we develop the infrastructure of a public company and continue to grow, we may find it difficult to maintain these valuable aspects\nof our corporate culture. Any failure to preserve our culture could negatively impact our future success, including our ability to attract and retain\nemployees, encourage innovation and teamwork and effectively focus on and pursue our corporate objectives.\nIf the PRC government determines that the historical contractual arrangements with the former PRC subsidiaries structure did not comply with PRC\nregulation, or if these regulations change or are interpreted differently in the future, our shares may decline in value or become worthless if we are\ndeemed to be unable to assert our contractual control rights over the assets of the former subsidiaries.\nIn order to streamline our corporate structure and considering the changing regulatory environment, we had completed the divestment of Moxian\nHK and its PRC subsidiaries to Jiantao Liu, a resident of China for a cash consideration of HKD 1,000. Accordingly, all contractual arrangements involving\nthe PRC subsidiaries were effectively terminated.\nAlthough we completed the divestment in July 2022, the PRC government could find any one of our previous agreements non-compliant with\nrelevant PRC laws, regulations, and rules, or if these laws, regulations, and rules or the interpretation thereof change in the future, and such changes may be\nretroactively applied to our historical contractual arrangements, we could be subject to severe penalties and require a potential restatement of our financial\nstatements included elsewhere in this annual report. As a result, our shares may decline in value or become worthless.\nThere remain substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current and future PRC laws, regulations, and rules which may\nbe relevant to our former PRC subsidiaries’ and our former operations in China, including potential future actions by the PRC government which may\nretroactively affect the enforceability and legality of our historical operations involving the former PRC subsidiaries.\nAlthough we divested all of the equity in Moxian HK and its PRC subsidiaries in July 2022 and we no longer have substantial operations in China,\nwe may be subject to potential future actions by the PRC government which may retroactively affect the enforceability and legality of our historical\noperations involving the former PRC subsidiaries. If the PRC government finds such agreements non-compliant with relevant PRC laws, regulations, and\nrules, or if these laws, regulations, and rules or the interpretation thereof change in the future, and such changes may be retroactively applied to our\nhistorical contractual arrangements, we could be subject to severe penalties. As such, the following former risk factors of doing business in China may still\napply:\n● Changes in China’s economic, political or social conditions or government policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and\nresults of operations.\n● Uncertainties in the interpretation and enforcement of Chinese laws and regulations could limit the legal protections available to us.\n● The PRC government may intervene or influence our operations at any time, or may exert more control over offerings conducted overseas and/or\nforeign investment in China-based issuers, which could result in a material change in our operations and/or cause the value of our securities to\nsignificantly decline or be worthless.\n● PRC regulations establish complex procedures for some acquisitions conducted by foreign investors, which could make it more difficult for us to\npursue growth through acquisitions in China.\n● The PCAOB is currently unable to inspect our auditor in relation to their audit work performed for our financial statements and the inability of the\nPCAOB to conduct inspections or investigation completely over our auditor deprives our investors with the benefits of such inspections.\n● Our ordinary shares will be prohibited from trading in the United States under the HFCAA in 2024 if the PCAOB is unable to inspect or fully\ninvestigate auditors located in China, or as early as 2023 if proposed changes to the law are enacted. The delisting of our ordinary shares, or the\nthreat of their being delisted, may materially and adversely affect the value of your investment.\n● PRC regulations relating to the establishment of offshore special purpose companies by PRC residents may limit our ability to inject capital into\nour PRC subsidiaries, limit our subsidiaries’ ability to increase their registered capital or distribute profits to us, or may otherwise adversely affect\nus\n● PRC regulation of loans to and direct investment in PRC entities by offshore holding companies and governmental control of currency conversion\nmay delay or prevent us from using offshore funds to make loans to our PRC subsidiaries, or to make additional capital contributions to our PRC\nsubsidiaries.\n● Regulatory bodies of the United States may be limited in their ability to conduct investigations or inspections of our operations in China.\n● Enhanced scrutiny over acquisition transactions by the PRC tax authorities may have a negative impact on potential acquisitions we may pursue in\nthe future.\n● Fluctuations in exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the value of your investment.\n8\nRisks related to Bitcoin Mining\nOur results of operations are expected to vary with Bitcoin price volatility\nThe price of Bitcoin has experienced significant fluctuations over its relatively short existence and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the\nfuture.\nWe expect our results of operations to continue to be affected by the Bitcoin price as most of the revenue is from bitcoin mining production as of\nthe filing date. Any future significant reductions in the price of Bitcoin will likely have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations and\nfinancial condition. We cannot assure you that the Bitcoin price will remain high enough to sustain our operation or that the Bitcoin price will not decline\nsignificantly in the future.\nVarious factors, mostly beyond our control, could impact the Bitcoin price. For example, the usage of Bitcoins in the retail and commercial\nmarketplace is relatively low in comparison with the usage for speculation, which contributes to Bitcoin price volatility. Additionally, the reward for\nBitcoin mining will decline over time, with the most recent halving event occurred in May 2020 and next one four years later, which may further contribute\nto Bitcoin price volatility.\nOur mining operating costs outpace our mining revenues, which could seriously harm our business or increase our losses.\nOur mining operations are costly and our expenses may increase in the future. We intend to use funds on hand from our private placement to\ncontinue to purchase bitcoin mining machines. This expense increase may not be offset by a corresponding increase in revenue. Our expenses may be\ngreater than we anticipate, and our investments to make our business more efficient may not succeed and may outpace monetization efforts. Increases in\nour costs without a corresponding increase in our revenue would increase our losses and could seriously harm our business and financial perform\nWe have an evolving business model which is subject to various uncertainties.\nAs bitcoin assets may become more widely available, we expect the services and products associated with them to evolve. In order to stay current\nwith the industry, our business model may need to evolve as well. From time to time, we may modify aspects of our business model relating to our strategy.\nWe cannot offer any assurance that these or any other modifications will be successful or will not result in harm to our business. We may not be able to\nmanage growth effectively, which could damage our reputation, limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results. Further, we cannot provide any\nassurance that we will successfully identify all emerging trends and growth opportunities in this business sector and we may lose out on those\nopportunities. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations.\nRegulatory changes or actions may alter the nature of an investment in us or restrict the use of cryptocurrencies in a manner that adversely affects our\nbusiness, prospects or operations.\nAs cryptocurrencies have grown in both popularity and market size, governments around the world have reacted differently to cryptocurrencies;\ncertain governments have deemed them illegal, and others have allowed their use and trade without restriction, while in some jurisdictions, such as in the\nU.S., subject to extensive, and in some cases overlapping, unclear and evolving regulatory requirements. Ongoing and future regulatory actions may impact\nour ability to continue to operate, and such actions could affect our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations.\nThe development and acceptance of cryptographic and algorithmic protocols governing the issuance of and transactions in cryptocurrencies is subject\nto a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate.\nThe use of cryptocurrencies to, among other things, buy and sell goods and services and complete transactions, is part of a new and rapidly\nevolving industry that employs bitcoin assets based upon a computer-generated mathematical and/or cryptographic protocol. Large-scale acceptance of\ncryptocurrencies as a means of payment has not, and may never, occur. The growth of this industry in general, and the use of bitcoin, in particular, is\nsubject to a high degree of uncertainty, and the slowing or stopping of the development or acceptance of developing protocols may occur unpredictably.\nThe factors include, but are not limited to:\n● continued worldwide growth in the adoption and use of cryptocurrencies as a medium to exchange;\n● governmental and quasi-governmental regulation of cryptocurrencies and their use, or restrictions on or regulation of access to and operation of\nthe network or similar bitcoin systems;\n● changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences;\n● the maintenance and development of the open-source software protocol of the network;\n9\n● the increased consolidation of contributors to the bitcoin blockchain through mining pools;\n● the availability and popularity of other forms or methods of buying and selling goods and services, including new means of using fiat currencies;\n● the use of the networks supporting cryptocurrencies for developing smart contracts and distributed applications;\n● general economic conditions and the regulatory environment relating to cryptocurrencies; and\n● negative consumer sentiment and perception of bitcoin specifically and cryptocurrencies generally.\nThe outcome of these factors could have negative effects on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our business strategy at all,\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations as well as potentially negative effect on the value of any bitcoin or\nother cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account, which would harm investors in our securities.\nBanks and financial institutions may not provide banking services, or may cut off services, to businesses that engage in bitcoin-related activities or that\naccept cryptocurrencies as payment, including financial institutions of investors in our securities.\nA number of companies that engage in bitcoin and/or other bitcoin-related activities have been unable to find banks or financial institutions that\nare willing to provide them with bank accounts and other services. Similarly, a number of companies and individuals or businesses associated with\ncryptocurrencies may have had and may continue to have their existing bank accounts closed or services discontinued with financial institutions in response\nto government action, particularly in China, where regulatory response to cryptocurrencies has been to exclude their use for ordinary consumer transactions\nwithin China. We also may be unable to obtain or maintain these services for our business. The difficulty that many businesses that provide bitcoin and/or\nderivatives on other bitcoin-related activities have and may continue to have in finding banks and financial institutions willing to provide them services\nmay be decreasing the usefulness of cryptocurrencies as a payment system and harming public perception of cryptocurrencies, and could decrease their\nusefulness and harm their public perception in the future.\nThe usefulness of cryptocurrencies as a payment system and the public perception of cryptocurrencies could be damaged if banks or financial\ninstitutions were to close the accounts of businesses engaging in bitcoin and/or other bitcoin-related activities. This could occur as a result of compliance\nrisk, cost, government regulation or public pressure. The risk applies to securities firms, clearance and settlement firms, national stock and derivatives on\ncommodities exchanges, the over-the-counter market, and the Depository Trust Company, which, if any of such entities adopts or implements similar\npolicies, rules or regulations, could negatively affect our relationships with financial institutions and impede our ability to convert cryptocurrencies to fiat\ncurrencies. Such factors could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and harm investors.\nWe may face risks of Internet disruptions, which could have an adverse effect on the price of cryptocurrencies.\nA disruption of the Internet may affect the use of cryptocurrencies and subsequently the value of our securities. Generally, cryptocurrencies and\nour business of mining cryptocurrencies is dependent upon the Internet. A significant disruption in Internet connectivity could disrupt a currency’s network\noperations until the disruption is resolved and have an adverse effect on the price of cryptocurrencies and our ability to mine cryptocurrencies.\n10\nThe impact of geopolitical and economic events on the supply and demand for cryptocurrencies is uncertain.\nGeopolitical crises may motivate large-scale purchases of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which could increase the price of bitcoin and other\ncryptocurrencies rapidly. This may increase the likelihood of a subsequent price decrease as crisis-driven purchasing behavior dissipates, adversely\naffecting the value of our inventory following such downward adjustment. Such risks are similar to the risks of purchasing commodities in general\nuncertain times, such as the risk of purchasing, holding or selling gold. Alternatively, as an emerging asset class with limited acceptance as a payment\nsystem or commodity, global crises and general economic downturn may discourage investment in cryptocurrencies as investors focus their investment on\nless volatile asset classes as a means of hedging their investment risk.\nAs an alternative to fiat currencies that are backed by central governments, cryptocurrencies, which are relatively new, are subject to supply and\ndemand forces. How such supply and demand will be impacted by geopolitical events is largely uncertain but could be harmful to us and investors in our\ncommon stock. Political or economic crises may motivate large-scale acquisitions or sales of cryptocurrencies either globally or locally. Such events could\nhave a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect\non our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or any other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our\nown account.\nAcceptance and/or widespread use of bitcoin is uncertain.\nCurrently, there is a relatively limited use of any bitcoin in the retail and commercial marketplace, thus contributing to price volatility that could\nadversely affect an investment in our securities. Banks and other established financial institutions may refuse to process funds for bitcoin transactions,\nprocess wire transfers to or from bitcoin exchanges, bitcoin-related companies or service providers, or maintain accounts for persons or entities transacting\nin bitcoin. Conversely, a significant portion of bitcoin demand is generated by investors seeking a long-term store of value or speculators seeking to profit\nfrom the short- or long-term holding of the asset. Price volatility undermines any bitcoin’s role as a medium of exchange, as retailers are much less likely to\naccept it as a form of payment. Market capitalization for a bitcoin as a medium of exchange and payment method may always be low.\nThe relative lack of acceptance of bitcoins in the retail and commercial marketplace, or a reduction of such use, limits the ability of end users to\nuse them to pay for goods and services. Such lack of acceptance or decline in acceptances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as\na going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the\nvalue of bitcoins we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account.\nTransactional fees may decrease demand for bitcoin and prevent expansion.\nAs the number of bitcoins currency rewards awarded for solving a block in a blockchain decreases, the incentive for miners to continue to\ncontribute to the bitcoin network may transition from a set reward to transaction fees. In order to incentivize miners to continue to contribute to the bitcoin\nnetwork, the bitcoin network may either formally or informally transition from a set reward to transaction fees earned upon solving a block. This transition\ncould be accomplished by miners independently electing to record in the blocks they solve only those transactions that include payment of a transaction fee.\nIf transaction fees paid for bitcoin transactions become too high, the marketplace may be reluctant to accept bitcoin as a means of payment and existing\nusers may be motivated to switch from bitcoin to another bitcoin or to fiat currency. Either the requirement from miners of higher transaction fees in\nexchange for recording transactions in a blockchain or a software upgrade that automatically charges fees for all transactions may decrease demand for\nbitcoin and prevent the expansion of the bitcoin network to retail merchants and commercial businesses, resulting in a reduction in the price of bitcoin that\ncould adversely impact an investment in our securities. Decreased use and demand for bitcoin may adversely affect its value and result in a reduction in the\nprice of bitcoin and the value of our common stock.\n11\nThe decentralized nature of bitcoin systems may lead to slow or inadequate responses to crises, which may negatively affect our business.\nThe decentralized nature of the governance of bitcoin systems may lead to ineffective decision making that slows development or prevents a\nnetwork from overcoming emergent obstacles. Governance of many bitcoin systems is by voluntary consensus and open competition with no clear\nleadership structure or authority. To the extent lack of clarity in corporate governance of bitcoin systems leads to ineffective decision making that slows\ndevelopment and growth of such cryptocurrencies, the value of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nIt may be illegal now, or in the future, to acquire, own, hold, sell or use bitcoin, ether, or other cryptocurrencies, participate in blockchains or utilize\nsimilar bitcoin assets in one or more countries, the ruling of which would adversely affect us.\nAlthough currently cryptocurrencies generally are not regulated or are lightly regulated in most countries, one or more countries such as China and\nRussia, which have taken harsh regulatory action, may take regulatory actions in the future that could severely restrict the right to acquire, own, hold, sell\nor use these bitcoin assets or to exchange for fiat currency. In many nations, particularly in China and Russia, it is illegal to accept payment in bitcoin and\nother cryptocurrencies for consumer transactions and banking institutions are barred from accepting deposits of cryptocurrencies. Such restrictions may\nadversely affect us as the large-scale use of cryptocurrencies as a means of exchange is presently confined to certain regions globally. Such circumstances\ncould have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for\nour own account, and harm investors.\nThere is a lack of liquid markets, and possible manipulation of blockchain/bitcoin-based assets.\nCryptocurrencies that are represented and trade on a ledger-based platform may not necessarily benefit from viable trading markets. Stock\nexchanges have listing requirements and vet issuers; requiring them to be subjected to rigorous listing standards and rules, and monitor investors\ntransacting on such platform for fraud and other improprieties. These conditions may not necessarily be replicated on a distributed ledger platform,\ndepending on the platform’s controls and other policies. The laxer a distributed ledger platform is about vetting issuers of bitcoin assets or users that\ntransact on the platform, the higher the potential risk for fraud or the manipulation of the ledger due to a control event. These factors may decrease liquidity\nor volume or may otherwise increase volatility of investment securities or other assets trading on a ledger-based system, which may adversely affect us.\nSuch circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have\na material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise\nacquire or hold for our own account, and harm investors.\nOur operations, investment strategies and profitability may be adversely affected by competition from other methods of investing in cryptocurrencies.\nWe compete with other users and/or companies that are mining cryptocurrencies and other potential financial vehicles, including securities backed\nby or linked to cryptocurrencies through entities similar to us. Market and financial conditions, and other conditions beyond our control, may make it more\nattractive to invest in other financial vehicles, or to invest in cryptocurrencies directly, which could limit the market for our shares and reduce their\nliquidity. The emergence of other financial vehicles and exchange-traded funds have been scrutinized by regulators and such scrutiny and the negative\nimpressions or conclusions resulting from such scrutiny could be applicable to us and impact our ability to successfully pursue our new strategy or operate\nat all, or to establish or maintain a public market for our securities. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a\ngoing concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the\nvalue of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account, and harm investors.\nThe development and acceptance of competing blockchain platforms or technologies may cause consumers to use alternative distributed ledgers or\nother alternatives.\nThe development and acceptance of competing blockchain platforms or technologies may cause consumers to use alternative distributed ledgers or\nan alternative to distributed ledgers altogether. Our business utilizes presently existent digital ledgers and blockchains and we could face difficulty adapting\nto emergent digital ledgers, blockchains, or alternatives thereto. This may adversely affect us and our exposure to various blockchain technologies and\nprevent us from realizing the anticipated profits from our investments. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as\na going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the\nvalue of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account, and harm investors.\n12\nOur bitcoins may be subject to loss, theft or restriction on access.\nThere is a risk that some or all of our bitcoins could be lost or stolen. Cryptocurrencies are stored in bitcoin sites commonly referred to as\n“wallets” by holders of bitcoins which may be accessed to exchange a holder’s bitcoin assets. Access to our bitcoin assets could also be restricted by\ncybercrime (such as a denial of service attack) against a service at which we maintain a hosted hot wallet. A hot wallet refers to any bitcoin wallet that is\nconnected to the Internet. Generally, hot wallets are easier to set up and access than wallets in cold storage, but they are also more susceptible to hackers\nand other technical vulnerabilities. Cold storage refers to any bitcoin wallet that is not connected to the Internet. Cold storage is generally more secure than\nhot storage, but is not ideal for quick or regular transactions and we may experience lag time in our ability to respond to market fluctuations in the price of\nour bitcoin assets. We hold all of our cryptocurrencies in cold storage to reduce the risk of malfeasance, but the risk of loss of our bitcoin assets cannot be\nwholly eliminated.\nHackers or malicious actors may launch attacks to steal, compromise or secure cryptocurrencies, such as by attacking the bitcoin network source\ncode, exchange miners, third-party platforms, cold and hot storage locations or software, or by other means. We may be in control and possession of one of\nthe more substantial holdings of bitcoins. As we increase in size, we may become a more appealing target of hackers, malware, cyber-attacks or other\nsecurity threats. Any of these events may adversely affect our operations and, consequently, our investments and profitability. The loss or destruction of a\nprivate key required to access our digital wallets may be irreversible and we may be denied access for all time to our bitcoin holdings or the holdings of\nothers held in those compromised wallets. Our loss of access to our private keys or our experience of a data loss relating to our digital wallets could\nadversely affect our investments and assets.\nCryptocurrencies are controllable only by the possessor of both the unique public and private keys relating to the local or online digital wallet in\nwhich they are held, which wallet’s public key or address is reflected in the network’s public blockchain. We will publish the public key relating to digital\nwallets in use when we verify the receipt of transfers and disseminate such information into the network, but we will need to safeguard the private keys\nrelating to such digital wallets. To the extent such private keys are lost, destroyed or otherwise compromised, we will be unable to access our bitcoin\nrewards and such private keys may not be capable of being restored by any network. Any loss of private keys relating to digital wallets used to store our\ncryptocurrencies could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise\nacquire or hold for our own account.\nRisks due to hacking or adverse software event.\nIn order to minimize risk, we have established processes to manage wallets that are associated with our bitcoin holdings. There can be no\nassurances that any processes we have adopted or will adopt in the future are or will be secure or effective, and we would suffer significant and immediate\nadverse effects if we suffered a loss of our bitcoin due to an adverse software or cybersecurity event. We utilize several layers of threat reduction\ntechniques, including: (i) the use of hardware wallets to store sensitive private key information; (ii) performance of transactions offline; and (iii) offline\ngeneration storage and use of private keys.\nAt present, the Company is evaluating several third-party custodial wallet alternatives, but there can be no assurance that such services will be\nmore secure than those the Company presently employs. Human error and the constantly evolving state of cybercrime and hacking techniques may render\npresent security protocols and procedures ineffective in ways which we cannot predict. If our security procedures and protocols are ineffectual and our\nbitcoin assets are compromised by cybercriminals, we may not have adequate recourse to recover our losses stemming from such compromise and we may\nlose much of the accumulated value of our bitcoin mining activities. This would have a negative impact on our business and operations.\n13\nIncorrect or fraudulent bitcoin transactions may be irreversible.\nBitcoin transactions are irrevocable and stolen or incorrectly transferred cryptocurrencies may be irretrievable. As a result, any incorrectly\nexecuted or fraudulent bitcoin transactions could adversely affect our investments and assets.\nBitcoin transactions are not, from an administrative perspective, reversible without the consent and active participation of the recipient of the\ncryptocurrencies from the transaction. In theory, bitcoin transactions may be reversible with the control or consent of a majority of processing power on the\nnetwork, however, we do not now, nor is it feasible that we could in the future, possess sufficient processing power to effect this reversal. Once a\ntransaction has been verified and recorded in a block that is added to a blockchain, an incorrect transfer of a bitcoin or a theft thereof generally will not be\nreversible and we may not have sufficient recourse to recover our losses from any such transfer or theft. It is possible that, through computer or human\nerror, or through theft or criminal action, our bitcoin rewards could be transferred in incorrect amounts or to unauthorized third parties, or to uncontrolled\naccounts. Further, according to the SEC, at this time, there is no specifically enumerated U.S. or foreign governmental, regulatory, investigative or\nprosecutorial authority or mechanism through which to bring an action or complaint regarding missing or stolen bitcoin. We are, therefore, presently reliant\non existing private investigative entities, such as Chain analysis and Kroll to investigate any potential loss of our bitcoin assets. These third-party service\nproviders rely on data analysis and compliance of ISPs with traditional court orders to reveal information such as the IP addresses of any attackers who\nmay have target us. To the extent that we are unable to recover our losses from such action, error or theft, such events could have a material adverse effect\non our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or\noperations of and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account.\nOur interactions with a blockchain may expose us to SDN or blocked persons or cause us to violate provisions of law that did not contemplate distribute\nledger technology.\nThe Office of Financial Assets Control of the US Department of Treasury requires us to comply with its sanction program and not conduct\nbusiness with persons named on its specially designated nationals (“SDN”) list. However, because of the pseudonymous nature of blockchain transactions\nwe may inadvertently and without our knowledge engage in transactions with persons named on OFAC’s SDN list. Our Company’s policy prohibits any\ntransactions with such SDN individuals, but we may not be adequately capable of determining the ultimate identity of the individual with whom we\ntransact with respect to selling bitcoin assets. Moreover, federal law prohibits any US person from knowingly or unknowingly possessing any visual\ndepiction commonly known as child pornography. Recent media reports have suggested that persons have imbedded such depictions on one or more\nblockchains. Because our business requires us to download and retain one or more blockchains to effectuate our ongoing business, it is possible that such\ndigital ledgers contain prohibited depictions without our knowledge or consent. To the extent government enforcement authorities literally enforce these\nand other laws and regulations that are impacted by decentralized distributed ledger technology, we may be subject to investigation, administrative or court\nproceedings, and civil or criminal monetary fines and penalties, all of which could harm our reputation and affect the value of our common stock.\nCryptocurrencies face significant scaling obstacles that can lead to high fees or slow transaction settlement times.\nCryptocurrencies face significant scaling obstacles that can lead to high fees or slow transaction settlement times, and attempts to increase the\nvolume of transactions may not be effective. Scaling cryptocurrencies is essential to the widespread acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a means of payment,\nwhich widespread acceptance is necessary to the continued growth and development of our business. Many bitcoin networks face significant scaling\nchallenges. For example, cryptocurrencies are limited with respect to how many transactions can occur per second. Participants in the bitcoin ecosystem\ndebate potential approaches to increasing the average number of transactions per second that the network can handle and have implemented mechanisms or\nare researching ways to increase scale, such as increasing the allowable sizes of blocks, and therefore the number of transactions per block, and sharding (a\nhorizontal partition of data in a database or search engine), which would not require every single transaction to be included in every single miner’s or\nvalidator’s block. However, there is no guarantee that any of the mechanisms in place or being explored for increasing the scale of settlement of bitcoin\ntransactions will be effective, or how long they will take to become effective, which could adversely affect an investment in our securities.\n14\nThe price of cryptocurrencies may be affected by the sale of such cryptocurrencies by other vehicles investing in cryptocurrencies or tracking bitcoin\nmarkets.\nThe global market for bitcoin is characterized by supply constraints that differ from those present in the markets for commodities or other assets\nsuch as gold and silver. The mathematical protocols under which certain cryptocurrencies are mined permit the creation of a limited, predetermined amount\nof currency, while others have no limit established on total supply. To the extent that other vehicles investing in cryptocurrencies or tracking bitcoin\nmarkets form and come to represent a significant proportion of the demand for cryptocurrencies, large redemptions of the securities of those vehicles and\nthe subsequent sale of cryptocurrencies by such vehicles could negatively affect bitcoin prices and therefore affect the value of the bitcoin inventory we\nhold. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise\nacquire or hold for our own account.\nBecause there has been limited precedent set for financial accounting of bitcoin and other bitcoin assets, the determination that we have made for how\nto account for bitcoin assets transactions may be subject to change.\nBecause there has been limited precedent set for the financial accounting of cryptocurrencies and related revenue recognition and no official\nguidance has yet been provided by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or the SEC, it is unclear how companies may in the future be required to\naccount for bitcoin transactions and assets and related revenue recognition. A change in regulatory or financial accounting standards could result in the\nnecessity to change our accounting methods and restate our financial statements. Such a restatement could adversely affect the accounting for our newly\nmined bitcoin rewards and more generally negatively impact our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operation. Such circumstances\nwould have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which would have a material adverse\neffect on our business, prospects or operations as well as and potentially the value of any cryptocurrencies we hold or expects to acquire for our own\naccount and harm investors.\nThere are risks related to technological obsolescence, the vulnerability of the global supply chain for bitcoin hardware disruption, and difficulty in\nobtaining new hardware which may have a negative effect on our business.\nOur mining operations can only be successful and ultimately profitable if the costs, including hardware and electricity costs, associated with\nmining cryptocurrencies are lower than the price of a bitcoin. As our mining facility operates, our miners experience ordinary wear and tear, and may also\nface more significant malfunctions caused by a number of extraneous factors beyond our control. The degradation of our miners will require us to, over\ntime, replace those miners which are no longer functional. Additionally, as the technology evolves, we may be required to acquire newer models of miners\nto remain competitive in the market. Reports have been released which indicate that miner manufacturer or seller adjusts the prices of its miners according\nto bitcoin prices, so the cost of new machines is unpredictable but could be extremely high. As a result, at times, we may obtain miners and other hardware\nfrom third parties at premium prices, to the extent they are available. This upgrading process requires substantial capital investment, and we may face\nchallenges. Further, the global supply chain for bitcoin miners is presently heavily dependent on China, which has been severely affected by the emergence\nof the COVID-19 coronavirus global pandemic. The global reliance on China as a main supplier of bitcoin miners has been called into question in the wake\nof the COVID-19 pandemic. Should similar outbreaks or other disruptions to the China-based global supply chain for bitcoin hardware occur, we may not\nbe able to obtain adequate replacement parts for our existing miners or to obtain additional miners from the manufacturer on a timely basis. Such events\ncould have a material adverse effect on our ability to pursue our new strategy, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and the value of\nour ordinary shares.\n15\nOur reliance primarily on a single model of miner may subject our operations to increased risk of mine failure.\nThe performance and reliability of our miners and our technology is critical to our reputation and our operations. Because we currently only use\nMicroBT miners, if there are issues with those machines, our entire system could be affected. Any system error or failure may significantly delay response\ntimes or even cause our system to fail. Any disruption in our ability to continue mining could result in lower yields and harm our reputation and business.\nAny exploitable weakness, flaw, or error common to MicroBT miners affects all our miners, if a defect other flaw is exploited, our entire mine could go\noffline simultaneously. Any interruption, delay or system failure could result in financial losses, a decrease in the trading price of our common stock and\ndamage to our reputation.\nThe Company’s reliance on a third-party mining pool service provider for our mining revenue payouts may have a negative impact on the Company\noperations.\nWe use third–party mining pools to receive our mining rewards from the network. Mining pools allow miners to combine their processing power,\nincreasing their chances of solving a block and getting paid by the network. The rewards are distributed by the pool operator, proportionally to our\ncontribution to the pool’s overall mining power, used to generate each block. Should the pool operator’s system suffer downtime due to a cyber-attack,\nsoftware malfunction or other similar issues, it will negatively impact our ability to mine and receive revenue. Furthermore, we are dependent on the\naccuracy of the mining pool operator’s record keeping to accurately record the total processing power provided to the pool for a given bitcoin mining\napplication in order to assess the proportion of that total processing power we provided. While we have internal methods of tracking both our power\nprovided and the total used by the pool, the mining pool operator uses its own record-keeping to determine our proportion of a given reward. We have little\nmeans of recourse against the mining pool operator if we determine the proportion of the reward paid out to us by the mining pool operator is incorrect,\nother than leaving the pool. If we are unable to consistently obtain accurate proportionate rewards from our mining pool operators, we may experience\nreduced reward for our efforts, which would have an adverse effect on our business and operations.\nThe bitcoin for which we mine, bitcoin, is subject to halving; the bitcoin reward for successfully uncovering a block will halve several times in the\nfuture and their value may not adjust to compensate us for the reduction in the rewards we receive from our mining efforts.\nHalving is a process designed to control the overall supply and reduce the risk of inflation in cryptocurrencies using a Proof-of-Work consensus\nalgorithm. At a predetermined block, the mining reward is cut in half, hence the term “halving.” For bitcoin, the reward was initially set at 50 bitcoin\ncurrency rewards per block and this was cut in half to 25 in November 28, 2012 at block 210,000 and again to 12.5 on July 9, 2016 at block 420,000 and in\nMay 2020 at block 630,000 when the reward reduced to 6.25. This was further halved to 3.125 in April 2024. The process will reoccur until the total\namount of bitcoin currency rewards issued reaches 21 million, which is expected around 2140. While bitcoin prices have had a history of price fluctuations\naround the halving of its bitcoin rewards, there is no guarantee that the price change will be favorable or would compensate for the reduction in mining\nreward. If a corresponding and proportionate increase in the trading price of bitcoin does not follow these anticipated halving events, the revenue we earn\nfrom our mining operations would see a corresponding decrease, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\n16\nOur future success will depend in large part upon the value of bitcoin; the value of bitcoin may be subject to pricing risk and has historically been\nsubject to wide swings.\nOur operating results will depend in large part upon the value of bitcoin because it’s the primary bitcoin we currently mine. Specifically, our\nrevenues from our bitcoin mining operations are based upon two factors: (1) the number of bitcoin rewards we successfully mine and (2) the value of\nbitcoin. In addition, our operating results are directly impacted by changes in the value of bitcoin, because under the value measurement model, both\nrealized and unrealized changes will be reflected in our statement of operations (i.e., we will be marking bitcoin to fair value each quarter). This means that\nour operating results will be subject to swings based upon increases or decreases in the value of bitcoin. Furthermore, our strategy focuses almost entirely\non bitcoin (as opposed to other cryptocurrencies). Further, our current application-specific integrated circuit (“ASIC”) machines (which we refer to as\n“miners”) are principally utilized for mining bitcoin and bitcoin cash and cannot mine other cryptocurrencies, such as ether, that are not mined utilizing the\n“SHA-256 algorithm.” If other cryptocurrencies were to achieve acceptance at the expense of bitcoin or bitcoin cash causing the value of bitcoin or bitcoin\ncash to decline, or if bitcoin were to switch its proof of work algorithm from SHA-256 to another algorithm for which our miners are not specialized, or the\nvalue of bitcoin or bitcoin cash were to decline for other reasons, particularly if such decline were significant or over an extended period of time, our\noperating results would be adversely affected, and there could be a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our\nnew strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations, and harm investors.\nBitcoin and other bitcoin market prices, which have historically been volatile and are impacted by a variety of factors (including those discussed\nbelow), are determined primarily using data from various exchanges, over-the-counter markets and derivative platforms. Furthermore, such prices may be\nsubject to factors such as those that impact commodities, more so than business activities, which could be subjected to additional influence from fraudulent\nor illegitimate actors, real or perceived scarcity, and political, economic, regulatory or other conditions. Pricing may be the result of, and may continue to\nresult in, speculation regarding future appreciation in the value of cryptocurrencies, or our share price, inflating and making their market prices more\nvolatile or creating “bubble” type risks for both bitcoin and shares of our ordinary shares.\nWe may not be able to realize the benefits of forks.\nTo the extent that a significant majority of users and miners on a bitcoin network install software that changes the bitcoin network or properties of\na bitcoin, including the irreversibility of transactions and limitations on the mining of new bitcoin, the bitcoin network would be subject to new protocols\nand software. However, if less than a significant majority of users and miners on the bitcoin network consent to the proposed modification, and the\nmodification is not compatible with the software prior to its modification, the consequence would be what is known as a “fork” of the network, with one\nprong running the pre-modified software and the other running the modified software. The effect of such a fork would be the existence of two versions of\nthe bitcoin running in parallel, yet lacking interchangeability and necessitating exchange-type transaction to convert currencies between the two forks.\nAdditionally, it may be unclear following a fork which fork represents the original asset and which is the new asset. Different metrics adopted by industry\nparticipants to determine which is the original asset include: referring to the wishes of the core developers of a bitcoin, blockchains with the greatest\namount of hashing power contributed by miners or validators; or blockchains with the longest chain. A fork in the network of a particular bitcoin could\nadversely affect an investment in our Company or our ability to operate.\nWe may not be able to realize the economic benefit of a fork, either immediately or ever, which could adversely affect an investment in our\nsecurities. If we hold a bitcoin at the time of a hard fork into two cryptocurrencies, industry standards would dictate that we would be expected to hold an\nequivalent amount of the old and new assets following the fork. However, we may not be able, or it may not be practical, to secure or realize the economic\nbenefit of the new asset for various reasons. For instance, we may determine that there is no safe or practical way to custody the new asset, that trying to do\nso may pose an unacceptable risk to our holdings in the old asset, or that the costs of taking possession and/or maintaining ownership of the new bitcoin\nexceed the benefits of owning the new bitcoin. Additionally, laws, regulation or other factors may prevent us from benefitting from the new asset even if\nthere is a safe and practical way to custody and secure the new asset.\n17\nThere is a possibility of bitcoin mining algorithms transitioning to proof of stake validation and other mining related risks, which could make us less\ncompetitive and ultimately adversely affect our business and the value of our stock.\nProof of stake is an alternative method in validating bitcoin transactions. Should the algorithm shift from a proof of work validation method to a\nproof of stake method, mining would require less energy and may render any company that maintains advantages in the current climate (for example, from\nlower priced electricity, processing, real estate, or hosting) less competitive. We, as a result of our efforts to optimize and improve the efficiency of our\nbitcoin mining operations, may be exposed to the risk in the future of losing the benefit of our capital investments and the competitive advantage we hope\nto gain form this as a result, and may be negatively impacted if a switch to proof of stake validation were to occur. This may additionally have an impact on\nother various investments of ours. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our business\nstrategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other\ncryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account.\nTo the extent that the profit margins of bitcoin mining operations are not high, operators of bitcoin mining operations are more likely to immediately\nsell bitcoin rewards earned by mining in the market, thereby constraining growth of the price of bitcoin that could adversely impact us, and similar\nactions could affect other cryptocurrencies.\nOver the past two years, bitcoin mining operations have evolved from individual users mining with computer processors, graphics processing units\nand first-generation ASIC servers. Currently, new processing power is predominantly added by incorporated and unincorporated “professionalized” mining\noperations. Professionalized mining operations may use proprietary hardware or sophisticated ASIC machines acquired from ASIC manufacturers. They\nrequire the investment of significant capital for the acquisition of this hardware, the leasing of operating space (often in data centers or warehousing\nfacilities), incurring of electricity costs and the employment of technicians to operate the mining farms. As a result, professionalized mining operations are\nof a greater scale than prior miners and have more defined and regular expenses and liabilities. These regular expenses and liabilities require\nprofessionalized mining operations to maintain profit margins on the sale of bitcoin. To the extent the price of bitcoin declines and such profit margin is\nconstrained, professionalized miners are incentivized to more immediately sell bitcoin earned from mining operations, whereas it is believed that individual\nminers in past years were more likely to hold newly mined bitcoin for more extended periods. The immediate selling of newly mined bitcoin greatly\nincreases the trading volume of bitcoin, creating downward pressure on the market price of bitcoin rewards.\nThe extent to which the value of bitcoin mined by a professionalized mining operation exceeds the allocable capital and operating costs\ndetermines the profit margin of such operation. A professionalized mining operation may be more likely to sell a higher percentage of its newly mined\nbitcoin rapidly if it is operating at a low profit margin and it may partially or completely cease operations if its profit margin is negative. In a low profit\nmargin environment, a higher percentage could be sold more rapidly, thereby potentially depressing bitcoin prices. Lower bitcoin prices could result in\nfurther tightening of profit margins for professionalized mining operations creating a network effect that may further reduce the price of bitcoin until\nmining operations with higher operating costs become unprofitable forcing them to reduce mining power or cease mining operations temporarily.\n18\nIf a malicious actor or botnet obtains control of more than 50% of the processing power on a bitcoin network, such actor or botnet could manipulate\nblockchains to adversely affect us, which would adversely affect an investment in us or our ability to operate.\nIf a malicious actor or botnet (a volunteer or hacked collection of computers controlled by networked software coordinating the actions of the\ncomputers) obtains a majority of the processing power dedicated to mining a bitcoin, it may be able to alter blockchains on which transactions of bitcoin\nreside and rely by constructing fraudulent blocks or preventing certain transactions from completing in a timely manner, or at all. The malicious actor or\nbotnet could control, exclude or modify the ordering of transactions, though it could not generate new units or transactions using such control. The\nmalicious actor could “double-spend” its own bitcoin (i.e., spend the same bitcoin in more than one transaction) and prevent the confirmation of other\nusers’ transactions for as long as it maintained control. To the extent that such malicious actor or botnet does not yield its control of the processing power\non the network or the bitcoin community does not reject the fraudulent blocks as malicious, reversing any changes made to blockchains may not be\npossible. The foregoing description is not the only means by which the entirety of blockchains or cryptocurrencies may be compromised but is only an\nexample.\nAlthough there are no known reports of malicious activity or control of blockchains achieved through controlling over 50% of the processing\npower on the network, it is believed that certain mining pools may have exceeded the 50% threshold in bitcoin. The possible crossing of the 50% threshold\nindicates a greater risk that a single mining pool could exert authority over the validation of bitcoin transactions. To the extent that the bitcoin ecosystem,\nand the administrators of mining pools, do not act to ensure greater decentralization of bitcoin mining processing power, the feasibility of a malicious actor\nobtaining control of the processing power will increase because the botnet or malicious actor could compromise more than 50% mining pool and thereby\ngain control of blockchain, whereas if the blockchain remains decentralized it is inherently more difficult for the botnet of malicious actor to aggregate\nenough processing power to gain control of the blockchain, may adversely affect an investment in our common stock. Such lack of controls and responses\nto such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or\notherwise acquire or hold for our own account, and harm investors.\nCryptocurrencies, including those maintained by or for us, may be exposed to cybersecurity threats and hacks.\nAs with any computer code generally, flaws in bitcoin codes may be exposed by malicious actors. Several errors and defects have been found\npreviously, including those that disabled some functionality for users and exposed users’ information. Exploitations of flaws in the source code that allow\nmalicious actors to take or create money have previously occurred. Despite our efforts and processes to prevent breaches, our devices, as well as our\nminers, computer systems and those of third parties that we use in our operations, are vulnerable to cyber security risks, including cyber-attacks such as\nviruses and worms, phishing attacks, denial-of-service attacks, physical or electronic break-ins, employee theft or misuse, and similar disruptions from\nunauthorized tampering with our miners and computer systems or those of third parties that we use in our operations. Such events could have a material\nadverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our business strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own\naccount.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our need for significant electrical power. Government regulators may potentially restrict the ability of electricity\nsuppliers to provide electricity to mining operations, such as ours.\nThe operation of a bitcoin or other bitcoin mine can require massive amounts of electrical power. Further, our mining operations can only be\nsuccessful and ultimately profitable if the costs, including electrical power costs, associated with mining a bitcoin are lower than the price of a bitcoin. As a\nresult, any mine we establish can only be successful if we can obtain sufficient electrical power for that mine on a cost-effective basis, and our\nestablishment of new mines requires us to find locations where that is the case. There may be significant competition for suitable mine locations, and\ngovernment regulators may potentially restrict the ability of electricity suppliers to provide electricity to mining operations in times of electricity shortage,\nor may otherwise potentially restrict or prohibit the provision or electricity to mining operations. Additionally, our mines could be materially adversely\naffected by a power outage. Given the power requirement, it would not be feasible to run miners on back-up power generators in the event of a government\nrestriction on electricity or a power outage. If we are unable to receive adequate power supply and are forced to reduce our operations due to the\navailability or cost of electrical power, our business would experience materially negative impacts.\n19\nIf the award of bitcoin rewards, for us primarily bitcoin for solving blocks and transaction fees are not sufficiently high, we may not have an adequate\nincentive to continue mining and may cease mining operations, which will likely lead to our failure to achieve profitability.\nAs the number of bitcoin rewards awarded for solving a block in a blockchain decreases, our ability to achieve profitability worsens. Decreased\nuse and demand for bitcoin rewards may adversely affect our incentive to expend processing power to solve blocks. If the award of bitcoin rewards for\nsolving blocks and transaction fees are not sufficiently high, we may not have an adequate incentive to continue mining and may cease our mining\noperations. For instance, the current fixed reward for solving a new block on the bitcoin blockchain is twelve and a half bitcoin currency rewards per block,\nwhich decreased from 25 bitcoin in July 2016. It is estimated that it will halve again in about one year. This reduction may result in a reduction in the\naggregate hash rate of the bitcoin network as the incentive for miners decreases. Miners ceasing operations would reduce the collective processing power\non the network, which would adversely affect the confirmation process for transactions (i.e., temporarily decreasing the speed at which blocks are added to\na blockchain until the next scheduled adjustment in difficulty for block solutions) and make bitcoin networks more vulnerable to a malicious actor or botnet\nobtaining control in excess of 50 percent of the processing power active on a blockchain, potentially permitting such actor or botnet to manipulate a\nblockchain in a manner that adversely affects our activities. A reduction in confidence in the confirmation process or processing power of the network\ncould result and be irreversible. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to pursue our new strategy at all, which could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or\notherwise acquire or hold for our own account.\nWe may not adequately respond to price fluctuations and rapidly changing technology, which may negatively affect our business.\nCompetitive conditions within the bitcoin industry require that we use sophisticated technology in the operation of our business. The industry for\nblockchain technology is characterized by rapid technological changes, new product introductions, enhancements and evolving industry standards. New\ntechnologies, techniques or products could emerge that might offer better performance than the software and other technologies we currently utilize, and we\nmay have to manage transitions to these new technologies to remain competitive. We may not be successful, generally or relative to our competitors in the\nbitcoin industry, in timely implementing new technology into our systems, or doing so in a cost-effective manner. During the course of implementing any\nsuch new technology into our operations, we may experience system interruptions and failures during such implementation. Furthermore, there can be no\nassurances that we will recognize, in a timely manner or at all, the benefits that we may expect as a result of our implementing new technology into our\noperations. As a result, our business and operations may suffer, and there may be adverse effects on the price of our common stock.\nRisks Involving Intellectual Property\nBitcoin and bitcoin mining is software related\nWe actively use specific hardware and software for our bitcoin mining operation. In certain cases, source code and other software assets may be\nsubject to an open source license, as much technology development underway in this sector is open source. For these works, the company intends to adhere\nto the terms of any license agreements that may be in place.\nWe do not currently own, and do not have any current plans to seek, any patents in connection with our existing and planned blockchain and\ncryptocurrency related operations. We do expect to rely upon trade secrets, trademarks, service marks, trade names, copyrights and other intellectual\nproperty rights and expect to license the use of intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others. In addition, we have developed and may further\ndevelop certain proprietary software applications for purposes of our cryptocurrency mining operation.\nOur platform may be subject to damage, interruptions or delays that may adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nIn the event of a platform outage and physical data loss, our ability to perform our bitcoin mining operations would be materially and adversely\naffected. The satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our platform are critical to our operations. Our operations depend on our ability to\nprotect our systems against damage or interruption from natural disasters, power or telecommunications failures, air quality issues, environmental\nconditions, computer viruses or attempts to harm our systems, criminal acts and similar events.\n20\nAny interruptions or delays in our service, whether as a result of third-party errors, our errors, natural disasters or security breaches, whether\naccidental or willful, could harm our operations and/or reputation. Additionally, in the event of damage or interruption, our insurance policies may not\nadequately compensate us for any losses that we may incur. Our disaster recovery plan has not been tested under actual disaster conditions, and we may not\nhave sufficient capacity to recover all data and services in the event of an outage. These factors could prevent us from mining bitcoins, damage our brand\nand reputation, divert our employees’ attention, subject us to liability, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nOur platform and internal systems rely on software that is highly technical, and if it contains undetected errors, our business could be adversely\naffected.\nOur platform and internal systems rely on software that is highly technical and complex. In addition, our platform and internal systems depend on\nthe ability of such software to store, retrieve, process and manage immense amounts of data. The software on which we rely has contained, and may now or\nin the future contain, undetected errors or bugs. Some errors may only be discovered after the code has been released for external or internal use. Any\nerrors, bugs or defects discovered in the software on which we rely could result in harm to our reputation, or liability for damages, any of which could\nadversely affect our business, results of operations and financial conditions.\nWe may not be able to prevent others from unauthorized use of our intellectual property, which could harm our business and competitive position.\nWe regard our trademarks, domain names, know-how, proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we\nrely on a combination of intellectual property laws and contractual arrangements, including confidentiality and non-compete agreements with our\nemployees and others to protect our proprietary rights. See “Item 4. Information of the Company —Intellectual Property” and “Regulation—Regulation on\nIntellectual Property Rights.” Thus, we cannot assure you that any of our intellectual property rights would not be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or\nmisappropriated, or such intellectual property will be sufficient to provide us with competitive advantages. In addition, because of the rapid pace of\ntechnological change in our industry, parts of our business rely on technologies developed or licensed by third parties, and we may not be able to obtain or\ncontinue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties on reasonable terms, or at all.\nOur trade secrets may be leaked or otherwise become available to, or be independently discovered by, our competitors. To the extent that our\nemployees or consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related know-how and\ninventions. Any failure in protecting or enforcing our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition\nand results of operations.\nWe may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims, which may be expensive to defend and may disrupt our business and operations.\nWe cannot be certain that our operations or any aspects of our business do not or will not infringe upon or otherwise violate trademarks, patents,\ncopyrights, know-how or other intellectual property rights held by third parties. We may be from time to time in the future subject to legal proceedings and\nclaims relating to the intellectual property rights of others. In addition, there may be third-party trademarks, patents, copyrights, know-how or other\nintellectual property rights that are infringed by our products, services or other aspects of our business without our awareness. Holders of such intellectual\nproperty rights may seek to enforce such intellectual property rights against us in China, the United States or other jurisdictions. If any third-party\ninfringement claims are brought against us, we may be forced to divert management’s time and other resources from our business and operations to defend\nagainst these claims, regardless of their merits. As a result, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nFluctuations in exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the value of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Ordinary Shares\nThe trading price of our common stock is subject to arbitrary pricing factors that are not necessarily associated with traditional factors that\ninfluence stock prices or the value of non-bitcoin assets such as revenue, cash flows, profitability, growth prospects or business activity levels since the\nvalue and price, as determined by the investing public, may be influenced by future anticipated adoption or appreciation in value of cryptocurrencies or\nblockchains generally, factors over which we have little or no influence or control.\n21\nOther factors which could cause volatility in the market price of our common stock include, but are not limited to:\n● actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results or those of companies perceived to be similar to us;\n● actual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\n● commercial success and market acceptance of blockchain and bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies;\n● actions by our competitors, such as new business initiatives, acquisitions and divestitures;\n● strategic transactions undertaken by us;\n● additions or departures of key personnel;\n● prevailing economic conditions;\n● disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\n● sales of our common stock by our officers, directors or significant stockholders;\n● other actions taken by our stockholders;\n● future sales or issuances of equity or debt securities by us;\n● business disruptions caused by earthquakes, tornadoes or other natural disasters;\n● issuance of new or changed securities analysts’ reports or recommendations regarding us;\n● legal proceedings involving our company, our industry or both;\n● changes in market valuations of companies similar to ours;\n● the prospects of the industry in which we operate;\n● speculation or reports by the press or investment community with respect to us or our industry in general;\n● the level of short interest in our stock; and\n● other risks, uncertainties and factors described in this annual report.\n22\nIn addition, the stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of the\nissuer. These broad market fluctuations may negatively impact the price or liquidity of our common stock. When the price of a stock has been volatile,\nholders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the issuer.\nWe may be unable to comply with the applicable continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, which may adversely impact our access\nto capital markets and may cause us to default certain of our agreements.\nOur common stock is currently traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Nasdaq rules require us to maintain a minimum closing bid price of $1.00\nper share of our common stock. The closing bid price of our common stock fell below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive trading days, so we were not in\ncompliance with Nasdaq’s rules for listing standards. Although we regained compliance, there can be no assurance we will continue to meet the minimum\nbid price requirements or any other requirements in the future, in which case our common stock could be delisted.\nIn the event that our common stock is delisted from Nasdaq and is not eligible for quotation or listing on another market or exchange, trading of\nour common stock could be conducted only in the over-the-counter market or on an electronic bulletin board established for unlisted securities such as the\nOTC. In such event, it could become more difficult to dispose of, or obtain accurate price quotations for our common stock and there would likely also be a\nreduction in our coverage by securities analysts and the news media, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline further. In addition, our\nability to raise additional capital may be severely impacted, which may negatively affect our plans and the results of our operations.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could\ndecline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by whether industry or securities analysts publish research and reports about us, our\nbusiness, our market or our competitors and, if any analysts do publish such reports, what they publish in those reports. We may not obtain or maintain\nanalyst coverage in the future. Any analysts that do cover us may make adverse recommendations regarding our stock, adversely change their\nrecommendations from time to time and/or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors. If analysts who may cover us in the\nfuture were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, or if analysts fail to cover us or publish reports about us at all, we\ncould lose (or never gain) visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the stock price of our common stock or trading volume to decline.\nMoreover, if our operating results do not meet the expectations of the investor community, one or more of the analysts who cover our company may change\ntheir recommendations regarding our company and our stock price could decline.\nOur ordinary shares may be thinly traded and you may be unable to sell at or near ask prices or at all if you need to sell your shares to raise money or\notherwise desire to liquidate your shares.\nOur ordinary shares may be “thinly-traded”, meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our ordinary shares at or near bid prices\nat any given time may be relatively small or non-existent. This situation may be attributable to a number of factors, including the fact that we are relatively\nunknown to stock analysts, stock brokers, institutional investors and others in the investment community that generate or influence sales volume, and that\neven if we came to the attention of such persons, they tend to be risk-averse and might be reluctant to follow an unproven company such as ours or\npurchase or recommend the purchase of our shares until such time as we became more seasoned. As a consequence, there may be periods of several days or\nmore when trading activity in our shares is minimal or non-existent, as compared to a seasoned issuer which has a large and steady volume of trading\nactivity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price. Broad or active public trading market for our ordinary shares\nmay not develop or be sustained.\n23\nVolatility in our ordinary shares price may subject us to securities litigation.\nThe market for our ordinary shares may have, when compared to seasoned issuers, significant price volatility and we expect that our share price\nmay continue to be more volatile than that of a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future. In the past, plaintiffs have often initiated securities class action\nlitigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We may, in the future, be the target of similar litigation.\nSecurities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert management’s attention and resources.\nWe are not likely to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe currently intend to retain any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business. Accordingly, we do not expect to pay any\ncash dividends in the foreseeable future but will review this policy as circumstances dictate.\nYou may face difficulties in protecting your interests as a shareholder, as the laws of British Virgin Islands provides substantially less protection when\ncompared to the laws of the United States and it may be difficult for a shareholder of ours to effect service of process or to enforce judgements obtained\nin the United States courts.\nOur corporate affairs are governed by our memorandum and articles of association and by the Companies Law (2016 Revision) and common law\nof the British Virgin Islands. The rights of shareholders to take legal action against our directors and us, actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary\nresponsibilities of our directors to us under British Islands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the British Virgin Islands. The common\nlaw of the British Virgin Islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the British Virgin Islands as well as from English\ncommon law. Decisions of the Privy Council (which is the final court of appeal for British overseas territories such as the British Virgin Islands) are\nbinding on a court in the British Virgin Islands. Decisions of the English courts, and particularly the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom and the Court\nof Appeal are generally of persuasive authority but are not binding on the courts of the British Virgin Islands. The rights of our shareholders and the\nfiduciary responsibilities of our directors under British Virgin Islands law are not as clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial\nprecedents in the United States. In particular, the British Virgin Islands has a less developed body of securities laws as compared to the United States and\nprovide significantly less protection to investors. In addition, British Virgin Islands companies may not have standing to initiate a shareholder derivative\naction before the United States federal courts. The British Islands courts are also unlikely to impose liabilities against us in original actions brought in the\nBritish Virgin Islands, based on certain civil liability provisions of United States securities laws.\nAll of our directors and officers are nationals or residents of jurisdictions other than the United States and a substantial portion of their assets are\nlocated outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for a shareholder to effect service of process within the United States upon these persons,\nor to enforce against us or them judgments obtained in United States courts, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the\nsecurities laws of the United States or any state in the United States.\nAs a result of all of the above, our shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests through actions against us or our officers,\ndirectors or major shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction in the United States.\n24\nWe are a foreign private issuer within the meaning of the rules under the Exchange Act, and as such we are exempt from certain provisions applicable\nto United States domestic public companies.\nWe are a foreign private issuer within the meaning of the rules under the Exchange Act. As such, we are exempt from certain provisions applicable\nto United States domestic public companies. For example:\n● we are not required to provide as many Exchange Act reports, or as frequently, as a domestic public company;\n● for interim reporting, we are permitted to comply solely with our home country requirements, which are less rigorous than the rules that apply to\ndomestic public companies;\n● we are not required to provide the same level of disclosure on certain issues, such as executive compensation;\n● we are exempt from provisions of Regulation FD aimed at preventing issuers from making selective disclosures of material information;\n● we are not required to comply with the sections of the Exchange Act regulating the solicitation of proxies, consents or authorizations in respect of\na security registered under the Exchange Act; and\n● we are not required to comply with Section 16 of the Exchange Act requiring insiders to file public reports of their share ownership and trading\nactivities and establishing insider liability for profits realized from any “short-swing” trading transaction.\n● We currently intend to file annual reports on Form 20-F and reports on Form 6-K as a foreign private issuer. Accordingly, our shareholders may\nnot have access to certain information they may deem important.\n25\nIf we are classified as a passive foreign investment company, United States taxpayers who own our ordinary shares may have adverse United States\nfederal income tax consequences.\nA non-U.S. corporation such as ourselves will be classified as a passive foreign investment company, which is known as a PFIC, for any taxable\nyear if, for such year, either\n● at least 75% of our gross income for the year is passive income; or\n● the average percentage of our assets (determined at the end of each quarter) during the taxable year which produce passive income or which are\nheld for the production of passive income is at least 50%.\nPassive income generally includes dividends, interest, rents and royalties (other than rents or royalties derived from the active conduct of a trade or\nbusiness) and gains from the disposition of passive assets.\nIf we are determined to be a PFIC for any taxable year (or portion thereof) that is included in the holding period of a U.S. taxpayer who holds our\nordinary shares, the U.S. taxpayer may be subject to increased U.S. federal income tax liability and may be subject to additional reporting requirements.\nDepending on the amount of cash we raise in a public offering completed in March 2018, together with any other assets held for the production of\npassive income, it is possible that, for our 2018 taxable year or for any subsequent year, more than 50% of our assets may be assets which produce passive\nincome. We will make this determination following the end of any particular tax year. Although the law in this regard is unclear, we treat our consolidated\naffiliated entities as being owned by us for United States federal income tax purposes, not only because we exercise effective control over the operation of\nsuch entities but also because we are entitled to substantially all of their economic benefits, and, as a result, we consolidate their operating results in our\nconsolidated financial statements. For purposes of the PFIC analysis, in general, a non-U.S. corporation is deemed to own its pro rata share of the gross\nincome and assets of any entity in which it is considered to own at least 25% of the equity by value.\nFor a more detailed discussion of the application of the PFIC rules to us and the consequences to U.S. taxpayers if we were determined to be a\nPFIC, see “Item 10.E. Taxation — United States Federal Income Taxation — Passive Foreign Investment Company.”\n26\nITEM 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY\nHistory and Development of the Company\nOur Company was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands on May 18, 2021. On August 16, 2021, the Company completed a redomicile merger with its\npredecessor company, Moxian, Inc., a Nevada corporation pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger entered into on May 28, 2021, wherein it acquired\nall the assets, liabilities, rights, obligations and operations of the latter and its subsidiaries, through an exchange of an identical number of its ordinary\nshares.\nOn October 25, 2021, the Board approved to re-designate 50,000,000 of its authorized but unissued ordinary shares of par value of $0.001 each (the\n“Ordinary Shares”) as 50,000,000 preferred shares of par value of $0.00101 each (the “Preferred Shares”) and amend its Memorandum and Articles of\nAssociation, among other things, to specify the rights attaching to the preferred shares. On October 28, 2021, the Company filed its Amended and Restated\nMemorandum and Articles of Association (the “Amended and Restated M&A”) with the British Virgin Islands Registrar of Corporate Affairs. The\nCompany is authorized to issue 150,000,000 Ordinary Shares and 50,000,000 Preferred Shares pursuant to the Amended and Restated M&A.\nOn November 11, 2021, the Board approved to issue 5,000,000 Preferred Shares to Bridgeforrest (BVI) Inc., a holding company owned by Conglin\n(Forrest) Deng , the Chief Executive Officer and an Executive Director of the Company, for gross proceeds of $5,000,000. The shares were issued on\nDecember 1, 2021.\nOn December 28, 2021, in a Special Meeting, the shareholders approved the issue of up to 20 million new ordinary shares of the Company, at a price of\n$2.50 per share to certain non-US based accredited investors. On February 11, 2022, the Company completed this private placement and issued 16,000,000\nnew shares, raising $40 million, which it will use in bitcoin mining in order to diversify its business operations.\nOur predecessor company, Moxian, Inc (“Moxian”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada, United States of America, on October 12, 2010. It was\nuplisted to the Nasdaq Capital Market on November 14, 2016, operating as an O2O enterprise, with two major lines of business mobile applications linking\nsmall and medium enterprises to its network platform and digital advertising through a partnership with Xinhua New Media, which operates the official app\nof the New China News Agency, a state-backed media firm. The mobile app business failed to achieve a meaningful share of the market and incurred huge\nlosses, primarily because users found the Moxian app unwieldy and not user-friendly. By September 30, 2018, the Company had to halt this business as it\nran out of working capital whilst the digital advertising continued until July 2022 when the Company divested its entire business operation in China.\nThere were discussions with various parties for strategic partnerships between June 2018 to the end of 2020 but none of these business opportunities\nmaterialized.\nIn August, 2021, Moxian, Inc decided to redomicile to the British Virgin Islands through a merger with its wholly-owned subsidiary, Moxian BVI. Moxian\nBVI became the surviving company when the merger was completed in August 2021. In September 2021, the Company appointed a new CEO who was\ntasked to identify new business for the Company in order to broaden its earnings base. Following non-binding expressions of support from some\nshareholders, the Company decided to venture into bitcoin mining and called for a Special Meeting of shareholders in December 2021 to approve related\nproposals as noted above. All these proposals were approved at the Special Meeting and in February 2022, the Company completed its capital raising\nexercise, with a total subscription of 16 million new ordinary shares for $40 million.\nOn October 25, 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors approved to change the name of the Company from “Moxian (BVI) Inc” to “Abits Group Inc.” On\nNovember 14, 2023, the British Virgin Islands Registrar of Corporate Affairs issued the certificate of name change to the Company. In connection with the\ncorporate name change, the Board of Directors approved to change the ticker symbol for the Company’s ordinary shares traded on the Nasdaq Capital\nMarket from “MOXC” to “ABTS” effective November 17, 2023.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the subsidiaries of the Company are as follows:\nDate of\nName of Company Jurisdiction of Incorporation Incorporation Principal Activity\nAbit Hong Kong Limited Hong Kong SAR May 8, 2019 Investment Holding\nBeijing Bitmatrix Technology Co. Ltd Peoples’ Republic of China December 20, 2019 In-house Support Services\nAbit USA, Inc. Delaware April 27, 2022 Bitcoin Mining\n27\nOrganization Chart\nThe following diagram illustrates our corporate structure, as of the date of this report:\nAbits Group Inc\n28\nBusiness Overview\nBitcoin Mining\nOperations of bitcoin mining\nIn view of the widespread adoption of blockchain technology and bitcoin worldwide, the Company determined to enter the bitcoin mining\nindustry, which is the production of bitcoin. Management believes that bitcoin mining is profitable and its business plan is viable.\nOur facility and mining platform will operate with the primary intent of accumulating bitcoin which we may sell for fiat currency from time to\ntime depending on market conditions and management’s determination of our cash flow needs.\nPerformance Metrics of bitcoin mining\nThe Company operates mining hardware which performs computational operations in support of the blockchain measured in “hash rate” or\n“hashes per second.” A “hash” is the computation run by mining hardware in support of the blockchain; therefore, a miner’s “hash rate” refers to the rate at\nwhich it is capable of solving such computations. The original equipment used for mining bitcoin utilized the Central Processing Unit (CPU) of a computer\nto mine various forms of bitcoin. Due to performance limitations, CPU mining was rapidly replaced by the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), which offers\nsignificant performance advantages over CPUs. General purpose chipsets like CPUs and GPUs have since been replaced in the mining industry by\nApplication Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC) chips. These ASIC chips are specifically to maximize the rate of hashing operations.\nThe Company measures our mining performance and competitive position based on overall hash rate being produced in our mining sites. The\nlatest equipment in our fleet of miners, the Bitmain S19 XP performs with a maximum hashrate of 100 TH/s per unit and is on the cutting edge of available\nmining equipment. However, advances and improvements to the technology are ongoing and may be available in quantities in the market in the near future\nwhich may affect our perceived position.\n29\nHalving\nFurther affecting the industry, and particularly for the bitcoin blockchain, the cryptocurrency reward for solving a block is subject to periodic\nincremental halving. Halving is a process designed to control the overall supply and reduce the risk of inflation in cryptocurrencies using a Proof-of-Work\nconsensus algorithm. At a predetermined block, the mining reward is cut in half, hence the term “halving”. For bitcoin, the reward was initially set at 50\nbitcoin currency rewards per block and this was cut in half to 25 in November 28, 2012 at block 210,000 and again to 12.5 on July 9, 2016 at block 420,000\nand on May 11, 2020 at block 630,000 when the reward was halved to 6.25. On April 19, 2024 it was halved again to 3.125. With each halving, the mining\nrewards to the miners are halved and the industry becomes a lot more competitive.. This process of halving will reoccur until the total amount of bitcoins in\ncirculation reaches 21 million, which is expected to occur around 2140.\nNetwork Hash Rate and Difficulty\nIn cryptocurrency mining, “hash rate” is a measure of the processing speed by a mining computer for a specific coin. An individual miner, has a\nhash rate total of its miners seeking to mine a specific coin. The higher total hash rate of a specific miner, as a percentage of the system wide total hash rate,\ngenerally results over time in a corresponding higher success rate in coin rewards as compared to miners with lower hash rates.\nMining Pools\nA “mining pool” is the pooling of resources by miners, who share their processing power over a network and split rewards according to the\namount of work they contributed to the probability of placing a block on the blockchain. Mining pools emerged in response to the growing difficulty and\navailable hashing power that competes to place a block on the bitcoin blockchain.\nThe Company participates in mining pools wherein groups of miners associate to pool resources and earn cryptocurrency together allocated to\neach miner according to the “hashing” capacity they contribute to the pool. As additional miners competed for the limited supply of blocks, individuals\nfound that they were working for months without finding a block and receiving any reward for their mining efforts. To address this variance, miners started\norganizing into pools to share mining rewards more evenly on a pro rata basis based on total hashing capacity contributed to the mining pool.\nThe mining pool operator provides a service that coordinates the computing power of the independent mining enterprise. Fees are paid to the\nmining pool operator to cover the costs of maintaining the pool. The pool uses software that coordinates the pool members’ hashing power, identifies new\nblock rewards, records how much work all the participants are doing, and assigns block rewards for successful algorithm solutions in-proportion to the\nindividual hash rate that each participant contributed to a given successful mining transaction. While we do not pay pool fees directly, pool fees are\ndeducted from amounts we may otherwise earn. Fees (and payouts) fluctuate and historically have been approximately 2% on average.\nMining pools are subject to various risks such as disruption and down time. Riot has internally created software that monitors its hashing\nperformance and reward rates to monitor credits for our contributed hashing power. In the event that a pool experiences down time or not yielding returns,\nour results may be impacted.\nCompetition\nIn bitcoin mining, companies, individuals and groups generate units of bitcoin through mining. Miners can range from individual enthusiasts to\nprofessional mining operations with dedicated data centers. Miners may organize themselves in mining pools. The Company competes or may in the future\ncompete with other companies that focus all or a portion of their activities on owning or operating bitcoin exchanges, developing programming for the\nblockchain, and mining activities. At present, the information concerning the activities of these enterprises is not readily available as the vast majority of\nthe participants in this sector do not publish information publicly or the information may be unreliable. Published sources of information include\n“bitcoin.org” and “blockchain.info”; however, the reliability of that information and its continued availability cannot be assured.\nThe bitcoin industry is a highly competitive and evolving industry and new competitors and/or emerging technologies could enter the market and\naffect our competitiveness in the future.\nLegal Proceedings\nWe are currently not a party to any material legal or administrative proceedings. We may from time to time be subject to various legal or\nadministrative claims and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Litigation or any other legal or administrative proceeding, regardless of\nthe outcome, is likely to result in substantial cost and diversion of our resources, including our management’s time and attention.\n30\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nEffective July 2022, the Company no longer has any substantial business operations in China. However, it still maintains a small office of about 200 square\nmeters for a staff of 3, who are engaged in accounting and administrative functions. There is no rental payable as this office is within a larger office\noccupied by a third party who pays the entire monthly rent of about $9,200 on a two year lease. The Company anticipates this arrangement to be only\ntemporary as it will eventually move the back-office operations to the United States.\nThe Company also maintains a registered office at Level 24, Lee Garden One, 33 Hysan Avenue in Causeway Bay, Hong Kong SAR.\nAs the Company is in the bitcoin mining business, its investment in plant and equipment is substantial and is centered at its self-owned property at 4458\nWhite Oak Road, Duff, TN 37729, where its principal subsidiary, Abit USA, operates.\nITEM 4A. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone\nITEM 5. OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS\nOperating review\nBitcoin prices began to recover in early January 2023, vindicating the Company’s decision to place a large order for advanced state-of-the-art machines, the\nBitmain Antminer S19XP in the third quarter of the previous year. The search for a suitable site intensified and in April, the Company bought a piece of\nland for $1.2 million in Duff, near the city of La Follette in Tennessee. Construction of the new mining center began in May 2023 and was completed by\nSeptember 2023 at a total cost of $6.5 million.\nThe fiscal year 2023, therefore, only saw three months of operation, beginning in the first days of October with production output increasing month-by-\nmonth. However, bearing in mind the relative short period of operations, any direct comparison between the two financial years must be tempered with\ncaution.\nThere was a total output of 43.93 bitcoins for the 2023 fiscal year, registering a revenue of approximately $1.68 million for the year. Direct cost of revenue\ncomprising depreciation and electricity costs totaled $0.89 million while other operating overheads, primarily the remuneration of key site executives\namounted to $0.17 million resulting in a profit of approximately $0.62 million. However, this profit was offset by the write-off of the remaining equipment\nimported from China of $7.37 million, as the performance of these machines was unexpectedly poor given its power consumption. Other administrative\nand general overheads topped approximately $1.47 million which was comparable with $1.67 million of the 2022 fiscal year, bringing the loss before\ntaxation of $12.59 million, an improvement of about 42%.\nFinancial review\nCash and cash equivalents dwindled to approximately $0.88 million and the Company had to resort to a sale of 32.82 bitcoins to supplement its operating\ncash. Digital assets fell to $1.2 million as a result of this sale, with a mix of digital assets as some suppliers accepted payment in USDC and USDT.\nProspects\nThe halving of rewards in April meant that the immediate prospects of all miners look dim. Much will depend on bitcoin prices as previous halvings saw a\nsubstantial rise in bitcoin prices in the period after the significant halving event. In January 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved the\nlisting and trading of spot bitcoin exchange-traded product shares on U.S. stock exchanges and this has brought in a influx of funds from institutional\ninvestors, a favorable factor. Nonetheless, the prospects of continued profitability for bitcoin miners appear uncertain.\nITEM 6. DIRECTORS, SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES\n6A.

Under Article 23 of our Articles of Association, no contract or transaction between us and one or more of our Directors (an “Interested\nDirector”) or officers, or between us and any of their affiliates (an “Interested Transaction”), will be void or voidable solely for this reason, or solely\nbecause the director or officer is present at or participates in the meeting of our board or committee which authorizes the contract or transaction, or solely\nbecause any such director’s or officer’s votes are counted for such purpose, if:\n(a) The material facts as to the director’s or officer’s relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the our\nBoard of Directors or the committee, and the board or committee in good faith authorizes the contract or transaction by the affirmative votes of a\nmajority of the disinterested directors, even though the disinterested directors be less than a quorum; or\n(b) The material facts as to the director’s or officer’s relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to our\nshareholders entitled to vote thereon, and the contract or transaction is specifically approved in good faith by vote of our shareholders; or\n(c) The contract or transaction is fair as to us as of the time it is authorized, approved or ratified, by the board, a committee or the Shareholders.\nA majority of independent directors must vote in favor of any Interested Transaction and determine that the terms of the Interested Transaction are no less\nfavorable to us than those that would be available to us with respect to such a transaction from unaffiliated third parties.\nOur board shall review and approve all payments made to the founders, officers, directors, special advisors, consultants and their respective affiliates and\nany Interested Director shall abstain from such review and approval.\nRights, Preferences and Restrictions Attaching to Our Ordinary Shares. We are authorized to issue a maximum of 200,000,000 shares divided into the\nfollowing classes of shares: (i) 150,000,000 ordinary shares, par value $0.001 per share; and (ii) 50,000,000 preferred shares, par value $0.00101 per share.\nAs of March 31, 2024, 35,554,677 ordinary shares and 5,000,000 preferred shares were outstanding. Each share, regardless if it is part of a class of ordinary\nshares, has the right to one vote at a meeting of shareholders or on any resolution of shareholders, the right to an equal share in any dividend paid by us,\nand the right to an equal share in the distribution of surplus assets. Each preferred share has the right to three votes at a meeting of shareholders or on any\nresolution of shareholders but does not participate in any distribution of the company. We may by a resolution of the Board of Directors redeem our shares\nfor such consideration as the Board of Directors determines.\nAlteration of Rights. The rights attached to any class or series of shares (unless otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the shares of that class or\nseries), whether or not the Company is being wound-up, may be varied with the consent in writing of all the holders of the issued shares of that class or\nseries or with the sanction of a resolution passed by a majority of the votes cast at a separate meeting of the holders of the shares of the class or series.\n39\nMeetings. A meeting of Members may be called by not less than ten (10) clear days’ Notice, but a meeting of Members may be called by shorter notice if\nMembers holding a 50 per cent majority of the total voting rights on all the matters to be considered at the meeting have waived notice of the meeting and,\nfor this purpose, the presence of a Member shall be deemed to constitute a waiver on his part. The notice shall specify the time and place of the meeting\nand the general nature of the business. The accidental omission to give Notice of a meeting or (in cases where instruments of proxy are sent out with the\nNotice) to send such instrument of proxy to, or the non-receipt of such Notice or such instrument of proxy by, any person entitled to receive such Notice\nshall not invalidate any resolution passed or the proceedings at that meeting.\nLimitations on the Right to Own Securities. There are no limitations on the rights to own our securities, or limitations on the rights of non-resident or\nforeign shareholders to hold or exercise voting rights on our securities, contained in our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association\n(or under British Virgin Islands law).\nC. Material Contracts\nWe have not entered into any material contracts other than in the ordinary course of business and otherwise described elsewhere in this annual report.\nD. Exchange Controls\nBVI Exchange Controls\nThere are no material exchange controls restrictions on payment of dividends, interest or other payments to the holders of our ordinary shares or on the\nconduct of our operations in the BVI. There are no material BVI laws that impose any material exchange controls on us or that affect the payment of\ndividends, interest or other payments to nonresident holders of our ordinary shares. BVI law and our memorandum and articles of association do not\nimpose any material limitations on the right of non-residents or foreign owners to hold or vote our ordinary shares.\nE. Taxation\nBritish Virgin Islands Taxation\nUnder the law of the British Virgin Islands as currently in effect, a holder of our shares who is not a resident of the British Virgin Islands is not liable for\nBritish Virgin Islands income tax on dividends paid with respect to our shares, and all holders of our securities are not liable to the British Virgin Islands for\nincome tax on gains realized on the sale or disposal of such securities. The British Virgin Islands does not impose a withholding tax on dividends paid by a\ncompany incorporated or re-registered under the BVI Act.\nThere are no capital gains, gift or inheritance taxes levied by the British Virgin Islands on companies incorporated or re-registered under the BVI Act. In\naddition, securities of companies incorporated or re-registered under the BVI Act are not subject to transfer taxes, stamp duties or similar charges.\nThere is no income tax treaty or convention currently in effect between the United States and the British Virgin Islands, although a Tax Information\nExchange Agreement is in force.\n40\nU.S. Federal Income Taxation\nGeneral\nThe following are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences to an investor of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of our securities.\nThe discussion below of the U.S. federal income tax consequences to “U.S. Holders” will apply to a beneficial owner of our securities that is treated for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes as:\n● an individual citizen or resident of the United States;\n● a corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation) that is created or organized (or treated as created or organized) in or under the laws of the\nUnited States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;\n● an estate whose income is includible in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless of its source; or\n● a trust if (i) a U.S. court can exercise primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one or more U.S. persons are authorized to control all\nsubstantial decisions of the trust, or (ii) it has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person.\nIf a beneficial owner of our securities is not described as a U.S. Holder and is not an entity treated as a partnership or other pass-through entity for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes, such an owner will be considered a “Non-U.S. Holder.” The material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the acquisition,\nownership and disposition of our securities applicable specifically to Non-U.S. Holders are described below under the heading “Non-U.S. Holders.”\nThis discussion is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), its legislative history, Treasury regulations promulgated\nthereunder, published rulings and court decisions, all as currently in effect. These authorities are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly on a\nretroactive basis.\nThis discussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to any particular holder of our securities based on such\nholder’s individual circumstances. In particular, this discussion considers only holders that own and hold our securities as capital assets within the meaning\nof Section 1221 of the Code, and does not address the alternative minimum tax. In addition, this discussion does not address the U.S. federal income tax\nconsequences to holders that are subject to special rules, including:\n● financial institutions or financial services entities;\n● broker-dealers;\n● persons that are subject to the mark-to-market accounting rules under Section 475 of the Code;\n● tax-exempt entities;\n● governments or agencies or instrumentalities thereof;\n● insurance companies;\n● regulated investment companies;\n● real estate investment trusts;\n● certain expatriates or former long-term residents of the United States;\n41\n● persons that actually or constructively own 5% or more of our public shares;\n● persons that acquired our securities pursuant to the exercise of employee options, in connection with employee incentive plans or otherwise as\ncompensation;\n● persons that hold our securities as part of a straddle, constructive sale, hedging, conversion or other integrated transaction;\n● persons whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;\n● controlled foreign corporations; or passive foreign investment companies.\nThis discussion does not address any aspect of U.S. federal non-income tax laws, such as gift or estate tax laws, state, local or non-U.S. tax laws or, except\nas discussed herein, any tax reporting obligations applicable to a holder of our securities. Additionally, this discussion does not consider the tax treatment of\npartnerships or other pass-through entities or persons who hold our securities through such entities. If a partnership (or other entity classified as a\npartnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is the beneficial owner of our securities, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in the\npartnership will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. This discussion also assumes that any distributions made\n(or deemed made) by us on our securities and any consideration received (or deemed received) by a holder in consideration for the sale or other disposition\nof our securities will be in U.S. dollars.\nWe have not sought, and will not seek a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) or an opinion of counsel as to any U.S. federal income tax\nconsequence described herein. The IRS may disagree with the description herein, and its determination may be upheld by a court. Moreover, there can be\nno assurance that future legislation, regulations, administrative rulings or court decisions will not adversely affect the accuracy of the statements in this\ndiscussion.\nTHIS DISCUSSION OF THE MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE ACQUISITION, OWNERSHIP AND\nDISPOSITION OF OUR SECURITIES IS NOT TAX ADVICE. EACH HOLDER OF OUR SECURITIES IS URGED TO CONSULT ITS OWN TAX\nADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO THE PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES TO SUCH HOLDER OF THE ACQUISITION, OWNERSHIP AND\nDISPOSITION OF OUR SECURITIES, INCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF ANY STATE, LOCAL, AND NON-U.S. TAX LAWS,\nAS WELL AS U.S. FEDERAL TAX LAWS AND ANY APPLICABLE TAX TREATIES.\nU.S. Holders\nTaxation of Cash Distributions\nSubject to the passive foreign investment company (“PFIC”) rules discussed below, a U.S. Holder generally will be required to include in gross income as\nordinary income the amount of any cash dividend paid on our shares. A cash distribution on such shares generally will be treated as a dividend for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes to the extent paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined under U.S. federal income tax\nprinciples). Such dividend generally will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction generally allowed to domestic corporations in respect of\ndividends received from other domestic corporations. The portion of such distribution, if any, in excess of such earnings and profits generally will\nconstitute a return of capital that will be applied against and reduce (but not below zero) the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in such shares. Any remaining\nexcess will be treated as gain from the sale or other taxable disposition of such shares and will be treated as described under “— Taxation on the\nDisposition of Securities” below.\nWith respect to non-corporate U.S. Holders, dividends on our shares may be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the lower applicable long-term capital\ngains tax rate (see “— Taxation on the Disposition of Securities” below) provided that (1) such shares are readily tradable on an established securities\nmarket in the United States, (2) we are not a PFIC, as discussed below, for either the taxable year in which the dividend was paid or the preceding taxable\nyear, and (3) certain holding period requirements are met. Under published IRS authority, our shares are considered for purposes of clause (1) above to be\nreadily tradable on an established securities market in the United States only if they are listed on certain exchanges, which presently include the NASDAQ\nCapital Market. Although our ordinary shares and warrants are currently listed and traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market, we cannot guarantee that our\nsecurities will continue to be listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the availability of the\nlower rate for any cash dividends paid with respect to our securities.\n42\nPossible Constructive Distributions with Respect to Redeemable Warrants\nThe terms of each redeemable warrant provide for an adjustment to the number of ordinary shares for which the redeemable warrant may be exercised in\ncertain events. An adjustment that has the effect of preventing dilution generally is not taxable. However, the U.S. Holders of the redeemable warrants\nwould be treated as receiving a constructive distribution from us if, for example, the adjustment increases the redeemable warrant holders’ proportionate\ninterest in our assets or earnings and profits (e.g., through an increase in the number of ordinary shares that would be obtained upon exercise) as a result of\na distribution of cash to the holders of our shares, which is taxable to the U.S. Holders of such shares as described under “Taxation of Cash Distributions”\nabove. Such constructive distribution would be subject to tax as described under that section in the same manner as if the U.S. Holders of the redeemable\nwarrants received a cash distribution from us equal to the fair market value of such increased interest.\nTaxation on the Disposition of Securities\nUpon a sale or other taxable disposition of our securities (which, in general, would include a distribution in connection with our liquidation or a redemption\nof redeemable warrants), and subject to the PFIC rules discussed below, a U.S. Holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to\nthe difference between the amount realized and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the securities. See “— Exercise or Lapse of Redeemable Warrants”\nbelow for a discussion regarding a U.S. Holder’s basis in the ordinary share acquired pursuant to the exercise of a warrant.\nThe regular U.S. federal income tax rate on capital gains recognized by U.S. Holders generally is the same as the regular U.S. federal income tax rate on\nordinary income, except that long-term capital gains recognized by non-corporate U.S. Holders generally are subject to U.S. federal income tax at reduced\nrates of tax. Capital gain or loss will constitute long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the securities exceeds one year. The\ndeductibility of capital losses is subject to various limitations.\nAdditional Taxes\nU.S. Holders that are individuals, estates or trusts and whose income exceeds certain thresholds generally will be subject to a 3.8% Medicare contribution\ntax on unearned income, including, without limitation, dividends on, and gains from the sale or other taxable disposition of, our securities, subject to certain\nlimitations and exceptions. Under recently issued regulations, in the absence of a special election, such unearned income generally would not include\nincome inclusions under the qualified electing fund, or QEF rules discussed below under “— Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules,” but would\ninclude distributions of earnings and profits from a QEF. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect, if any, of such tax on their\nownership and disposition of our securities.\nExercise or Lapse of Redeemable Warrants\nSubject to the PFIC rules discussed below, a U.S. Holder generally will not recognize gain or loss upon the acquisition of ordinary shares on the exercise of\nredeemable warrants for cash. Ordinary shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of redeemable warrants for cash will have a tax basis equal to the U.S.\nHolder’s tax basis in the redeemable warrants, increased by the amount paid to exercise the redeemable warrants. The holding period of such ordinary\nshares should begin on the day after the date of exercise of the redeemable warrants. If redeemable warrants are allowed to lapse unexercised, a U.S.\nHolder generally will recognize a capital loss equal to such holder’s adjusted tax basis in the redeemable warrants.\nThe tax consequences of a cashless exercise of redeemable warrants are not clear under current tax law. A cashless exercise may be tax-free, either because\nit is not a realization event (i.e., not a transaction in which gain or loss is realized) or because the transaction is treated as a recapitalization for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes. In either tax-free situation, a U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the ordinary shares received would equal the U.S. Holder’s basis in the\nredeemable warrants. If the cashless exercise were treated as not being a realization event, the U.S. Holder’s holding period in the ordinary shares could be\ntreated as commencing on the date following the date of exercise of the redeemable warrants. If the cashless exercise were treated as a recapitalization, the\nholding period of the ordinary shares received would include the holding period of the redeemable warrants.\n43\nIt is also possible that a cashless exercise could be treated as a taxable exchange in which gain or loss is recognized. In such event, a U.S. Holder could be\ndeemed to have surrendered a number of redeemable warrants with a fair market value equal to the exercise price for the number of redeemable warrants\ndeemed exercised. For this purpose, the number of redeemable warrants deemed exercised would be equal to the number of ordinary shares issued pursuant\nto the cashless exercise of the redeemable warrants. In this situation, the U.S. Holder would recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the\ndifference between the fair market value of the redeemable warrants deemed surrendered to pay the exercise price and the U.S. Holder’s tax basis in such\nredeemable warrants deemed surrendered. Such gain or loss would be long-term or short-term depending on the U.S. Holder’s holding period in the\nredeemable warrants. In this case, a U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the ordinary shares received would equal the sum of the fair market value of the redeemable\nwarrants deemed surrendered to pay the exercise price and the U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the redeemable warrants deemed exercised, and a U.S. Holder’s\nholding period for the ordinary shares should commence on the date following the date of exercise of the redeemable warrants. There also may be\nalternative characterizations of any such taxable exchange that would result in similar tax consequences, except that a U.S. Holder’s gain or loss would be\nshort-term.\nDue to the absence of authority on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a cashless exercise of redeemable warrants it is unclear which, if any, of the\nalternative tax consequences and holding periods described above would be adopted by the IRS or a court of law. Accordingly, U.S. Holders should consult\ntheir tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of a cashless exercise of redeemable warrants.\nPassive Foreign Investment Company Rules\nA foreign (i.e., non-U.S.) corporation will be a PFIC if at least 75% of its gross income in a taxable year of the foreign corporation, including its pro rata\nshare of the gross income of any corporation in which it is considered to own at least 25% of the shares by value, is passive income. Alternatively, a foreign\ncorporation will be a PFIC if at least 50% of its assets in a taxable year of the foreign corporation, ordinarily determined based on fair market value and\naveraged quarterly over the year, including its pro rata share of the assets of any corporation in which it is considered to own at least 25% of the shares by\nvalue, are held for the production of, or produce, passive income. Passive income generally includes dividends, interest, rents and royalties (other than\ncertain rents or royalties derived from the active conduct of a trade or business) and gains from the disposition of passive assets.\nBased on the composition of our assets and the nature of the Company’s income and subsidiaries’ income for our taxable year ended December 31, 2021,\nwe do not expect to be treated as a PFIC for such year and we do not expect to be one for our taxable year ending December 31, 2022 or become one in the\nforeseeable future. Nevertheless, the application of the PFIC rules is subject to ambiguity in several respects and, in addition, we must make a separate\ndetermination each year as to whether we are a PFIC (after the close of each taxable year). Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will not be a PFIC\nfor the current or any other taxable year. Moreover, although we do not believe we would be treated as a PFIC, we have not engaged any U.S. tax advisers\nto determine our PFIC status. In addition, if a U.S. Holder owned our ordinary shares at any time prior to our acquisition of Elite, such U.S. Holder may be\nconsidered to own stock of a PFIC by virtue of the fact that we may have been a PFIC during the period prior to our acquisition of Elite, unless such U.S.\nHolder made either a valid and timely QEF election or a valid and timely mark-to-market election, in each case as described below.\nIf we are determined to be a PFIC for any taxable year (or portion thereof) that is included in the holding period of a U.S. Holder of our shares or\nredeemable warrants and, in the case of our shares, the U.S. Holder did not make either a timely qualified electing fund (“QEF”) election for our first\ntaxable year as a PFIC in which the U.S. Holder held (or was deemed to hold) such shares, a QEF election along with a purging election, or a mark-to-\nmarket election, each as described below, such holder generally will be subject to special rules for regular U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to:\n● any gain recognized by the U.S. Holder on the sale or other disposition of its shares or redeemable warrants; and\n● any “excess distribution” made to the U.S. Holder (generally, any distributions to such U.S. Holder during a taxable year of the U.S. Holder that\nare greater than 125% of the average annual distributions received by such U.S. Holder in respect of the shares or warrants during the three\npreceding taxable years of such U.S. Holder or, if shorter, such U.S. Holder’s holding period for the shares or warrants).\n44\nUnder these rules,\n● the U.S. Holder’s gain or excess distribution will be allocated ratably over the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the shares or redeemable warrants;\n● the amount allocated to the U.S. Holder’s taxable year in which the U.S. Holder recognized the gain or received the excess distribution, or to the\nperiod in the U.S. Holder’s holding period before the first day of our first taxable year in which we are a PFIC, will be taxed as ordinary income;\n● the amount allocated to other taxable years (or portions thereof) of the U.S. Holder and included in its holding period will be taxed at the highest\ntax rate in effect for that year and applicable to the U.S. Holder; and\n● the interest charge generally applicable to underpayments of tax will be imposed in respect of the tax attributable to each such other taxable year\nof the U.S. Holder.\nIn general, if we are determined to be a PFIC, a U.S. Holder may avoid the PFIC tax consequences described above in respect to our shares by making a\ntimely QEF election (or a QEF election along with a purging election, as described below). Pursuant to the QEF election, a U.S. Holder will be required to\ninclude in income its pro rata share of our net capital gains (as long-term capital gain) and other earnings and profits (as ordinary income), on a current\nbasis, in each case whether or not distributed, in the taxable year of the U.S. Holder in which or with which our taxable year ends. A U.S. Holder may make\na separate election to defer the payment of taxes on undistributed income inclusions under the QEF rules, but if deferred, any such taxes will be subject to\nan interest charge.\nA U.S. Holder may not make a QEF election with respect to its redeemable warrants. As a result, if a U.S. Holder sells or otherwise disposes of a\nredeemable warrant (other than upon exercise of the redeemable warrant), any gain recognized generally will be subject to the special tax and interest\ncharge rules treating the gain as an excess distribution, as described above, if we were a PFIC at any time during the period the U.S. Holder held the\nredeemable warrants. If a U.S. Holder that exercises such redeemable warrants properly makes a QEF election with respect to the newly acquired ordinary\nshares (or has previously made a QEF election with respect to our shares), the QEF election will apply to the newly acquired ordinary shares, but the\nadverse tax consequences relating to PFIC shares, adjusted to take into account the current income inclusions resulting from the QEF election, will\ncontinue to apply with respect to such newly acquired ordinary shares (which generally will be deemed to have a holding period for purposes of the PFIC\nrules that includes the period the U.S. Holder held the redeemable warrants), unless the U.S. Holder makes a purging election with respect to such shares.\nThe purging election creates a deemed sale of such shares at their fair market value. The gain recognized by the purging election will be subject to the\nspecial tax and interest charge rules treating the gain as an excess distribution, as described above. As a result of the purging election, the U.S. Holder will\nincrease the adjusted tax basis in its ordinary shares acquired upon the exercise of the redeemable warrants by the gain recognized and will also have a new\nholding period in such ordinary shares for purposes of the PFIC rules.\nThe QEF election is made on a shareholder-by-shareholder basis and, once made, can be revoked only with the consent of the IRS. A U.S. Holder generally\nmakes a QEF election by attaching a completed IRS Form 8621 (Information Return by a Shareholder of a Passive Foreign Investment Company or\nQualified Electing Fund), including the information provided in a PFIC annual information statement, to a timely filed U.S. federal income tax return for\nthe taxable year to which the election relates. Retroactive QEF elections generally may be made only by filing a protective statement with such return and if\ncertain other conditions are met or with the consent of the IRS.\nIn order to comply with the requirements of a QEF election, a U.S. Holder must receive certain information from us. Upon request from a U.S. Holder, we\nwill endeavor to provide to the U.S. Holder no later than 90 days after the request such information as the IRS may require, including a PFIC annual\ninformation statement, in order to enable the U.S. Holder to make and maintain a QEF election. However, there is no assurance that we will have timely\nknowledge of our status as a PFIC in the future or of the required information to be provided.\n45\nIf a U.S. Holder has made a QEF election with respect to our shares and the special tax and interest charge rules do not apply to such shares (because of a\ntimely QEF election for our first taxable year as a PFIC in which the U.S. Holder holds (or is deemed to hold) such shares or a QEF election, along with a\npurge of the PFIC taint pursuant to a purging election, as described above), any gain recognized on the sale or other taxable disposition of our shares\ngenerally will be taxable as capital gain and no interest charge will be imposed. As discussed above, for regular U.S. federal income tax purposes, U.S.\nHolders of a QEF are currently taxed on their pro rata shares of the QEF’s earnings and profits, whether or not distributed. In such case, a subsequent\ndistribution of such earnings and profits that were previously included in income generally should not be taxable as a dividend to such U.S. Holders. The\nadjusted tax basis of a U.S. Holder’s shares in a QEF will be increased by amounts that are included in income, and decreased by amounts distributed but\nnot taxed as dividends, under the above rules. Similar basis adjustments apply to property if by reason of holding such property the U.S. Holder is treated\nunder the applicable attribution rules as owning shares in a QEF.\nAlthough a determination as to our PFIC status will be made annually, the initial determination that we are a PFIC generally will apply for subsequent years\nto a U.S. Holder who held shares or redeemable warrants while we were a PFIC, whether or not we meet the test for PFIC status in those subsequent years,\nunless such U.S. Holder made a purging election as described below. A U.S. Holder who makes the QEF election discussed above for our first taxable year\nas a PFIC in which the U.S. Holder holds (or is deemed to hold) our shares, however, will not be subject to the PFIC tax and interest charge rules discussed\nabove in respect to such shares. In addition, such U.S. Holder will not be subject to the QEF inclusion regime with respect to such shares for any of our\ntaxable years that end within or with a taxable year of the U.S. Holder and in which we are not a PFIC. On the other hand, if the QEF election is not\neffective for each of our taxable years in which we are a PFIC and during which the U.S. Holder holds (or is deemed to hold) our shares, the PFIC rules\ndiscussed above will continue to apply to such shares unless the holder files on a timely filed U.S. income tax return (including extensions) a QEF election\nand a purging election to recognize under the rules of Section 1291 of the Code any gain that the U.S. Holder would otherwise recognize if the U.S. Holder\nhad sold our shares for their fair market value on the “qualification date.” The qualification date is the first day of our tax year in which we qualify as a\nQEF with respect to such U.S. Holder. The purging election can only be made if such U.S. Holder held our ordinary shares on the qualification date. The\ngain recognized by the purging election will be subject to the special tax and interest charge rules treating the gain as an excess distribution, as described\nabove. As a result of the purging election, the U.S. Holder will increase the adjusted tax basis in its ordinary shares by the amount of the gain recognized\nand will also have a new holding period in the shares for purposes of the PFIC rules.\nIf a U.S. Holder did not make a timely “mark-to-market” election (as described above), and if we were a PFIC at any time during the period such U.S.\nHolder held our ordinary shares, then such ordinary shares will continue to be treated as stock of a PFIC with respect to such U.S. Holder even if we cease\nto be a PFIC in a future year, unless such U.S. Holder makes a “purging election” for the year we cease to be a PFIC. A “purging election” creates a\ndeemed sale of such ordinary shares at their fair market value on the last day of the last year in which we are treated as a PFIC. The gain recognized by the\npurging election will be subject to the special tax and interest charge rules treating the gain as an excess distribution, as described above. As a result of the\npurging election, such U.S. Holder will have a new tax basis (equal to the fair market value of the ordinary shares on the last day of the last year in which\nwe are treated as a PFIC) and tax holding period (which new holding period will begin the day after such last day) in such ordinary shares.\nAs an alternative to the QEF election, if a U.S. Holder, at the close of its taxable year, owns shares in a PFIC that are treated as marketable stock, the U.S.\nHolder may make a mark-to-market election with respect to such shares for such taxable year. If the U.S. Holder makes a valid mark-to-market election for\nthe first taxable year of the U.S. Holder in which the U.S. Holder holds (or is deemed to hold) our shares and for which we are determined to be a PFIC,\nsuch holder generally will not be subject to the PFIC rules described above in respect to its shares. Instead, in general, the U.S. Holder will include as\nordinary income each year the excess, if any, of the fair market value of its shares at the end of its taxable year over the adjusted tax basis in its shares. The\nU.S. Holder also will be allowed to take an ordinary loss in respect of the excess, if any, of the adjusted tax basis of its shares over the fair market value of\nits shares at the end of its taxable year (but only to the extent of the net amount of previously included income as a result of the mark-to-market election).\nThe U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in its shares will be adjusted to reflect any such income or loss amounts, and any further gain recognized on a sale or\nother taxable disposition of the shares will be treated as ordinary income. Currently, a mark-to-market election may not be made with respect to our\nredeemable warrants.\n46\nThe mark-to-market election is available only for stock that is regularly traded on a national securities exchange that is registered with the Securities and\nExchange Commission, including the NASDAQ Capital Market, or on a foreign exchange or market that the IRS determines has rules sufficient to ensure\nthat the market price represents a legitimate and sound fair market value. Although our ordinary shares are listed and traded on the NASDAQ Capital\nMarket, we cannot guarantee that our shares will continue to be listed and traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market. U.S. Holders should consult their own\ntax advisors regarding the availability and tax consequences of a mark-to-market election in respect to our shares under their particular circumstances.\nIf we are a PFIC and, at any time, have a foreign subsidiary that is classified as a PFIC, a U.S. Holder generally would be deemed to own a portion of the\nshares of such lower-tier PFIC, and generally could incur liability for the deferred tax and interest charge described above if we receive a distribution from,\nor dispose of all or part of our interest in, or the U.S. Holder otherwise were deemed to have disposed of an interest in, the lower-tier PFIC. Upon request,\nwe will endeavor to cause any lower-tier PFIC to provide to a U.S. Holder no later than 90 days after the request the information that may be required to\nmake or maintain a QEF election with respect to the lower-tier PFIC. However, there is no assurance that we will have timely knowledge of the status of\nany such lower-tier PFIC, and we do not plan to make annual determinations or otherwise notify U.S. Holders of the PFIC status of any such lower-tier\nPFIC. There also is no assurance that we will be able to cause the lower-tier PFIC to provide the required information. U.S. Holders are urged to consult\ntheir own tax advisors regarding the tax issues raised by lower-tier PFICs.\nA U.S. Holder that owns (or is deemed to own) shares in a PFIC during any taxable year of the U.S. Holder may have to file an IRS Form 8621 (whether or\nnot a QEF election or mark-to-market election is or has been made) with such U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax return and provide such other\ninformation as may be required by the U.S. Treasury Department.\nThe rules dealing with PFICs and with the QEF and mark-to-market elections are very complex and are affected by various factors in addition to those\ndescribed above. Accordingly, U.S. Holders of our shares and redeemable warrants should consult their own tax advisors concerning the application of the\nPFIC rules to our shares and redeemable warrants under their particular circumstances.\nNon-U.S. Holders\nDividends (including constructive dividends) paid or deemed paid to a Non-U.S. Holder in respect to our securities generally will not be subject to U.S.\nfederal income tax, unless the dividends are effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business within the United States (and,\nif required by an applicable income tax treaty, are attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base that such holder maintains or maintained in the\nUnited States).\nIn addition, a Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain attributable to a sale or other taxable disposition of our\nsecurities unless such gain is effectively connected with its conduct of a trade or business in the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax\ntreaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base that such holder maintains or maintained in the United States) or the Non-U.S. Holder is an\nindividual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of sale or other disposition and certain other conditions are met (in\nwhich case, such gain from U.S. sources generally is subject to U.S. federal income tax at a 30% rate or a lower applicable tax treaty rate).\nDividends and gains that are effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the United States (and, if required by an\napplicable income tax treaty, are attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base that such holder maintains or maintained in the United States)\ngenerally will be subject to regular U.S. federal income tax at the same regular U.S. federal income tax rates applicable to a comparable U.S. Holder and, in\nthe case of a Non-U.S. Holder that is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, may also be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a 30%\nrate or a lower applicable tax treaty rate.\nThe U.S. federal income tax treatment of a Non-U.S. Holder’s exercise of redeemable warrants, or the lapse of redeemable warrants held by a Non-U.S.\nHolder, generally will correspond to the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the exercise or lapse of redeemable warrants by a U.S. Holder, as described\nunder “U.S. Holders — Exercise or Lapse of Redeemable Warrants” above.\n47\nBackup Withholding and Information Reporting\nIn general, information reporting for U.S. federal income tax purposes should apply to distributions made on our securities within the United States to a\nU.S. Holder (other than an exempt recipient) and to the proceeds from sales and other dispositions of our securities by a U.S. Holder (other than an exempt\nrecipient) to or through a U.S. office of a broker. Payments made (and sales and other dispositions effected at an office) outside the United States will be\nsubject to information reporting in limited circumstances. In addition, certain information concerning a U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in its securities and\nadjustments to that tax basis and whether any gain or loss with respect to such securities is long-term or short-term also may be required to be reported to\nthe IRS, and certain holders may be required to file an IRS Form 8938 (Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets) to report their interest in our\nsecurities.\nMoreover, backup withholding of U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 28% generally will apply to dividends paid on our securities to a U.S. Holder (other\nthan an exempt recipient) and the proceeds from sales and other dispositions of shares or warrants by a U.S. Holder (other than an exempt recipient), in\neach case who\n● fails to provide an accurate taxpayer identification number;\n● is notified by the IRS that backup withholding is required; or\n● in certain circumstances, fails to comply with applicable certification requirements.\nA Non-U.S. Holder generally may eliminate the requirement for information reporting and backup withholding by providing certification of its foreign\nstatus, under penalties of perjury, on a duly executed applicable IRS Form W-8 or by otherwise establishing an exemption. Backup withholding is not an\nadditional tax. Rather, the amount of any backup withholding will be allowed as a credit against a U.S. Holder’s or a Non-U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal\nincome tax liability and may entitle such holder to a refund, provided that certain required information is timely furnished to the IRS. Holders are urged to\nconsult their own tax advisors regarding the application of backup withholding and the availability of and procedures for obtaining an exemption from\nbackup withholding in their particular circumstances.\nF.

Subsidiary Information\nNot applicable.\n48\nITEM 11. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe deposit any surplus funds with Chinese banks earning daily interest. We do not invest in any instruments for trading purposes. Our operations generally\nare not directly sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates and we currently do not have any long-term debt outstanding. Management monitors the banks’\nprime rates in conjunction with our cash requirements to determine the appropriate level of debt balances relative to other sources of funds. We have not\nentered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to interest rate risk.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nThe reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, but the Group has a subsidiary in China primarily involved in the administration and accounting functions of the\nGroup. Its operating expenses are denominated in RMB and its annual expenditure is in the region of RMB 1 million. There is exposure to the fluctuations\nin the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the RMB but its impact on our results is considered minimal given the current level of expenditure.\nInflation\nInflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results. Although we do not believe\nthat inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse\neffect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues if the selling\nprices of our products do not increase with these increased costs.\nITEM 12.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of December 31, 2023 our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls\nand procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the year covered by this report. Disclosure controls\nand procedure include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the\nreports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management as appropriate to allow timely\ndecisions regarding required disclosure. Our Management is responsible for monitoring the process pursuant to which information is gathered and\nanalyzing such information to determine the extent to which such information requires disclosure, in the reports filed with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission.\nBased on such evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that as of December 31, 2023, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were\nineffective due to the Company’s lacks of formal documented controls and procedures applicable to all officers and directors to disclose the required\ninformation under the Exchange Act.\nWe have appointed outside independent directors, established board committees, strengthened the financial personnel and introduced written policies and\nprocedures.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting\nis defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act. It is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s\nprincipal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company’s board of directors, management and other personnel. The objective is to\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance\nwith accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that:\n● Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the\ncompany;\n● Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made\nonly in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and\n● Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets\nthat could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.\nTherefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and\npresentation. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely\nbasis by the internal controls over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore,\nit is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.\n50\nAs December 31, 2023 management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal\ncontrol over financial reporting established in by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission’s 2013 Internal Control\nIntegrated Framework and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. Based on that evaluation, they concluded that, during the period covered by this\nreport, such internal controls and procedures were not effective to detect the inappropriate application of US GAAP rules. This was primarily due to\ndeficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls. These\ndeficiencies may be considered to be material weaknesses.\nIdentified Material Weakness\nA material weakness in internal control over financial reporting is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a\nremote likelihood that a material misstatement of the financial statements will not be prevented or detected.\nManagement identified the following material weaknesses during its assessment of internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023:\n(1) A lack of understanding of the requirements of NASDAQ, made worse by a poor or no command of the English language\n(2) Mining records were not kept to the required standard and were not updated due to a lack of understanding of the various monitoring links and\nplatforms.\nAs a result of the material weaknesses described above, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2023 based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by COSO (2013 framework).\nHowever, management does not believe that any of our annual or interim financial statements issued to date contain a material misstatement as a result of\nthe aforementioned weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement’s Remediation Initiatives\nTo mediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies, we have introduced the following measures:\n(1) Continue to educate senior management on the continuing listing requirements of NASDAQ\n(2) Design and monitor controls over financial reporting, including the documentation of various checks and balances to monitor and reconcile\ndifferences in mining revenue.\nChanges in internal controls over financial reporting\nExcept as described above, there have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this\nReport that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.\nITEM 16.

Our board of directors has determined all three are\n“independent directors” within the meaning of NASDAQ Stock Market Rule 5605(a)(2) and meet the criteria for independence set forth in Rule 10A−3(b)\nof the Exchange Act. Khuat Leok Choong, Lionel meets the criteria of an audit committee financial expert as set forth under the applicable rules of the\nSEC.\nITEM 16B. CODE OF ETHICS\nOur board of directors has adopted a code of business conduct and ethics. The purpose of the code is to promote ethical conduct and deter\nwrongdoing. The policies outlined in the Code are designed to ensure that our directors, executive officers and employees act in accordance with not only\nthe letter but also the spirit of the laws and regulations that apply to our business. We expect our directors, executive officers and employees to exercise\ngood judgment, to uphold these standards in their day-to-day activities, and to comply with all applicable policies and procedures in the course of their\nrelationship with the company. During fiscal year 2022, no amendments to or waivers from the Code were made or given for any of our executive officers.\nOur code of business conduct and ethics are publicly available on our website at http://www.abitsgroup.com.\n51\nITEM 16C. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES\nAudit Alliance LLP was appointed by the Company to serve as its independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended December 31,\n2023 and 2022.\nThe following table sets forth the aggregate fees by categories specified below in connection with certain professional services rendered by our\nprincipal external auditors, for the periods indicated.\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nAudit fees (1) $ 100,000 $ 90,000\nAudit related fees (2) - -\nTax fees (3) - -\nAll other fees (4) - -\nTotal $ 100,000 $ 90,000\n(1) “Audit fees” means the aggregate fees billed for each of the fiscal years for professional services rendered by our principal accountant for the audit of\nour annual financial statements or services that are normally provided by the accountant in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or\nengagements for those fiscal years.\n(2) “Audit related fees” means the aggregate fees billed for each of the fiscal years for assurance and related services by our principal accountant that are\nreasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of our financial statements and are not reported under paragraph (1).\n(3) “Tax Fees” represents the aggregate fees billed in each of the fiscal years listed for the professional tax services rendered by our principal auditors.\n(4) “All Other Fees” represents the aggregate fees billed in each of the fiscal years listed for services rendered by our principal auditors other than services\nreported under “Audit fees,” “Audit-related fees” and “Tax fees.”\nThe policy of our audit committee and our board of directors is to pre-approve all audit and non-audit services provided by our principal auditors,\nincluding audit services, audit-related services, and other services as described above, other than those for de minimis services which are approved by the\naudit committee or our board of directors prior to the completion of the services.\nITEM 16D.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nWe are incorporated in the British Virgin Islands and our corporate governance practices are governed by applicable British Virgin Islands law. In\naddition, because our ordinary shares are listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market, we are subject to Nasdaq’s corporate governance requirements.\nOther than as described in this section, our corporate governance practices do not differ from those followed by domestic companies listed on the\nNASDAQ Capital Market. NASDAQ Listing Rule 5635 (“NASDAQ Rule 5635”) generally provides that shareholder approval is required of U.S.\ndomestic companies listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market prior to an issuance (or potential issuance) of securities in connection with: (i) the acquisition\nof the stock or assets of another company; (ii) equity-based compensation of officers, directors, employees or consultants; (iii) a change of control; and (iv)\ncertain transactions other than a public offering involving issuances equaling 20% or more of the Company’s ordinary shares or voting power for less than\nthe greater of market or book value. Notwithstanding this general requirement, NASDAQ Listing Rule 5615(a)(3)(A) permits foreign private issuers like\nthe Company to follow their home country practice rather than this shareholder approval requirement. The corporate governance practice in our home\ncountry, the British Virgin Islands, does not require to obtain such shareholder approval prior to entering into a transaction with the potential to issue\nsecurities as described in NASDAQ Rule 5635 above. The Company has adopted and opted to follow British Virgin Islands practices in lieu of the\nrequirements of NASDAQ Rule 5635 in connection with an issuance of securities.\nITEM 16H.

CYBERSECURITY\nRisk Management and Strategy\nWe have implemented processes for assessing, identifying and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats and monitoring the prevention, detection,\nmitigation and remediation of material cybersecurity incident.\nOur facility network at Duffis setup with a Fortigate 100F firewall and Cisco Catalyst 3850 coreswitch stack. The Cisco LAN network is configured with\nindividual per rack Vlans with no access to any other racks so that if a problem were to ever occur that they are isolated to single rack networks and could\nnot effect other racks in the facility.\nAccess to coreswitch, server, firewall, and camera systems is limited to only two executives, the site manager and the general manager. Passwords are not\nshared and office network, camera segments, server infrastructure all have their own individual networks as well. There is no guest wifi setup and only an\noffice network with which the techs can diagnose and resolve network issues/troubleshoot miners.\nPhysical access to site has been addressed as server cabinets/network switches are under lock and key. The facility itself has a great amount of physical\nsecurity as well in regards to being able to physically access networks and miners, locked gates and doors are in place at all times. Remote access to the site\nis limited to tech level access via foreman, and adminstrator access to authorized personnel only. Remote access to servers and internal systems is limited to\nthe site manager and general manager only.\nOur General Manager is engaged in continuous monitoring of our applications, systems and infrastructure to ensure prompt identification and response to\npotential cybersecurity issues, including emerging cybersecurity threats. Given our current scale of operation, the Company does not have the resources to\nengage third parties to assess our internal cybersecurity programs and compliance with applicable practices and standards.]\nGovernance\nOur Company’s Board of Directors has oversight responsibility for the Company’s overall risk management, including cybersecurity risks, and has not\ndelegated oversight authority for cybersecurity risks to any committee. Our management, led by our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is\nresponsible for assessing, identifying and managing material cybersecurity risks and threats to our Company and monitoring the prevention, detection,\nmitigation and remediation of material cybersecurity incidents if any.\nIn 2023, we did not identify any cybersecurity threats that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our business strategy, results\nof operations, or financial condition. However, we face potential cybersecurity threats that, if realized, would materially affect us. These threats include but\nare not limited to ransomware and malware attacks, and compromised business email and other social engineering threats. Our service providers, suppliers\nand business partners also face similar cybersecurity risks, which could have an adverse impact on our business. Additional information on cybersecurity\nrisks we face is discussed in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors - Risks due to hacking or adverse software event”; - Cryptocurrencies, including those\nmaintained by or for us, may be exposed to cybersecurity threats and hacks.”\n53\nPART III\nITEM 17.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial positions of the Company as of December 31,\n2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of America.\nExplanatory Paragraph\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company retrospectively changed its accounting for digital assets.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial\nstatements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor\nwere we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of\ninternal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and\nperforming procedures that respond to those risks.

Organization and nature of operations\nThe Company was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands (BVI) on May 18, 2021. On August 17, 2021, the Company completed a redomicile merger\nwith its predecessor company, Moxian, Inc, wherein it acquired all the assets, liabilities, rights, obligations and operations of the latter and its subsidiaries,\nthrough an exchange of an identical number of shares.\nOn December 28, 2021 in a Special Meeting of shareholders, the Company approved the issue of up to 20 million new ordinary shares of the Company, at a\nprice of $2.50 per share to certain non-US based accredited investors. On February 11, 2022 the Company completed this private placement and issued 16\nmillion new shares, raising $40 million, which it has used in bitcoin mining operations.\nThe Company operates in the United States of America through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Abit USA, Inc which has a mining facility in the town of\nDuff, Eastern Tennessee.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the activities of the Company and each of the following entities:\nName of entity Background Ownership\nAbit Hong Kong Limited Investment Holding 100% owned by Abits Group Inc\nAbit USA, Inc. Bitcoin Mining 100% owned by Abit Hong Kong Limited\nBeijing Bitmatrix Technology Co. Ltd In-house Support Services 100% owned by Abit Hong Kong Limited\n2. Summary of principal accounting policies\nBasis of presentation and consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in\nthe United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and include all the subsidiaries of the Group. The financial year-end of the Company is December 31. The\nconsolidated results are presented as of the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. All intercompany transactions and balances have been\neliminated in the consolidation.\nFair value of financial instruments\nThe Company follows the provisions of ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.” ASC 820 clarifies the definition of fair value, prescribes\nmethods for measuring fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:\nLevel 1-Observable inputs such as unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date.\nLevel 2-Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and\nliabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market\ndata.\nLevel 3-Inputs are unobservable inputs that reflect management’s assumptions based on the best available information.\nThe carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, prepayments, deposits and other receivables, accruals and other payables, loans from related parties and\nunrelated party approximate their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments.\nF-6\nABITS GROUP INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n2. Summary of principal accounting policies (continued)\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the accompanying consolidated\nfinancial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates required to be made by\nmanagement include but not limited to, useful lives of property and equipment, provision for doubtful accounts, intangible assets valuation, inventory\nvaluation, value added recoverable valuation and deferred tax assets valuation. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash includes cash on hand and demand deposits in accounts maintained with commercial banks. The Company considers all highly liquid investment\ninstruments with an original maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.\nThe Company considers all short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and have original maturities of three\nmonths or less to be cash equivalents.\nPrepayments, deposits and other receivables\nPrepayments and deposits represent amounts advanced to suppliers. The suppliers usually require advance payments or deposits when the Company makes\npurchase or orders service and the prepayments and deposits will be utilized to offset the Company’s future payments. Other receivables mainly consist of\nvarious cash advances to employees for business needs. These amounts are unsecured, non-interest bearing and generally short-term in nature.\nAllowances are recorded when utilization and collection of amounts due are in doubt. Delinquent prepayments, deposits and other receivables are written-\noff after management has determined that the likelihood of utilization or collection is not probable and known bad debts are written off against the\nallowances when identified.\nProperty, Equipment and Vehicles, net\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Significant additions or improvements extending useful lives\nof assets are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line\nmethod over the estimated useful lives as follows:\nElectronic and mining equipment 3-6 years\nFurniture and fixtures 3-6 years\nVehicles 3 years\nThe Company owns the land used for its mining center; There is no depreciation on this land.\nIntangible assets, net\nIntangible assets, comprising Intellectual property rights (“IP rights”) and software, which are separable from property and equipment, are stated at cost\nless accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of 3- 10 years.\nF-7\nABITS GROUP INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nThe Company classifies its long-lived assets into: (i) computer and office equipment; (ii) furniture and fixtures, (iii) leasehold improvements, and (iv)\nfinite-lived intangible assets.\nLong-lived assets held and used by the Company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value\nof such assets may not be fully recoverable. It is possible that these assets could become impaired as a result of technology, economy or other industry\nchanges. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group to be tested for possible impairment, the Company first compares undiscounted cash\nflows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset or asset group is not\nrecoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Fair value is\ndetermined through various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models, relief from royalty income approach, quoted market values and\nthird-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary.\nThe Company makes various assumptions and estimates regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair values of the\nrespective assets. The assumptions and estimates used to determine future values and remaining useful lives of long-lived assets are complex and\nsubjective. They can be affected by various factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as the\nCompany’s business strategy and its forecasts for specific market expansion.\nDigital assets\nDigital assets are included in non-current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Digital assets purchased are recorded at cost and digital\nassets awarded to the Company through its mining activities are accounted for in connection with the Company’s revenue recognition policy disclosed\nbelow.\nDigital assets held are accounted for as intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized but\nassessed for impairment annually, or more frequently, when events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that it is more likely than not that the\nindefinite-lived asset is impaired. Impairment exists when the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, which is measured using the quoted price of the\ndigital assets at the time its fair value is being measured. In testing for impairment, the Company has the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to\ndetermine whether it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. If it is determined that it is not more likely than not that an impairment exists, a\nquantitative impairment test is not necessary. If the Company concludes otherwise, it is required to perform a quantitative impairment test. To the extent an\nimpairment loss is recognized, the loss establishes the new cost basis of the asset. Subsequent reversal of impairment losses is not permitted.\nMeanwhile, on December 13, 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-08, which addresses the accounting and disclosure requirements for certain crypto assets.\nThe new guidance requires entities to subsequently measure certain crypto assets at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in net income in each\nreporting period. For all entities, the ASU’s amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, including interim periods within\nthose years. Early adoption is permitted. If an entity adopts the amendments in an interim period, it must adopt them as of the beginning of the fiscal year\nthat includes that interim period.\nEffective January 1, 2023, the Company early adopted ASU 2023-08, which requires entities to measure crypto assets at fair value with changes recognized\nin the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss) each reporting period.\nThe Company’s digital assets are within the scope of ASU 2023-08 and the transition guidance requires a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the beginning\nof the current fiscal year for any difference between the carrying amount of the Company’s digital assets and fair value.\nPurchases of digital assets by the Company, if any, will be included within investing activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows,\nwhile digital assets awarded to the Company through its mining activities are included within operating activities on the accompanying consolidated\nstatements of cash flows. The sales of digital assets are included within investing activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows and\nany realized gains or losses from such sales are included in “realized gain (loss) on exchange of digital assets” in the consolidated statements of operations\nand comprehensive income (loss). The Company accounts for its gains or losses in accordance with the first-in first-out method of accounting.\nF-8\nABITS GROUP INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nRevenue recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”).\nThe Company has entered into digital asset mining pools by executing contracts with mining pool operators to provide computing power to the mining\npool. The Company’s enforceable right to compensation begins only when, and lasts as long as, the Company provides computing power to the mining\npool operator and is created as power is provided over time. The only consideration due to the Company relates to the provision of computing power. The\ncontracts are terminable at any time by and at no cost to the Company, and by the pool operator under certain conditions specified in the contract. Providing\ncomputing power in digital asset transaction verification services is an output of the Company’s ordinary activities. Providing such computing power is the\nonly performance obligation in the Company’s contracts with mining pool operators.\nThe transaction consideration the Company receives, if any, is noncash consideration in the form of bitcoin. Changes in the fair value of the noncash\nconsideration due to form of the consideration (changes in the market price of Bitcoin) are not included in the transaction price and therefore, are not\nincluded in revenue. Certain mining pool operators charge fees to cover the costs of maintaining the pool and are deducted from amounts we may otherwise\nearn and are treated as a reduction to the consideration received. Fees fluctuate and historically have been no more than approximately 2% per reward\nearned, on average.\nIn exchange for providing computing power, the Company is entitled to either:\na Full-Pay-Per-Share pay out of bitcoin based on a contractual formula, which primarily calculates the hash rate provided by the Company to the mining\npool as a percentage of total network hash rate, and other inputs. The Company is entitled to consideration even if a block is not successfully placed by the\nmining pool operator. The contract is in effect until terminated by either party.\nThe consideration is all variable. Because it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue will not occur and the Company is able to calculate\nthe payout based on the contractual formula, noncash revenue is estimated and recognized based on the spot price of Bitcoin determined using the\nCompany’s primary trading platform for bitcoin at the inception of each contract, which is determined to be daily. Non cash consideration is measured at\nfair value at contract inception. Fair value of the crypto asset consideration is determined using the quoted price on the Company’s primary trading platform\nfor bitcoin at the beginning of the contract period at the single bitcoin level (one bitcoin). This amount is estimated and recognized in revenue upon\ninception, which is when hash rate is provided.\nOr:\na fractional share of the fixed Bitcoin award the mining pool operator receives (less digital asset transaction fees to the mining pool operator which are\nimmaterial and are recorded as a deduction from revenue) for successfully adding a block to the blockchain based on a proportion of the Company’s\n“scoring hash rate” to the pool’s “scoring hash rate” where the scoring hash rate as defined by the pool is the exponential moving average of the hash power\ncontributed by the Company or by all pool members combined. The Company’s fractional share of the bitcoin reward is based on the proportion of\ncomputing power the Company contributed to the mining pool operator to the total computing power contributed by all mining pool participants in solving\nthe current algorithm.\nIncome taxes\nThe Company utilizes ASC Topic 740 (“ASC 740”) “Income taxes”, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected\nfuture tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred income taxes\nare recognized for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at\neach period end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.\nValuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nASC 740 “Income taxes” clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. This interpretation requires that an entity recognizes in the financial\nstatements the impact of a tax position, if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the\nposition. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or\nmeasurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company has elected to classify interest and penalties related to\nunrecognized tax benefits, if and when required, as part of income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company evaluate the\nlevel of authority for each uncertain tax position (including the potential application of interest and penalties) based on the technical merits, and measure\nthe unrecognized benefits associated with the tax positions. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company did not have any\nunrecognized tax benefits. The Company does not anticipate any significant increase to its liability for unrecognized tax benefit within the next 12 months.\nF-9\nABITS GROUP INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nForeign currency transactions and translation\nThe reporting currency of the Company is United States Dollars (the “USD”).\nFor financial reporting purposes, the financial statements of the foreign-incorporated subsidiaries are prepared using their respective functional currencies,\nand then translated into the reporting currency, USD so to be consolidated with the Company’s. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies\nother than the reporting currency are translated into the reporting currency at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses\nare translated using average rates prevailing during the reporting period. Adjustments resulting from the translation are recorded as a separate component of\naccumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ deficiency. Translation losses are recognized in the statements of operations and comprehensive\nloss.\nThe exchange rates applied are as follows:\nDecember 31, December 31,\nBalance sheet items, except for equity accounts 2023 2022\nRMB:USD 7.0827 6.8979\nHKD:USD 7.8157 7.7990\nItems in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss, and statements cash flows:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nRMB:USD 7.0467 6.4525\nHKD:USD 7.8284 7.7727\nEarnings per share\nBasic gain per share is based on the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period while the effects of potential ordinary shares\noutstanding during the period are included in diluted earnings per share.\nFASB Accounting Standard Codification Topic 260 (“ASC 260”), “Earnings Per Share,” requires that employee equity share options, non-vested shares and\nsimilar equity instruments granted to employees be treated as potential ordinary shares in computing diluted earnings per share. Diluted earnings per share\nshould be based on the actual number of options or shares granted and not yet forfeited, unless doing so would be anti-dilutive. The Company uses the\n“treasury stock” method for equity instruments granted in share-based payment transactions provided in ASC 260 to determine diluted earnings per share.\nAntidilutive securities represent potentially dilutive securities which are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings or loss per share as their impact\nwas antidilutive.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Company continually assesses any new accounting pronouncements to determine their applicability. When it is determined that a new accounting\npronouncement affects the Company’s financial reporting, the Company undertakes a study to determine the consequences of the change to its consolidated\nfinancial statements and assures that there are proper controls in place to ascertain that the Company’s consolidated financial statements properly reflect the\nchange.\nF-10\nABITS GROUP INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement\nof Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which was codified with its subsequent amendments as Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 326,\nFinancial Instruments – Credit Losses (“ASC 326”). ASC 326 seeks to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the\nexpected credit losses on financial instruments, including trade receivables, and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each\nreporting date. The amendments require an entity to replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in other GAAP with a methodology that reflects\ncurrent expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. The\nupdated guidance is effective for the Company for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022, and early adoption is permitted. In\nconnection with the Company’s acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2021 and the\nadoption did not have a material impact on the financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (“ASU 2019-12”), which is\nintended to simplify various aspects related to accounting for income taxes. ASU 2019-12 removes certain exceptions to the general principles in ASC\nTopic 740 and also clarifies and amends existing guidance to improve consistent application. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods\nwithin those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2020 and\nthe adoption did not have a material impact on the financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn May 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-04, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt-Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50),Compensation-\nStock Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40), (“ASU 2021-04”).This ASU reduces\ndiversity in an issuer’s accounting for modifications or exchanges of freestanding equity-classified written call options (for example, warrants) that remain\nequity classified after modification or exchange. This ASU provides guidance for a modification or an exchange of a freestanding equity-classified written\ncall option that is not within the scope of another Topic. It specifically addresses: (1) how an entity should treat a modification of the terms or conditions or\nan exchange of a freestanding equity-classified written call option that remains equity classified after modification or exchange; (2) how an entity should\nmeasure the effect of a modification or an exchange of a freestanding equity-classified written call option that remains equity classified after modification\nor exchange; and (3) how an entity should recognize the effect of a modification or an exchange of a freestanding equity-classified written call option that\nremains equity classified after modification or exchange. This ASU will be effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. An\nentity should apply the amendments prospectively to modifications or exchanges occurring on or after the effective date of the amendments. Early adoption\nis permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The adoption of ASU 2021-04 on January 1, 2022 did not have a material impact on the Company’s\nfinancial statements.\nThe Company’s management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, authoritative guidance, if currently adopted, would have\na material impact on the Company’s financial statement presentation or disclosures.\nF-11\nABITS GROUP INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n3.

Divestment of a subsidiary\nIn July 2022, the Company divested its entire interest in Moxian (Hong Kong) Liu Jian Tao for a consideration of HK$1,000, based on a willing buyer,\nwilling seller basis. Moxian (Hong Kong) Limited is a holding company with interests in several wholly-owned subsidiaries in Shenzhen, Beijing,\nShanghai and Malaysia as well as a variable entity in Shenzhen and has made losses since inception. and have been largely dormant since September 2018.\nThe directors consider this divestment to be in the best interests of the Company as it has decided to pursue other business opportunities which are based\noutside the People’s Republic of China. The divested company and its subsidiary companies have had many years of losses since their inception and have\ngradually ceased business operations because of a lack of working capital, little or no market penetration and highly competitive pressure.\nThe gains on this divestment is stated after accounting for the interest in Moxian (Hong Kong) which is the funding vehicle through which advances had\nbeen made for the working capital requirements of the subsidiaries and the variable interest entity, less the consolidation of past losses in its financial\nstatements. In a related development, the Company also wrote off its carrying value in its entire interest in Moxian CN Group China Limited, the holding\ncompany of Moxian (Hong Kong) Limited as there was no longer any purpose to retain the company.\nDetails of the transaction:\nGain on divestment of the interest in Moxian (Hong Kong) Limited $ 406,938\nWrite-off of the cost of investment in Moxian CN China Limited (1,000,001)\n8. Income taxes\nThe Company and its subsidiary companies file separate income tax returns.\nThe United States of America\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”) was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code.\nChanges include, but are not limited to, a U.S. corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the\ntransition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed\nrepatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017. As the Company has a December 31 fiscal year-end, the lower corporate income tax\nrate will be phased in, resulting in a U.S. statutory federal rate of approximately 24.5% for our fiscal year ending December 31, 2018, and 21% for\nsubsequent fiscal years. Accordingly, we have to remeasure our deferred tax assets on net operating loss carryforward in the U.S. at the lower enacted\ncooperated tax rate of 21%. However, this re-measurement has no effect on the Company’s income tax expenses as the Company has provided a 100%\nvaluation allowance on its deferred tax assets previously.\nAdditionally, the Tax Act imposes a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of historical earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and future foreign earnings\nare subject to U.S. taxation. The change in rate has caused us to remeasure all U.S. deferred income tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences and\nnet operating loss (NOL) carryforwards and recorded a one-time income tax payable in 8 years.\nF-13\nABITS GROUP INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAbit USA, Inc was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on April 27, 2022.\nBritish Virgin Islands\nMoxian BVI is incorporated in the British Virgin Islands.

As of\nDecember 31, 2023, a total of 35,554,677 ordinary shares were issued and outstanding and 5,000,000 preferred shares issued and outstanding. The ordinary\nshares are registered for trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the trading symbol “ABTS”.\nCapitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings given to them in the annual report on Form 20-F.\nThis Exhibit sets forth a description of our ordinary shares and certain provisions of our memorandum and articles of association which are\nsummaries and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, which\nwas previously filed as Exhibit 99.1 to the Company’s current report on Form 6-K on December 6, 2021 (referred to hereafter as our “Memorandum and\nArticles”).\nDividend Distributions\nThe holders of our ordinary shares are entitled to such dividends as may be declared by our board of directors subject to the BVI Business\nCompanies Act. The holders of our preferred shares have no right to share in any dividend paid by the Company and no right to share in the distribution of\nthe surplus assets of the Company on its liquidation.\nVoting rights\nAny action required or permitted to be taken by the shareholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of the shareholders\nentitled to vote on such action and may be effected by a resolution in writing. At each shareholder’s meeting, each shareholder who is present in person or\nby proxy (or, in the case of a shareholder being a corporation, by its duly authorized representative) will be entitled to one vote for each ordinary share\nwhich such shareholder holds and be entitled to three votes for each preferred share which such shareholder holds on all matters subject to vote at each\nshareholders’ meeting of the Company.\nElection of directors\nDelaware law permits cumulative voting for the election of directors only if expressly authorized in the certificate of incorporation. The laws of\nthe British Virgin Islands, however, do not specifically prohibit or restrict the creation of cumulative voting rights for the election of our directors.\nCumulative voting is not a concept that is accepted as a common practice in the British Virgin Islands, and we have made no provisions in our\nmemorandum and articles of association to allow cumulative voting for elections of directors.\nMeetings\nWe must provide written notice of all meetings of shareholders, stating the time, place and, in the case of a special meeting of shareholders, the\npurpose or purposes thereof, at least 7 days before the date of the proposed meeting to those persons whose names appear as shareholders in the register of\nmembers on the date of the notice and are entitled to vote at the meeting. Our board of directors shall call a special meeting upon the written request of\nshareholders holding at least 30% of our outstanding voting shares. In addition, our board of directors may call a special meeting of shareholders on its own\nmotion. A meeting of shareholders held in contravention of the requirement to give notice is valid if shareholders holding at least 90 percent of the total\nvoting rights on all the matters to be considered at the meeting have waived notice of the meeting and, for this purpose, the presence of a shareholder at the\nmeeting shall constitute waiver in relation to all the shares which that shareholder holds.\nThe management of us is entrusted to our board of directors, who will make corporate decisions by board resolution. Our directors are free to meet\nat such times and in such manner and places within or outside the BVI as the directors determine to be necessary or desirable. A 3 days’ notice of a meeting\nof directors must be given. At any meeting of directors, a quorum will be present if half of the total number of directors is present, unless there are only 2\ndirectors in which case the quorum is 2. If a quorum is not present, the meeting will be dissolved. If a quorum is present, votes of half of present directors\nare required to pass a resolution of directors.\nAs few as one third of our outstanding shares may be sufficient to hold a shareholder meeting. Although our memorandum and articles of\nassociation require that holders of at least one-third of our outstanding shares appear in person or by proxy to hold a shareholder meeting, to the extent we\nfail to have quorum on this initial meeting date, we can reschedule the meeting for the next business day or later, at which second meeting the holders of\none third or more of our outstanding shares will constitute a quorum. As mentioned, at the initial date set for any meeting of shareholders, a quorum will be\npresent if there are shareholders present in person or by proxy representing not less than one-third of the issued Ordinary Shares entitled to vote on the\nresolutions to be considered at the meeting. A quorum may comprise a single shareholder or proxy and then such person may pass a resolution of\nshareholders and a certificate signed by such person accompanied where such person be a proxy by a copy of the proxy instrument shall constitute a valid\nresolution of shareholder. If within two hours from the time appointed for the meeting a quorum is not present, the meeting, if convened upon the\nrequisition of shareholders, shall be dissolved; in any other case it shall stand adjourned to the next business day in the jurisdiction in which the meeting\nwas to have been held at the same time and place or to such other time and place as the directors may determine, and if at the adjourned meeting there are\npresent within one hour from the time appointed for the meeting in person or by proxy not less than one third of the votes of the shares or each class or\nseries of shares entitle to vote on the matter to be considered by the meeting, those present shall constitute a quorum but otherwise the meeting shall be\ndissolved. No business may be transacted at any general meeting unless a quorum is present at the commencement of business. If present, the chair of our\nboard of directors shall be the chair presiding at any meeting of the shareholders.\nA corporation that is a shareholder shall be deemed for the purpose of our memorandum and articles of association to be present in person if\nrepresented by its duly authorized representative. This duly authorized representative shall be entitled to exercise the same powers on behalf of the\ncorporation which he represents as that corporation could exercise if it were our individual shareholder.\nProtection of minority shareholders\nWe would normally expect British Virgin Islands courts to follow English case law precedents, which permit a minority shareholder to commence\na representative action, or derivative actions in our name, to challenge (1) an act which is ultra vires or illegal, (2) an act which constitutes a fraud against\nthe minority by parties in control of us, (3) the act complained of constitutes an infringement of individual rights of shareholders, such as the right to vote\nand pre-emptive rights and (4) an irregularity in the passing of a resolution which requires a special or extraordinary majority of the shareholders.\nPre-emptive rights\nThere are no pre-emptive rights applicable to the issue by us of new Ordinary Shares under either British Virgin Islands law or our memorandum\nand articles of association.\nTransfer of ordinary shares\nSubject to the restrictions in our memorandum and articles of association and applicable securities laws, any of our shareholders may transfer all\nor any of his or her ordinary shares by written instrument of transfer signed by the transferor and containing the name and address of the transferee. Our\nboard of directors may resolve by resolution to refuse or delay the registration of the transfer of any common share. If our board of directors resolves to\nrefuse or delay any transfer, it shall specify the reasons for such refusal in the resolution. Our directors may not resolve or refuse or delay the transfer of a\ncommon share unless: (a) the person transferring the shares has failed to pay any amount due in respect of any of those shares; or (b) such refusal or delay\nis deemed necessary or advisable in our view or that of our legal counsel in order to avoid violation of, or in order to ensure compliance with, any\napplicable, corporate, securities and other laws and regulations.\nLiquidation\nIf we are wound up and the assets available for distribution among our shareholders are more than sufficient to repay all amounts paid to us on\naccount of the issue of shares immediately prior to the winding up, the excess shall be distributable pari passu among those shareholders in proportion to\nthe amount paid up immediately prior to the winding up on the shares held by them, respectively. If we are wound up and the assets available for\ndistribution among the shareholders as such are insufficient to repay the whole of the amounts paid to us on account of the issue of shares, those assets shall\nbe distributed so that, to the greatest extent possible, the losses shall be borne by the shareholders in proportion to the amounts paid up immediately prior to\nthe winding up on the shares held by them, respectively. If we are wound up, the liquidator appointed by us may, in accordance with the BVI Business\nCompanies Act, divide among our shareholders in specie or kind the whole or any part of our assets (whether they shall consist of property of the same\nkind or not) and may, for such purpose, set such value as the liquidator deems fair upon any property to be divided and may determine how such division\nshall be carried out as between the shareholders or different classes of shareholders.\nCalls on ordinary shares and forfeiture of ordinary shares\nOur board of directors may from time to time make calls upon shareholders for any amounts unpaid on their ordinary shares in a notice served to\nsuch shareholders at least 14 days prior to the specified time of payment. The ordinary shares that have been called upon and remain unpaid are subject to\nforfeiture.\nRedemption of ordinary shares\nSubject to the provisions of the BVI Business Companies Act, we may issue shares on terms that are subject to redemption, at our option or at the\noption of the holders, on such terms and in such manner as may be determined by our memorandum and articles of association and subject to any\napplicable requirements imposed from time to time by, the BVI Business Companies Act, the SEC, The NASDAQ Capital Market, or by any recognized\nstock exchange on which our securities are listed.\nModifications of rights\nAll or any of the special rights attached to any class of shares may, subject to the provisions of the BVI Business Companies Act, be amended only\npursuant to a resolution passed at a meeting by a majority of the votes cast by those entitled to vote at a meeting of the holders of the shares of that class.\nChanges in the number of shares we are authorized to issue and those in issue\nWe may from time to time by resolution of our board of directors:\n● amend our memorandum of association to increase or decrease the maximum number of shares we are authorized to issue;\n● subject to our memorandum, divide our authorized and issued shares into a larger number of shares; and\n● subject to our memorandum, combine our authorized and issued shares into a smaller number of shares.\nUntraceable shareholders\nWe are entitled to sell any shares of a shareholder who is untraceable, provided that:\n● all checks or warrants in respect of dividends of these shares, not being less than three in number, for any sums payable in cash to the holder of\nsuch shares have remained uncashed for a period of twelve years prior to the publication of the notice and during the three months referred to in\nthe third bullet point below;\n● we have not during that time received any indication of the whereabouts or existence of the shareholder or person entitled to these shares by death,\nbankruptcy or operation of law; and\n● we have caused a notice to be published in newspapers in the manner stipulated by our memorandum and articles of association, giving notice of\nour intention to sell these shares, and a period of three months has elapsed since such notice.\n● The net proceeds of any such sale shall belong to us, and when we receive these net proceeds we shall become indebted to the former shareholder\nfor an amount equal to the net proceeds.\nInspection of books and records\nUnder British Virgin Islands Law, holders of our ordinary shares are entitled, upon giving written notice to us, to inspect (i) our memorandum and\narticles of association, (ii) the register of members, (iii) the register of directors and (iv) minutes of meetings and resolutions of members, and to make\ncopies and take extracts from the documents and records. However, our directors can refuse access if they are satisfied that to allow such access would be\ncontrary to our interests. See “Where You Can Find Additional Information.”\nRights of non-resident or foreign shareholders\nThere are no limitations imposed by our memorandum and articles of association on the rights of non-resident or foreign shareholders to hold or\nexercise voting rights on our shares. In addition, there are no provisions in our memorandum and articles of association governing the ownership threshold\nabove which shareholder ownership must be disclosed.\nIssuance of additional ordinary shares\nOur memorandum and articles of association authorizes our board of directors to issue additional ordinary shares from authorized but unissued\nshares, to the extent available, from time to time as our board of directors shall determine.\nDifferences in Corporate Law\nThe BVI Business Companies Act and the laws of the British Virgin Islands affecting British Virgin Islands companies like us and our\nshareholders differ from laws applicable to U.S. corporations and their shareholders. Set forth below is a summary of the material differences between the\nprovisions of the laws of the British Virgin Islands applicable to us and the laws applicable to companies incorporated in the United States and their\nshareholders.\nMergers and similar arrangements\nUnder the laws of the British Virgin Islands, two or more companies may merge or consolidate in accordance with Section 170 of the BVI\nBusiness Companies Act. A merger means the merging of two or more constituent companies into one of the constituent companies and a consolidation\nmeans the uniting of two or more constituent companies into a new company. In order to merge or consolidate, the directors of each constituent company\nmust approve a written plan of merger or consolidation, which must be authorized by a resolution of shareholders.\nWhile a director may vote on the plan of merger or consolidation even if he has a financial interest in the plan, the interested director must disclose\nthe interest to all other directors of the company promptly upon becoming aware of the fact that he is interested in a transaction entered into or to be entered\ninto by the company.\nA transaction entered into by our company in respect of which a director is interested (including a merger or consolidation) is voidable by us\nunless the director’s interest was (a) disclosed to the board prior to the transaction or (b) the transaction is (i) between the director and the company and (ii)\nthe transaction is in the ordinary course of the company’s business and on usual terms and conditions.\nNotwithstanding the above, a transaction entered into by the company is not voidable if the material facts of the interest are known to the\nshareholders and they approve or ratify it or the company received fair value for the transaction.\nShareholders not otherwise entitled to vote on the merger or consolidation may still acquire the right to vote if the plan of merger or consolidation\ncontains any provision which, if proposed as an amendment to the memorandum or articles of association, would entitle them to vote as a class or series on\nthe proposed amendment. In any event, all shareholders must be given a copy of the plan of merger or consolidation irrespective of whether they are\nentitled to vote at the meeting to approve the plan of merger or consolidation.\nThe shareholders of the constituent companies are not required to receive shares of the surviving or consolidated company but may receive debt\nobligations or other securities of the surviving or consolidated company, other assets, or a combination thereof. Further, some or all of the shares of a class\nor series may be converted into a kind of asset while the other shares of the same class or series may receive a different kind of asset. As such, not all the\nshares of a class or series must receive the same kind of consideration.\nAfter the plan of merger or consolidation has been approved by the directors and authorized by a resolution of the shareholders, articles of merger\nor consolidation are executed by each company and filed with the Registrar of Corporate Affairs in the British Virgin Islands.\nA shareholder may dissent from a mandatory redemption of his shares, an arrangement (if permitted by the court), a merger (unless the\nshareholder was a shareholder of the surviving company prior to the merger and continues to hold the same or similar shares after the merger) or a\nconsolidation. A shareholder properly exercising his dissent rights is entitled to a cash payment equal to the fair value of his shares.\nA shareholder dissenting from a merger or consolidation must object in writing to the merger or consolidation before the vote by the shareholders\non the merger or consolidation, unless notice of the meeting was not given to the shareholder. If the merger or consolidation is approved by the\nshareholders, the company must give notice of this fact to each shareholder within 20 days who gave written objection. These shareholders then have 20\ndays to give to the company their written election in the form specified by the BVI Business Companies Act to dissent from the merger or consolidation,\nprovided that in the case of a merger, the 20 days starts when the plan of merger is delivered to the shareholder.\nUpon giving notice of his election to dissent, a shareholder ceases to have any shareholder rights except the right to be paid the fair value of his\nshares. As such, the merger or consolidation may proceed in the ordinary course notwithstanding his dissent.\nWithin seven days of the later of the delivery of the notice of election to dissent and the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the company\nmust make a written offer to each dissenting shareholder to purchase his shares at a specified price per share that the company determines to be the fair\nvalue of the shares. The company and the shareholder then have 30 days to agree upon the price. If the company and a shareholder fail to agree on the price\nwithin the 30 days, then the company and the shareholder shall, within 20 days immediately following the expiration of the 30-day period, each designate\nan appraiser and these two appraisers shall designate a third appraiser. These three appraisers shall fix the fair value of the shares as of the close of business\non the day prior to the shareholders’ approval of the transaction without taking into account any change in value as a result of the transaction.\nShareholders’ suits\nThere are both statutory and common law remedies available to our shareholders as a matter of British Virgin Islands law. These are summarized\nbelow:\nPrejudiced members\nA shareholder who considers that the affairs of the company have been, are being, or are likely to be, conducted in a manner that is, or any act or\nacts of the company have been, or are, likely to be oppressive, unfairly discriminatory or unfairly prejudicial to him in that capacity, can apply to the court\nunder Section 184I of the BVI Business Companies Act, inter alia, for an order that his shares be acquired, that he be provided compensation, that the\nCourt regulate the future conduct of the company, or that any decision of the company which contravenes the BVI Business Companies Act or our\nmemorandum and articles of association be set aside.\nDerivative actions\nSection 184C of the BVI Business Companies Act provides that a shareholder of a company may, with the leave of the Court, bring an action in\nthe name of the company to redress any wrong done to it.\nJust and equitable winding up\nIn addition to the statutory remedies outlined above, shareholders can also petition for the winding up of a company on the grounds that it is just\nand equitable for the court to so order. Save in exceptional circumstances, this remedy is only available where the company has been operated as a quasi\npartnership and trust and confidence between the partners has broken down.\nIndemnification of directors and executive officers and limitation of liability\nBritish Virgin Islands law does not limit the extent to which a company’s articles of association may provide for indemnification of officers and\ndirectors, except to the extent any provision providing indemnification may be held by the British Virgin Islands courts to be contrary to public policy, such\nas to provide indemnification against civil fraud or the consequences of committing a crime.\nUnder our memorandum and articles of association, we indemnify against all expenses, including legal fees, and against all judgments, fines and\namounts paid in settlement and reasonably incurred in connection with legal, administrative or investigative proceedings for any person who:\n● is or was a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed proceedings, whether civil, criminal, administrative or\ninvestigative, by reason of the fact that the person is or was our director; or\n● is or was, at our request, serving as a director or officer of, or in any other capacity is or was acting for, another body corporate or a partnership, joint\nventure, trust or other enterprise.\nThese indemnities only apply if the person acted honestly and in good faith with a view to our best interests and, in the case of criminal\nproceedings, the person had no reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. This standard of conduct is generally the same as permitted\nunder the Delaware General Corporation Law for a Delaware corporation.\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers or persons controlling us under\nthe foregoing provisions, we have been advised that in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities\nAct and is therefore unenforceable.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our memorandum and articles of association\nSome provisions of our memorandum and articles of association may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or\nmanagement that shareholders may consider favorable, including provisions that provide for a staggered board of directors and prevent shareholders from\ntaking an action by written consent in lieu of a meeting. However, under British Virgin Islands law, our directors may only exercise the rights and powers\ngranted to them under our memorandum and articles of association, as amended and restated from time to time, as they believe in good faith to be in the\nbest interests of our company.\nDirectors’ fiduciary duties\nUnder Delaware corporate law, a director of a Delaware corporation has a fiduciary duty to the corporation and its shareholders. This duty has two\ncomponents: the duty of care and the duty of loyalty. The duty of care requires that a director act in good faith, with the care that an ordinarily prudent\nperson would exercise under similar circumstances. Under this duty, a director must inform himself of, and disclose to shareholders, all material\ninformation reasonably available regarding a transaction that is material to the company. The duty of loyalty requires that a director act in a manner he\nreasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation. He must not use his corporate position for personal gain or advantage. This duty prohibits\nself-dealing by a director and mandates that the best interest of the corporation and its shareholders take precedence over any interest possessed by a\ndirector, officer or controlling shareholder and not shared by the shareholders generally. In general, actions of a director are presumed to have been made\non an informed basis, in good faith and in the honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the corporation. However, this presumption may\nbe rebutted by evidence of a breach of one of the fiduciary duties. Should such evidence be presented concerning a transaction by a director, a director must\nprove the procedural fairness of the transaction and that the transaction was of fair value to the corporation.\nUnder British Virgin Islands law, our directors owe the company certain statutory and fiduciary duties including, among others, a duty to act\nhonestly, in good faith, for a proper purpose and with a view to what the directors believe to be in the best interests of the company. Our directors are also\nrequired, when exercising powers or performing duties as a director, to exercise the care, diligence and skill that a reasonable director would exercise in\ncomparable circumstances, taking into account without limitation, the nature of the company, the nature of the decision and the position of the director and\nthe nature of the responsibilities undertaken. In the exercise of their powers, our directors must ensure neither they nor the company acts in a manner which\ncontravenes the BVI Business Companies Act or our memorandum and articles of association, as amended and re-stated from time to time. A shareholder\nhas the right to seek damages for breaches of duties owed to us by our directors.\nShareholder action by written consent\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, a corporation may eliminate the right of shareholders to act by written consent by amendment to its\ncertificate of incorporation. British Virgin Islands law provides that shareholders may approve corporate matters by way of a written resolution without a\nmeeting signed by or on behalf of shareholders sufficient to constitute the requisite majority of shareholders who would have been entitled to vote on such\nmatter at a general meeting; provided that if the consent is less than unanimous, notice must be given to all non-consenting shareholders. Our memorandum\nand articles of association permit shareholders to act by written consent.\nShareholder proposals\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, a shareholder has the right to put any proposal before the annual meeting of shareholders, provided\nit complies with the notice provisions in the governing documents. A special meeting may be called by the board of directors or any other person\nauthorized to do so in the governing documents, but shareholders may be precluded from calling special meetings. British Virgin Islands law and our\nmemorandum and articles of association allow our shareholders holding not less than 30% of the votes of the outstanding voting shares to requisition a\nshareholders’ meeting. We are not obliged by law to call shareholders’ annual general meetings, but our memorandum and articles of association do permit\nthe directors to call such a meeting. The location of any shareholders’ meeting can be determined by the board of directors and can be held anywhere in the\nworld.\nCumulative voting\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, cumulative voting for elections of directors is not permitted unless the corporation’s certificate of\nincorporation specifically provides for it. Cumulative voting potentially facilitates the representation of minority shareholders on a board of directors since\nit permits the minority shareholder to cast all the votes to which the shareholder is entitled on a single director, which increases the shareholder’s voting\npower with respect to electing such director. As permitted under British Virgin Islands law, our memorandum and articles of association do not provide for\ncumulative voting. As a result, our shareholders are not afforded any less protections or rights on this issue than shareholders of a Delaware corporation.\nRemoval of directors\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, a director of a corporation with a classified board may be removed only for cause with the approval\nof a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote, unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. Under our memorandum and articles of\nassociation, directors can be removed from office, with cause, by a resolution of shareholders or by a resolution of directors passed at a meeting of directors\ncalled for the purpose of removing the director or for purposes including the removal of the director.\nTransactions with interested shareholders\nThe Delaware General Corporation Law contains a business combination statute applicable to Delaware public corporations whereby, unless the\ncorporation has specifically elected not to be governed by such statute by amendment to its certificate of incorporation, it is prohibited from engaging in\ncertain business combinations with an “interested shareholder” for three years following the date that such person becomes an interested shareholder. An\ninterested shareholder generally is a person or group who or which owns or owned 15% or more of the target’s outstanding voting shares within the past\nthree years. This has the effect of limiting the ability of a potential acquirer to make a two-tiered bid for the target in which all shareholders would not be\ntreated equally. The statute does not apply if, among other things, prior to the date on which such shareholder becomes an interested shareholder, the board\nof directors approves either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the person becoming an interested shareholder. This encourages\nany potential acquirer of a Delaware public corporation to negotiate the terms of any acquisition transaction with the target’s board of directors. British\nVirgin Islands law has no comparable statute.\nDissolution; Winding Up\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, unless the board of directors approves the proposal to dissolve, dissolution must be approved by\nshareholders holding 100% of the total voting power of the corporation. Only if the dissolution is initiated by the board of directors may it be approved by a\nsimple majority of the corporation’s outstanding shares. Delaware law allows a Delaware corporation to include in its certificate of incorporation a\nsupermajority voting requirement in connection with dissolutions initiated by the board. Under the BVI Business Companies Act and our memorandum and\narticles of association, we may appoint a voluntary liquidator by a resolution of the shareholders or by resolution of directors.\nVariation of rights of shares\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, a corporation may vary the rights of a class of shares with the approval of a majority of the\noutstanding shares of such class, unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. Under our memorandum and articles of association, if at any\ntime our shares are divided into different classes of shares, the rights attached to any class may only be varied, whether or not our company is in\nliquidation, with the consent in writing of or by a resolution passed at a meeting by the holders of not less than 50 percent of the issued shares in that class.\nAmendment of governing documents\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, a corporation’s governing documents may be amended with the approval of a majority of the\noutstanding shares entitled to vote, unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. As permitted by British Virgin Islands law, our memorandum\nand articles of association may be amended by a resolution of shareholders and, subject to certain exceptions, by a resolution of directors. Any amendment\nis effective from the date it is registered at the Registry of Corporate Affairs in the British Virgin Islands.\nExhibit 8.1\nSUBSIDIARIES OF THE REGISTRANT\nSubsidiary Jurisdiction of incorporation\nAbit Hong Kong Limited Hong Kong SAR, People’s Republic of China\nAbit USA, Inc. Delaware\nBeijing Bitmatrix Technology Co. Ltd. People’s Republic of China\nExhibit 11.1\nABITS GROUP INC\nCODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT AND ETHICS\nThis Code of Business Conduct and Ethics covers a wide range of business practices and procedures. It does not cover every issue that may arise, but it sets\nout basic principles to guide the employees of Abits Group Inc and its subsidiaries (the “Company”). All of our employees must conduct themselves in\naccordance with these principles and seek to avoid even the appearance of improper behavior. The Company’s agents and representatives, including\nconsultants and directors, to the extent practicable, shall also follow this Code.\nThis Code is in addition to and supplements the other policies and procedures which have been implemented by the Company. If a law conflicts with a\npolicy in this Code, you must comply with the law; however, if a local custom or policy conflicts with this Code, you must comply with the Code. If you\nhave any questions about a conflict, you should ask your supervisor how to handle the situation.\nAll claims of violations of this Code will be investigated by appropriate personnel. Those who violate the standards in this Code will be subject to\ndisciplinary action. If you are in a situation that you believe may violate or lead to a violation of this Code, follow the guidelines described in Section 14 of\nthis Code.\n1. Compliance with Laws, Rules and Regulations\nObeying the law, both in letter and in spirit, is the foundation on which this Company’s ethical standards are built. All employees must respect and\nobey the laws of all jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Any employee who is unsure about any aspect of these laws should seek advice from\nsupervisors, managers or other appropriate personnel.\n2. Record-Keeping\nAccuracy and reliability in the preparation of all business records is critically important to the Company’s decision-making process and to the proper\ndischarge of its financial, legal, and reporting obligations. All of the Company’s books, records, accounts and financial statements shall be maintained\nin reasonable detail, shall appropriately reflect the Company’s transactions and shall conform both to applicable legal requirements and to the\nCompany’s system of internal controls. Unrecorded or “off the books” funds or assets shall not be maintained unless permitted by applicable law or\nregulation.\nMany employees regularly incur business expenses, which must be documented and recorded accurately. If you are not sure whether a certain expense\nis appropriate, consult the policy or ask your supervisor.\nBusiness records and communications often become public, and we should avoid exaggeration, derogatory remarks, guesswork, or inappropriate\ncharacterizations of people and companies that can be misunderstood. This applies equally to e-mail, internal memos and formal reports. Records shall\nalways be retained or destroyed according to the Company’s record retention policies.\n3. Conflicts of Interest and Related Party Transactions\nA “conflict of interest” exists when a person’s private interest interferes in any way with the interests of the Company. A conflict situation can arise\nwhen an employee, officer or director takes actions or has interests that may make it difficult to perform his or her Company work objectively and\neffectively. Conflicts of interest may also arise when an employee, officer or director, or members of his or her family, receives improper personal\nbenefits as a result of his or her position in the Company. Loans to, or guarantees of obligations of, employees and their family members may create\nconflicts of interest. Loans to, or guarantees of obligations of, directors, executive officers and their family members are prohibited.\nA conflict of interest almost always exists when a Company employee works concurrently for a competitor, customer or supplier. You are not allowed\nto work for a competitor as a consultant or board member. The best policy is to avoid any direct or indirect business connection with the Company’s\ncompetitors, customers or suppliers, except on the Company’s behalf.\nA conflict of interest may occur when an employee of the Company has an ownership or financial interest in another business organization that is\ndoing business with the Company. These transactions between the Company and the other organization are characterized as related party transactions.\nWhile not all related party transactions are improper, the Company must be aware of the details of each such transaction so that it can make a judgment\nas to the appropriateness of the transaction. If you or a family member have any ownership or financial interest in another organization that conducts\nbusiness or seeks to conduct business with the Company, you must report the situation to the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and cooperate with the\nlegal staff by providing all relevant facts. The CEO will determine whether or not the related party transaction is a conflict of interest.\nConflicts of interest are prohibited as a matter of Company policy, except under guidelines approved by the Board of Directors. Conflicts of interest\nmay not always be clear, so if you have a question, you should consult with higher levels of management or the Company’s CEO. Any employee,\nofficer or director who becomes aware of a conflict or potential conflict shall bring it to the attention of a supervisor, manager or other appropriate\npersonnel or consult the procedures described in Section 14 of this Code.\n4. Confidentiality\nEmployees must maintain the confidentiality of confidential information entrusted to them by the Company or its customers, except when disclosure is\nauthorized by the CEO or legally mandated. Even within the Company, you should disclose confidential information only to those employees who\nneed to know the information. Confidential information includes all non-public information that might be of use to competitors, or harmful to the\nCompany or its customers, if disclosed. It also includes information that suppliers and customers have entrusted to us. The obligation to preserve\nconfidential information continues even after employment ends.\n5. Insider Trading\nEmployees who have access to confidential information are not permitted to use or share that information for stock trading purposes or for any other\npurpose except the conduct of the Company’s business. All non-public information about the Company shall be considered confidential information.\nTo use non-public information for personal financial benefit or to “tip” others who might make an investment decision on the basis of this information\nis not only unethical but also illegal. If you have any questions, you should consult the Company’s CEO.\n6. Corporate Opportunities\nEmployees, officers and directors are prohibited from taking for themselves personally opportunities that are discovered through the use of corporate\nproperty, information or position without the consent of the Board of Directors. No employee shall use corporate property, information, or position for\nimproper personal gain, and no employee shall compete with the Company directly or indirectly. Employees, officers and directors owe a duty to the\nCompany to advance its legitimate interests when the opportunity to do so arises.\n7. Competition and Fair Dealing\nThe Company seeks to outperform its competition fairly and honestly. The Company seeks competitive advantages through superior performance,\nnever through unethical or illegal business practices. Stealing proprietary information, possessing trade secret information that was obtained without\nthe owner’s consent, or inducing such disclosures by past or present employees of other companies is prohibited. Each employee shall endeavor to\nrespect the rights of and deal fairly with the Company’s customers, suppliers, competitors and employees. No employee shall take unfair advantage of\nanyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged information, misrepresentation of material facts, or any other intentional unfair-dealinq\npractice.\nThe purpose of business entertainment and gifts in a commercial setting is to create good will and sound working relationships, not to gain unfair\nadvantage with customers. No gift or entertainment shall ever be offered, given, provided or accepted by any Company employee, family member of\nan employee or agent unless it:\n○ is not a cash gift,\n○ is consistent with customary business practices,\n○ is not excessive in value,\n○ cannot be construed as a bribe or payoff, and\n○ does not violate any laws or regulations.\n8. Discrimination and Harassment\nThe diversity of the Company’s employees is a tremendous asset. The Company is firmly committed to providing equal opportunity in all aspects of\nemployment and shall not tolerate any illegal discrimination or harassment or any kind. Examples include derogatory comments based on racial,\ngender, religious, or ethnic characteristics and unwelcome sexual advances.\n9. Health and Safety\nThe Company strives to provide each employee with a safe and healthful work environment. Each employee has the responsibility for maintaining a\nsafe and healthful workplace for all employees by following safety and health rules and practices and reporting accidents, injuries and unsafe\nequipment, practices or conditions.\nViolence and threatening behavior are not permitted. Employees must report to work in condition to perform their duties, free from the influence of\nalcohol or illegal drugs. The use of alcohol or illegal drugs in the workplace is not tolerated.\n10. Protection and Proper Use of Company Assets\nAll employees shall endeavor to protect the Company’s assets and ensure their efficient use. Theft, carelessness and waste have a direct impact on the\nCompany’s profitability. All Company assets should be used for legitimate business purposes. Any suspected incident of theft, carelessness, or waste\nof or with Company assets shall be immediately reported for investigation. Company equipment shall not be used for non-Company business, although\nincidental personal use may be permitted by your supervisor.\nThe obligation of employees to protect the Company’s assets includes its proprietary information. Proprietary information includes intellectual\nproperty such as trade secrets, patents, trademarks, and copyrights, as well as business, marketing and service plans, databases, records, salary\ninformation and any unpublished financial data and reports. Unauthorized use or distribution of this information would violate Company policy. It\ncould also be illegal and result in civil and/or criminal penalties.\n11. Accounting and Related Matters\nAll employees participate, in some measure, in the gathering of information made available to the Company’s accounting department for use in the\nCompany’s financial reports and other information required to be publicly disclosed by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the NASDAQ\nStock Market LLC. Each employee should endeavor to ensure that such information is accurate and complete in all material respects through full\ncompliance with the Company’s accounting requirements, internal disclosure and accounting controls and audits.\n12. Waivers of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics\nAny waiver of this Code for executive officers or directors may be made only by the Corporate Governance Committee of the Board and shall be\npromptly disclosed as required by law or stock exchange regulation.\n13. Administration of Code\nThis Code shall be administered by the Company’s CEO, who shall act as the Corporate Compliance Officer of the Company, Company employees are\nencouraged to seek guidance regarding the application or interpretation of this Code from the CEO and are expected to cooperate fully in any\ninvestigation of any potential violation of this Code.\n14. Reporting Violations; Compliance Procedures\nAll employees shall work to ensure prompt and consistent action against violations of this Code. However, in some situations it is difficult to know\nright from wrong. Since no one can anticipate every situation that will arise, it is important to have a way to approach a new question or problem.\nThese are the steps to keep in mind:\n○ Make sure you have all the facts. In order to reach the right solutions, you must be as fully informed as possible.\n○ Ask yourself: What specifically am I being asked to do? Does it seem unethical or improper? This will enable you to focus on the\nspecific question you are faced with and the alternatives you have. Use your judgment and common sense; if something seems unethical or\nimproper, it probably is.\n○ Clarify your responsibility and role. In most situations there is shared responsibility. Are your colleagues informed? It may help to get\nothers involved and discuss the problem.\n○ Discuss the problem with your supervisor. You are encouraged to talk to your supervisor about any issues concerning illegal, unethical or\nimproper behavior and when in doubt about the best course of action in a particular situation. This is the basic guidance for all situations. In\nmany cases your supervisor will be more knowledgeable about the question, and will appreciate being brought into the decision-making\nprocess. Remember it is your supervisor’s responsibility to help solve problems.\n○ Report serious violations to the Company’s CEO. You should report serious violations that have not been properly addressed by your\nsupervisor or other resources of the Company to the CEO. However, if it is not appropriate to discuss an issue with the CEO, or if you believe\nthat the CEO has not properly addressed the violations, you may contact any independent director of the Board of Directors. In the rare case\nthat you become aware of a material legal violation or a breach of fiduciary duty by an employee of the Company, address your concerns to:\nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee Chairman, Abits Group Inc, Unit 911, Tower 2, Silvercord, 30 Canton Road, Tsimshatsui,\nHong Kong SAR, China.\n○ Reporting of accounting issues. If you are aware of an issue concerning accounting, auditing or the Company’s internal accounting controls,\naddress your concerns with the Company’s internal audit function or to the CEO. In the event that you believe that the Company has not\nproperly responded to the issue, you may address your concerns to: Audit Committee Chairman, Abits Group Inc, Unit 911, Tower 2,\nSilvercord, 30 Canton Road, Tsimshatsui, Hong Kong SAR, China.\n○ You may report any possible violation in confidence and without fear of retaliation. If your situation requires that your identity be kept\nsecret, your anonymity will be protected and you will be guaranteed confidentiality in the handling of your claim. It is the policy of the\nCompany not to allow retaliation for reports of misconduct by others made in good faith by employees. Employees are expected to cooperate\nin internal investigations of misconduct.\n○ Always ask first, act later: If you are unsure of, what to do in any situation, seek guidance before you act.\nExhibit 12.1\nCERTIFICATION\nI, Deng Conglin, certify that:\n1.

The Board has therefore adopted this policy which provides for the recoupment of certain executive compensation in the event of an\naccounting restatement resulting from material noncompliance with financial reporting requirements under the United States federal securities laws (the\n“Policy”). This Policy is designed to comply with Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), the rules or\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder, and applicable standards of any national securities exchange on which the Company’s\nsecurities are listed (the “Listing Standards”).\nAdministration\nThis Policy shall be administered by the Board or, if so designated by the Board, the Compensation Committee of the Board, in which case references\nherein to the Board shall be deemed references to the Compensation Committee. Any determinations made by the Board shall be final and binding on all\naffected individuals.\nCovered Executives\nThis Policy applies to the Company’s current and former executive officers, as determined by the Board in accordance with the definition in Section 10D of\nthe Exchange Act and the Listing Standards, and such other executive officers who may from time to time be deemed subject to the Policy by the Board\n(“Covered Executives”).\nRecoupment; Accounting Restatement\nIn the event the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement of its financial statements due to the Company’s material noncompliance with\nany financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued\nfinancial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected\nin the current period or left uncorrected in the current period, the Board will require reimbursement or forfeiture of any excess Incentive Compensation\nreceived by any Covered Executive during the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date on which the Company is required to prepare an\naccounting restatement.\nIncentive Compensation\nFor purposes of this Policy, Incentive Compensation means any of the following; provided that, such compensation is granted, earned, or vested based\nwholly or in part on the attainment of a financial reporting measure:\n● Annual bonuses and other short- and long-term cash incentives\n● Stock options\n● Stock appreciation rights\n● Restricted stock\n● Restricted stock units\n● Performance shares\n● Performance units\nFinancial reporting measures include:\n● Company stock price\n● Total shareholder return\n● Revenues\n● Net income\n● Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA)\n● Funds from operations\n● Liquidity measures such as working capital or operating cash flow\n● Return measures such as return on invested capital or return on assets\n● Earnings measures such as earnings per share\nExcess Incentive Compensation: Amount Subject to Recovery\nThe amount to be recovered will be the excess of the Incentive Compensation paid to the Covered Executive based on the erroneous data over the Incentive\nCompensation that would have been paid to the Covered Executive had it been based on the restated results, as determined by the Board, without regard to\nany taxes paid by the Covered Executive in respect of the Incentive Compensation paid based on the erroneous data.\nIf the Board cannot determine the amount of excess Incentive Compensation received by the Covered Executive directly from the information in the\naccounting restatement, then it will make its determination based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the accounting restatement.\n2\nMethod of Recoupment\nThe Board will determine, in its sole discretion, the method for recouping Incentive Compensation hereunder which may include, without limitation:\n(a) requiring reimbursement of cash Incentive Compensation previously paid;\n(b) seeking recovery of any gain realized on the vesting, exercise, settlement, sale, transfer, or other disposition of any equity-based awards;\n(c) offsetting the recouped amount from any compensation otherwise owed by the Company to the Covered Executive;\n(d) cancelling outstanding vested or unvested equity awards; and/or\n(e) taking any other remedial and recovery action permitted by law, as determined by the Board.\nNo Indemnification\nThe Company shall not indemnify any Covered Executives against the loss of any incorrectly awarded Incentive Compensation.\nInterpretation\nThe Board is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations necessary, appropriate, or advisable for the administration of\nthis Policy. It is intended that this Policy be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of Section 10D of the Exchange Act, any\napplicable rules or regulations adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Listing Standards.\nEffective Date\nThis Policy shall be effective as of the date it is adopted by the Board (the “Effective Date”) and shall apply to Incentive Compensation that is received by\nCovered Executives on or after October 2, 2023 (even if such Incentive Compensation was approved, awarded, or granted to Covered Executives prior to\nOctober 2, 2023).\nAmendment; Termination\nThe Board may amend this Policy from time to time in its discretion and shall amend this Policy as it deems necessary to reflect final regulations adopted\nor amended by the Securities and Exchange Commission under Section 10D of the Exchange Act and to comply with the Listing Standards and any other\nrules or standards adopted by a national securities exchange on which the Company’s securities are listed. The Board may terminate this Policy at any time.\n3\nOther Recoupment Rights\nAny right of recoupment under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recoupment that may be available to the\nCompany pursuant to the terms of any similar policy in any employment agreement, equity award agreement, or similar agreement and any other legal\nremedies available to the Company.\nRelationship to Other Plans and Agreements\nThe Board intends that this Policy will be applied to the fullest extent of the law. The Board may require that any employment agreement, equity award\nagreement, or similar agreement entered into on or after the Effective Date shall, as a condition to the grant of any benefit thereunder, require a Covered\nExecutive to agree to abide by the terms of this Policy. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms of the Policy and the terms of any employment\nagreement, equity award agreement, or similar agreement under which Incentive Compensation has been granted, awarded, earned or paid to a Covered\nExecutive, whether or not deferred, the terms of the Policy shall govern.\nAcknowledgment\nThe Covered Executive shall sign an acknowledgment form in which they acknowledge that they have read and understand the terms of the Policy and are\nbound by the Policy.\nImpracticability\nThe Board shall recover any excess Incentive Compensation in accordance with this Policy unless such recovery would be impracticable, as determined by\nthe Board in accordance with Rule 10D-1 of the Exchange Act and the listing standards of the national securities exchange on which the Company’s\nsecurities are listed.\nSuccessors\nThis Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Covered Executives and their beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or other legal\nrepresentatives.\n4"

Bitcoin prices on average for\nthe six months to June 2023 hover around the $26,000 mark.\nFor the Company, the immediate priority was the location of a new permanent site for its bitcoin operations. The earlier site, Columbus in Georgia proved\nto be untenable following volatile electricity prices as a result of the outbreak of the Ukraine War. Following intensive site searches, the Company decided\nto buy an outright piece of barren land for $1.2 million in April. Measuring about 1.8 acres and located in the town of Duff, near La Follette in the State of\nTennessee, the site was chosen as its power supply was stable and prices competitive. Site clearance, levelling and preparation began in earnest in May,\nfollowed by the other major works, such as control room/office construction, electrical and plumbing works. An agreement with the local utility board was\nsigned in August and by the end of September, a brand-new mining center was in place.\nThe Company also took the opportunity of a depressed market in 2022 to place an advance order for six units of supercomputing servers S19 XP for $5.3\nmillion to be delivered on a progressive basis from the last quarter of the year. This additional purchase, together with the earlier fleet of equipment shipped\nfrom China, will ensure that the Company had enhanced computing power for its mining activities when site mining begin in the last quarter of the year.\nThe financial analysis of the results of operations for the six months to June 30, 2023 as compared to the corresponding period have to be evaluated from\nan understanding that the operations in the two periods were largely different. In the period to June 30, 2022, the Company enjoyed about four months of\noperational activity before the effects of the skyrocketing electricity costs made it unprofitable to continue. In the current period to June 30, 2023, the\nCompany’s focus was on the construction of its new and permanent center and the results only comprise of a minor operation in Kazakhstan which started\nat the end of May. Only a meagre $7,272 was reported as revenue against $40,000 in the previous year.\nAs far as costs were concerned, the current year’s total includes operational US-based staff which did not exist in the corresponding period last year. The\nnet result was a loss for the six months to June 30, 2023 of $3.5 million, compared to a loss of $922,000 in the corresponding period in 2022.\nIn the Balance Sheet comparison, cash and cash equivalents saw a slight dip of just under a million, a large part of which was in payment of invoices for\nthe construction work-in-progress which amount to $1.5 million at the end of June 2023. Depreciation and other charges accounted for the net drop in total\nassets of the Company.\nAs of the date of this report, the new mining facility at Duff near La Follette, based on a new generation of hydro power, is virtually completed and the\nCompany expects results going forward to be increasingly better.\nExhibit 99.2\nMOXIAN (BVI) INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nAs of\nJune 30, 2023\nNote (Unaudited) December 31, 2022\nASSETS\nCurrent Assets\nCash and cash equivalents $ 1,538,831 $ 2,505,286\nPrepayments and other receivables 3 3,486,623 2,384,976\nTotal current assets 5,025,454 4,890,262\nDigital assets 4 4,716,979 7,087,747\nProperty, equipment and vehicles 5 9,736,152 12,553,408\nConstruction-in-progress 6 1,522,949 -\nTOTAL ASSETS 21,001,534 24,531,417\nLIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nOther payables and accruals $ 541,356 $ 613,455\nStockholders’ Equity\nPreferred stock, $0.001010 par value, authorized; 50,000,000 shares, 5,000,000\nshares issued and outstanding as of June 30, 2023 and December,31 2022 $ 5,050 $ 5,050\nCommon stock, $0.001 par value, authorized: 50,000,000 shares.

Organization and nature of operations\nThe Company was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands (BVI) on May 18, 2021. On August 17, 2021, the Company completed a redomicile merger\nwith its predecessor company, Moxian, Inc, wherein it acquired all the assets, liabilities, rights, obligations and operations of the latter and its subsidiaries,\nthrough an exchange of an identical number of shares.\nOn December 28, 2021 in a Special Meeting of shareholders, the Company approved the issue of up to 20 million new ordinary shares of the Company, at a\nprice of $2.50 per share to certain non-US based accredited investors. On February 11, 2022 the Company completed this private placement and issued 16\nmillion new shares, raising $40 million, which it would use in bitcoin mining in order to diversify its business operations. Of the issue proceeds, $29.8\nmillion was used to purchase and ship relevant equipment from China and the balance deployed as working capital.\nOn March 5, 2022 a number of machines were installed and operational at a site near Buffalo in New York State, USA. The bulk of the equipment was\nshipped to Columbus in the State of Georgia and mining commenced in late May. However, due to poor prices for bitcoin and high electricity charges,\nmining operations ceased temporarily at both sides by June 2022 whilst efforts intensified in the search for a more cost-effective site.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the activities of the Company and each of the following entities:\nName of entity Background Ownership\nABit Hong Kong Limited Investment Holding 100% owned by Moxian (BVI) Inc\nABit USA Limited Bitcoin Mining 100% owned by ABit Hong Kong Limited\nBeijing BitMarix Co. Ltd. Inhouse Treasury and Administration 100% owned by ABit Hong Kong Limited\n2. Summary of principal accounting policies\nBasis of presentation and consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in\nthe United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and include all the subsidiaries of the Group. The financial year-end of the Company is December 31 while\nthat of the predecessor company is September 30. The consolidated results are presented as of the period ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022. All\nintercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in the consolidation.\nFair value of financial instruments\nThe Company follows the provisions of ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.” ASC 820 clarifies the definition of fair value, prescribes\nmethods for measuring fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:\nLevel 1-Observable inputs such as unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date.\nLevel 2-Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and\nliabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market\ndata.\nLevel 3-Inputs are unobservable inputs that reflect management’s assumptions based on the best available information.\nThe carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, prepayments, deposits and other receivables, accruals and other payables, loans from related parties and\nunrelated party approximate their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments.\nF-5\nMOXIAN (BVI) INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n2. Summary of principal accounting policies (continued)\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the accompanying consolidated\nfinancial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates required to be made by\nmanagement include but not limited to, useful lives of property and equipment, provision for doubtful accounts, intangible assets valuation, inventory\nvaluation, value added recoverable valuation and deferred tax assets valuation. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash includes cash on hand and demand deposits in accounts maintained with commercial banks. The Company considers all highly liquid investment\ninstruments with an original maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.\nThe Company considers all short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and have original maturities of three\nmonths or less to be cash equivalents.\nPrepayments, deposits and other receivables\nPrepayments and deposits represent amounts advanced to suppliers. The suppliers usually require advance payments or deposits when the Company makes\npurchase or orders service and the prepayments and deposits will be utilized to offset the Company’s future payments. Other receivables mainly consist of\nvarious cash advances to employees for business needs. These amounts are unsecured, non-interest bearing and generally short-term in nature.\nAllowances are recorded when utilization and collection of amounts due are in doubt. Delinquent prepayments, deposits and other receivables are written-\noff after management has determined that the likelihood of utilization or collection is not probable and known bad debts are written off against the\nallowances when identified.\nProperty, Equipment and Vehicles, net\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Significant additions or improvements extending useful lives\nof assets are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line\nmethod over the estimated useful lives as follows:\nEquipment 2-6 years\nVehicless 2-6 years\nIntangible assets, net\nIntangible assets, comprising Intellectual property rights (“IP rights”) and software, which are separable from property and equipment, are stated at cost\nless accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of 3- 10 years.\nF-6\nMOXIAN (BVI) INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nThe Company classifies its long-lived assets into: (i) computer and office equipment; (ii) furniture and fixtures, (iii) leasehold improvements, and (iv)\nfinite-lived intangible assets.\nLong-lived assets held and used by the Company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value\nof such assets may not be fully recoverable. It is possible that these assets could become impaired as a result of technology, economy or other industry\nchanges. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group to be tested for possible impairment, the Company first compares undiscounted cash\nflows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset or asset group is not\nrecoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Fair value is\ndetermined through various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models, relief from royalty income approach, quoted market values and\nthird-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary.\nThe Company makes various assumptions and estimates regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair values of the\nrespective assets. The assumptions and estimates used to determine future values and remaining useful lives of long-lived assets are complex and\nsubjective. They can be affected by various factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as the\nCompany’s business strategy and its forecasts for specific market expansion.\nDigital assets\nDigital assets (including USDC) are included in current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Digital assets purchased are recorded at\ncost and digital assets awarded to the Company through its mining activities are accounted for in connection with the Company’s revenue recognition\npolicy disclosed below.\nDigital assets held are accounted for as intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized but\nassessed for impairment annually, or more frequently, when events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that it is more likely than not that the\nindefinite-lived asset is impaired. Impairment exists when the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, which is measured using the quoted price of the\ndigital assets at the time its fair value is being measured.\nIn testing for impairment, the Company has the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an\nimpairment exists. If it is determined that it is not more likely than not that an impairment exists, a quantitative impairment test is not necessary. If the\nCompany concludes otherwise, it is required to perform a quantitative impairment test. To the extent an impairment loss is recognized, the loss establishes\nthe new cost basis of the asset. Subsequent reversal of impairment losses is not permitted.\nPurchases of digital assets by the Company, if any, will be included within investing activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows,\nwhile digital assets awarded to the Company through its mining activities are included within operating activities on the accompanying consolidated\nstatements of cash flows. The sales of digital assets are included within investing activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows and\nany realized gains or losses from such sales are included in “realized gain (loss) on exchange of digital assets” in the consolidated statements of operations\nand comprehensive income (loss). The Company accounts for its gains or losses in accordance with the first-in first-out method of accounting.\nRevenue recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”).\nTo determine revenue recognition for contracts with customers, the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract with the customer,\n(ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, including variable consideration to the extent that it is probable\nthat a significant future reversal will not occur, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the respective performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize\nrevenue when (or as) the Company satisfies the performance obligation.\nProviding computing power in digital asset transaction verification services is an output of the Company’s ordinary activities. The provision of such\ncomputing power is the only performance obligation in the Company’s contracts with mining pool operators. The transaction consideration the Company\nreceives, if any, is noncash consideration. ASC 606-10-32-21 requires entities to measure the estimated fair value of noncash consideration at contract\ninception. Because the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled for providing computing power is entirely variable, as well as being\nnoncash consideration, the Company assesses the estimated amount of the variable noncash consideration at contract inception and subsequently, to\ndetermine when and to what extent it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur once the\nuncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Because it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue will\nnot occur and the Company is able to calculate the payout based on the contractual formula. This amount should be estimated and recognized in revenue\nupon inception, which is when hash rate is provided.\nFor reasons of operational practicality, the Company applies an accounting convention to use the daily quoted closing U.S. dollar spot rate of digital asset\neach day to determine the fair value of digital asset on the date received, which is not materially different than the fair value at contract inception or the\ntime the Company has earned the award from the pools.\nFair value of the digital assets award received is determined using the quoted price of the related digital assets at the time of receipt. There is currently no\nspecific definitive guidance under US GAAP or alternative accounting framework for the accounting for digital assets recognized as revenue or held, and\nmanagement has exercised significant judgment in determining the appropriate accounting treatment. In the event authoritative guidance is enacted by the\nFASB, the Company may be required to change its policies, which could have an effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position and results from\noperations.\nIncome taxes\nThe Company utilizes ASC Topic 740 (“ASC 740”) “Income taxes”, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected\nfuture tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred income taxes\nare recognized for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at\neach period end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.\nValuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nF-7\nMOXIAN (BVI) INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n2.Summary of principal accounting policies (continued)”\nIncome taxes (continued)\nASC 740 “Income taxes” clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. This interpretation requires that an entity recognizes in the financial\nstatements the impact of a tax position, if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the\nposition. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or\nmeasurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company has elected to classify interest and penalties related to\nunrecognized tax benefits, if and when required, as part of income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company evaluate the\nlevel of authority for each uncertain tax position (including the potential application of interest and penalties) based on the technical merits, and measure\nthe unrecognized benefits associated with the tax positions.\nForeign currency transactions and translation\nThe reporting currency of the Company is United States Dollars (the “USD”) and the functional currency of the PRC subsidiary is the Renminbi\n(“RMB”).The functional currency of ABit Hong Kong is the Hong Kong Dollar (the “HKD”).\nFor financial reporting purposes, the financial statements of the various subsidiaries are prepared using their respective functional currencies, e translated\ninto the reporting currency, USD so to be consolidated with the Company’s. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the\nreporting currency are translated into the reporting currency at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated\nusing average rates prevailing during the reporting period. Adjustments resulting from the translation are recorded as a separate component of accumulated\nother comprehensive income in stockholders’ deficiency. Translation losses are recognized in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nThe exchange rates applied are as follows:\nBalance sheet items, except for equity accounts June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022\nRMB:USD 7.2258 6.8979\nHKD:USD 7.8322 7.7990\nItems in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss, and statements cash flows:\nJune 30, 2023 June 30, 2022\nRMB:USD 6.9291 6.4783\nHKD:USD 7.8392 7.8257\nEarnings per share\nBasic gain per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period while the effects of potential common\nshares outstanding during the period are included in diluted earnings per share.\nFASB Accounting Standard Codification Topic 260 (“ASC 260”), “Earnings Per Share,” requires that employee equity share options, non-vested shares and\nsimilar equity instruments granted to employees be treated as potential common shares in computing diluted earnings per share. Diluted earnings per share\nshould be based on the actual number of options or shares granted and not yet forfeited, unless doing so would be anti-dilutive. The Company uses the\n“treasury stock” method for equity instruments granted in share-based payment transactions provided in ASC 260 to determine diluted earnings per share.\nAntidilutive securities represent potentially dilutive securities which are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings or loss per share as their impact\nwas antidilutive.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic\n740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (“ASU 2019-12”). ASU 2019-12 simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain\nexceptions and enhances and simplifies various aspects of the income tax accounting guidance in ASC 740. ASU 2019-12 was effective January 1, 2021.\nThe adoption of ASU 2019-12 did not have any impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statement presentation or disclosures.\nF-8\nMOXIAN (BVI) INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements (continued)\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt — Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—\nContracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity (“ASU 2020-06”).\nASU 2020-06 simplifies the accounting for convertible debt by eliminating the beneficial conversion and cash conversion accounting models. Upon\nadoption of ASU 2020-06, convertible debt proceeds, unless issued with a substantial premium or an embedded conversion feature that is not clearly and\nclosely related to the host contract, will no longer be allocated between debt and equity components. This modification will reduce the issue discount and\nresult in less non-cash interest expense in financial statements. ASU 2020-06 also updates the earnings per share calculation and requires entities to assume\nshare settlement when the convertible debt can be settled in cash or shares. For contracts in an entity’s own equity, the type of contracts primarily affected\nby ASU 2020-06 are freestanding and embedded features that are accounted for as derivatives under the current guidance due to a failure to meet the\nsettlement assessment by removing the requirements to (i) consider whether the contract would be settled in registered shares, (ii) consider whether\ncollateral is required to be posted, and (iii) assess shareholder rights. ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. Early\nadoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and only if adopted as of the beginning of such fiscal year. The\nCompany adopted ASU 2020-06 effective January 1, 2021. The adoption of ASU 2020-06 did not have any impact on the Company’s consolidated\nfinancial statement presentation or disclosures.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) (“ASU 2016-13”), which requires entities to measure\nall expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable\nforecasts. ASU 2016-13 replaces the existing incurred loss model and is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at\namortized cost. ASU 2016-13 is to be adopted on a modified retrospective basis. As a smaller reporting company, ASU 2016-13 will be effective for the\nCompany for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption\nof ASU 2016-13 will have on its consolidated financial statement presentations and disclosures.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (Topic 350), Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment (“ASU\n2017-04”). ASU 2017-04 eliminates Step 2 of the two-step goodwill impairment test, under which a goodwill impairment loss was measured by comparing\nthe implied fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. ASU 2017-04 requires only a one-step quantitative\nimpairment test, whereby a goodwill impairment loss is measured as the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value (not to exceed the\ntotal goodwill allocated to that reporting unit). Adoption of the ASUs is on a modified retrospective basis. As a smaller reporting company, the standard\nwill be effective for the Company for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company is currently evaluating the\nimpact that the adoption of ASU 2017-04 will have on its consolidated financial statement presentation or disclosures.\nIn May 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-04, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt — Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50),\nCompensation — Stock Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives and Hedging — Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Issuer’s\nAccounting for Certain Modifications or Exchanges of Freestanding Equity-Classified Written Call Options (“ASU 2021-04”). ASU 2021-04 provides\nguidance as to how an issuer should account for a modification of the terms or conditions or an exchange of a freestanding equity-classified written call\noption (i.e., a warrant) that remains classified after modification or exchange as an exchange of the original instrument for a new instrument. An issuer\nshould measure the effect of a modification or exchange as the difference between the fair value of the modified or exchanged warrant and the fair value of\nthat warrant immediately before modification or exchange and then apply a recognition model that comprises four categories of transactions and the\ncorresponding accounting treatment for each category (equity issuance, debt origination, debt modification, and modifications unrelated to equity issuance\nand debt origination or modification). ASU 2021-04 is effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim\nperiods within those fiscal years. An entity should apply the guidance provided in ASU 2021-04 prospectively to modifications or exchanges occurring on\nor after the effective date. Early adoption is permitted for all entities, including adoption in an interim period. If an entity elects to early adopt ASU 2021-\n04 in an interim period, the guidance should be applied as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. The adoption of ASU 2021-\n04 is not expected to have any impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statement presentation or disclosures.\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance.\nThis update requires certain annual disclosures about transactions with a government that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting\nmodel by analogy. This update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021, and early application is permitted. This guidance should\nbe applied either prospectively to all transactions that are reflected in financial statements at the date of initial application and new transactions that are\nentered into after the date of initial application or retrospectively to those transactions. The Company does not expect the impact of this guidance to have a\nmaterial impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company’s management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, authoritative guidance, if currently adopted, would have\na material impact on the Company’s financial statement presentation or disclosures.\nF-9\nMOXIAN (BVI) INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n3.

Income taxes\nThe Company and its subsidiaries file separate income tax returns.\nUnited States of America\nABit USA was incorporated in April 2022 and will have to file a tax return for the year ending December 31, 2022.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”) was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code.\nChanges include, but are not limited to, a U.S. corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the\ntransition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed\nrepatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017. As the Company has a September 30 fiscal year-end, the lower corporate income tax\nrate will be phased in, resulting in a U.S. statutory federal rate of approximately 24.5% for our fiscal year ending September 30, 2018, and 21% for\nsubsequent fiscal years. Accordingly, we have to remeasure our deferred tax assets on net operating loss carryforward in the U.S. at the lower enacted\ncooperated tax rate of 21%. However, this re-measurement has no effect on the Company’s income tax expenses as the Company has provided a 100%\nvaluation allowance on its deferred tax assets previously.\nAdditionally, the Tax Act imposes a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of historical earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and future foreign earnings\nare subject to U.S. taxation. The change in rate has caused us to remeasure all U.S. deferred income tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences and\nnet operating loss (NOL) carryforwards and recorded a one-time income tax payable in 8 years.\nBritish Virgin Islands\nMoxian BVI is incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. Under the current laws of the British Virgin Islands, Moxian BVI is not subject to tax on income\nor capital gains. In addition, upon payments of dividends by Moxian BVI, no British Virgin Islands withholding tax is imposed.\nHong Kong\nABit Hong Kong did not earn any income that was derived in Hong Kong since its incorporation and is therefore not to any Hong Kong profits tax.\nF-11\nMOXIAN (BVI) INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n7.

The Company’s PRC subsidiaries are subject to income tax rate of 25%, unless\notherwise specified.\nThe Company’s effective income tax rate was 0% for the period of six months to June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022.

The note 3 indicated that $3.5 million had been paid and the remaining $1.8 million will be paid in the second half of the year.\n9. Subsequent event\nIn August, 2023, the Company incorporated another wholly-owned subsidiary called Aibit USA, Inc in the State of Delaware. It has yet to begin operation\nas of the date of this report.\nF-12\nExhibit 99.3\nMoxian (BVI) Inc Reports Unaudited Financial Results for the First Half of 2023\nFollowing a very difficult year in 2022, when bitcoin prices to a low of about $15,000, 2023 began with a more cheerful note. Bitcoin prices on average for\nthe six months to June 2023 hover around the $26,000 mark.\nFor the Company, the immediate priority was the location of a new permanent site for its bitcoin operations. The earlier site, Columbus in Georgia proved\nto be untenable following volatile electricity prices as a result of the outbreak of the Ukraine War. Following intensive site searches, the Company decided\nto buy an outright piece of barren land for $1.2 million in April. Measuring about 1.8 acres and located in the town of Duff, near La Follette in the State of\nTennessee, the site was chosen as its power supply was stable and prices competitive. Site clearance, levelling and preparation began in earnest in May,\nfollowed by the other major works, such as control room/office construction, electrical and plumbing works. An agreement with the local utility board was\nsigned in August and by the end of September, a brand-new mining center was in place.\nThe Company also took the opportunity of a depressed market in 2022 to place an advance order for six units of supercomputing servers S19 XP for $5.3\nmillion to be delivered on a progressive basis from the last quarter of the year. This additional purchase, together with the earlier fleet of equipment shipped\nfrom China, will ensure that the Company had enhanced computing power for its mining activities when site mining begin in the last quarter of the year.\nThe financial analysis of the results of operations for the six months to June 30, 2023 as compared to the corresponding period have to be evaluated from\nan understanding that the operations in the two periods were largely different. In the period to June 30, 2022, the Company enjoyed about four months of\noperational activity before the effects of the skyrocketing electricity costs made it unprofitable to continue. In the current period to June 30, 2023, the\nCompany’s focus was on the construction of its new and permanent center and the results only comprise of a minor operation in Kazakhstan which started\nat the end of May. Only a meagre $7,272 was reported as revenue against $40,000 in the previous year.\nAs far as costs were concerned, the current year’s total includes operational US-based staff which did not exist in the corresponding period last year. The\nnet result was a loss for the six months to June 30, 2023 of $3.5 million, compared to a loss of $922,000 in the corresponding period in 2022.\nIn the Balance Sheet comparison, cash and cash equivalents saw a slight dip of just under a million, a large part of which was in payment of invoices for\nthe construction work-in-progress which amount to $1.5 million at the end of June 2023. Depreciation and other charges accounted for the net drop in total\nassets of the Company.\nAs of the date of this report, the new mining facility at Duff near La Follette, based on a new generation of hydro power, is virtually completed and the\nCompany expects results going forward to be increasingly better.\nMOXIAN (BVI) INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nAs of\nJune 30, 2023\nNote (Unaudited) December 31, 2022\nASSETS\nCurrent Assets\nCash and cash equivalents $ 1,538,831 $ 2,505,286\nPrepayments and other receivables 3 3,486,623 2,384,976\nTotal current assets 5,025,454 4,890,262\nDigital assets 4 4,716,979 7,087,747\nProperty, equipment and vehicles 5 9,736,152 12,553,408\nConstruction-in-progress 6 1,522,949 -\nTOTAL ASSETS 21,001,534 24,531,417\nLIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nOther payables and accruals $ 541,356 $ 613,455\nStockholders’ Equity\nPreferred stock, $0.001010 par value, authorized; 50,000,000 shares, 5,000,000\nshares issued and outstanding as of June 30, 2023 and December,31 2022 $ 5,050 $ 5,050\nCommon stock, $0.001 par value, authorized: 50,000,000 shares.

KEY INFORMATION\nOur Corporate Structure\nMoxian (BVI) Inc, or Moxian BVI, is not a PRC operating company but a British Virgin Islands holding company (“the Company”) resulting from\na merger with a U.S. domiciled subsidiary in August 2021. In July 2022, the Company divested its entire interest in Moxian (Hong Kong) Limited with the\nresult that it no longer has any business operations in the PRC and now solely operates in the bitcoin mining industry, with an operation through its U.S.\nsubsidiary, ABit USA Inc.\nBecause of the Company’s past history in operating in China, it could be subject to investigative action by the Chinese authorities but as of the\ndate of this report, the Company has not received any formal notification of such action. Whilst the Company acknowledges that such risks exist at any\ntime, it also believes that repeating them in great depth serves no purpose and can preclude a proper reading of this Report.\n1\nThe Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act\nOur common shares may be prohibited from trading on a national exchange or “over-the-counter” markets under the HFCAA if the PCAOB determines it\nis unable to inspect or investigate completely our auditors for three consecutive years beginning in 2021. Further, on June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed\nthe Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (“AHFCAA”) and on February 4, 2022, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the\nAmerica Creating Opportunities for Manufacturing Pre-Eminence in Technology and Economic Strength (COMPETES) Act of 2022, or the COMPETES\nAct. If either the AHFCAA or COMPETES Act is enacted into law, it would amend the HFCAA and require the SEC to prohibit an issuer’s securities from\ntrading on any U.S. stock exchanges if its auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspections or complete investigations for two consecutive years instead of\nthree.\nAt the Annual Meeting of its stockholders on August 12, 2022, the Company decided to appoint Audit Alliance LLP, a firm of accountants incorporated in\nthe Republic of Singapore, as the Company’s auditors for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nMerger\nThe Company is the surviving company following a merger in August 2021 with its predecessor company, Moxian, Inc., which was incorporated in\nNevada, U.S. As an offshore holding company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, we are qualified as a “foreign private issuer” within the meaning\nof the rules under the Exchange Act. As such, we are exempt from certain rules under the Exchange Act that are applicable to U.S. domestic issuers.\nMoreover, we are not required to provide as many Exchange Act reports, or as frequently or as promptly, as U.S. domestic issuers. We are also not required\nto provide the same level of disclosure on certain issues. In addition, as a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, we are permitted to adopt\ncertain home country practices in relation to corporate governance matters that differ significantly from that applied to the U.S. domestic issuers under the\nNasdaq listing rules. These exemptions and practices may afford less protection to our shareholders than they would enjoy if we were a U.S. domestic\nissuer.\nSelected Financial Data\nThe Company has a December 31 fiscal year-end which is different from that of its predecessor company which fiscal year-end was September 30.\nBecause of this change, the following table presents the selected consolidated financial information of our Company as of December 31, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021, The selected consolidated statements of operations data and the selected consolidated balance sheets data have been derived from our\naudited consolidated financial statements, which are included in this annual report. These audited consolidated financial statements begin on F-1 and are\nprepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP.

Risk Factors\nAn investment in our ordinary shares involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with\nall other information contained in this annual report, including the matters discussed under the headings “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Operating\nand Financial Review and Prospects” before you decide to invest in our ordinary shares. If any of the following risks, or any other risks and uncertainties\nthat are not presently foreseeable to us, actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and our future growth prospects\ncould be materially and adversely affected.\nSummary Of Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to a number of risks, including risks that may prevent us from achieving our business objectives or may adversely affect\nour business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects. These risks are discussed more fully below and include, but are not\nlimited to, risks related to:\nGeneral Risks\n● Failure to manage our liquidity and cash flows may materially and adversely affect our financial conditions and results of operations. As a result,\nwe may need additional capital, and financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\n● We have a history of operating losses, and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability; we have recently shifted our bitcoin mining\nbusiness, and we may not be successful in this business.\n● Our results of operation may fluctuate significantly and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business.\n● We may acquire other businesses, form joint ventures or acquire other companies or businesses that could negatively affect our operating results,\ndilute our stockholders’ ownership, increase our debt or cause us to incur significant expense; notwithstanding the foregoing, our growth may\ndepend on our success in uncovering and completing such transactions.\n● From time to time, we may evaluate and potentially consummate strategic investments or acquisitions, which could require significant\nmanagement attention, disrupt our business and adversely affect our financial results.\nRisks Related to Bitcoin Mining\n● Our results of operations are expected to vary with Bitcoin price volatility.\n● Our mining operating costs outpace our mining revenues, which could seriously harm our business or increase our losses.\n● We have an evolving business model which is subject to various uncertainties.\n● Regulatory changes or actions may alter the nature of an investment in us or restrict the use of cryptocurrencies in a manner that adversely affects\nour business, prospects or operations.\n● The development and acceptance of cryptographic and algorithmic protocols governing the issuance of and transactions in cryptocurrencies is\nsubject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate.\n● Banks and financial institutions may not provide banking services, or may cut off services, to businesses that engage in bitcoin-related activities or\nthat accept cryptocurrencies as payment, including financial institutions of investors in our securities.\n● We may face risks of Internet disruptions, which could have an adverse effect on the price of cryptocurrencies.\n● Acceptance and/or widespread use of bitcoin is uncertain.\n● The decentralized nature of bitcoin systems may lead to slow or inadequate responses to crises, which may negatively affect our business.\n● Our bitcoins may be subject to loss, theft or restriction on access.\n● There is a lack of liquid markets, and possible manipulation of blockchain/bitcoin-based assets.\n● Incorrect or fraudulent bitcoin transactions may be irreversible.\n● Our reliance primarily on a single model of miner may subject our operations to increased risk of mine failure.\n● Our future success will depend in large part upon the value of bitcoin; the value of bitcoin may be subject to pricing risk and has historically been\nsubject to wide swings.\n● Cryptocurrencies, including those maintained by or for us, may be exposed to cybersecurity threats and hacks.\n3\n● We are subject to risks associated with our need for significant electrical power. Government regulators may potentially restrict the ability of\nelectricity suppliers to provide electricity to mining operations, such as ours.\n● We may not adequately respond to price fluctuations and rapidly changing technology, which may negatively affect our business.\nRisks Involving Intellectual Property\n● Bitcoin and bitcoin mining operations rely on software and specialized technology.\n● We may not be able to prevent others from unauthorized use of our intellectual property, which could harm our business and competitive position.\n● We may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims, which may be expensive to defend and may disrupt our business and operations\n● Our platform and internal systems rely on software that is highly technical, and if it contains undetected errors, our business could be adversely\naffected.\nRisks Related to Our Ordinary Shares\n● Our ordinary shares may be thinly traded and you may be unable to sell at or near ask prices or at all if you need to sell your shares to raise money\nor otherwise desire to liquidate your shares.\n● We are not likely to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\n● You may face difficulties in protecting your interests as a shareholder, as the laws of British Virgin Islands provides substantially less protection\nwhen compared to the laws of the United States and it may be difficult for a shareholder of ours to effect service of process or to enforce\njudgements obtained in the United States courts.\n● Volatility in our ordinary shares price may subject us to securities litigation.\n● We may be unable to comply with the applicable continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, which may adversely impact our\naccess to capital markets and may cause us to default certain of our agreements\nGeneral Risks\nIf we are unable to successfully execute our bitcoin mining, it would adversely affect our financial and business condition and results of operations.\nAs of the date of this Report, the Company has yet to fully implement its plan to diversify into bitcoin mining as various mining sites have not\nbeen finalized. If we cannot execute the bitcoin mining, it would seriously affect our financial and business condition and deepen the losses of the\nCompany.\nFailure to manage our liquidity and cash flows may materially and adversely affect our financial conditions and results of operations. As a result, we\nmay need additional capital, and financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nThe Company is new to bitcoin mining and is operating in the United States for the first time. If we fail to manage our liquidity and cash flows, it\nwill seriously affect our financial condition and results of operations. We may need additional financing and such access may be limited or at unacceptable\nterms.\nWe have a history of operating losses, and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability; we have recently shifted our bitcoin mining business,\nand we may not be successful in this business.\nWe are not profitable and have incurred losses since our inception. We expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and these\nlosses could increase as we continue to work to develop our business. We were previously engaged in the business of mobile payments which we ceased\noperation in June 2018. Whilst we continue with the digital advertising business, it is proving to be increasingly difficult because of restrictions on online\ngaming. which is a key business of our clients. Starting in March 2022, we diversified into the bitcoin mining business. Our current strategy is new and\nunproven, is in an industry that is relatively itself new and evolving and is subject to the risks discussed below. Even if we achieve profitability in the\nfuture, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods.\nOur results of operation may fluctuate significantly and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business.\nOur results of operations, including the levels of our net revenues, expenses, net loss and other key metrics, may vary significantly in the future\ndue to a variety of factors, some of which are outside of our control, and period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful,\nespecially given our limited operating history. Accordingly, the results for any one quarter are not necessarily an indication of future performance.\nFluctuations in quarterly results may adversely affect the market price of our ordinary shares. Factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly financial\nresults include:\n● the amount and timing of operating expenses related to our new business operations and infrastructure;\n● fluctuations in the price of bitcoin; and\n● general economic, industry and market conditions.\n4\nWe may acquire other businesses, form joint ventures or acquire other companies or businesses that could negatively affect our operating results, dilute\nour stockholders’ ownership, increase our debt or cause us to incur significant expense; notwithstanding the foregoing, our growth may depend on our\nsuccess in uncovering and completing such transactions.\nWe are actively seeking other business opportunities, however, we cannot offer any assurance that acquisitions of businesses, assets and/or\nentering into strategic alliances or joint ventures will be successful. We may not be able to find suitable partners or acquisition candidates and may not be\nable to complete such transactions on favorable terms, if at all. If we make any acquisitions, we may not be able to integrate these acquisitions successfully\ninto our existing infrastructure. In addition, in the event we acquire any existing businesses we could assume unknown or contingent liabilities.\nAny future acquisitions also could result in the issuance of stock, incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or future write-offs of intangible assets\nor goodwill, any of which could have a negative impact on our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. Integration of an acquired\ncompany may also disrupt ongoing operations and require management resources that otherwise would be focused on developing and expanding our\nexisting business. We may experience losses related to potential investments in other companies, which could harm our financial condition and results of\noperations. Further, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, strategic alliance or joint venture if such investments do not materialize.\nTo finance any acquisitions or joint ventures, we may choose to issue ordinary shares, preferred stock or a combination of debt and equity as\nconsideration, which could significantly dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders or provide rights to such preferred stock holders in priority over\nour common stock holders. Additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. If the price of our common stock is low or\nvolatile, we may not be able to acquire other companies or fund a joint venture project using stock as consideration.\nFrom time to time we may evaluate and potentially consummate strategic investments or acquisitions, which could require significant management\nattention, disrupt our business and adversely affect our financial results.\nWe may evaluate and consider strategic investments, combinations, acquisitions or alliances in both the bitcoin mining business. These\ntransactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations if consummated. If we are able to identify an appropriate business\nopportunity, we may not be able to successfully consummate the transaction and, even if we do consummate such a transaction, we may be unable to obtain\nthe benefits or avoid the difficulties and risks of such transaction.\nStrategic investments or acquisitions will involve risks commonly encountered in business relationships, including:\n● difficulties in assimilating and integrating the operations, personnel, systems, data, technologies, products and services of the acquired\nbusiness;\n● inability of the acquired technologies, products or businesses to achieve expected levels of revenue, profitability, productivity or other\nbenefits;\n● difficulties in retaining, training, motivating and integrating key personnel;\n● diversion of management’s time and resources from our normal daily operations;\n● difficulties in successfully incorporating licensed or acquired technology and rights into our businesses;\n● difficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies within the combined organizations;\n● difficulties in retaining relationships with customers, employees and suppliers of the acquired business;\n● risks of entering markets, including the U.S., in which we have limited or no prior experience;\n5\nWe may not make any investments or acquisitions, or any future investments or acquisitions may not be successful, may not benefit our business\nstrategy, may not generate sufficient revenues to offset the associated acquisition costs or may not otherwise result in the intended benefits. In addition, we\ncannot assure you that any future investment in or acquisition of new businesses or technology will lead to the successful development of new or enhanced\nloan products and services or that any new or enhanced loan products and services, if developed, will achieve market acceptance or prove to be profitable.\nOur loss of any of our management team, our inability to execute an effective succession plan, or our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel,\ncould adversely affect our business.\nOur success and future growth will depend to a significant degree on the skills and services of our management, including our Chief Executive\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer. We will need to continue to grow our management in order to alleviate pressure on our existing team and in order to\ncontinue to develop our business. If our management, including any new hires that we may make, fails to work together effectively and to execute our plans\nand strategies on a timely basis, our business could be harmed. Furthermore, if we fail to execute an effective contingency or succession plan with the loss\nof any member of management, the loss of such management personnel may significantly disrupt our business.\nThe loss of key members of management could inhibit our growth prospects. Our future success also depends in large part on our ability to attract,\nretain and motivate key management and operating personnel. As we continue to develop and expand our operations, we may require personnel with\ndifferent skills and experiences, and who have a sound understanding of our business and the bitcoin industry. The market for highly qualified personnel in\nthis industry is very competitive and we may be unable to attract such personnel. If we are unable to attract such personnel, our business could be harmed.\nWe incur significant costs and demands upon management and accounting and finance resources as a result of complying with the laws and\nregulations affecting public companies; if we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate and timely\nfinancial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, our ability to operate our business and our reputation.\nAs a public reporting company, we are required to, among other things, maintain a system of effective internal control over financial reporting.\nEnsuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on\na timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently. Substantial work will continue to be required to further\nimplement, document, assess, test and remediate our system of internal controls.\nIf our internal control over financial reporting is not effective, we may be unable to issue our financial statements in a timely manner, we may be\nunable to obtain the required audit or review of our financial statements by our independent registered public accounting firm in a timely manner or we\nmay be otherwise unable to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the SEC, our common stock listing on Nasdaq could be suspended or\nterminated and our stock price could materially suffer. In addition, we or members of our management could be subject to investigation and sanction by the\nSEC and other regulatory authorities and to stockholder lawsuits, which could impose significant additional costs on us and divert management attention.\nBecause cryptocurrencies may be determined to be investment securities, we may inadvertently violate the Investment Company Act and incur large\nlosses as a result and potentially be required to register as an investment company or terminate operations and we may incur third party liabilities.\nWe are engaged in the mining of bitcoins which the SEC said is currency and not securities. We therefore believe that we are not engaged in the\nbusiness of investing, reinvesting, or trading in securities, and we do not hold ourselves out as being engaged in those activities. However, under the\nInvestment Company Act a company may be deemed an investment company under section 3(a)(1)(C) thereof if the value of its investment securities is\nmore than 40% of its total assets (exclusive of government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis.\n6\nIf, as a result of our investments and our mining activities, including investments in which we do not have a controlling interest, the investment\nsecurities we hold could exceed 40% of our total assets, exclusive of cash items and, accordingly, we could determine that we have become an inadvertent\ninvestment company. The bitcoins we own, acquire or mine may be deemed an investment security by the SEC, although we do not believe any of the\ncryptocurrencies we own, acquire or mine are securities. An inadvertent investment company can avoid being classified as an investment company if it can\nrely on one of the exclusions under the Investment Company Act. One such exclusion, Rule 3a-2 under the Investment Company Act, allows an inadvertent\ninvestment company a grace period of one year from the earlier of (a) the date on which an issuer owns securities and/or cash having a value exceeding\n50% of the issuer’s total assets on either a consolidated or unconsolidated basis and (b) the date on which an issuer owns or proposes to acquire investment\nsecurities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of such issuer’s total assets (exclusive of government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated\nbasis. We may take actions to cause the investment securities held by us to be less than 40% of our total assets, which may include acquiring assets with our\ncash and bitcoin on hand or liquidating our investment securities or bitcoin or seeking a no-action letter from the SEC if we are unable to acquire sufficient\nassets or liquidate sufficient investment securities in a timely manner.\nAs the Rule 3a-2 exception is available to a company no more than once every three years, and assuming no other exclusion were available to us,\nwe would have to keep within the 40% limit for at least three years after we cease being an inadvertent investment company. This may limit our ability to\nmake certain investments or enter into joint ventures that could otherwise have a positive impact on our earnings. In any event, we do not intend to become\nan investment company engaged in the business of investing and trading securities.\nClassification as an investment company under the Investment Company Act requires registration with the SEC. If an investment company fails to\nregister, it would have to stop doing almost all business, and its contracts would become voidable. Registration is time consuming and restrictive and would\nrequire a restructuring of our operations, and we would be very constrained in the kind of business we could do as a registered investment company.\nFurther, we would become subject to substantial regulation concerning management, operations, transactions with affiliated persons and portfolio\ncomposition, and would need to file reports under the Investment Company Act regime. The cost of such compliance would result in the Company\nincurring substantial additional expenses, and the failure to register if required would have a materially adverse impact to conduct our operations.\nWe face risks similar to that of the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, which could significantly disrupt our operations and financial results.\nAlthough the outbreak of the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) appears to be over, we believe that our results of operations, business and financial\ncondition could be adversely impacted by the effects of any outbreak of any severe virus affecting public health.\nThe continued spread of the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) or the occurrence of other epidemics and the imposition of public health measures\nand travel and business restrictions will adversely affect impact our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. In addition, we have\nexperienced and will experience disruptions to our business operations resulting from quarantines, self-isolations, or other movement and restrictions on the\nability of our employees to perform their jobs. If we are unable to effectively service our miners, our ability to mine bitcoin will be adversely affected as\nminers go offline, which would have an adverse effect on our business and the results of our operations.\n7\nIf we cannot maintain our corporate culture as we grow, we could lose the innovation, collaboration and focus that contribute to our business.\nWe believe that a critical component of our success is our corporate culture, which we believe fosters innovation, encourages teamwork and\ncultivates creativity. As we develop the infrastructure of a public company and continue to grow, we may find it difficult to maintain these valuable aspects\nof our corporate culture. Any failure to preserve our culture could negatively impact our future success, including our ability to attract and retain\nemployees, encourage innovation and teamwork and effectively focus on and pursue our corporate objectives.\nIf the PRC government determines that the historical contractual arrangements with the former PRC subsidiaries structure did not comply with PRC\nregulation, or if these regulations change or are interpreted differently in the future, our shares may decline in value or become worthless if we are\ndeemed to be unable to assert our contractual control rights over the assets of the former subsidiaries.\nMoxian (BVI) Inc. is a British Virgin islands holding company with operations primarily conducted by its subsidiaries and, historically, through\ncontractual arrangements with former subsidiaries based in China. In the past we primarily operated our businesses in China through the former\nsubsidiaries.\nIn order to streamline our corporate structure and considering the changing regulatory environment, we have completed the divestment of our\nPRC subsidiaries to Jiantao Liu, a resident of China, for the disposal of all equity interests of Moxian (Hong Kong) Limited for a cash consideration of\nHKD 1,000. Accordingly, all contractual arrangements involving the PRC subsidiaries were effectively terminated.\nAlthough we have completed the divestment in July 2022, the PRC government could find any one of our previous agreements non-compliant\nwith relevant PRC laws, regulations, and rules, or if these laws, regulations, and rules or the interpretation thereof change in the future, and such changes\nmay be retroactively applied to our historical contractual arrangements, we could be subject to severe penalties and require a potential restatement of our\nfinancial statements included elsewhere in this annual report. As a result, our shares may decline in value or become worthless.\nThere remain substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current and future PRC laws, regulations, and rules which may\nbe relevant to our former PRC subsidiaries’ and our former operations in China, including potential future actions by the PRC government which may\nretroactively affect the enforceability and legality of our historical operations involving the former PRC subsidiaries.\nAlthough we divested ourselves of the PRC subsidiaries in July 2022 and we no longer have operations in China, we may be subject to potential\nfuture actions by the PRC government which may retroactively affect the enforceability and legality of our historical operations involving the former PRC\nsubsidiaries. If the PRC government finds such agreements non-compliant with relevant PRC laws, regulations, and rules, or if these laws, regulations, and\nrules or the interpretation thereof change in the future, and such changes may be retroactively applied to our historical contractual arrangements, we could\nbe subject to severe penalties. As such, the following former risk factors of doing business in China may still apply:\n● Changes in China’s economic, political or social conditions or government policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and\nresults of operations.\n● Uncertainties in the interpretation and enforcement of Chinese laws and regulations could limit the legal protections available to us.\n● The PRC government may intervene or influence our operations at any time, or may exert more control over offerings conducted overseas and/or\nforeign investment in China-based issuers, which could result in a material change in our operations and/or cause the value of our securities to\nsignificantly decline or be worthless.\n● PRC regulations establish complex procedures for some acquisitions conducted by foreign investors, which could make it more difficult for us to\npursue growth through acquisitions in China.\n● The PCAOB is currently unable to inspect our auditor in relation to their audit work performed for our financial statements and the inability of the\nPCAOB to conduct inspections or investigation completely over our auditor deprives our investors with the benefits of such inspections.\n● Our ordinary shares will be prohibited from trading in the United States under the HFCAA in 2024 if the PCAOB is unable to inspect or fully\ninvestigate auditors located in China, or as early as 2023 if proposed changes to the law are enacted. The delisting of our ordinary shares, or the\nthreat of their being delisted, may materially and adversely affect the value of your investment.\n● PRC regulations relating to the establishment of offshore special purpose companies by PRC residents may limit our ability to inject capital into\nour PRC subsidiaries, limit our subsidiaries’ ability to increase their registered capital or distribute profits to us, or may otherwise adversely affect\nus\n● PRC regulation of loans to and direct investment in PRC entities by offshore holding companies and governmental control of currency conversion\nmay delay or prevent us from using offshore funds to make loans to our PRC subsidiaries, or to make additional capital contributions to our PRC\nsubsidiaries.\n● Regulatory bodies of the United States may be limited in their ability to conduct investigations or inspections of our operations in China.\n● Enhanced scrutiny over acquisition transactions by the PRC tax authorities may have a negative impact on potential acquisitions we may pursue in\nthe future.\n● Fluctuations in exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the value of your investment.\n8\nRisks related to Bitcoin Mining\nOur results of operations are expected to vary with Bitcoin price volatility\nThe price of Bitcoin has experienced significant fluctuations over its relatively short existence and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the\nfuture.\nWe expect our results of operations to continue to be affected by the Bitcoin price as most of the revenue is from bitcoin mining production as of\nthe filing date. Any future significant reductions in the price of Bitcoin will likely have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations and\nfinancial condition. We cannot assure you that the Bitcoin price will remain high enough to sustain our operation or that the Bitcoin price will not decline\nsignificantly in the future.\nVarious factors, mostly beyond our control, could impact the Bitcoin price. For example, the usage of Bitcoins in the retail and commercial\nmarketplace is relatively low in comparison with the usage for speculation, which contributes to Bitcoin price volatility. Additionally, the reward for\nBitcoin mining will decline over time, with the most recent halving event occurred in May 2020 and next one four years later, which may further contribute\nto Bitcoin price volatility.\nOur mining operating costs outpace our mining revenues, which could seriously harm our business or increase our losses.\nOur mining operations are costly and our expenses may increase in the future. We intend to use funds on hand from our private placement to\ncontinue to purchase bitcoin mining machines. This expense increase may not be offset by a corresponding increase in revenue. Our expenses may be\ngreater than we anticipate, and our investments to make our business more efficient may not succeed and may outpace monetization efforts. Increases in\nour costs without a corresponding increase in our revenue would increase our losses and could seriously harm our business and financial perform\nWe have an evolving business model which is subject to various uncertainties.\nAs bitcoin assets may become more widely available, we expect the services and products associated with them to evolve. In order to stay current\nwith the industry, our business model may need to evolve as well. From time to time, we may modify aspects of our business model relating to our strategy.\nWe cannot offer any assurance that these or any other modifications will be successful or will not result in harm to our business. We may not be able to\nmanage growth effectively, which could damage our reputation, limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results. Further, we cannot provide any\nassurance that we will successfully identify all emerging trends and growth opportunities in this business sector and we may lose out on those\nopportunities. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations.\nRegulatory changes or actions may alter the nature of an investment in us or restrict the use of cryptocurrencies in a manner that adversely affects our\nbusiness, prospects or operations.\nAs cryptocurrencies have grown in both popularity and market size, governments around the world have reacted differently to cryptocurrencies;\ncertain governments have deemed them illegal, and others have allowed their use and trade without restriction, while in some jurisdictions, such as in the\nU.S., subject to extensive, and in some cases overlapping, unclear and evolving regulatory requirements. Ongoing and future regulatory actions may impact\nour ability to continue to operate, and such actions could affect our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations.\nThe development and acceptance of cryptographic and algorithmic protocols governing the issuance of and transactions in cryptocurrencies is subject\nto a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate.\nThe use of cryptocurrencies to, among other things, buy and sell goods and services and complete transactions, is part of a new and rapidly\nevolving industry that employs bitcoin assets based upon a computer-generated mathematical and/or cryptographic protocol. Large-scale acceptance of\ncryptocurrencies as a means of payment has not, and may never, occur. The growth of this industry in general, and the use of bitcoin, in particular, is\nsubject to a high degree of uncertainty, and the slowing or stopping of the development or acceptance of developing protocols may occur unpredictably.\nThe factors include, but are not limited to:\n● continued worldwide growth in the adoption and use of cryptocurrencies as a medium to exchange;\n● governmental and quasi-governmental regulation of cryptocurrencies and their use, or restrictions on or regulation of access to and operation\nof the network or similar bitcoin systems;\n● changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences;\n● the maintenance and development of the open-source software protocol of the network;\n9\n● the increased consolidation of contributors to the bitcoin blockchain through mining pools;\n● the availability and popularity of other forms or methods of buying and selling goods and services, including new means of using fiat\ncurrencies;\n● the use of the networks supporting cryptocurrencies for developing smart contracts and distributed applications;\n● general economic conditions and the regulatory environment relating to cryptocurrencies; and\n● negative consumer sentiment and perception of bitcoin specifically and cryptocurrencies generally.\nThe outcome of these factors could have negative effects on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our business strategy at all,\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations as well as potentially negative effect on the value of any bitcoin or\nother cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account, which would harm investors in our securities.\nBanks and financial institutions may not provide banking services, or may cut off services, to businesses that engage in bitcoin-related activities or that\naccept cryptocurrencies as payment, including financial institutions of investors in our securities.\nA number of companies that engage in bitcoin and/or other bitcoin-related activities have been unable to find banks or financial institutions that\nare willing to provide them with bank accounts and other services. Similarly, a number of companies and individuals or businesses associated with\ncryptocurrencies may have had and may continue to have their existing bank accounts closed or services discontinued with financial institutions in response\nto government action, particularly in China, where regulatory response to cryptocurrencies has been to exclude their use for ordinary consumer transactions\nwithin China. We also may be unable to obtain or maintain these services for our business. The difficulty that many businesses that provide bitcoin and/or\nderivatives on other bitcoin-related activities have and may continue to have in finding banks and financial institutions willing to provide them services\nmay be decreasing the usefulness of cryptocurrencies as a payment system and harming public perception of cryptocurrencies, and could decrease their\nusefulness and harm their public perception in the future.\nThe usefulness of cryptocurrencies as a payment system and the public perception of cryptocurrencies could be damaged if banks or financial\ninstitutions were to close the accounts of businesses engaging in bitcoin and/or other bitcoin-related activities. This could occur as a result of compliance\nrisk, cost, government regulation or public pressure. The risk applies to securities firms, clearance and settlement firms, national stock and derivatives on\ncommodities exchanges, the over-the-counter market, and the Depository Trust Company, which, if any of such entities adopts or implements similar\npolicies, rules or regulations, could negatively affect our relationships with financial institutions and impede our ability to convert cryptocurrencies to fiat\ncurrencies. Such factors could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and harm investors.\nWe may face risks of Internet disruptions, which could have an adverse effect on the price of cryptocurrencies.\nA disruption of the Internet may affect the use of cryptocurrencies and subsequently the value of our securities. Generally, cryptocurrencies and\nour business of mining cryptocurrencies is dependent upon the Internet. A significant disruption in Internet connectivity could disrupt a currency’s network\noperations until the disruption is resolved and have an adverse effect on the price of cryptocurrencies and our ability to mine cryptocurrencies.\n10\nThe impact of geopolitical and economic events on the supply and demand for cryptocurrencies is uncertain.\nGeopolitical crises may motivate large-scale purchases of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which could increase the price of bitcoin and other\ncryptocurrencies rapidly. This may increase the likelihood of a subsequent price decrease as crisis-driven purchasing behavior dissipates, adversely\naffecting the value of our inventory following such downward adjustment. Such risks are similar to the risks of purchasing commodities in general\nuncertain times, such as the risk of purchasing, holding or selling gold. Alternatively, as an emerging asset class with limited acceptance as a payment\nsystem or commodity, global crises and general economic downturn may discourage investment in cryptocurrencies as investors focus their investment on\nless volatile asset classes as a means of hedging their investment risk.\nAs an alternative to fiat currencies that are backed by central governments, cryptocurrencies, which are relatively new, are subject to supply and\ndemand forces. How such supply and demand will be impacted by geopolitical events is largely uncertain but could be harmful to us and investors in our\ncommon stock. Political or economic crises may motivate large-scale acquisitions or sales of cryptocurrencies either globally or locally. Such events could\nhave a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect\non our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or any other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our\nown account.\nAcceptance and/or widespread use of bitcoin is uncertain.\nCurrently, there is a relatively limited use of any bitcoin in the retail and commercial marketplace, thus contributing to price volatility that could\nadversely affect an investment in our securities. Banks and other established financial institutions may refuse to process funds for bitcoin transactions,\nprocess wire transfers to or from bitcoin exchanges, bitcoin-related companies or service providers, or maintain accounts for persons or entities transacting\nin bitcoin. Conversely, a significant portion of bitcoin demand is generated by investors seeking a long-term store of value or speculators seeking to profit\nfrom the short- or long-term holding of the asset. Price volatility undermines any bitcoin’s role as a medium of exchange, as retailers are much less likely to\naccept it as a form of payment. Market capitalization for a bitcoin as a medium of exchange and payment method may always be low.\nThe relative lack of acceptance of bitcoins in the retail and commercial marketplace, or a reduction of such use, limits the ability of end users to\nuse them to pay for goods and services. Such lack of acceptance or decline in acceptances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as\na going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the\nvalue of bitcoins we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account.\nTransactional fees may decrease demand for bitcoin and prevent expansion.\nAs the number of bitcoins currency rewards awarded for solving a block in a blockchain decreases, the incentive for miners to continue to\ncontribute to the bitcoin network may transition from a set reward to transaction fees. In order to incentivize miners to continue to contribute to the bitcoin\nnetwork, the bitcoin network may either formally or informally transition from a set reward to transaction fees earned upon solving a block. This transition\ncould be accomplished by miners independently electing to record in the blocks they solve only those transactions that include payment of a transaction\nfee. If transaction fees paid for bitcoin transactions become too high, the marketplace may be reluctant to accept bitcoin as a means of payment and existing\nusers may be motivated to switch from bitcoin to another bitcoin or to fiat currency. Either the requirement from miners of higher transaction fees in\nexchange for recording transactions in a blockchain or a software upgrade that automatically charges fees for all transactions may decrease demand for\nbitcoin and prevent the expansion of the bitcoin network to retail merchants and commercial businesses, resulting in a reduction in the price of bitcoin that\ncould adversely impact an investment in our securities. Decreased use and demand for bitcoin may adversely affect its value and result in a reduction in the\nprice of bitcoin and the value of our common stock.\n11\nThe decentralized nature of bitcoin systems may lead to slow or inadequate responses to crises, which may negatively affect our business.\nThe decentralized nature of the governance of bitcoin systems may lead to ineffective decision making that slows development or prevents a\nnetwork from overcoming emergent obstacles. Governance of many bitcoin systems is by voluntary consensus and open competition with no clear\nleadership structure or authority. To the extent lack of clarity in corporate governance of bitcoin systems leads to ineffective decision making that slows\ndevelopment and growth of such cryptocurrencies, the value of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nIt may be illegal now, or in the future, to acquire, own, hold, sell or use bitcoin, ether, or other cryptocurrencies, participate in blockchains or utilize\nsimilar bitcoin assets in one or more countries, the ruling of which would adversely affect us.\nAlthough currently cryptocurrencies generally are not regulated or are lightly regulated in most countries, one or more countries such as China and\nRussia, which have taken harsh regulatory action, may take regulatory actions in the future that could severely restrict the right to acquire, own, hold, sell\nor use these bitcoin assets or to exchange for fiat currency. In many nations, particularly in China and Russia, it is illegal to accept payment in bitcoin and\nother cryptocurrencies for consumer transactions and banking institutions are barred from accepting deposits of cryptocurrencies. Such restrictions may\nadversely affect us as the large-scale use of cryptocurrencies as a means of exchange is presently confined to certain regions globally. Such circumstances\ncould have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for\nour own account, and harm investors.\nThere is a lack of liquid markets, and possible manipulation of blockchain/bitcoin-based assets.\nCryptocurrencies that are represented and trade on a ledger-based platform may not necessarily benefit from viable trading markets. Stock\nexchanges have listing requirements and vet issuers; requiring them to be subjected to rigorous listing standards and rules, and monitor investors\ntransacting on such platform for fraud and other improprieties. These conditions may not necessarily be replicated on a distributed ledger platform,\ndepending on the platform’s controls and other policies. The laxer a distributed ledger platform is about vetting issuers of bitcoin assets or users that\ntransact on the platform, the higher the potential risk for fraud or the manipulation of the ledger due to a control event. These factors may decrease liquidity\nor volume or may otherwise increase volatility of investment securities or other assets trading on a ledger-based system, which may adversely affect us.\nSuch circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have\na material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise\nacquire or hold for our own account, and harm investors.\nOur operations, investment strategies and profitability may be adversely affected by competition from other methods of investing in cryptocurrencies.\nWe compete with other users and/or companies that are mining cryptocurrencies and other potential financial vehicles, including securities backed\nby or linked to cryptocurrencies through entities similar to us. Market and financial conditions, and other conditions beyond our control, may make it more\nattractive to invest in other financial vehicles, or to invest in cryptocurrencies directly, which could limit the market for our shares and reduce their\nliquidity. The emergence of other financial vehicles and exchange-traded funds have been scrutinized by regulators and such scrutiny and the negative\nimpressions or conclusions resulting from such scrutiny could be applicable to us and impact our ability to successfully pursue our new strategy or operate\nat all, or to establish or maintain a public market for our securities. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a\ngoing concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the\nvalue of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account, and harm investors.\nThe development and acceptance of competing blockchain platforms or technologies may cause consumers to use alternative distributed ledgers or\nother alternatives.\nThe development and acceptance of competing blockchain platforms or technologies may cause consumers to use alternative distributed ledgers or\nan alternative to distributed ledgers altogether. Our business utilizes presently existent digital ledgers and blockchains and we could face difficulty adapting\nto emergent digital ledgers, blockchains, or alternatives thereto. This may adversely affect us and our exposure to various blockchain technologies and\nprevent us from realizing the anticipated profits from our investments. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as\na going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the\nvalue of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account, and harm investors.\n12\nOur bitcoins may be subject to loss, theft or restriction on access.\nThere is a risk that some or all of our bitcoins could be lost or stolen. Cryptocurrencies are stored in bitcoin sites commonly referred to as\n“wallets” by holders of bitcoins which may be accessed to exchange a holder’s bitcoin assets. Access to our bitcoin assets could also be restricted by\ncybercrime (such as a denial of service attack) against a service at which we maintain a hosted hot wallet. A hot wallet refers to any bitcoin wallet that is\nconnected to the Internet. Generally, hot wallets are easier to set up and access than wallets in cold storage, but they are also more susceptible to hackers\nand other technical vulnerabilities. Cold storage refers to any bitcoin wallet that is not connected to the Internet. Cold storage is generally more secure than\nhot storage, but is not ideal for quick or regular transactions and we may experience lag time in our ability to respond to market fluctuations in the price of\nour bitcoin assets. We hold all of our cryptocurrencies in cold storage to reduce the risk of malfeasance, but the risk of loss of our bitcoin assets cannot be\nwholly eliminated.\nHackers or malicious actors may launch attacks to steal, compromise or secure cryptocurrencies, such as by attacking the bitcoin network source\ncode, exchange miners, third-party platforms, cold and hot storage locations or software, or by other means. We may be in control and possession of one of\nthe more substantial holdings of bitcoins. As we increase in size, we may become a more appealing target of hackers, malware, cyber-attacks or other\nsecurity threats. Any of these events may adversely affect our operations and, consequently, our investments and profitability. The loss or destruction of a\nprivate key required to access our digital wallets may be irreversible and we may be denied access for all time to our bitcoin holdings or the holdings of\nothers held in those compromised wallets. Our loss of access to our private keys or our experience of a data loss relating to our digital wallets could\nadversely affect our investments and assets.\nCryptocurrencies are controllable only by the possessor of both the unique public and private keys relating to the local or online digital wallet in\nwhich they are held, which wallet’s public key or address is reflected in the network’s public blockchain. We will publish the public key relating to digital\nwallets in use when we verify the receipt of transfers and disseminate such information into the network, but we will need to safeguard the private keys\nrelating to such digital wallets. To the extent such private keys are lost, destroyed or otherwise compromised, we will be unable to access our bitcoin\nrewards and such private keys may not be capable of being restored by any network. Any loss of private keys relating to digital wallets used to store our\ncryptocurrencies could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise\nacquire or hold for our own account.\nRisks due to hacking or adverse software event.\nIn order to minimize risk, we have established processes to manage wallets that are associated with our bitcoin holdings. There can be no\nassurances that any processes we have adopted or will adopt in the future are or will be secure or effective, and we would suffer significant and immediate\nadverse effects if we suffered a loss of our bitcoin due to an adverse software or cybersecurity event. We utilize several layers of threat reduction\ntechniques, including: (i) the use of hardware wallets to store sensitive private key information; (ii) performance of transactions offline; and (iii) offline\ngeneration storage and use of private keys.\nAt present, the Company is evaluating several third-party custodial wallet alternatives, but there can be no assurance that such services will be\nmore secure than those the Company presently employs. Human error and the constantly evolving state of cybercrime and hacking techniques may render\npresent security protocols and procedures ineffective in ways which we cannot predict. If our security procedures and protocols are ineffectual and our\nbitcoin assets are compromised by cybercriminals, we may not have adequate recourse to recover our losses stemming from such compromise and we may\nlose much of the accumulated value of our bitcoin mining activities. This would have a negative impact on our business and operations.\n13\nIncorrect or fraudulent bitcoin transactions may be irreversible.\nBitcoin transactions are irrevocable and stolen or incorrectly transferred cryptocurrencies may be irretrievable. As a result, any incorrectly\nexecuted or fraudulent bitcoin transactions could adversely affect our investments and assets.\nBitcoin transactions are not, from an administrative perspective, reversible without the consent and active participation of the recipient of the\ncryptocurrencies from the transaction. In theory, bitcoin transactions may be reversible with the control or consent of a majority of processing power on the\nnetwork, however, we do not now, nor is it feasible that we could in the future, possess sufficient processing power to effect this reversal. Once a\ntransaction has been verified and recorded in a block that is added to a blockchain, an incorrect transfer of a bitcoin or a theft thereof generally will not be\nreversible and we may not have sufficient recourse to recover our losses from any such transfer or theft. It is possible that, through computer or human\nerror, or through theft or criminal action, our bitcoin rewards could be transferred in incorrect amounts or to unauthorized third parties, or to uncontrolled\naccounts. Further, according to the SEC, at this time, there is no specifically enumerated U.S. or foreign governmental, regulatory, investigative or\nprosecutorial authority or mechanism through which to bring an action or complaint regarding missing or stolen bitcoin. We are, therefore, presently reliant\non existing private investigative entities, such as Chain analysis and Kroll to investigate any potential loss of our bitcoin assets. These third-party service\nproviders rely on data analysis and compliance of ISPs with traditional court orders to reveal information such as the IP addresses of any attackers who may\nhave target us. To the extent that we are unable to recover our losses from such action, error or theft, such events could have a material adverse effect on\nour ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or\noperations of and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account.\nOur interactions with a blockchain may expose us to SDN or blocked persons or cause us to violate provisions of law that did not contemplate distribute\nledger technology.\nThe Office of Financial Assets Control of the US Department of Treasury requires us to comply with its sanction program and not conduct\nbusiness with persons named on its specially designated nationals (“SDN”) list. However, because of the pseudonymous nature of blockchain transactions\nwe may inadvertently and without our knowledge engage in transactions with persons named on OFAC’s SDN list. Our Company’s policy prohibits any\ntransactions with such SDN individuals, but we may not be adequately capable of determining the ultimate identity of the individual with whom we\ntransact with respect to selling bitcoin assets. Moreover, federal law prohibits any US person from knowingly or unknowingly possessing any visual\ndepiction commonly known as child pornography. Recent media reports have suggested that persons have imbedded such depictions on one or more\nblockchains. Because our business requires us to download and retain one or more blockchains to effectuate our ongoing business, it is possible that such\ndigital ledgers contain prohibited depictions without our knowledge or consent. To the extent government enforcement authorities literally enforce these\nand other laws and regulations that are impacted by decentralized distributed ledger technology, we may be subject to investigation, administrative or court\nproceedings, and civil or criminal monetary fines and penalties, all of which could harm our reputation and affect the value of our common stock.\nCryptocurrencies face significant scaling obstacles that can lead to high fees or slow transaction settlement times.\nCryptocurrencies face significant scaling obstacles that can lead to high fees or slow transaction settlement times, and attempts to increase the\nvolume of transactions may not be effective. Scaling cryptocurrencies is essential to the widespread acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a means of payment,\nwhich widespread acceptance is necessary to the continued growth and development of our business. Many bitcoin networks face significant scaling\nchallenges. For example, cryptocurrencies are limited with respect to how many transactions can occur per second. Participants in the bitcoin ecosystem\ndebate potential approaches to increasing the average number of transactions per second that the network can handle and have implemented mechanisms or\nare researching ways to increase scale, such as increasing the allowable sizes of blocks, and therefore the number of transactions per block, and sharding (a\nhorizontal partition of data in a database or search engine), which would not require every single transaction to be included in every single miner’s or\nvalidator’s block. However, there is no guarantee that any of the mechanisms in place or being explored for increasing the scale of settlement of bitcoin\ntransactions will be effective, or how long they will take to become effective, which could adversely affect an investment in our securities.\n14\nThe price of cryptocurrencies may be affected by the sale of such cryptocurrencies by other vehicles investing in cryptocurrencies or tracking bitcoin\nmarkets.\nThe global market for bitcoin is characterized by supply constraints that differ from those present in the markets for commodities or other assets\nsuch as gold and silver. The mathematical protocols under which certain cryptocurrencies are mined permit the creation of a limited, predetermined amount\nof currency, while others have no limit established on total supply. To the extent that other vehicles investing in cryptocurrencies or tracking bitcoin\nmarkets form and come to represent a significant proportion of the demand for cryptocurrencies, large redemptions of the securities of those vehicles and\nthe subsequent sale of cryptocurrencies by such vehicles could negatively affect bitcoin prices and therefore affect the value of the bitcoin inventory we\nhold. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise\nacquire or hold for our own account.\nBecause there has been limited precedent set for financial accounting of bitcoin and other bitcoin assets, the determination that we have made for how\nto account for bitcoin assets transactions may be subject to change.\nBecause there has been limited precedent set for the financial accounting of cryptocurrencies and related revenue recognition and no official\nguidance has yet been provided by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or the SEC, it is unclear how companies may in the future be required to\naccount for bitcoin transactions and assets and related revenue recognition. A change in regulatory or financial accounting standards could result in the\nnecessity to change our accounting methods and restate our financial statements. Such a restatement could adversely affect the accounting for our newly\nmined bitcoin rewards and more generally negatively impact our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operation. Such circumstances\nwould have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which would have a material adverse\neffect on our business, prospects or operations as well as and potentially the value of any cryptocurrencies we hold or expects to acquire for our own\naccount and harm investors.\nThere are risks related to technological obsolescence, the vulnerability of the global supply chain for bitcoin hardware disruption, and difficulty in\nobtaining new hardware which may have a negative effect on our business.\nOur mining operations can only be successful and ultimately profitable if the costs, including hardware and electricity costs, associated with\nmining cryptocurrencies are lower than the price of a bitcoin. As our mining facility operates, our miners experience ordinary wear and tear, and may also\nface more significant malfunctions caused by a number of extraneous factors beyond our control. The degradation of our miners will require us to, over\ntime, replace those miners which are no longer functional. Additionally, as the technology evolves, we may be required to acquire newer models of miners\nto remain competitive in the market. Reports have been released which indicate that miner manufacturer or seller adjusts the prices of its miners according\nto bitcoin prices, so the cost of new machines is unpredictable but could be extremely high. As a result, at times, we may obtain miners and other hardware\nfrom third parties at premium prices, to the extent they are available. This upgrading process requires substantial capital investment, and we may face\nchallenges. Further, the global supply chain for bitcoin miners is presently heavily dependent on China, which has been severely affected by the emergence\nof the COVID-19 coronavirus global pandemic. The global reliance on China as a main supplier of bitcoin miners has been called into question in the wake\nof the COVID-19 pandemic. Should similar outbreaks or other disruptions to the China-based global supply chain for bitcoin hardware occur, we may not\nbe able to obtain adequate replacement parts for our existing miners or to obtain additional miners from the manufacturer on a timely basis. Such events\ncould have a material adverse effect on our ability to pursue our new strategy, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and the value of\nour ordinary shares.\n15\nOur reliance primarily on a single model of miner may subject our operations to increased risk of mine failure.\nThe performance and reliability of our miners and our technology is critical to our reputation and our operations. Because we currently only use\nMicroBT miners, if there are issues with those machines, our entire system could be affected. Any system error or failure may significantly delay response\ntimes or even cause our system to fail. Any disruption in our ability to continue mining could result in lower yields and harm our reputation and business.\nAny exploitable weakness, flaw, or error common to MicroBT miners affects all our miners, if a defect other flaw is exploited, our entire mine could go\noffline simultaneously. Any interruption, delay or system failure could result in financial losses, a decrease in the trading price of our common stock and\ndamage to our reputation.\nThe Company’s reliance on a third-party mining pool service provider for our mining revenue payouts may have a negative impact on the Company\noperations.\nWe use third–party mining pools to receive our mining rewards from the network. Mining pools allow miners to combine their processing power,\nincreasing their chances of solving a block and getting paid by the network. The rewards are distributed by the pool operator, proportionally to our\ncontribution to the pool’s overall mining power, used to generate each block. Should the pool operator’s system suffer downtime due to a cyber-attack,\nsoftware malfunction or other similar issues, it will negatively impact our ability to mine and receive revenue. Furthermore, we are dependent on the\naccuracy of the mining pool operator’s record keeping to accurately record the total processing power provided to the pool for a given bitcoin mining\napplication in order to assess the proportion of that total processing power we provided. While we have internal methods of tracking both our power\nprovided and the total used by the pool, the mining pool operator uses its own record-keeping to determine our proportion of a given reward. We have little\nmeans of recourse against the mining pool operator if we determine the proportion of the reward paid out to us by the mining pool operator is incorrect,\nother than leaving the pool. If we are unable to consistently obtain accurate proportionate rewards from our mining pool operators, we may experience\nreduced reward for our efforts, which would have an adverse effect on our business and operations.\nThe bitcoin for which we mine, bitcoin, is subject to halving; the bitcoin reward for successfully uncovering a block will halve several times in the\nfuture and their value may not adjust to compensate us for the reduction in the rewards we receive from our mining efforts.\nHalving is a process designed to control the overall supply and reduce the risk of inflation in cryptocurrencies using a Proof-of-Work consensus\nalgorithm. At a predetermined block, the mining reward is cut in half, hence the term “halving.” For bitcoin, the reward was initially set at 50 bitcoin\ncurrency rewards per block and this was cut in half to 25 in November 28, 2012 at block 210,000 and again to 12.5 on July 9, 2016 at block 420,000 and in\nMay 2020 at block 630,000 when the reward reduced to 6.25. This process will reoccur until the total amount of bitcoin currency rewards issued reaches 21\nmillion, which is expected around 2140. While bitcoin prices have had a history of price fluctuations around the halving of its bitcoin rewards, there is no\nguarantee that the price change will be favorable or would compensate for the reduction in mining reward. If a corresponding and proportionate increase in\nthe trading price of bitcoin does not follow these anticipated halving events, the revenue we earn from our mining operations would see a corresponding\ndecrease, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\n16\nOur future success will depend in large part upon the value of bitcoin; the value of bitcoin may be subject to pricing risk and has historically been\nsubject to wide swings.\nOur operating results will depend in large part upon the value of bitcoin because it’s the primary bitcoin we currently mine. Specifically, our\nrevenues from our bitcoin mining operations are based upon two factors: (1) the number of bitcoin rewards we successfully mine and (2) the value of\nbitcoin. In addition, our operating results are directly impacted by changes in the value of bitcoin, because under the value measurement model, both\nrealized and unrealized changes will be reflected in our statement of operations (i.e., we will be marking bitcoin to fair value each quarter). This means that\nour operating results will be subject to swings based upon increases or decreases in the value of bitcoin. Furthermore, our strategy focuses almost entirely\non bitcoin (as opposed to other cryptocurrencies). Further, our current application-specific integrated circuit (“ASIC”) machines (which we refer to as\n“miners”) are principally utilized for mining bitcoin and bitcoin cash and cannot mine other cryptocurrencies, such as ether, that are not mined utilizing the\n“SHA-256 algorithm.” If other cryptocurrencies were to achieve acceptance at the expense of bitcoin or bitcoin cash causing the value of bitcoin or bitcoin\ncash to decline, or if bitcoin were to switch its proof of work algorithm from SHA-256 to another algorithm for which our miners are not specialized, or the\nvalue of bitcoin or bitcoin cash were to decline for other reasons, particularly if such decline were significant or over an extended period of time, our\noperating results would be adversely affected, and there could be a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our\nnew strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations, and harm investors.\nBitcoin and other bitcoin market prices, which have historically been volatile and are impacted by a variety of factors (including those discussed\nbelow), are determined primarily using data from various exchanges, over-the-counter markets and derivative platforms. Furthermore, such prices may be\nsubject to factors such as those that impact commodities, more so than business activities, which could be subjected to additional influence from fraudulent\nor illegitimate actors, real or perceived scarcity, and political, economic, regulatory or other conditions. Pricing may be the result of, and may continue to\nresult in, speculation regarding future appreciation in the value of cryptocurrencies, or our share price, inflating and making their market prices more\nvolatile or creating “bubble” type risks for both bitcoin and shares of our ordinary shares.\nWe may not be able to realize the benefits of forks.\nTo the extent that a significant majority of users and miners on a bitcoin network install software that changes the bitcoin network or properties of\na bitcoin, including the irreversibility of transactions and limitations on the mining of new bitcoin, the bitcoin network would be subject to new protocols\nand software. However, if less than a significant majority of users and miners on the bitcoin network consent to the proposed modification, and the\nmodification is not compatible with the software prior to its modification, the consequence would be what is known as a “fork” of the network, with one\nprong running the pre-modified software and the other running the modified software. The effect of such a fork would be the existence of two versions of\nthe bitcoin running in parallel, yet lacking interchangeability and necessitating exchange-type transaction to convert currencies between the two forks.\nAdditionally, it may be unclear following a fork which fork represents the original asset and which is the new asset. Different metrics adopted by industry\nparticipants to determine which is the original asset include: referring to the wishes of the core developers of a bitcoin, blockchains with the greatest\namount of hashing power contributed by miners or validators; or blockchains with the longest chain. A fork in the network of a particular bitcoin could\nadversely affect an investment in our Company or our ability to operate.\nWe may not be able to realize the economic benefit of a fork, either immediately or ever, which could adversely affect an investment in our\nsecurities. If we hold a bitcoin at the time of a hard fork into two cryptocurrencies, industry standards would dictate that we would be expected to hold an\nequivalent amount of the old and new assets following the fork. However, we may not be able, or it may not be practical, to secure or realize the economic\nbenefit of the new asset for various reasons. For instance, we may determine that there is no safe or practical way to custody the new asset, that trying to do\nso may pose an unacceptable risk to our holdings in the old asset, or that the costs of taking possession and/or maintaining ownership of the new bitcoin\nexceed the benefits of owning the new bitcoin. Additionally, laws, regulation or other factors may prevent us from benefitting from the new asset even if\nthere is a safe and practical way to custody and secure the new asset.\n17\nThere is a possibility of bitcoin mining algorithms transitioning to proof of stake validation and other mining related risks, which could make us less\ncompetitive and ultimately adversely affect our business and the value of our stock.\nProof of stake is an alternative method in validating bitcoin transactions. Should the algorithm shift from a proof of work validation method to a\nproof of stake method, mining would require less energy and may render any company that maintains advantages in the current climate (for example, from\nlower priced electricity, processing, real estate, or hosting) less competitive. We, as a result of our efforts to optimize and improve the efficiency of our\nbitcoin mining operations, may be exposed to the risk in the future of losing the benefit of our capital investments and the competitive advantage we hope\nto gain form this as a result, and may be negatively impacted if a switch to proof of stake validation were to occur. This may additionally have an impact on\nother various investments of ours. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our business\nstrategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other\ncryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account.\nTo the extent that the profit margins of bitcoin mining operations are not high, operators of bitcoin mining operations are more likely to immediately\nsell bitcoin rewards earned by mining in the market, thereby constraining growth of the price of bitcoin that could adversely impact us, and similar\nactions could affect other cryptocurrencies.\nOver the past two years, bitcoin mining operations have evolved from individual users mining with computer processors, graphics processing units\nand first-generation ASIC servers. Currently, new processing power is predominantly added by incorporated and unincorporated “professionalized” mining\noperations. Professionalized mining operations may use proprietary hardware or sophisticated ASIC machines acquired from ASIC manufacturers. They\nrequire the investment of significant capital for the acquisition of this hardware, the leasing of operating space (often in data centers or warehousing\nfacilities), incurring of electricity costs and the employment of technicians to operate the mining farms. As a result, professionalized mining operations are\nof a greater scale than prior miners and have more defined and regular expenses and liabilities. These regular expenses and liabilities require\nprofessionalized mining operations to maintain profit margins on the sale of bitcoin. To the extent the price of bitcoin declines and such profit margin is\nconstrained, professionalized miners are incentivized to more immediately sell bitcoin earned from mining operations, whereas it is believed that individual\nminers in past years were more likely to hold newly mined bitcoin for more extended periods. The immediate selling of newly mined bitcoin greatly\nincreases the trading volume of bitcoin, creating downward pressure on the market price of bitcoin rewards.\nThe extent to which the value of bitcoin mined by a professionalized mining operation exceeds the allocable capital and operating costs\ndetermines the profit margin of such operation. A professionalized mining operation may be more likely to sell a higher percentage of its newly mined\nbitcoin rapidly if it is operating at a low profit margin and it may partially or completely cease operations if its profit margin is negative. In a low profit\nmargin environment, a higher percentage could be sold more rapidly, thereby potentially depressing bitcoin prices. Lower bitcoin prices could result in\nfurther tightening of profit margins for professionalized mining operations creating a network effect that may further reduce the price of bitcoin until\nmining operations with higher operating costs become unprofitable forcing them to reduce mining power or cease mining operations temporarily.\n18\nIf a malicious actor or botnet obtains control of more than 50% of the processing power on a bitcoin network, such actor or botnet could manipulate\nblockchains to adversely affect us, which would adversely affect an investment in us or our ability to operate.\nIf a malicious actor or botnet (a volunteer or hacked collection of computers controlled by networked software coordinating the actions of the\ncomputers) obtains a majority of the processing power dedicated to mining a bitcoin, it may be able to alter blockchains on which transactions of bitcoin\nreside and rely by constructing fraudulent blocks or preventing certain transactions from completing in a timely manner, or at all. The malicious actor or\nbotnet could control, exclude or modify the ordering of transactions, though it could not generate new units or transactions using such control. The\nmalicious actor could “double-spend” its own bitcoin (i.e., spend the same bitcoin in more than one transaction) and prevent the confirmation of other\nusers’ transactions for as long as it maintained control. To the extent that such malicious actor or botnet does not yield its control of the processing power\non the network or the bitcoin community does not reject the fraudulent blocks as malicious, reversing any changes made to blockchains may not be\npossible. The foregoing description is not the only means by which the entirety of blockchains or cryptocurrencies may be compromised but is only an\nexample.\nAlthough there are no known reports of malicious activity or control of blockchains achieved through controlling over 50% of the processing\npower on the network, it is believed that certain mining pools may have exceeded the 50% threshold in bitcoin. The possible crossing of the 50% threshold\nindicates a greater risk that a single mining pool could exert authority over the validation of bitcoin transactions. To the extent that the bitcoin ecosystem,\nand the administrators of mining pools, do not act to ensure greater decentralization of bitcoin mining processing power, the feasibility of a malicious actor\nobtaining control of the processing power will increase because the botnet or malicious actor could compromise more than 50% mining pool and thereby\ngain control of blockchain, whereas if the blockchain remains decentralized it is inherently more difficult for the botnet of malicious actor to aggregate\nenough processing power to gain control of the blockchain, may adversely affect an investment in our common stock. Such lack of controls and responses\nto such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or\notherwise acquire or hold for our own account, and harm investors.\nCryptocurrencies, including those maintained by or for us, may be exposed to cybersecurity threats and hacks.\nAs with any computer code generally, flaws in bitcoin codes may be exposed by malicious actors. Several errors and defects have been found\npreviously, including those that disabled some functionality for users and exposed users’ information. Exploitations of flaws in the source code that allow\nmalicious actors to take or create money have previously occurred. Despite our efforts and processes to prevent breaches, our devices, as well as our\nminers, computer systems and those of third parties that we use in our operations, are vulnerable to cyber security risks, including cyber-attacks such as\nviruses and worms, phishing attacks, denial-of-service attacks, physical or electronic break-ins, employee theft or misuse, and similar disruptions from\nunauthorized tampering with our miners and computer systems or those of third parties that we use in our operations. Such events could have a material\nadverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our business strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own\naccount.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our need for significant electrical power. Government regulators may potentially restrict the ability of electricity\nsuppliers to provide electricity to mining operations, such as ours.\nThe operation of a bitcoin or other bitcoin mine can require massive amounts of electrical power. Further, our mining operations can only be\nsuccessful and ultimately profitable if the costs, including electrical power costs, associated with mining a bitcoin are lower than the price of a bitcoin. As a\nresult, any mine we establish can only be successful if we can obtain sufficient electrical power for that mine on a cost-effective basis, and our\nestablishment of new mines requires us to find locations where that is the case. There may be significant competition for suitable mine locations, and\ngovernment regulators may potentially restrict the ability of electricity suppliers to provide electricity to mining operations in times of electricity shortage,\nor may otherwise potentially restrict or prohibit the provision or electricity to mining operations. Additionally, our mines could be materially adversely\naffected by a power outage. Given the power requirement, it would not be feasible to run miners on back-up power generators in the event of a government\nrestriction on electricity or a power outage. If we are unable to receive adequate power supply and are forced to reduce our operations due to the\navailability or cost of electrical power, our business would experience materially negative impacts.\n19\nIf the award of bitcoin rewards, for us primarily bitcoin for solving blocks and transaction fees are not sufficiently high, we may not have an adequate\nincentive to continue mining and may cease mining operations, which will likely lead to our failure to achieve profitability.\nAs the number of bitcoin rewards awarded for solving a block in a blockchain decreases, our ability to achieve profitability worsens. Decreased\nuse and demand for bitcoin rewards may adversely affect our incentive to expend processing power to solve blocks. If the award of bitcoin rewards for\nsolving blocks and transaction fees are not sufficiently high, we may not have an adequate incentive to continue mining and may cease our mining\noperations. For instance, the current fixed reward for solving a new block on the bitcoin blockchain is twelve and a half bitcoin currency rewards per block,\nwhich decreased from 25 bitcoin in July 2016. It is estimated that it will halve again in about one year. This reduction may result in a reduction in the\naggregate hash rate of the bitcoin network as the incentive for miners decreases. Miners ceasing operations would reduce the collective processing power\non the network, which would adversely affect the confirmation process for transactions (i.e., temporarily decreasing the speed at which blocks are added to\na blockchain until the next scheduled adjustment in difficulty for block solutions) and make bitcoin networks more vulnerable to a malicious actor or botnet\nobtaining control in excess of 50 percent of the processing power active on a blockchain, potentially permitting such actor or botnet to manipulate a\nblockchain in a manner that adversely affects our activities. A reduction in confidence in the confirmation process or processing power of the network could\nresult and be irreversible. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise\nacquire or hold for our own account.\nWe may not adequately respond to price fluctuations and rapidly changing technology, which may negatively affect our business.\nCompetitive conditions within the bitcoin industry require that we use sophisticated technology in the operation of our business. The industry for\nblockchain technology is characterized by rapid technological changes, new product introductions, enhancements and evolving industry standards. New\ntechnologies, techniques or products could emerge that might offer better performance than the software and other technologies we currently utilize, and we\nmay have to manage transitions to these new technologies to remain competitive. We may not be successful, generally or relative to our competitors in the\nbitcoin industry, in timely implementing new technology into our systems, or doing so in a cost-effective manner. During the course of implementing any\nsuch new technology into our operations, we may experience system interruptions and failures during such implementation. Furthermore, there can be no\nassurances that we will recognize, in a timely manner or at all, the benefits that we may expect as a result of our implementing new technology into our\noperations. As a result, our business and operations may suffer, and there may be adverse effects on the price of our common stock.\nRisks Involving Intellectual Property\nBitcoin and bitcoin mining is software related\nWe actively use specific hardware and software for our bitcoin mining operation. In certain cases, source code and other software assets may be\nsubject to an open source license, as much technology development underway in this sector is open source. For these works, the company intends to adhere\nto the terms of any license agreements that may be in place.\nWe do not currently own, and do not have any current plans to seek, any patents in connection with our existing and planned blockchain and\ncryptocurrency related operations. We do expect to rely upon trade secrets, trademarks, service marks, trade names, copyrights and other intellectual\nproperty rights and expect to license the use of intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others. In addition, we have developed and may further\ndevelop certain proprietary software applications for purposes of our cryptocurrency mining operation.\nOur platform may be subject to damage, interruptions or delays that may adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nIn the event of a platform outage and physical data loss, our ability to perform our bitcoin mining operations would be materially and adversely\naffected. The satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our platform are critical to our operations. Our operations depend on our ability to\nprotect our systems against damage or interruption from natural disasters, power or telecommunications failures, air quality issues, environmental\nconditions, computer viruses or attempts to harm our systems, criminal acts and similar events.\n20\nAny interruptions or delays in our service, whether as a result of third-party errors, our errors, natural disasters or security breaches, whether\naccidental or willful, could harm our operations and/or reputation. Additionally, in the event of damage or interruption, our insurance policies may not\nadequately compensate us for any losses that we may incur. Our disaster recovery plan has not been tested under actual disaster conditions, and we may not\nhave sufficient capacity to recover all data and services in the event of an outage. These factors could prevent us from mining bitcoins, damage our brand\nand reputation, divert our employees’ attention, subject us to liability, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nOur platform and internal systems rely on software that is highly technical, and if it contains undetected errors, our business could be adversely\naffected.\nOur platform and internal systems rely on software that is highly technical and complex. In addition, our platform and internal systems depend on\nthe ability of such software to store, retrieve, process and manage immense amounts of data. The software on which we rely has contained, and may now or\nin the future contain, undetected errors or bugs. Some errors may only be discovered after the code has been released for external or internal use. Any\nerrors, bugs or defects discovered in the software on which we rely could result in harm to our reputation, or liability for damages, any of which could\nadversely affect our business, results of operations and financial conditions.\nWe may not be able to prevent others from unauthorized use of our intellectual property, which could harm our business and competitive position.\nWe regard our trademarks, domain names, know-how, proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we\nrely on a combination of intellectual property laws and contractual arrangements, including confidentiality and non-compete agreements with our\nemployees and others to protect our proprietary rights. See “Item 4. Information of the Company —Intellectual Property” and “Regulation—Regulation on\nIntellectual Property Rights.” Thus, we cannot assure you that any of our intellectual property rights would not be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or\nmisappropriated, or such intellectual property will be sufficient to provide us with competitive advantages. In addition, because of the rapid pace of\ntechnological change in our industry, parts of our business rely on technologies developed or licensed by third parties, and we may not be able to obtain or\ncontinue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties on reasonable terms, or at all.\nOur trade secrets may be leaked or otherwise become available to, or be independently discovered by, our competitors. To the extent that our\nemployees or consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related know-how and\ninventions. Any failure in protecting or enforcing our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition\nand results of operations.\nWe may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims, which may be expensive to defend and may disrupt our business and operations.\nWe cannot be certain that our operations or any aspects of our business do not or will not infringe upon or otherwise violate trademarks, patents,\ncopyrights, know-how or other intellectual property rights held by third parties. We may be from time to time in the future subject to legal proceedings and\nclaims relating to the intellectual property rights of others. In addition, there may be third-party trademarks, patents, copyrights, know-how or other\nintellectual property rights that are infringed by our products, services or other aspects of our business without our awareness. Holders of such intellectual\nproperty rights may seek to enforce such intellectual property rights against us in China, the United States or other jurisdictions. If any third-party\ninfringement claims are brought against us, we may be forced to divert management’s time and other resources from our business and operations to defend\nagainst these claims, regardless of their merits. As a result, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nFluctuations in exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the value of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Ordinary Shares\nThe trading price of our common stock is subject to arbitrary pricing factors that are not necessarily associated with traditional factors that\ninfluence stock prices or the value of non-bitcoin assets such as revenue, cash flows, profitability, growth prospects or business activity levels since the\nvalue and price, as determined by the investing public, may be influenced by future anticipated adoption or appreciation in value of cryptocurrencies or\nblockchains generally, factors over which we have little or no influence or control.\n21\nOther factors which could cause volatility in the market price of our common stock include, but are not limited to:\n● actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results or those of companies perceived to be similar to us;\n● actual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\n● commercial success and market acceptance of blockchain and bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies;\n● actions by our competitors, such as new business initiatives, acquisitions and divestitures;\n● strategic transactions undertaken by us;\n● additions or departures of key personnel;\n● prevailing economic conditions;\n● disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\n● sales of our common stock by our officers, directors or significant stockholders;\n● other actions taken by our stockholders;\n● future sales or issuances of equity or debt securities by us;\n● business disruptions caused by earthquakes, tornadoes or other natural disasters;\n● issuance of new or changed securities analysts’ reports or recommendations regarding us;\n● legal proceedings involving our company, our industry or both;\n● changes in market valuations of companies similar to ours;\n● the prospects of the industry in which we operate;\n● speculation or reports by the press or investment community with respect to us or our industry in general;\n● the level of short interest in our stock; and\n● other risks, uncertainties and factors described in this annual report.\n22\nIn addition, the stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of the\nissuer. These broad market fluctuations may negatively impact the price or liquidity of our common stock. When the price of a stock has been volatile,\nholders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the issuer.\nWe may be unable to comply with the applicable continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, which may adversely impact our access\nto capital markets and may cause us to default certain of our agreements.\nOur common stock is currently traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Nasdaq rules require us to maintain a minimum closing bid price of $1.00\nper share of our common stock. The closing bid price of our common stock fell below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive trading days, so we were not in\ncompliance with Nasdaq’s rules for listing standards. Although we regained compliance, there can be no assurance we will continue to meet the minimum\nbid price requirements or any other requirements in the future, in which case our common stock could be delisted.\nIn the event that our common stock is delisted from Nasdaq and is not eligible for quotation or listing on another market or exchange, trading of\nour common stock could be conducted only in the over-the-counter market or on an electronic bulletin board established for unlisted securities such as the\nOTC. In such event, it could become more difficult to dispose of, or obtain accurate price quotations for our common stock and there would likely also be a\nreduction in our coverage by securities analysts and the news media, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline further. In addition, our\nability to raise additional capital may be severely impacted, which may negatively affect our plans and the results of our operations.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could\ndecline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by whether industry or securities analysts publish research and reports about us, our\nbusiness, our market or our competitors and, if any analysts do publish such reports, what they publish in those reports. We may not obtain or maintain\nanalyst coverage in the future. Any analysts that do cover us may make adverse recommendations regarding our stock, adversely change their\nrecommendations from time to time and/or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors. If analysts who may cover us in the\nfuture were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, or if analysts fail to cover us or publish reports about us at all, we\ncould lose (or never gain) visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the stock price of our common stock or trading volume to decline.\nMoreover, if our operating results do not meet the expectations of the investor community, one or more of the analysts who cover our company may change\ntheir recommendations regarding our company and our stock price could decline.\nOur ordinary shares may be thinly traded and you may be unable to sell at or near ask prices or at all if you need to sell your shares to raise money or\notherwise desire to liquidate your shares.\nOur ordinary shares may be “thinly-traded”, meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our ordinary shares at or near bid prices\nat any given time may be relatively small or non-existent. This situation may be attributable to a number of factors, including the fact that we are relatively\nunknown to stock analysts, stock brokers, institutional investors and others in the investment community that generate or influence sales volume, and that\neven if we came to the attention of such persons, they tend to be risk-averse and might be reluctant to follow an unproven company such as ours or\npurchase or recommend the purchase of our shares until such time as we became more seasoned. As a consequence, there may be periods of several days or\nmore when trading activity in our shares is minimal or non-existent, as compared to a seasoned issuer which has a large and steady volume of trading\nactivity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price. Broad or active public trading market for our ordinary shares\nmay not develop or be sustained.\n23\nVolatility in our ordinary shares price may subject us to securities litigation.\nThe market for our ordinary shares may have, when compared to seasoned issuers, significant price volatility and we expect that our share price\nmay continue to be more volatile than that of a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future. In the past, plaintiffs have often initiated securities class action\nlitigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We may, in the future, be the target of similar litigation.\nSecurities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert management’s attention and resources.\nWe are not likely to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe currently intend to retain any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business. Accordingly, we do not expect to pay any\ncash dividends in the foreseeable future but will review this policy as circumstances dictate.\nYou may face difficulties in protecting your interests as a shareholder, as the laws of British Virgin Islands provides substantially less protection when\ncompared to the laws of the United States and it may be difficult for a shareholder of ours to effect service of process or to enforce judgements obtained\nin the United States courts.\nOur corporate affairs are governed by our memorandum and articles of association and by the Companies Law (2016 Revision) and common law\nof the British Virgin Islands. The rights of shareholders to take legal action against our directors and us, actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary\nresponsibilities of our directors to us under British Islands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the British Virgin Islands. The common\nlaw of the British Virgin Islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the British Virgin Islands as well as from English\ncommon law. Decisions of the Privy Council (which is the final court of appeal for British overseas territories such as the British Virgin Islands) are\nbinding on a court in the British Virgin Islands. Decisions of the English courts, and particularly the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom and the Court\nof Appeal are generally of persuasive authority but are not binding on the courts of the British Virgin Islands. The rights of our shareholders and the\nfiduciary responsibilities of our directors under British Virgin Islands law are not as clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial\nprecedents in the United States. In particular, the British Virgin Islands has a less developed body of securities laws as compared to the United States and\nprovide significantly less protection to investors. In addition, British Virgin Islands companies may not have standing to initiate a shareholder derivative\naction before the United States federal courts. The British Islands courts are also unlikely to impose liabilities against us in original actions brought in the\nBritish Virgin Islands, based on certain civil liability provisions of United States securities laws.\nAll of our directors and officers are nationals or residents of jurisdictions other than the United States and a substantial portion of their assets are\nlocated outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for a shareholder to effect service of process within the United States upon these persons,\nor to enforce against us or them judgments obtained in United States courts, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the\nsecurities laws of the United States or any state in the United States.\nAs a result of all of the above, our shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests through actions against us or our officers,\ndirectors or major shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction in the United States.\n24\nWe are a foreign private issuer within the meaning of the rules under the Exchange Act, and as such we are exempt from certain provisions applicable\nto United States domestic public companies.\nWe are a foreign private issuer within the meaning of the rules under the Exchange Act. As such, we are exempt from certain provisions applicable\nto United States domestic public companies. For example:\n● we are not required to provide as many Exchange Act reports, or as frequently, as a domestic public company;\n● for interim reporting, we are permitted to comply solely with our home country requirements, which are less rigorous than the rules that apply\nto domestic public companies;\n● we are not required to provide the same level of disclosure on certain issues, such as executive compensation;\n● we are exempt from provisions of Regulation FD aimed at preventing issuers from making selective disclosures of material information;\n● we are not required to comply with the sections of the Exchange Act regulating the solicitation of proxies, consents or authorizations in\nrespect of a security registered under the Exchange Act; and\n● we are not required to comply with Section 16 of the Exchange Act requiring insiders to file public reports of their share ownership and\ntrading activities and establishing insider liability for profits realized from any “short-swing” trading transaction.\n● We currently intend to file annual reports on Form 20-F and reports on Form 6-K as a foreign private issuer. Accordingly, our shareholders\nmay not have access to certain information they may deem important.\n25\nIf we are classified as a passive foreign investment company, United States taxpayers who own our ordinary shares may have adverse United States\nfederal income tax consequences.\nA non-U.S. corporation such as ourselves will be classified as a passive foreign investment company, which is known as a PFIC, for any taxable\nyear if, for such year, either\n● at least 75% of our gross income for the year is passive income; or\n● the average percentage of our assets (determined at the end of each quarter) during the taxable year which produce passive income or which\nare held for the production of passive income is at least 50%.\nPassive income generally includes dividends, interest, rents and royalties (other than rents or royalties derived from the active conduct of a trade or\nbusiness) and gains from the disposition of passive assets.\nIf we are determined to be a PFIC for any taxable year (or portion thereof) that is included in the holding period of a U.S. taxpayer who holds our\nordinary shares, the U.S. taxpayer may be subject to increased U.S. federal income tax liability and may be subject to additional reporting requirements.\nDepending on the amount of cash we raise in a public offering completed in March 2018, together with any other assets held for the production of\npassive income, it is possible that, for our 2018 taxable year or for any subsequent year, more than 50% of our assets may be assets which produce passive\nincome. We will make this determination following the end of any particular tax year. Although the law in this regard is unclear, we treat our consolidated\naffiliated entities as being owned by us for United States federal income tax purposes, not only because we exercise effective control over the operation of\nsuch entities but also because we are entitled to substantially all of their economic benefits, and, as a result, we consolidate their operating results in our\nconsolidated financial statements. For purposes of the PFIC analysis, in general, a non-U.S. corporation is deemed to own its pro rata share of the gross\nincome and assets of any entity in which it is considered to own at least 25% of the equity by value.\nFor a more detailed discussion of the application of the PFIC rules to us and the consequences to U.S. taxpayers if we were determined to be a\nPFIC, see “Item 10.E. Taxation — United States Federal Income Taxation — Passive Foreign Investment Company.”\nWe expect that our capital expenditures in fiscal year 2022 will be incurred primarily in connection with the purchase of bitcoin mining machines,\nadditional computer equipment and IT server to support our services.\n26\nITEM 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY\nHistory and Development of the Company\nOur Company was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands on May 18, 2021. On August 16, 2021, the Company completed a redomicile merger with its\npredecessor company, Moxian, Inc., a Nevada corporation pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger entered into on May 28, 2021, wherein it acquired\nall the assets, liabilities, rights, obligations and operations of the latter and its subsidiaries, through an exchange of an identical number of its ordinary\nshares.\nOn October 25, 2021, the Board approved to re-designate 50,000,000 of its authorized but unissued ordinary shares of par value of $0.001 each (the\n“Ordinary Shares”) as 50,000,000 preferred shares of par value of $0.00101 each (the “Preferred Shares”) and amend its Memorandum and Articles of\nAssociation, among other things, to specify the rights attaching to the preferred shares. On October 28, 2021, the Company filed its Amended and Restated\nMemorandum and Articles of Association (the “Amended and Restated M&A”) with the British Virgin Islands Registrar of Corporate Affairs. The\nCompany is authorized to issue 150,000,000 Ordinary Shares and 50,000,000 Preferred Shares pursuant to the Amended and Restated M&A.\nOn November 11, 2021, the Board approved to issue 5,000,000 Preferred Shares to Bridgeforrest (BVI) Inc., a holding company owned by Conglin\n(Forrest) Deng , the Chief Executive Officer and an Executive Director of the Company, for gross proceeds of $5,000,000. The shares were issued on\nDecember 1, 2021.\nOn December 28, 2021, in a Special Meeting, the shareholders approved the issue of up to 20 million new ordinary shares of the Company, at a price of\n$2.50 per share to certain non-US based accredited investors. On February 11, 2022, the Company completed this private placement and issued 16,000,000\nnew shares, raising $40 million, which it will use in bitcoin mining in order to diversify its business operations. Of the proceeds raised, $29.8 million was\nused to purchase relevant equipment and the balance will be used as working capital.\nOur predecessor company, Moxian, Inc (“Moxian”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada, United States of America, on October 12, 2010. It was\nuplisted to the Nasdaq Capital Market on November 14, 2016, operating as an O2O enterprise, with two major lines of business mobile applications linking\nsmall and medium enterprises to its network platform and digital advertising through a partnership with Xinhua New Media, which operates the official app\nof the New China News Agency, a state-backed media firm. The mobile app business failed to achieve a meaningful share of the market and incurred huge\nlosses, primarily because users found the Moxian app unwieldy and not user-friendly. By September 30, 2018, the Company had to halt this business as it\nran out of working capital whilst the digital advertising continued.\nThere were discussions with various parties for strategic partnerships between June 2018 to the end of 2020 but none of these business opportunities\nmaterialized.\nIn August, 2021, Moxian, Inc decided to redomicile to the British Virgin Islands through a merger with its wholly-owned subsidiary, Moxian BVI. Moxian\nBVI became the surviving company when the merger was completed in August 2021. In September 2021, the Company appointed a new CEO who was\ntasked to identify new business for the Company in order to broaden its earnings base. Following non-binding expressions of support from some\nshareholders, the Company decided to venture into bitcoin mining and called for a Special Meeting of shareholders in December 2021 to approve related\nproposals as noted above. All these proposals were approved at the Special Meeting and in February 2022, the Company completed its capital raising\nexercise, with a total subscription of 16 million new ordinary shares for $40 million.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the subsidiaries of the Company are as follows:\nDate of\nName of Company Country of Incorporation Incorporation Principal Activity\nABit Hong Kong Limited Hong Kong SAR May 8, 2019 Investment Holding\nBeijing Bitmatrix Technology Co. Ltd. Peoples’ Republic of China December 20, 2019 In-house Support Services\nABit USA, Inc Delaware, United States of America April 26, 2022 Bitcoin Mining\n27\nOrganization Chart\nThe following diagram illustrates our corporate structure, as of the date of this Report:\nMoxian (BVI) Inc\n28\nBusiness Overview\nBitcoin Mining\nOperations of bitcoin mining\nIn view of the widespread adoption of blockchain technology and bitcoin worldwide, the Company determined to enter the bitcoin mining\nindustry, which is the production of bitcoin. Management believes that bitcoin mining is profitable and its business plan is viable.\nAs of the date of this Report, the Company has identified a suitable site in Eastern Tennessee and will continue to identify other suitable sites for\nthe sole purpose of mining bitcoin. Our facility and mining platform will operate with the primary intent of accumulating bitcoin which we may sell for fiat\ncurrency from time to time depending on market conditions and management’s determination of our cash flow needs.\nPerformance Metrics of bitcoin mining\nThe Company operates mining hardware which performs computational operations in support of the blockchain measured in “hash rate” or\n“hashes per second.” A “hash” is the computation run by mining hardware in support of the blockchain; therefore, a miner’s “hash rate” refers to the rate at\nwhich it is capable of solving such computations. The original equipment used for mining bitcoin utilized the Central Processing Unit (CPU) of a computer\nto mine various forms of bitcoin. Due to performance limitations, CPU mining was rapidly replaced by the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), which offers\nsignificant performance advantages over CPUs. General purpose chipsets like CPUs and GPUs have since been replaced in the mining industry by\nApplication Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC) chips like those found in the MicroBT M21S miner currently utilized by the Company at its mining\nfacility. These ASIC chips are designed specifically to maximize the rate of hashing operations.\nThe Company measures our mining performance and competitive position based on overall hash rate being produced in our mining sites. The\nlatest equipment the MicroBT M21S miner, performs in the range of approximately 50 – 58 terahash per second (TH/s) per unit, M20S performs in the\nrange of 64 – 68 TH/s per unit, M10 performs in the range of 31 – 35 TH/s per unit; Bitmain T17+ performs with a maximum hashrate of 64 TH/s per unit;\nInnosilicon T3 performs in the range of 41 – 45 TH/s per unit. This group of mining hardware is on the cutting edge of available mining equipment,\nhowever, advances and improvements to the technology are ongoing and may be available in quantities to the market in the near future which may affect\nour perceived position.\n29\nHalving\nFurther affecting the industry, and particularly for the bitcoin blockchain, the cryptocurrency reward for solving a block is subject to periodic\nincremental halving. Halving is a process designed to control the overall supply and reduce the risk of inflation in cryptocurrencies using a Proof-of-Work\nconsensus algorithm. At a predetermined block, the mining reward is cut in half, hence the term “halving”. For bitcoin, the reward was initially set at 50\nbitcoin currency rewards per block and this was cut in half to 25 in November 28, 2012 at block 210,000 and again to 12.5 on July 9, 2016 at block 420,000\nand on May 11, 2020 at block 630,000 when the reward was halved to 6.25. This process will reoccur until the total amount of bitcoin currency rewards\nissued reaches 21 million, which is expected to occur around 2140.\nNetwork Hash Rate and Difficulty\nIn cryptocurrency mining, “hash rate” is a measure of the processing speed by a mining computer for a specific coin. An individual miner, such as\nRiot has a hash rate total of its miners seeking to mine a specific coin, and system wide there is a total has rate of all miners seeking to mine each specific\ntype of coin. The higher total hash rate of a specific miner, as a percentage of the system wide total hash rate, generally results over time in a corresponding\nhigher success rate in coin rewards as compared to miners with lower hash rates.\nMining Pools\nA “mining pool” is the pooling of resources by miners, who share their processing power over a network and split rewards according to the\namount of work they contributed to the probability of placing a block on the blockchain. Mining pools emerged in response to the growing difficulty and\navailable hashing power that competes to place a block on the bitcoin blockchain.\nThe Company participates in mining pools wherein groups of miners associate to pool resources and earn cryptocurrency together allocated to\neach miner according to the “hashing” capacity they contribute to the pool. As additional miners competed for the limited supply of blocks, individuals\nfound that they were working for months without finding a block and receiving any reward for their mining efforts. To address this variance, miners started\norganizing into pools to share mining rewards more evenly on a pro rata basis based on total hashing capacity contributed to the mining pool.\nThe mining pool operator provides a service that coordinates the computing power of the independent mining enterprise. Fees are paid to the\nmining pool operator to cover the costs of maintaining the pool. The pool uses software that coordinates the pool members’ hashing power, identifies new\nblock rewards, records how much work all the participants are doing, and assigns block rewards for successful algorithm solutions in-proportion to the\nindividual hash rate that each participant contributed to a given successful mining transaction. While we do not pay pool fees directly, pool fees are\ndeducted from amounts we may otherwise earn. Fees (and payouts) fluctuate and historically have been approximately 2% on average.\nMining pools are subject to various risks such as disruption and down time. Riot has internally created software that monitors its hashing\nperformance and reward rates to monitor credits for our contributed hashing power. In the event that a pool experiences down time or not yielding returns,\nour results may be impacted.\nCompetition\nIn bitcoin mining, companies, individuals and groups generate units of bitcoin through mining. Miners can range from individual enthusiasts to\nprofessional mining operations with dedicated data centers. Miners may organize themselves in mining pools. The Company competes or may in the future\ncompete with other companies that focus all or a portion of their activities on owning or operating bitcoin exchanges, developing programming for the\nblockchain, and mining activities. At present, the information concerning the activities of these enterprises is not readily available as the vast majority of\nthe participants in this sector do not publish information publicly or the information may be unreliable. Published sources of information include\n“bitcoin.org” and “blockchain.info”; however, the reliability of that information and its continued availability cannot be assured.\n30\nThe bitcoin industry is a highly competitive and evolving industry and new competitors and/or emerging technologies could enter the market and\naffect our competitiveness in the future. For more information regarding those risk factors known to us, see the section entitled “Risk Factors” herein.\nEmployees\nAs required by PRC regulations, we participate in various government statutory employee benefit plans, including social insurance funds, namely\na pension contribution plan, a medical insurance plan, an unemployment insurance plan, a work-related injury insurance plan and a maternity insurance\nplan, and a housing provident fund. We are required under PRC law to make contributions to employee benefit plans at specified percentages of the\nsalaries, bonuses and certain allowances of our employees, up to a maximum amount specified by the local government from time to time. As of the date of\nthis report, we have made adequate employee benefit payments. However, if we were found by the relevant authorities that we failed to make adequate\npayment, we may be required to make up the contributions for these plans as well as to pay late fees and fines. See “Item 3.D. Risk Factors — Risks\nRelated to Doing Business in China — Failure to make adequate contributions to various employee benefit plans as required by PRC regulations may\nsubject us to penalties.”\nWe enter into standard labor and confidentiality agreements with our employees. We believe that we maintain a good working relationship with\nour employees, and we have not experienced any major labor disputes.\nInsurance\nWe provide social security insurance including pension insurance, unemployment insurance, work-related injury insurance and medical insurance\nfor our employees. We do not maintain business interruption insurance or general third-party liability insurance, nor do we maintain product liability\ninsurance or key-man insurance. We consider our insurance coverage to be sufficient for our business operations in China.\nLegal Proceedings\nWe are currently not a party to any material legal or administrative proceedings. We may from time to time be subject to various legal or\nadministrative claims and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Litigation or any other legal or administrative proceeding, regardless of\nthe outcome, is likely to result in substantial cost and diversion of our resources, including our management’s time and attention.\n31\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nEffective July 2022, the Company no longer has any business operations in China. It maintains a small office of about 200 square meters for the\nadministrative and accounting staff, which is part of a larger office for a third party which bears the rental. The Company does not bear its share of the\nrental for the space it occupies. The third party pays a rental of about $9,200 on a two-year lease, expiring in February 2024. The office address is Room\n1202, Block B, Jiahui Center, 6 Jiqing Li, Chaoyangmenwai Street, Chaoyang District, Beijing.\nThe main subsidiary of the Company, ABit USA, Inc is constructing a mining center in its acquired land in Duff, near the city of LaFollette in the State of\nTennessee in the United States which was purchased in April 2023 for $1.2 million. Construction is expected to be completed in August 2023 and will\ninclude the office of its USA subsidiary.\nITEM 4A. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone\nITEM 5. OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS\nThe Company is now on a much stronger footing than any time in the past. Stockholders’ equity as of December 31, 2022 is now in excess of $23 million,\nnearly a 4-fold increase from the previous year. The year began with a strong promise as new stockholders pumped $40 million as new working capital as\nthe Company sought to ship mining equipment from China. Unfortunately, as the year unfolded, bitcoin prices fell from the $40,000 level at the beginning\nof the year to a low of about $15,000 towards the end of the year. Interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve and geo-political tensions, not excluding the\nUkraine war, hastened the collapse of bitcoin prices as the outlook remained grim throughout the year.\nOur mining operation which began in earnest in Buffalo in late February, followed by another operation in Columbus, Georgia became increasing\nunprofitable with sharp fluctuations in electricity prices. Mining operations discontinued in both locations by the end of May. The Company felt it\nnecessary to cease operations and reviewed its mining equipment, resulting in an impairment adjustment to the tune of $11.9 million as a one-time charge.\nEfforts began to intensify for a more favorable site and eventually, we acquired a piece of property in Eastern Tennessee. The directors of the Company\nremained optimistic about the longer-term future of the bitcoin business and sought to capitalize on the dim outlook of the industry towards December to\nacquire 1,140 units of the latest supercomputing servers at most competitive prices. With these additions and other equipment, including switchgear and\ntransformers, the Company began construction of a new mining center in April of 2023 with a completion by August by which time, the first new units of\nequipment will have arrived and the Company can look forward to a renewed start.\nThe optimism seemed to be well=founded as bitcoin prices have somewhat recovered from the lows of 2022.\nIn July 2022, the Company divested its entire interest in Moxian (Hong Kong) Limited, the holding company of a group of companies in the People’s\nRepublic of China and Malaysia. which have ceased active operations since June 2018. It meant that the Company no longer has a business footprint in\nChina and is now in a position to consider other commercial opportunities in the United States and the rest of the world. With the continued support of a\nnew group of investors, there is every hope that 2023 fiscal year will mark a significant milestone for the Company.\nBecause of the relative inactivity, there is little meaning in comparing with the financials of the previous year. The Company operated on sundry jobs in its\nBeijing subsidiary, maintained a central pool of staff and did not segregate costs between that of direct jobs or back-office supporting staff.\nITEM 6.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nA. Share Capital\nNot applicable.\nB. Memorandum and Articles of Association\nThe following represents a summary of certain key provisions of our memorandum and articles of association and the BVI Business Companies Act 2004 of\nthe British Virgin Islands, which we refer to as the Act below.\nSummary\nRegistered Office. Under our Amended and Restated Memorandum of Association, the address of our registered office is Floor 4, Banco Popular Building,\nRoad Town, Tortola, VG 1110, British Virgin Islands.\nCapacity and Powers. Under Clause 4(1) of our Amended and Restated Memorandum of Association, we have the capacity to carry on or undertake any\nbusiness or activity, do any act or enter into any transaction.\nDirectors. Under Article 23 of our Articles of Association, no contract or transaction between us and one or more of our Directors (an “Interested Director”)\nor officers, or between us and any of their affiliates (an “Interested Transaction”), will be void or voidable solely for this reason, or solely because the\ndirector or officer is present at or participates in the meeting of our board or committee which authorizes the contract or transaction, or solely because any\nsuch director’s or officer’s votes are counted for such purpose, if:\n(a) The material facts as to the director’s or officer’s relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the our\nBoard of Directors or the committee, and the board or committee in good faith authorizes the contract or transaction by the affirmative votes of a\nmajority of the disinterested directors, even though the disinterested directors be less than a quorum; or\n(b) The material facts as to the director’s or officer’s relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to our\nshareholders entitled to vote thereon, and the contract or transaction is specifically approved in good faith by vote of our shareholders; or\n(c) The contract or transaction is fair as to us as of the time it is authorized, approved or ratified, by the board, a committee or the Shareholders.\nA majority of independent directors must vote in favor of any Interested Transaction and determine that the terms of the Interested Transaction are no less\nfavorable to us than those that would be available to us with respect to such a transaction from unaffiliated third parties.\nOur board shall review and approve all payments made to the founders, officers, directors, special advisors, consultants and their respective affiliates and\nany Interested Director shall abstain from such review and approval.\nRights, Preferences and Restrictions Attaching to Our Ordinary Shares. We are authorized to issue an unlimited number of shares divided into the\nfollowing classes of shares: (i) 150,000,000 ordinary shares, par value $0.001 per share; and (ii) 50,000,000 preferred shares, par value $0.00101 per share.\nAs of March 31, 2023, 35,554,677 ordinary shares and 5,000,000 preferred shares were outstanding. Each share, regardless if it is part of a class of ordinary\nshares, has the right to one vote at a meeting of shareholders or on any resolution of shareholders, the right to an equal share in any dividend paid by us,\nand the right to an equal share in the distribution of surplus assets. Each preferred share has the right to three votes at a meeting of shareholders or on any\nresolution of shareholders but does not participate in any distribution of the company. We may by a resolution of the Board of Directors redeem our shares\nfor such consideration as the Board of Directors determines.\nAlteration of Rights. The rights attached to any class or series of shares (unless otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the shares of that class or\nseries), whether or not the Company is being wound-up, may be varied with the consent in writing of all the holders of the issued shares of that class or\nseries or with the sanction of a resolution passed by a majority of the votes cast at a separate meeting of the holders of the shares of the class or series.\n40\nMeetings. A meeting of Members may be called by not less than ten (10) clear days’ Notice, but a meeting of Members may be called by shorter notice if\nMembers holding a 50 per cent majority of the total voting rights on all the matters to be considered at the meeting have waived notice of the meeting and,\nfor this purpose, the presence of a Member shall be deemed to constitute a waiver on his part. The notice shall specify the time and place of the meeting\nand the general nature of the business. The accidental omission to give Notice of a meeting or (in cases where instruments of proxy are sent out with the\nNotice) to send such instrument of proxy to, or the non-receipt of such Notice or such instrument of proxy by, any person entitled to receive such Notice\nshall not invalidate any resolution passed or the proceedings at that meeting.\nLimitations on the Right to Own Securities. There are no limitations on the rights to own our securities, or limitations on the rights of non-resident or\nforeign shareholders to hold or exercise voting rights on our securities, contained in our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association\n(or under British Virgin Islands law).\nC. Material Contracts\nWe have not entered into any material contracts other than in the ordinary course of business and otherwise described elsewhere in this annual report.\nD. Exchange Controls\nBVI Exchange Controls\nThere are no material exchange controls restrictions on payment of dividends, interest or other payments to the holders of our ordinary shares or on the\nconduct of our operations in the BVI. There are no material BVI laws that impose any material exchange controls on us or that affect the payment of\ndividends, interest or other payments to nonresident holders of our ordinary shares. BVI law and our memorandum and articles of association do not\nimpose any material limitations on the right of non-residents or foreign owners to hold or vote our ordinary shares.\nE. Taxation\nBritish Virgin Islands Taxation\nUnder the law of the British Virgin Islands as currently in effect, a holder of our shares who is not a resident of the British Virgin Islands is not liable for\nBritish Virgin Islands income tax on dividends paid with respect to our shares, and all holders of our securities are not liable to the British Virgin Islands for\nincome tax on gains realized on the sale or disposal of such securities. The British Virgin Islands does not impose a withholding tax on dividends paid by a\ncompany incorporated or re-registered under the BVI Act.\nThere are no capital gains, gift or inheritance taxes levied by the British Virgin Islands on companies incorporated or re-registered under the BVI Act. In\naddition, securities of companies incorporated or re-registered under the BVI Act are not subject to transfer taxes, stamp duties or similar charges.\nThere is no income tax treaty or convention currently in effect between the United States and the British Virgin Islands, although a Tax Information\nExchange Agreement is in force.\n41\nU.S. Federal Income Taxation\nGeneral\nThe following are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences to an investor of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of our securities.\nThe discussion below of the U.S. federal income tax consequences to “U.S. Holders” will apply to a beneficial owner of our securities that is treated for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes as:\n● an individual citizen or resident of the United States;\n● a corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation) that is created or organized (or treated as created or organized) in or under the laws of the\nUnited States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;\n● an estate whose income is includible in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless of its source; or\n● a trust if (i) a U.S. court can exercise primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one or more U.S. persons are authorized to control all\nsubstantial decisions of the trust, or (ii) it has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person.\nIf a beneficial owner of our securities is not described as a U.S. Holder and is not an entity treated as a partnership or other pass-through entity for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes, such an owner will be considered a “Non-U.S. Holder.” The material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the acquisition,\nownership and disposition of our securities applicable specifically to Non-U.S. Holders are described below under the heading “Non-U.S. Holders.”\nThis discussion is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), its legislative history, Treasury regulations promulgated\nthereunder, published rulings and court decisions, all as currently in effect. These authorities are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly on a\nretroactive basis.\nThis discussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to any particular holder of our securities based on such\nholder’s individual circumstances. In particular, this discussion considers only holders that own and hold our securities as capital assets within the meaning\nof Section 1221 of the Code, and does not address the alternative minimum tax. In addition, this discussion does not address the U.S. federal income tax\nconsequences to holders that are subject to special rules, including:\n● financial institutions or financial services entities;\n● broker-dealers;\n● persons that are subject to the mark-to-market accounting rules under Section 475 of the Code;\n● tax-exempt entities;\n● governments or agencies or instrumentalities thereof;\n● insurance companies;\n● regulated investment companies;\n● real estate investment trusts;\n● certain expatriates or former long-term residents of the United States;\n42\n● persons that actually or constructively own 5% or more of our public shares;\n● persons that acquired our securities pursuant to the exercise of employee options, in connection with employee incentive plans or otherwise as\ncompensation;\n● persons that hold our securities as part of a straddle, constructive sale, hedging, conversion or other integrated transaction;\n● persons whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;\n● controlled foreign corporations; or passive foreign investment companies.\nThis discussion does not address any aspect of U.S. federal non-income tax laws, such as gift or estate tax laws, state, local or non-U.S. tax laws or, except\nas discussed herein, any tax reporting obligations applicable to a holder of our securities. Additionally, this discussion does not consider the tax treatment of\npartnerships or other pass-through entities or persons who hold our securities through such entities. If a partnership (or other entity classified as a\npartnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is the beneficial owner of our securities, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in the\npartnership will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. This discussion also assumes that any distributions made\n(or deemed made) by us on our securities and any consideration received (or deemed received) by a holder in consideration for the sale or other disposition\nof our securities will be in U.S. dollars.\nWe have not sought, and will not seek a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) or an opinion of counsel as to any U.S. federal income tax\nconsequence described herein. The IRS may disagree with the description herein, and its determination may be upheld by a court. Moreover, there can be\nno assurance that future legislation, regulations, administrative rulings or court decisions will not adversely affect the accuracy of the statements in this\ndiscussion.\nTHIS DISCUSSION OF THE MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE ACQUISITION, OWNERSHIP AND\nDISPOSITION OF OUR SECURITIES IS NOT TAX ADVICE. EACH HOLDER OF OUR SECURITIES IS URGED TO CONSULT ITS OWN TAX\nADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO THE PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES TO SUCH HOLDER OF THE ACQUISITION, OWNERSHIP AND\nDISPOSITION OF OUR SECURITIES, INCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF ANY STATE, LOCAL, AND NON-U.S. TAX LAWS,\nAS WELL AS U.S. FEDERAL TAX LAWS AND ANY APPLICABLE TAX TREATIES.\nU.S. Holders\nTaxation of Cash Distributions\nSubject to the passive foreign investment company (“PFIC”) rules discussed below, a U.S. Holder generally will be required to include in gross income as\nordinary income the amount of any cash dividend paid on our shares. A cash distribution on such shares generally will be treated as a dividend for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes to the extent paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined under U.S. federal income tax\nprinciples). Such dividend generally will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction generally allowed to domestic corporations in respect of\ndividends received from other domestic corporations. The portion of such distribution, if any, in excess of such earnings and profits generally will\nconstitute a return of capital that will be applied against and reduce (but not below zero) the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in such shares. Any remaining\nexcess will be treated as gain from the sale or other taxable disposition of such shares and will be treated as described under “— Taxation on the\nDisposition of Securities” below.\nWith respect to non-corporate U.S. Holders, dividends on our shares may be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the lower applicable long-term capital\ngains tax rate (see “— Taxation on the Disposition of Securities” below) provided that (1) such shares are readily tradable on an established securities\nmarket in the United States, (2) we are not a PFIC, as discussed below, for either the taxable year in which the dividend was paid or the preceding taxable\nyear, and (3) certain holding period requirements are met. Under published IRS authority, our shares are considered for purposes of clause (1) above to be\nreadily tradable on an established securities market in the United States only if they are listed on certain exchanges, which presently include the NASDAQ\nCapital Market. Although our ordinary shares and warrants are currently listed and traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market, we cannot guarantee that our\nsecurities will continue to be listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the availability of the\nlower rate for any cash dividends paid with respect to our securities.\n43\nPossible Constructive Distributions with Respect to Redeemable Warrants\nThe terms of each redeemable warrant provide for an adjustment to the number of ordinary shares for which the redeemable warrant may be exercised in\ncertain events. An adjustment that has the effect of preventing dilution generally is not taxable. However, the U.S. Holders of the redeemable warrants\nwould be treated as receiving a constructive distribution from us if, for example, the adjustment increases the redeemable warrant holders’ proportionate\ninterest in our assets or earnings and profits (e.g., through an increase in the number of ordinary shares that would be obtained upon exercise) as a result of\na distribution of cash to the holders of our shares, which is taxable to the U.S. Holders of such shares as described under “Taxation of Cash Distributions”\nabove. Such constructive distribution would be subject to tax as described under that section in the same manner as if the U.S. Holders of the redeemable\nwarrants received a cash distribution from us equal to the fair market value of such increased interest.\nTaxation on the Disposition of Securities\nUpon a sale or other taxable disposition of our securities (which, in general, would include a distribution in connection with our liquidation or a redemption\nof redeemable warrants), and subject to the PFIC rules discussed below, a U.S. Holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to\nthe difference between the amount realized and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the securities. See “— Exercise or Lapse of Redeemable Warrants”\nbelow for a discussion regarding a U.S. Holder’s basis in the ordinary share acquired pursuant to the exercise of a warrant.\nThe regular U.S. federal income tax rate on capital gains recognized by U.S. Holders generally is the same as the regular U.S. federal income tax rate on\nordinary income, except that long-term capital gains recognized by non-corporate U.S. Holders generally are subject to U.S. federal income tax at reduced\nrates of tax. Capital gain or loss will constitute long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the securities exceeds one year. The\ndeductibility of capital losses is subject to various limitations.\nAdditional Taxes\nU.S. Holders that are individuals, estates or trusts and whose income exceeds certain thresholds generally will be subject to a 3.8% Medicare contribution\ntax on unearned income, including, without limitation, dividends on, and gains from the sale or other taxable disposition of, our securities, subject to certain\nlimitations and exceptions. Under recently issued regulations, in the absence of a special election, such unearned income generally would not include\nincome inclusions under the qualified electing fund, or QEF rules discussed below under “— Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules,” but would\ninclude distributions of earnings and profits from a QEF. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect, if any, of such tax on their\nownership and disposition of our securities.\nExercise or Lapse of Redeemable Warrants\nSubject to the PFIC rules discussed below, a U.S. Holder generally will not recognize gain or loss upon the acquisition of ordinary shares on the exercise of\nredeemable warrants for cash. Ordinary shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of redeemable warrants for cash will have a tax basis equal to the U.S.\nHolder’s tax basis in the redeemable warrants, increased by the amount paid to exercise the redeemable warrants. The holding period of such ordinary\nshares should begin on the day after the date of exercise of the redeemable warrants. If redeemable warrants are allowed to lapse unexercised, a U.S.\nHolder generally will recognize a capital loss equal to such holder’s adjusted tax basis in the redeemable warrants.\nThe tax consequences of a cashless exercise of redeemable warrants are not clear under current tax law. A cashless exercise may be tax-free, either because\nit is not a realization event (i.e., not a transaction in which gain or loss is realized) or because the transaction is treated as a recapitalization for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes. In either tax-free situation, a U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the ordinary shares received would equal the U.S. Holder’s basis in the\nredeemable warrants. If the cashless exercise were treated as not being a realization event, the U.S. Holder’s holding period in the ordinary shares could be\ntreated as commencing on the date following the date of exercise of the redeemable warrants. If the cashless exercise were treated as a recapitalization, the\nholding period of the ordinary shares received would include the holding period of the redeemable warrants.\n44\nIt is also possible that a cashless exercise could be treated as a taxable exchange in which gain or loss is recognized. In such event, a U.S. Holder could be\ndeemed to have surrendered a number of redeemable warrants with a fair market value equal to the exercise price for the number of redeemable warrants\ndeemed exercised. For this purpose, the number of redeemable warrants deemed exercised would be equal to the number of ordinary shares issued pursuant\nto the cashless exercise of the redeemable warrants. In this situation, the U.S. Holder would recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the\ndifference between the fair market value of the redeemable warrants deemed surrendered to pay the exercise price and the U.S. Holder’s tax basis in such\nredeemable warrants deemed surrendered. Such gain or loss would be long-term or short-term depending on the U.S. Holder’s holding period in the\nredeemable warrants. In this case, a U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the ordinary shares received would equal the sum of the fair market value of the redeemable\nwarrants deemed surrendered to pay the exercise price and the U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the redeemable warrants deemed exercised, and a U.S. Holder’s\nholding period for the ordinary shares should commence on the date following the date of exercise of the redeemable warrants. There also may be\nalternative characterizations of any such taxable exchange that would result in similar tax consequences, except that a U.S. Holder’s gain or loss would be\nshort-term.\nDue to the absence of authority on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a cashless exercise of redeemable warrants it is unclear which, if any, of the\nalternative tax consequences and holding periods described above would be adopted by the IRS or a court of law. Accordingly, U.S. Holders should consult\ntheir tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of a cashless exercise of redeemable warrants.\nPassive Foreign Investment Company Rules\nA foreign (i.e., non-U.S.) corporation will be a PFIC if at least 75% of its gross income in a taxable year of the foreign corporation, including its pro rata\nshare of the gross income of any corporation in which it is considered to own at least 25% of the shares by value, is passive income. Alternatively, a foreign\ncorporation will be a PFIC if at least 50% of its assets in a taxable year of the foreign corporation, ordinarily determined based on fair market value and\naveraged quarterly over the year, including its pro rata share of the assets of any corporation in which it is considered to own at least 25% of the shares by\nvalue, are held for the production of, or produce, passive income. Passive income generally includes dividends, interest, rents and royalties (other than\ncertain rents or royalties derived from the active conduct of a trade or business) and gains from the disposition of passive assets.\nBased on the composition of our assets and the nature of the Company’s income and subsidiaries’ income for our taxable year ended December 31, 2021,\nwe do not expect to be treated as a PFIC for such year and we do not expect to be one for our taxable year ending December 31, 2022 or become one in the\nforeseeable future. Nevertheless, the application of the PFIC rules is subject to ambiguity in several respects and, in addition, we must make a separate\ndetermination each year as to whether we are a PFIC (after the close of each taxable year). Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will not be a PFIC\nfor the current or any other taxable year. Moreover, although we do not believe we would be treated as a PFIC, we have not engaged any U.S. tax advisers\nto determine our PFIC status. In addition, if a U.S. Holder owned our ordinary shares at any time prior to our acquisition of Elite, such U.S. Holder may be\nconsidered to own stock of a PFIC by virtue of the fact that we may have been a PFIC during the period prior to our acquisition of Elite, unless such U.S.\nHolder made either a valid and timely QEF election or a valid and timely mark-to-market election, in each case as described below.\nIf we are determined to be a PFIC for any taxable year (or portion thereof) that is included in the holding period of a U.S. Holder of our shares or\nredeemable warrants and, in the case of our shares, the U.S. Holder did not make either a timely qualified electing fund (“QEF”) election for our first\ntaxable year as a PFIC in which the U.S. Holder held (or was deemed to hold) such shares, a QEF election along with a purging election, or a mark-to-\nmarket election, each as described below, such holder generally will be subject to special rules for regular U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to:\n● any gain recognized by the U.S. Holder on the sale or other disposition of its shares or redeemable warrants; and\n● any “excess distribution” made to the U.S. Holder (generally, any distributions to such U.S. Holder during a taxable year of the U.S. Holder that\nare greater than 125% of the average annual distributions received by such U.S. Holder in respect of the shares or warrants during the three\npreceding taxable years of such U.S. Holder or, if shorter, such U.S. Holder’s holding period for the shares or warrants).\n45\nUnder these rules,\n● the U.S. Holder’s gain or excess distribution will be allocated ratably over the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the shares or redeemable warrants;\n● the amount allocated to the U.S. Holder’s taxable year in which the U.S. Holder recognized the gain or received the excess distribution, or to the\nperiod in the U.S. Holder’s holding period before the first day of our first taxable year in which we are a PFIC, will be taxed as ordinary income;\n● the amount allocated to other taxable years (or portions thereof) of the U.S. Holder and included in its holding period will be taxed at the highest\ntax rate in effect for that year and applicable to the U.S. Holder; and\n● the interest charge generally applicable to underpayments of tax will be imposed in respect of the tax attributable to each such other taxable year\nof the U.S. Holder.\nIn general, if we are determined to be a PFIC, a U.S. Holder may avoid the PFIC tax consequences described above in respect to our shares by making a\ntimely QEF election (or a QEF election along with a purging election, as described below). Pursuant to the QEF election, a U.S. Holder will be required to\ninclude in income its pro rata share of our net capital gains (as long-term capital gain) and other earnings and profits (as ordinary income), on a current\nbasis, in each case whether or not distributed, in the taxable year of the U.S. Holder in which or with which our taxable year ends. A U.S. Holder may make\na separate election to defer the payment of taxes on undistributed income inclusions under the QEF rules, but if deferred, any such taxes will be subject to\nan interest charge.\nA U.S. Holder may not make a QEF election with respect to its redeemable warrants. As a result, if a U.S. Holder sells or otherwise disposes of a\nredeemable warrant (other than upon exercise of the redeemable warrant), any gain recognized generally will be subject to the special tax and interest\ncharge rules treating the gain as an excess distribution, as described above, if we were a PFIC at any time during the period the U.S. Holder held the\nredeemable warrants. If a U.S. Holder that exercises such redeemable warrants properly makes a QEF election with respect to the newly acquired ordinary\nshares (or has previously made a QEF election with respect to our shares), the QEF election will apply to the newly acquired ordinary shares, but the\nadverse tax consequences relating to PFIC shares, adjusted to take into account the current income inclusions resulting from the QEF election, will\ncontinue to apply with respect to such newly acquired ordinary shares (which generally will be deemed to have a holding period for purposes of the PFIC\nrules that includes the period the U.S. Holder held the redeemable warrants), unless the U.S. Holder makes a purging election with respect to such shares.\nThe purging election creates a deemed sale of such shares at their fair market value. The gain recognized by the purging election will be subject to the\nspecial tax and interest charge rules treating the gain as an excess distribution, as described above. As a result of the purging election, the U.S. Holder will\nincrease the adjusted tax basis in its ordinary shares acquired upon the exercise of the redeemable warrants by the gain recognized and will also have a new\nholding period in such ordinary shares for purposes of the PFIC rules.\nThe QEF election is made on a shareholder-by-shareholder basis and, once made, can be revoked only with the consent of the IRS. A U.S. Holder generally\nmakes a QEF election by attaching a completed IRS Form 8621 (Information Return by a Shareholder of a Passive Foreign Investment Company or\nQualified Electing Fund), including the information provided in a PFIC annual information statement, to a timely filed U.S. federal income tax return for\nthe taxable year to which the election relates. Retroactive QEF elections generally may be made only by filing a protective statement with such return and if\ncertain other conditions are met or with the consent of the IRS.\nIn order to comply with the requirements of a QEF election, a U.S. Holder must receive certain information from us. Upon request from a U.S. Holder, we\nwill endeavor to provide to the U.S. Holder no later than 90 days after the request such information as the IRS may require, including a PFIC annual\ninformation statement, in order to enable the U.S. Holder to make and maintain a QEF election. However, there is no assurance that we will have timely\nknowledge of our status as a PFIC in the future or of the required information to be provided.\n46\nIf a U.S. Holder has made a QEF election with respect to our shares and the special tax and interest charge rules do not apply to such shares (because of a\ntimely QEF election for our first taxable year as a PFIC in which the U.S. Holder holds (or is deemed to hold) such shares or a QEF election, along with a\npurge of the PFIC taint pursuant to a purging election, as described above), any gain recognized on the sale or other taxable disposition of our shares\ngenerally will be taxable as capital gain and no interest charge will be imposed. As discussed above, for regular U.S. federal income tax purposes, U.S.\nHolders of a QEF are currently taxed on their pro rata shares of the QEF’s earnings and profits, whether or not distributed. In such case, a subsequent\ndistribution of such earnings and profits that were previously included in income generally should not be taxable as a dividend to such U.S. Holders. The\nadjusted tax basis of a U.S. Holder’s shares in a QEF will be increased by amounts that are included in income, and decreased by amounts distributed but\nnot taxed as dividends, under the above rules. Similar basis adjustments apply to property if by reason of holding such property the U.S. Holder is treated\nunder the applicable attribution rules as owning shares in a QEF.\nAlthough a determination as to our PFIC status will be made annually, the initial determination that we are a PFIC generally will apply for subsequent years\nto a U.S. Holder who held shares or redeemable warrants while we were a PFIC, whether or not we meet the test for PFIC status in those subsequent years,\nunless such U.S. Holder made a purging election as described below. A U.S. Holder who makes the QEF election discussed above for our first taxable year\nas a PFIC in which the U.S. Holder holds (or is deemed to hold) our shares, however, will not be subject to the PFIC tax and interest charge rules discussed\nabove in respect to such shares. In addition, such U.S. Holder will not be subject to the QEF inclusion regime with respect to such shares for any of our\ntaxable years that end within or with a taxable year of the U.S. Holder and in which we are not a PFIC. On the other hand, if the QEF election is not\neffective for each of our taxable years in which we are a PFIC and during which the U.S. Holder holds (or is deemed to hold) our shares, the PFIC rules\ndiscussed above will continue to apply to such shares unless the holder files on a timely filed U.S. income tax return (including extensions) a QEF election\nand a purging election to recognize under the rules of Section 1291 of the Code any gain that the U.S. Holder would otherwise recognize if the U.S. Holder\nhad sold our shares for their fair market value on the “qualification date.” The qualification date is the first day of our tax year in which we qualify as a\nQEF with respect to such U.S. Holder. The purging election can only be made if such U.S. Holder held our ordinary shares on the qualification date. The\ngain recognized by the purging election will be subject to the special tax and interest charge rules treating the gain as an excess distribution, as described\nabove. As a result of the purging election, the U.S. Holder will increase the adjusted tax basis in its ordinary shares by the amount of the gain recognized\nand will also have a new holding period in the shares for purposes of the PFIC rules.\nIf a U.S. Holder did not make a timely “mark-to-market” election (as described above), and if we were a PFIC at any time during the period such U.S.\nHolder held our ordinary shares, then such ordinary shares will continue to be treated as stock of a PFIC with respect to such U.S. Holder even if we cease\nto be a PFIC in a future year, unless such U.S. Holder makes a “purging election” for the year we cease to be a PFIC. A “purging election” creates a deemed\nsale of such ordinary shares at their fair market value on the last day of the last year in which we are treated as a PFIC. The gain recognized by the purging\nelection will be subject to the special tax and interest charge rules treating the gain as an excess distribution, as described above. As a result of the purging\nelection, such U.S. Holder will have a new tax basis (equal to the fair market value of the ordinary shares on the last day of the last year in which we are\ntreated as a PFIC) and tax holding period (which new holding period will begin the day after such last day) in such ordinary shares.\nAs an alternative to the QEF election, if a U.S. Holder, at the close of its taxable year, owns shares in a PFIC that are treated as marketable stock, the U.S.\nHolder may make a mark-to-market election with respect to such shares for such taxable year. If the U.S. Holder makes a valid mark-to-market election for\nthe first taxable year of the U.S. Holder in which the U.S. Holder holds (or is deemed to hold) our shares and for which we are determined to be a PFIC,\nsuch holder generally will not be subject to the PFIC rules described above in respect to its shares. Instead, in general, the U.S. Holder will include as\nordinary income each year the excess, if any, of the fair market value of its shares at the end of its taxable year over the adjusted tax basis in its shares. The\nU.S. Holder also will be allowed to take an ordinary loss in respect of the excess, if any, of the adjusted tax basis of its shares over the fair market value of\nits shares at the end of its taxable year (but only to the extent of the net amount of previously included income as a result of the mark-to-market election).\nThe U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in its shares will be adjusted to reflect any such income or loss amounts, and any further gain recognized on a sale or\nother taxable disposition of the shares will be treated as ordinary income. Currently, a mark-to-market election may not be made with respect to our\nredeemable warrants.\n47\nThe mark-to-market election is available only for stock that is regularly traded on a national securities exchange that is registered with the Securities and\nExchange Commission, including the NASDAQ Capital Market, or on a foreign exchange or market that the IRS determines has rules sufficient to ensure\nthat the market price represents a legitimate and sound fair market value. Although our ordinary shares are listed and traded on the NASDAQ Capital\nMarket, we cannot guarantee that our shares will continue to be listed and traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market. U.S. Holders should consult their own\ntax advisors regarding the availability and tax consequences of a mark-to-market election in respect to our shares under their particular circumstances.\nIf we are a PFIC and, at any time, have a foreign subsidiary that is classified as a PFIC, a U.S. Holder generally would be deemed to own a portion of the\nshares of such lower-tier PFIC, and generally could incur liability for the deferred tax and interest charge described above if we receive a distribution from,\nor dispose of all or part of our interest in, or the U.S. Holder otherwise were deemed to have disposed of an interest in, the lower-tier PFIC. Upon request,\nwe will endeavor to cause any lower-tier PFIC to provide to a U.S. Holder no later than 90 days after the request the information that may be required to\nmake or maintain a QEF election with respect to the lower-tier PFIC. However, there is no assurance that we will have timely knowledge of the status of\nany such lower-tier PFIC, and we do not plan to make annual determinations or otherwise notify U.S. Holders of the PFIC status of any such lower-tier\nPFIC. There also is no assurance that we will be able to cause the lower-tier PFIC to provide the required information. U.S. Holders are urged to consult\ntheir own tax advisors regarding the tax issues raised by lower-tier PFICs.\nA U.S. Holder that owns (or is deemed to own) shares in a PFIC during any taxable year of the U.S. Holder may have to file an IRS Form 8621 (whether or\nnot a QEF election or mark-to-market election is or has been made) with such U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax return and provide such other\ninformation as may be required by the U.S. Treasury Department.\nThe rules dealing with PFICs and with the QEF and mark-to-market elections are very complex and are affected by various factors in addition to those\ndescribed above. Accordingly, U.S. Holders of our shares and redeemable warrants should consult their own tax advisors concerning the application of the\nPFIC rules to our shares and redeemable warrants under their particular circumstances.\nNon-U.S. Holders\nDividends (including constructive dividends) paid or deemed paid to a Non-U.S. Holder in respect to our securities generally will not be subject to U.S.\nfederal income tax, unless the dividends are effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business within the United States (and,\nif required by an applicable income tax treaty, are attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base that such holder maintains or maintained in the\nUnited States).\nIn addition, a Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain attributable to a sale or other taxable disposition of our\nsecurities unless such gain is effectively connected with its conduct of a trade or business in the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax\ntreaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base that such holder maintains or maintained in the United States) or the Non-U.S. Holder is an\nindividual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of sale or other disposition and certain other conditions are met (in\nwhich case, such gain from U.S. sources generally is subject to U.S. federal income tax at a 30% rate or a lower applicable tax treaty rate).\nDividends and gains that are effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the United States (and, if required by an\napplicable income tax treaty, are attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base that such holder maintains or maintained in the United States)\ngenerally will be subject to regular U.S. federal income tax at the same regular U.S. federal income tax rates applicable to a comparable U.S. Holder and, in\nthe case of a Non-U.S. Holder that is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, may also be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a 30%\nrate or a lower applicable tax treaty rate.\nThe U.S. federal income tax treatment of a Non-U.S. Holder’s exercise of redeemable warrants, or the lapse of redeemable warrants held by a Non-U.S.\nHolder, generally will correspond to the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the exercise or lapse of redeemable warrants by a U.S. Holder, as described\nunder “U.S. Holders — Exercise or Lapse of Redeemable Warrants” above.\n48\nBackup Withholding and Information Reporting\nIn general, information reporting for U.S. federal income tax purposes should apply to distributions made on our securities within the United States to a\nU.S. Holder (other than an exempt recipient) and to the proceeds from sales and other dispositions of our securities by a U.S. Holder (other than an exempt\nrecipient) to or through a U.S. office of a broker. Payments made (and sales and other dispositions effected at an office) outside the United States will be\nsubject to information reporting in limited circumstances. In addition, certain information concerning a U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in its securities and\nadjustments to that tax basis and whether any gain or loss with respect to such securities is long-term or short-term also may be required to be reported to\nthe IRS, and certain holders may be required to file an IRS Form 8938 (Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets) to report their interest in our\nsecurities.\nMoreover, backup withholding of U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 28% generally will apply to dividends paid on our securities to a U.S. Holder (other\nthan an exempt recipient) and the proceeds from sales and other dispositions of shares or warrants by a U.S. Holder (other than an exempt recipient), in\neach case who\n● fails to provide an accurate taxpayer identification number;\n● is notified by the IRS that backup withholding is required; or\n● in certain circumstances, fails to comply with applicable certification requirements.\nA Non-U.S. Holder generally may eliminate the requirement for information reporting and backup withholding by providing certification of its foreign\nstatus, under penalties of perjury, on a duly executed applicable IRS Form W-8 or by otherwise establishing an exemption. Backup withholding is not an\nadditional tax. Rather, the amount of any backup withholding will be allowed as a credit against a U.S. Holder’s or a Non-U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal\nincome tax liability and may entitle such holder to a refund, provided that certain required information is timely furnished to the IRS. Holders are urged to\nconsult their own tax advisors regarding the application of backup withholding and the availability of and procedures for obtaining an exemption from\nbackup withholding in their particular circumstances.\nF.

Subsidiary Information\nNot applicable.\n49\nITEM 11. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe deposit any surplus funds with Chinese banks earning daily interest. We do not invest in any instruments for trading purposes. Our operations generally\nare not directly sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates and we currently do not have any long-term debt outstanding. Management monitors the banks’\nprime rates in conjunction with our cash requirements to determine the appropriate level of debt balances relative to other sources of funds. We have not\nentered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to interest rate risk.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nThe reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, but the Group has a subsidiary in China primarily involved in the administration and accounting functions of the\nGroup. Its operating expenses are denominated in RMB and its annual expenditure is in the region of RMB 2 million. There is exposure to the fluctuations\nin the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the RMB but its impact on our results is considered minimal given the current level of expenditure.\nThe value of RMB against the U.S. dollar and other currencies is affected by, among other things, changes in China’s political and economic conditions.\nSince July 2005, RMB has not been pegged to the U.S. dollar. Although the People’s Bank of China regularly intervenes in the foreign exchange market to\nprevent significant short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate, RMB may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the U.S. dollar in the\nmedium to long term. Moreover, it is possible that in the future, PRC authorities may lift restrictions on fluctuations in RMB exchange rate and lessen\nintervention in the foreign exchange market.\nInflation\nInflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results. Although we do not believe\nthat inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse\neffect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues if the selling\nprices of our products do not increase with these increased costs.\nITEM 12.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of December 31, 2022 our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls\nand procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the year covered by this report. Disclosure controls\nand procedure include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the\nreports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management as appropriate to allow timely\ndecisions regarding required disclosure. Our Management is responsible for monitoring the process pursuant to which information is gathered and\nanalyzing such information to determine the extent to which such information requires disclosure, in the reports filed with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission.\nBased on such evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that as of December 31, 2022, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were\nineffective due to the Company’s lacks of formal documented controls and procedures applicable to all officers and directors to disclose the required\ninformation under the Exchange Act.\nWe have appointed outside independent directors, established board committees, strengthened the financial personnel and introduced written policies and\nprocedures.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting\nis defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act. It is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s\nprincipal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company’s board of directors, management and other personnel. The objective is to\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance\nwith accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that:\n● Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the\ncompany;\n● Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made\nonly in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and\n● Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets\nthat could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore,\neven those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.\nBecause of the inherent limitations of internal control, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the\ninternal controls over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible\nto design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.\n51\nAs December 31, 2022 management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal\ncontrol over financial reporting established in by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission’s 2013 Internal Control\nIntegrated Framework and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. Based on that evaluation, they concluded that, during the period covered by this\nreport, such internal controls and procedures were not effective to detect the inappropriate application of US GAAP rules. This was primarily due to\ndeficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls. These\ndeficiencies may be considered to be material weaknesses.\nIdentified Material Weakness\nA material weakness in internal control over financial reporting is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a\nremote likelihood that a material misstatement of the financial statements will not be prevented or detected.\nManagement identified the following material weaknesses during its assessment of internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022:\n(1) A lack of understanding of the requirements of NASDAQ, made worse by a poor or no command of the English language\n(2) Mining records were not kept to the required standard and were not updated due to a lack of understanding of the various monitoring links and\nplatforms. Reconciliation of differences were not satisfactorily completed\n(3) There was no fixed ledger showing all the relevant details of the assets of the Company.\n(4) Past consolidation adjustments were not fully explained and there was too much reliance on memorandum records and reconciliations.\nAs a result of the material weaknesses described above, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by COSO (2013 framework).\nHowever, management does not believe that any of our annual or interim financial statements issued to date contain a material misstatement as a result of\nthe aforementioned weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement’s Remediation Initiatives\nTo mediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies, we have introduced the following measures:\n(1) Continue to educate senior management on the continuing listing requirements of NASDAQ\n(2) Design and monitor controls over financial reporting, including the documentation of various checks and balances to monitor and reconcile\ndifferences in mining revenue.\n(3) A Fixed Asset Register is now maintained to improve documentation and physical custody of the Company’s assets.\n(4) There is now a proper record of all consolidation adjustments with supporting journals and records\nChanges in internal controls over financial reporting\nExcept as described above, there have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this\nReport that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.\nITEM 16.

CHANGE IN REGISTRANT’S CERTIFYING ACCOUNTANT\nEffective June 30, 2022, the Registrant has appointed Audit Alliance LLP (“Audit Alliance”) as its independent registered public accounting firm\nfor the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 and accepted the resignation of the Registrant’s previous independent auditor, Centurion ZD & Co.\n(“Centurion”), effective on the same date. Audit Alliance is headquartered in Singapore and will be subject to the inspections by the Public Company\nAccounting Oversight Board of the United States. The appointment of Audit Alliance was made after careful consideration and evaluation by the Registrant\nand has been approved by the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors of the Registrant.\nDuring the Registrant’s two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 and September 30, 2020, through the resignation of\nCenturion on June 30, 2022, there were no disagreements between the Registrant or its predecessor, Moxian, Inc., and Centurion on any matter of\naccounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of\nCenturion, would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in connection with its report on the Registrant’s or its\npredecessor’s consolidated financial statements for such periods. In addition, Centurion’s reports on the financial statements as of and for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020 and September 30, 2020 did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to\nuncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 and September 30, 2020 through the\nresignation of Centurion on June 30, 2022, there were no “reportable events” as that term is defined in Item 16F(a)(1)(v) of Form 20-F.\nDuring the two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 and September 30, 2020 and any subsequent interim period prior to\nengaging Audit Alliance, neither the Registrant nor anyone on its behalf consulted Audit Alliance regarding either (i) the application of accounting\nprinciples to any proposed or completed transaction, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Registrant’s financial statements, and neither\na written report nor oral advice was provided to the Registrant that Audit Alliance concluded was an important factor considered by the Registrant in\nreaching a decision as to any accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement (as defined in\nItem 16F(a)(1)(iv) of Form 20-F and the related instructions to Item 16F of Form 20-F) or a reportable event.\nITEM 16G. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nOur ordinary shares are listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market, or NASDAQ. As such, we are subject to corporate governance requirements\nimposed by NASDAQ.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the\nfinancial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial\nstatements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB)\nand are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations\nof the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor\nwere we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of\ninternal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and\nperforming procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in\nthe financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as\nevaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or\nrequired to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2)\ninvolved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our\nopinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the\ncritical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nImpairment Assessment of Property, equipment and vehicles\nAs described in Note 4, the Company recognized an impairment loss on property, equipment and vehicles amounting to $11,889,000. The assessment of\nloss allowance requires significant judgement. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with\nforming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The recoverable amount is determined based on the cash-generating-unit (CGU) to\nwhich the asset belongs. For each reporting period, management reviews the recoverable amount using discounted cash flows and determine if impairment\nis required. The assessment of the impairment requires significant judgement. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit\nevidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The audit engagement team performed extended\nprocedures, which includes, among others, obtaining an understanding of the management’s assessment process, evaluating the reasonableness of the\nrelevant inputs and factors used in calculating the projections, and testing the accuracy of the assessment output.\n/s/ Audit Alliance LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2023.\nSingapore\nMay 17, 2023\nPCAOB ID number: 3487\nF-1\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)\nCenturion ZD CPA & Co.\nCertified Public Accountants (Practising)\nUnit 1304, 13/F, Two Harbourfront, 22 Tak Fung Street, Hunghom, Hong Kong.\n(cid:0)(cid:0) (cid:0)(cid:0) (cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)22(cid:0) (cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0) 13(cid:0)1304(cid:0)\nTel (cid:0)(cid:0): (852) 2126 2388 Fax (cid:0)(cid:0): (852) 2122 9078\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Moxian (BVI) Inc\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Moxian (BVI) Inc (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2021, and the related\nconsolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity (deficit) and cash flows for the year then ended December 31, 2021,\nand the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,\nthe financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended December 31,\n2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s\ninternal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued\nby the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated May 13, 2022 expressed a qualified opinion on the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial\nstatements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules\nand regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing\nprocedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated\nfinancial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as\nevaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and\nperforming procedures that respond to those risks.

Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as\nevaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was\ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated\nfinancial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not\nalter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below,\nproviding a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAllowance for current expected credit losses (“CECL”) on accounts receivable\nAs described in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (codified\nas Accounting Standard Codification Topic 326), since January 1, 2020, which requires measurement and recognition of current expected credit losses for\nfinancial instruments held at amortized cost. The management of the Company has estimated an allowance accrued for CECL of $1,181,916 for the year\nended December 31, 2021, on accounts receivables, based on the credit risk of the respective receivables. The allowance amount has been measured as the\ndifference of the asset’s carrying amount and the estimates of present value of future cash flows based on the historical experience, current conditions, and\nreasonable and supportable forecasts.\nWe have identified allowance for CECL on accounts receivable as a critical audit matter due to the involvement of subjective judgment and management\nestimates in evaluating the CECL of these receivable items, and the significance to the Company’s consolidated financial position.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements. Our audit procedures to respond the risk of error in the allowance for CECL included (i) obtaining an understanding and assessing\nmanagement’s method for developing the allowance for doubtful accounts (credit losses); (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the model, by reviewing the\ncalculation schedules prepared by the management; (iii) testing the accuracy of management’s basic input in calculating CECL including aging report,\nhistorical write-offs and recoveries, on a sample basis; (iv) independently evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions and judgments made by\nmanagement to estimate the allowance for credit loss, including the Company’s assessment on significant factors, and the basis of estimated loss rates\napplied with reference to historical default rates and forward-looking information; (v) sending confirmations to debtors to confirm the accuracy of the basic\ninformation and terms of the loan receivables; (vi) performing credit review with both individual and corporation borrowers of significant loan receivables,\nto assess the borrowers’ capability and willing to repay the debt; and (vii) evaluating the competence, capabilities and objectivity of the professionals\nengaged by the Company.\n/s/ Centurion ZD CPA & Co\nCenturion ZD CPA & Co.\nHong Kong\nMay 13, 2022\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2018\nF-2\nMOXIAN (BVI) INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nAs of\nDecember 31, December 31,\nNote 2022 2021\nASSETS\nProperty, equipment and vehicles 4 $ 12,553,408 $ -\nDigital assets 7,087,747 5,000,000\nCurrent Assets\nCash and cash equivalents 2,505,286 2,507,404\nAccount receivable -

Organization and nature of operations\nThe Company was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands (BVI) on May 18, 2021. On August 17, 2021, the Company completed a redomicile merger\nwith its predecessor company, Moxian, Inc, wherein it acquired all the assets, liabilities, rights, obligations and operations of the latter and its subsidiaries,\nthrough an exchange of an identical number of shares.\nOn December 28, 2021 in a Special Meeting of shareholders, the Company approved the issue of up to 20 million new ordinary shares of the Company, at a\nprice of $2.50 per share to certain non-US based accredited investors. On February 11, 2022 the Company completed this private placement and issued 16\nmillion new shares, raising $40 million, which it would use in bitcoin mining in order to diversify its business operations. Of the issue proceeds, $29.8\nmillion was used to purchase and ship relevant equipment from China and the balance deployed as working capital.\nOn March 5, 2022 a number of machines were installed and operational at a site near Buffalo in New York State, USA. The bulk of the equipment was\nshipped to Columbus in the State of Georgia and mining commenced in late May. However, due to poor prices for bitcoin and high electricity charges,\nmining operations ceased temporarily at both sides by June 2022 whilst efforts intensified in the search for a more cost-effective site.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the activities of the Company and each of the following entities:\nName of entity Background Ownership\nAbit Hong Kong Limited (formerly known as Investment Holding 100% owned by Moxian (BVI) Inc\nWoodland Corporation Limited)\nAbit USA, Inc. Bitcoin Mining 100% owned by Abit Hong Kong Limited\nBeijing Bitmatrix Technology Co. Ltd In-house Support Services 100% owned by Abit Hong Kong Limited\n2. Summary of principal accounting policies\nBasis of presentation and consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in\nthe United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and include all the subsidiaries of the Group. The financial year-end of the Company is December 31. The\nconsolidated results are presented as of the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. All intercompany transactions and balances have been\neliminated in the consolidation.\nFair value of financial instruments\nThe Company follows the provisions of ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.” ASC 820 clarifies the definition of fair value, prescribes\nmethods for measuring fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:\nLevel 1-Observable inputs such as unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date.\nLevel 2-Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and\nliabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market\ndata.\nLevel 3-Inputs are unobservable inputs that reflect management’s assumptions based on the best available information.\nThe carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, prepayments, deposits and other receivables, accruals and other payables, loans from related parties and\nunrelated party approximate their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments.\nF-7\nMOXIAN (BVI) INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n2. Summary of principal accounting policies (continued)\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the accompanying consolidated\nfinancial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates required to be made by\nmanagement include but not limited to, useful lives of property and equipment, provision for doubtful accounts, intangible assets valuation, inventory\nvaluation, value added recoverable valuation and deferred tax assets valuation. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash includes cash on hand and demand deposits in accounts maintained with commercial banks. The Company considers all highly liquid investment\ninstruments with an original maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.\nThe Company considers all short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and have original maturities of three\nmonths or less to be cash equivalents.\nPrepayments, deposits and other receivables\nPrepayments and deposits represent amounts advanced to suppliers. The suppliers usually require advance payments or deposits when the Company makes\npurchase or orders service and the prepayments and deposits will be utilized to offset the Company’s future payments. Other receivables mainly consist of\nvarious cash advances to employees for business needs. These amounts are unsecured, non-interest bearing and generally short-term in nature.\nAllowances are recorded when utilization and collection of amounts due are in doubt. Delinquent prepayments, deposits and other receivables are written-\noff after management has determined that the likelihood of utilization or collection is not probable and known bad debts are written off against the\nallowances when identified.\nProperty, Equipment and Vehicles, net\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Significant additions or improvements extending useful lives\nof assets are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line\nmethod over the estimated useful lives as follows:\nElectronic and mining equipment 3-6 years\nFurniture and fixtures 3-6 years\nLeasehold improvements Shorter of estimated useful life or term of lease\nVehicles 3 years\nIntangible assets, net\nIntangible assets, comprising Intellectual property rights (“IP rights”) and software, which are separable from property and equipment, are stated at cost\nless accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of 3- 10 years.\nF-8\nMOXIAN (BVI) INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nThe Company classifies its long-lived assets into: (i) computer and office equipment; (ii) furniture and fixtures, (iii) leasehold improvements, and (iv)\nfinite-lived intangible assets.\nLong-lived assets held and used by the Company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value\nof such assets may not be fully recoverable. It is possible that these assets could become impaired as a result of technology, economy or other industry\nchanges. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group to be tested for possible impairment, the Company first compares undiscounted cash\nflows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset or asset group is not\nrecoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Fair value is\ndetermined through various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models, relief from royalty income approach, quoted market values and\nthird-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary.\nThe Company makes various assumptions and estimates regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair values of the\nrespective assets. The assumptions and estimates used to determine future values and remaining useful lives of long-lived assets are complex and\nsubjective. They can be affected by various factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as the\nCompany’s business strategy and its forecasts for specific market expansion.\nDigital assets\nDigital assets (including USDC) are included in current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Digital assets purchased are recorded at\ncost and digital assets awarded to the Company through its mining activities are accounted for in connection with the Company’s revenue recognition\npolicy disclosed below.\nDigital assets held are accounted for as intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized but\nassessed for impairment annually, or more frequently, when events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that it is more likely than not that the\nindefinite-lived asset is impaired. Impairment exists when the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, which is measured using the quoted price of the\ndigital assets at the time its fair value is being measured. In testing for impairment, the Company has the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to\ndetermine whether it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. If it is determined that it is not more likely than not that an impairment exists, a\nquantitative impairment test is not necessary. If the Company concludes otherwise, it is required to perform a quantitative impairment test. To the extent an\nimpairment loss is recognized, the loss establishes the new cost basis of the asset. Subsequent reversal of impairment losses is not permitted.\nPurchases of digital assets by the Company, if any, will be included within investing activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows,\nwhile digital assets awarded to the Company through its mining activities are included within operating activities on the accompanying consolidated\nstatements of cash flows. The sales of digital assets are included within investing activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows and\nany realized gains or losses from such sales are included in “realized gain (loss) on exchange of digital assets” in the consolidated statements of operations\nand comprehensive income (loss). The Company accounts for its gains or losses in accordance with the first-in first-out method of accounting.\nF-9\nMOXIAN (BVI) INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nRevenue recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”).\nThe Company has entered into digital asset mining pools by executing contracts with mining pool operators to provide computing power to the mining\npool. The Company’s enforceable right to compensation begins only when, and lasts as long as, the Company provides computing power to the mining pool\noperator and is created as power is provided over time. The only consideration due to the Company relates to the provision of computing power. The\ncontracts are terminable at any time by and at no cost to the Company, and by the pool operator under certain conditions specified in the contract. Providing\ncomputing power in digital asset transaction verification services is an output of the Company’s ordinary activities. Providing such computing power is the\nonly performance obligation in the Company’s contracts with mining pool operators.\nThe transaction consideration the Company receives, if any, is noncash consideration in the form of bitcoin. Changes in the fair value of the noncash\nconsideration due to form of the consideration (changes in the market price of Bitcoin) are not included in the transaction price and therefore, are not\nincluded in revenue. Certain mining pool operators charge fees to cover the costs of maintaining the pool and are deducted from amounts we may otherwise\nearn and are treated as a reduction to the consideration received. Fees fluctuate and historically have been no more than approximately 2% per reward\nearned, on average.\nIn exchange for providing computing power, the Company is entitled to either:\na Full-Pay-Per-Share pay out of bitcoin based on a contractual formula, which primarily calculates the hash rate provided by the Company to the mining\npool as a percentage of total network hash rate, and other inputs. The Company is entitled to consideration even if a block is not successfully placed by the\nmining pool operator. The contract is in effect until terminated by either party.\nThe consideration is all variable. Because it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue will not occur and the Company is able to calculate\nthe payout based on the contractual formula, noncash revenue is estimated and recognized based on the spot price of Bitcoin determined using the\nCompany’s primary trading platform for bitcoin at the inception of each contract, whichis determined to be daily. Noncash consideration is measured at fair\nvalue at contract inception. Fair value of the crypto asset consideration is determined using the quoted price on the Company’s primary trading platform for\nbitcoin at the beginning of the contract period at the single bitcoin level (one bitcoin). This amount is estimated and recognized in revenue upon inception,\nwhich is when hash rate is provided.\nOr:\na fractional share of the fixed Bitcoin award the mining pool operator receives (less digital asset transaction fees to the mining pool operator which are\nimmaterial and are recorded as a deduction from revenue) for successfully adding a block to the blockchain based on a proportion of the Company’s\n“scoring hash rate” to the pool’s “scoring hash rate” where the scoring hash rate as defined by the pool is the exponential moving average of the hash power\ncontributed by the Company or by all pool members combined. The Company’s fractional share of the bitcoin reward is based on the proportion of\ncomputing power the Company contributed to the mining pool operator to the total computing power contributed by all mining pool participants in solving\nthe current algorithm.\nIncome taxes\nThe Company utilizes ASC Topic 740 (“ASC 740”) “Income taxes”, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected\nfuture tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred income taxes\nare recognized for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at\neach period end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.\nValuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nASC 740 “Income taxes” clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. This interpretation requires that an entity recognizes in the financial\nstatements the impact of a tax position, if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the\nposition. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or\nmeasurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company has elected to classify interest and penalties related to\nunrecognized tax benefits, if and when required, as part of income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company evaluate the\nlevel of authority for each uncertain tax position (including the potential application of interest and penalties) based on the technical merits, and measure\nthe unrecognized benefits associated with the tax positions. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company did not have any unrecognized\ntax benefits. The Company does not anticipate any significant increase to its liability for unrecognized tax benefit within the next 12 months.\nF-10\nMOXIAN (BVI) INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nForeign currency transactions and translation\nThe reporting currency of the Company is United States Dollars (the “USD”).\nFor financial reporting purposes, the financial statements of the foreign-incorporated subsidiaries are prepared using their respective functional currencies,\nand then translated into the reporting currency, USD so to be consolidated with the Company’s. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies\nother than the reporting currency are translated into the reporting currency at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses\nare translated using average rates prevailing during the reporting period. Adjustments resulting from the translation are recorded as a separate component of\naccumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ deficiency. Translation losses are recognized in the statements of operations and comprehensive\nloss.\nThe exchange rates applied are as follows:\nDecember 31, December 31,\nBalance sheet items, except for equity accounts 2022 2021\nRMB:USD 6.8979 6.3559\nHKD:USD 7.7990 7.7992\nItems in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss, and statements cash flows:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2022 2021\nRMB:USD 6.8979 6.4525\nHKD:USD 7.7959 7.7727\nEarnings per share\nBasic gain per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period while the effects of potential common\nshares outstanding during the period are included in diluted earnings per share.\nFASB Accounting Standard Codification Topic 260 (“ASC 260”), “Earnings Per Share,” requires that employee equity share options, non-vested shares and\nsimilar equity instruments granted to employees be treated as potential common shares in computing diluted earnings per share. Diluted earnings per share\nshould be based on the actual number of options or shares granted and not yet forfeited, unless doing so would be anti-dilutive. The Company uses the\n“treasury stock” method for equity instruments granted in share-based payment transactions provided in ASC 260 to determine diluted earnings per share.\nAntidilutive securities represent potentially dilutive securities which are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings or loss per share as their impact\nwas antidilutive.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Company continually assesses any new accounting pronouncements to determine their applicability. When it is determined that a new accounting\npronouncement affects the Company’s financial reporting, the Company undertakes a study to determine the consequences of the change to its consolidated\nfinancial statements and assures that there are proper controls in place to ascertain that the Company’s consolidated financial statements properly reflect the\nchange.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement\nof Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which was codified with its subsequent amendments as Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 326,\nFinancial Instruments – Credit Losses (“ASC 326”). ASC 326 seeks to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the\nexpected credit losses on financial instruments, including trade receivables, and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each\nreporting date. The amendments require an entity to replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in other GAAP with a methodology that reflects\ncurrent expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. The\nupdated guidance is effective for the Company for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022, and early adoption is permitted. In\nconnection with the Company’s acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company adopted this standard on January 1,2021 and the\nadoption did not have a material impact on the financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (“ASU 2019-12”), which is\nintended to simplify various aspects related to accounting for income taxes. ASU 2019-12 removes certain exceptions to the general principles in ASC\nTopic 740 and also clarifies and amends existing guidance to improve consistent application. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods\nwithin those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2020 and\nthe adoption did not have a material impact on the financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn May 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-04, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt-Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50),Compensation-\nStock Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40), (“ASU 2021-04”).This ASU reduces\ndiversity in an issuer’s accounting for modifications or exchanges of freestanding equity-classified written call options (for example, warrants) that remain\nequity classified after modification or exchange. This ASU provides guidance for a modification or an exchange of a freestanding equity-classified written\ncall option that is not within the scope of another Topic. It specifically addresses: (1) how an entity should treat a modification of the terms or conditions or\nan exchange of a freestanding equity-classified written call option that remains equity classified after modification or exchange; (2) how an entity should\nmeasure the effect of a modification or an exchange of a freestanding equity-classified written call option that remains equity classified after modification\nor exchange; and (3) how an entity should recognize the effect of a modification or an exchange of a freestanding equity-classified written call option that\nremains equity classified after modification or exchange. This ASU will be effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. An\nentity should apply the amendments prospectively to modifications or exchanges occurring on or after the effective date of the amendments. Early adoption\nis permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The adoption of ASU 2021-04 on January 1, 2022 did not have a material impact on the Company’s\nfinancial statements.\nThe Company’s management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, authoritative guidance, if currently adopted, would have\na material impact on the Company’s financial statement presentation or disclosures.\nF-11\nMOXIAN (BVI) INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n3.

Divestment of a subsidiary\nIn July 2022, the Company divested its entire interest in Moxian (Hong Kong) Limited, a holding company with interests in several wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries in Shenzhen, Beijing, Shanghai and Malaysia as well as a variable entity in Shenzhen for a consideration of HK$1,000. The wholly-owned\nsubsidiary companies as well as the variable interest entity had been largely dormant since September 2018. The directors consider this divestment to be in\nthe best interests of the Company as it has decided to pursue other business opportunities which are based outside the People’s Republic of China. The\ndivested company and its subsidiary companies have had many years of losses since their inception and have gradually ceased business operations because\nof a lack of working capital, little or no market penetration and high competitive pressure.\nThe gains on this divestment is stated after accounting for the interest in Moxian (Hong Kong) which is the funding vehicle through which advances had\nbeen made for the working capital requirements of the subsidiaries and the variable interest entity, less the consolidation of past losses in its financial\nstatements. In a related development, the Company also wrote off its carrying value in its entire interest in Moxian CN Group China Limited, the holding\ncompany of Moxian (Hong Kong) Limited as there was no longer any purpose to retain the company.\nDetails of the transaction:\nGain on divestment of the interest in Moxian (Hong Kong) Limited $ 406,938\nWrite-off of the cost of investment in Moxian CN China Limited (1,000,001)\n8. Income taxes\nThe Company and its subsidiaries file separate income tax returns.\nThe United States of America\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”) was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code.\nChanges include, but are not limited to, a U.S. corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the\ntransition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed\nrepatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017. As the Company has a September 30 fiscal year-end, the lower corporate income tax\nrate will be phased in, resulting in a U.S. statutory federal rate of approximately 24.5% for our fiscal year ending September 30, 2018, and 21% for\nsubsequent fiscal years. Accordingly, we have to remeasure our deferred tax assets on net operating loss carryforward in the U.S. at the lower enacted\ncooperated tax rate of 21%. However, this re-measurement has no effect on the Company’s income tax expenses as the Company has provided a 100%\nvaluation allowance on its deferred tax assets previously.\nAdditionally, the Tax Act imposes a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of historical earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and future foreign earnings\nare subject to U.S. taxation. The change in rate has caused us to remeasure all U.S. deferred income tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences and\nnet operating loss (NOL) carryforwards and recorded a one-time income tax payable in 8 years.\nABit USA, Inc was incorporated by statutory conversion in the State of Delaware on April 28, 2022. It was previously known as Watercool Asset\nManagement LLC.\nBritish Virgin Islands\nMoxian BVI is incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. Under the current laws of the British Virgin Islands, Moxian BVI is not subject to tax on income\nor capital gains. In addition, upon payments of dividends by Moxian BVI, no British Virgin Islands withholding tax is imposed.\nHong Kong\nABit Hong Kong is incorporated in the Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong where the profits tax rate is 16.5%. It has not commenced business\noperations and did earn any income that was derived in Hong Kong for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.\nPRC\nEffective from January 1, 2008, the PRC’s statutory income tax rate is 25%. The Company’s sole PRC subsidiary, Beijing Bitmatrix Technology Co. Ltd.\nhas not operated any business since inception but provides administrative and accounting services to the Group.\n9. Commitments and contingencies\nOperating Lease\nCurrently, the Company has no property under an operating lease.\nAs noted in Note 5, the Company has an irrevocable order for some equipment which it has already paid a deposit equivalent to about 50% of the cost. The\ntotal cost of the purchase order is $5,272,500 and the balance, net of purchase credits, will be progressively paid upon delivery by December 2023.\n10. Subsequent events\n(a) In April 2023, the Company signed an agreement to acquire a piece of property in Duff, near La Follette in the State of Tennessee for a\nconsideration of $1.2 million. It subsequently awarded a construction management agreement for $1.6 million for the construction of a mining\ncenter which is scheduled for completion in August 2023. Other relevant equipment, including transformers and switchgear, have been acquired\nand a supply contract with the local utility board is under negotiation as of the date of this report.\n(b) The Company has negotiated to take up a joint-venture in bitcoin mining in Kazakhstan where its initial investment will be less than $0.5 million.\nF-13\nExhibit 2.2\nDescription of Securities\nRegistered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\nAs of December 31, 2022, Moxian (BVI) Inc (“Moxian BVI,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our”) had one class of securities registered\npursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as follows:\nTitle of each class Symbol Name of each exchange on which registered\nOrdinary shares, par value $0.001 per share MOXC Nasdaq Capital Market\nOrdinary Shares\nUnder our memorandum and articles of association, as amended, the Company is authorized to issue a maximum of 200,000,000 shares,\ncomprising: (i) 150,000,000 ordinary shares of par value US$0.001 each and (ii) 50,000,000 preferred shares of par value US$0.00101 each. As of\nDecember 31, 2022, a total of 35,554,677 ordinary shares were issued and outstanding and 5,000,000 preferred shares issued and outstanding. The ordinary\nshares are registered for trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the trading symbol “MOXC.”\nCapitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings given to them in the annual report on Form 20-F.\nThis Exhibit sets forth a description of our ordinary shares and certain provisions of our memorandum and articles of association which are\nsummaries and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, which\nwas previously filed as Exhibit 99.1 to the Company’s current report on Form 6-K on December 6, 2021 (referred to hereafter as our “Memorandum and\nArticles”).\nDividend Distributions\nThe holders of our ordinary shares are entitled to such dividends as may be declared by our board of directors subject to the BVI Business\nCompanies Act. The holders of our preferred shares have no right to share in any dividend paid by the Company and no right to share in the distribution of\nthe surplus assets of the Company on its liquidation.\nVoting rights\nAny action required or permitted to be taken by the shareholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of the shareholders\nentitled to vote on such action and may be effected by a resolution in writing. At each shareholder’s meeting, each shareholder who is present in person or\nby proxy (or, in the case of a shareholder being a corporation, by its duly authorized representative) will be entitled to one vote for each ordinary share\nwhich such shareholder holds and be entitled to three votes for each preferred share which such shareholder holds on all matters subject to vote at each\nshareholders’ meeting of the Company.\nElection of directors\nDelaware law permits cumulative voting for the election of directors only if expressly authorized in the certificate of incorporation. The laws of\nthe British Virgin Islands, however, do not specifically prohibit or restrict the creation of cumulative voting rights for the election of our directors.\nCumulative voting is not a concept that is accepted as a common practice in the British Virgin Islands, and we have made no provisions in our\nmemorandum and articles of association to allow cumulative voting for elections of directors.\nMeetings\nWe must provide written notice of all meetings of shareholders, stating the time, place and, in the case of a special meeting of shareholders, the\npurpose or purposes thereof, at least 7 days before the date of the proposed meeting to those persons whose names appear as shareholders in the register of\nmembers on the date of the notice and are entitled to vote at the meeting. Our board of directors shall call a special meeting upon the written request of\nshareholders holding at least 30% of our outstanding voting shares. In addition, our board of directors may call a special meeting of shareholders on its own\nmotion. A meeting of shareholders held in contravention of the requirement to give notice is valid if shareholders holding at least 90 percent of the total\nvoting rights on all the matters to be considered at the meeting have waived notice of the meeting and, for this purpose, the presence of a shareholder at the\nmeeting shall constitute waiver in relation to all the shares which that shareholder holds.\nThe management of us is entrusted to our board of directors, who will make corporate decisions by board resolution. Our directors are free to meet\nat such times and in such manner and places within or outside the BVI as the directors determine to be necessary or desirable. A 3 days’ notice of a meeting\nof directors must be given. At any meeting of directors, a quorum will be present if half of the total number of directors is present, unless there are only 2\ndirectors in which case the quorum is 2. If a quorum is not present, the meeting will be dissolved. If a quorum is present, votes of half of present directors\nare required to pass a resolution of directors.\nAs few as one third of our outstanding shares may be sufficient to hold a shareholder meeting. Although our memorandum and articles of\nassociation require that holders of at least one-third of our outstanding shares appear in person or by proxy to hold a shareholder meeting, to the extent we\nfail to have quorum on this initial meeting date, we can reschedule the meeting for the next business day or later, at which second meeting the holders of\none third or more of our outstanding shares will constitute a quorum. As mentioned, at the initial date set for any meeting of shareholders, a quorum will be\npresent if there are shareholders present in person or by proxy representing not less than one-third of the issued Ordinary Shares entitled to vote on the\nresolutions to be considered at the meeting. A quorum may comprise a single shareholder or proxy and then such person may pass a resolution of\nshareholders and a certificate signed by such person accompanied where such person be a proxy by a copy of the proxy instrument shall constitute a valid\nresolution of shareholder. If within two hours from the time appointed for the meeting a quorum is not present, the meeting, if convened upon the\nrequisition of shareholders, shall be dissolved; in any other case it shall stand adjourned to the next business day in the jurisdiction in which the meeting\nwas to have been held at the same time and place or to such other time and place as the directors may determine, and if at the adjourned meeting there are\npresent within one hour from the time appointed for the meeting in person or by proxy not less than one third of the votes of the shares or each class or\nseries of shares entitle to vote on the matter to be considered by the meeting, those present shall constitute a quorum but otherwise the meeting shall be\ndissolved. No business may be transacted at any general meeting unless a quorum is present at the commencement of business. If present, the chair of our\nboard of directors shall be the chair presiding at any meeting of the shareholders.\nA corporation that is a shareholder shall be deemed for the purpose of our memorandum and articles of association to be present in person if\nrepresented by its duly authorized representative. This duly authorized representative shall be entitled to exercise the same powers on behalf of the\ncorporation which he represents as that corporation could exercise if it were our individual shareholder.\nProtection of minority shareholders\nWe would normally expect British Virgin Islands courts to follow English case law precedents, which permit a minority shareholder to commence\na representative action, or derivative actions in our name, to challenge (1) an act which is ultra vires or illegal, (2) an act which constitutes a fraud against\nthe minority by parties in control of us, (3) the act complained of constitutes an infringement of individual rights of shareholders, such as the right to vote\nand pre-emptive rights and (4) an irregularity in the passing of a resolution which requires a special or extraordinary majority of the shareholders.\nPre-emptive rights\nThere are no pre-emptive rights applicable to the issue by us of new Ordinary Shares under either British Virgin Islands law or our memorandum\nand articles of association.\nTransfer of ordinary shares\nSubject to the restrictions in our memorandum and articles of association and applicable securities laws, any of our shareholders may transfer all\nor any of his or her ordinary shares by written instrument of transfer signed by the transferor and containing the name and address of the transferee. Our\nboard of directors may resolve by resolution to refuse or delay the registration of the transfer of any common share. If our board of directors resolves to\nrefuse or delay any transfer, it shall specify the reasons for such refusal in the resolution. Our directors may not resolve or refuse or delay the transfer of a\ncommon share unless: (a) the person transferring the shares has failed to pay any amount due in respect of any of those shares; or (b) such refusal or delay\nis deemed necessary or advisable in our view or that of our legal counsel in order to avoid violation of, or in order to ensure compliance with, any\napplicable, corporate, securities and other laws and regulations.\nLiquidation\nIf we are wound up and the assets available for distribution among our shareholders are more than sufficient to repay all amounts paid to us on\naccount of the issue of shares immediately prior to the winding up, the excess shall be distributable pari passu among those shareholders in proportion to\nthe amount paid up immediately prior to the winding up on the shares held by them, respectively. If we are wound up and the assets available for\ndistribution among the shareholders as such are insufficient to repay the whole of the amounts paid to us on account of the issue of shares, those assets shall\nbe distributed so that, to the greatest extent possible, the losses shall be borne by the shareholders in proportion to the amounts paid up immediately prior to\nthe winding up on the shares held by them, respectively. If we are wound up, the liquidator appointed by us may, in accordance with the BVI Business\nCompanies Act, divide among our shareholders in specie or kind the whole or any part of our assets (whether they shall consist of property of the same\nkind or not) and may, for such purpose, set such value as the liquidator deems fair upon any property to be divided and may determine how such division\nshall be carried out as between the shareholders or different classes of shareholders.\nCalls on ordinary shares and forfeiture of ordinary shares\nOur board of directors may from time to time make calls upon shareholders for any amounts unpaid on their ordinary shares in a notice served to\nsuch shareholders at least 14 days prior to the specified time of payment. The ordinary shares that have been called upon and remain unpaid are subject to\nforfeiture.\nRedemption of ordinary shares\nSubject to the provisions of the BVI Business Companies Act, we may issue shares on terms that are subject to redemption, at our option or at the\noption of the holders, on such terms and in such manner as may be determined by our memorandum and articles of association and subject to any\napplicable requirements imposed from time to time by, the BVI Business Companies Act, the SEC, The NASDAQ Capital Market, or by any recognized\nstock exchange on which our securities are listed.\nModifications of rights\nAll or any of the special rights attached to any class of shares may, subject to the provisions of the BVI Business Companies Act, be amended only\npursuant to a resolution passed at a meeting by a majority of the votes cast by those entitled to vote at a meeting of the holders of the shares of that class.\nChanges in the number of shares we are authorized to issue and those in issue\nWe may from time to time by resolution of our board of directors:\n● amend our memorandum of association to increase or decrease the maximum number of shares we are authorized to issue;\n● subject to our memorandum, divide our authorized and issued shares into a larger number of shares; and\n● subject to our memorandum, combine our authorized and issued shares into a smaller number of shares.\nUntraceable shareholders\nWe are entitled to sell any shares of a shareholder who is untraceable, provided that:\n● all checks or warrants in respect of dividends of these shares, not being less than three in number, for any sums payable in cash to the holder of\nsuch shares have remained uncashed for a period of twelve years prior to the publication of the notice and during the three months referred to in\nthe third bullet point below;\n● we have not during that time received any indication of the whereabouts or existence of the shareholder or person entitled to these shares by death,\nbankruptcy or operation of law; and\n● we have caused a notice to be published in newspapers in the manner stipulated by our memorandum and articles of association, giving notice of\nour intention to sell these shares, and a period of three months has elapsed since such notice.\n● The net proceeds of any such sale shall belong to us, and when we receive these net proceeds we shall become indebted to the former shareholder\nfor an amount equal to the net proceeds.\nInspection of books and records\nUnder British Virgin Islands Law, holders of our ordinary shares are entitled, upon giving written notice to us, to inspect (i) our memorandum and\narticles of association, (ii) the register of members, (iii) the register of directors and (iv) minutes of meetings and resolutions of members, and to make\ncopies and take extracts from the documents and records. However, our directors can refuse access if they are satisfied that to allow such access would be\ncontrary to our interests. See “Where You Can Find Additional Information.”\nRights of non-resident or foreign shareholders\nThere are no limitations imposed by our memorandum and articles of association on the rights of non-resident or foreign shareholders to hold or\nexercise voting rights on our shares. In addition, there are no provisions in our memorandum and articles of association governing the ownership threshold\nabove which shareholder ownership must be disclosed.\nIssuance of additional ordinary shares\nOur memorandum and articles of association authorizes our board of directors to issue additional ordinary shares from authorized but unissued\nshares, to the extent available, from time to time as our board of directors shall determine.\nDifferences in Corporate Law\nThe BVI Business Companies Act and the laws of the British Virgin Islands affecting British Virgin Islands companies like us and our\nshareholders differ from laws applicable to U.S. corporations and their shareholders. Set forth below is a summary of the material differences between the\nprovisions of the laws of the British Virgin Islands applicable to us and the laws applicable to companies incorporated in the United States and their\nshareholders.\nMergers and similar arrangements\nUnder the laws of the British Virgin Islands, two or more companies may merge or consolidate in accordance with Section 170 of the BVI\nBusiness Companies Act. A merger means the merging of two or more constituent companies into one of the constituent companies and a consolidation\nmeans the uniting of two or more constituent companies into a new company. In order to merge or consolidate, the directors of each constituent company\nmust approve a written plan of merger or consolidation, which must be authorized by a resolution of shareholders.\nWhile a director may vote on the plan of merger or consolidation even if he has a financial interest in the plan, the interested director must disclose\nthe interest to all other directors of the company promptly upon becoming aware of the fact that he is interested in a transaction entered into or to be entered\ninto by the company.\nA transaction entered into by our company in respect of which a director is interested (including a merger or consolidation) is voidable by us\nunless the director’s interest was (a) disclosed to the board prior to the transaction or (b) the transaction is (i) between the director and the company and (ii)\nthe transaction is in the ordinary course of the company’s business and on usual terms and conditions.\nNotwithstanding the above, a transaction entered into by the company is not voidable if the material facts of the interest are known to the\nshareholders and they approve or ratify it or the company received fair value for the transaction.\nShareholders not otherwise entitled to vote on the merger or consolidation may still acquire the right to vote if the plan of merger or consolidation\ncontains any provision which, if proposed as an amendment to the memorandum or articles of association, would entitle them to vote as a class or series on\nthe proposed amendment. In any event, all shareholders must be given a copy of the plan of merger or consolidation irrespective of whether they are\nentitled to vote at the meeting to approve the plan of merger or consolidation.\nThe shareholders of the constituent companies are not required to receive shares of the surviving or consolidated company but may receive debt\nobligations or other securities of the surviving or consolidated company, other assets, or a combination thereof. Further, some or all of the shares of a class\nor series may be converted into a kind of asset while the other shares of the same class or series may receive a different kind of asset. As such, not all the\nshares of a class or series must receive the same kind of consideration.\nAfter the plan of merger or consolidation has been approved by the directors and authorized by a resolution of the shareholders, articles of merger\nor consolidation are executed by each company and filed with the Registrar of Corporate Affairs in the British Virgin Islands.\nA shareholder may dissent from a mandatory redemption of his shares, an arrangement (if permitted by the court), a merger (unless the\nshareholder was a shareholder of the surviving company prior to the merger and continues to hold the same or similar shares after the merger) or a\nconsolidation. A shareholder properly exercising his dissent rights is entitled to a cash payment equal to the fair value of his shares.\nA shareholder dissenting from a merger or consolidation must object in writing to the merger or consolidation before the vote by the shareholders\non the merger or consolidation, unless notice of the meeting was not given to the shareholder. If the merger or consolidation is approved by the\nshareholders, the company must give notice of this fact to each shareholder within 20 days who gave written objection. These shareholders then have 20\ndays to give to the company their written election in the form specified by the BVI Business Companies Act to dissent from the merger or consolidation,\nprovided that in the case of a merger, the 20 days starts when the plan of merger is delivered to the shareholder.\nUpon giving notice of his election to dissent, a shareholder ceases to have any shareholder rights except the right to be paid the fair value of his\nshares. As such, the merger or consolidation may proceed in the ordinary course notwithstanding his dissent.\nWithin seven days of the later of the delivery of the notice of election to dissent and the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the company\nmust make a written offer to each dissenting shareholder to purchase his shares at a specified price per share that the company determines to be the fair\nvalue of the shares. The company and the shareholder then have 30 days to agree upon the price. If the company and a shareholder fail to agree on the price\nwithin the 30 days, then the company and the shareholder shall, within 20 days immediately following the expiration of the 30-day period, each designate\nan appraiser and these two appraisers shall designate a third appraiser. These three appraisers shall fix the fair value of the shares as of the close of business\non the day prior to the shareholders’ approval of the transaction without taking into account any change in value as a result of the transaction.\nShareholders’ suits\nThere are both statutory and common law remedies available to our shareholders as a matter of British Virgin Islands law. These are summarized\nbelow:\nPrejudiced members\nA shareholder who considers that the affairs of the company have been, are being, or are likely to be, conducted in a manner that is, or any act or\nacts of the company have been, or are, likely to be oppressive, unfairly discriminatory or unfairly prejudicial to him in that capacity, can apply to the court\nunder Section 184I of the BVI Business Companies Act, inter alia, for an order that his shares be acquired, that he be provided compensation, that the Court\nregulate the future conduct of the company, or that any decision of the company which contravenes the BVI Business Companies Act or our memorandum\nand articles of association be set aside.\nDerivative actions\nSection 184C of the BVI Business Companies Act provides that a shareholder of a company may, with the leave of the Court, bring an action in\nthe name of the company to redress any wrong done to it.\nJust and equitable winding up\nIn addition to the statutory remedies outlined above, shareholders can also petition for the winding up of a company on the grounds that it is just\nand equitable for the court to so order. Save in exceptional circumstances, this remedy is only available where the company has been operated as a quasi\npartnership and trust and confidence between the partners has broken down.\nIndemnification of directors and executive officers and limitation of liability\nBritish Virgin Islands law does not limit the extent to which a company’s articles of association may provide for indemnification of officers and\ndirectors, except to the extent any provision providing indemnification may be held by the British Virgin Islands courts to be contrary to public policy, such\nas to provide indemnification against civil fraud or the consequences of committing a crime.\nUnder our memorandum and articles of association, we indemnify against all expenses, including legal fees, and against all judgments, fines and\namounts paid in settlement and reasonably incurred in connection with legal, administrative or investigative proceedings for any person who:\n● is or was a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed proceedings, whether civil, criminal, administrative or\ninvestigative, by reason of the fact that the person is or was our director; or\n● is or was, at our request, serving as a director or officer of, or in any other capacity is or was acting for, another body corporate or a partnership, joint\nventure, trust or other enterprise.\nThese indemnities only apply if the person acted honestly and in good faith with a view to our best interests and, in the case of criminal\nproceedings, the person had no reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. This standard of conduct is generally the same as permitted\nunder the Delaware General Corporation Law for a Delaware corporation.\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers or persons controlling us under\nthe foregoing provisions, we have been advised that in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities\nAct and is therefore unenforceable.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our memorandum and articles of association\nSome provisions of our memorandum and articles of association may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or\nmanagement that shareholders may consider favorable, including provisions that provide for a staggered board of directors and prevent shareholders from\ntaking an action by written consent in lieu of a meeting. However, under British Virgin Islands law, our directors may only exercise the rights and powers\ngranted to them under our memorandum and articles of association, as amended and restated from time to time, as they believe in good faith to be in the\nbest interests of our company.\nDirectors’ fiduciary duties\nUnder Delaware corporate law, a director of a Delaware corporation has a fiduciary duty to the corporation and its shareholders. This duty has two\ncomponents: the duty of care and the duty of loyalty. The duty of care requires that a director act in good faith, with the care that an ordinarily prudent\nperson would exercise under similar circumstances. Under this duty, a director must inform himself of, and disclose to shareholders, all material\ninformation reasonably available regarding a transaction that is material to the company. The duty of loyalty requires that a director act in a manner he\nreasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation. He must not use his corporate position for personal gain or advantage. This duty prohibits\nself-dealing by a director and mandates that the best interest of the corporation and its shareholders take precedence over any interest possessed by a\ndirector, officer or controlling shareholder and not shared by the shareholders generally. In general, actions of a director are presumed to have been made\non an informed basis, in good faith and in the honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the corporation. However, this presumption may\nbe rebutted by evidence of a breach of one of the fiduciary duties. Should such evidence be presented concerning a transaction by a director, a director must\nprove the procedural fairness of the transaction and that the transaction was of fair value to the corporation.\nUnder British Virgin Islands law, our directors owe the company certain statutory and fiduciary duties including, among others, a duty to act\nhonestly, in good faith, for a proper purpose and with a view to what the directors believe to be in the best interests of the company. Our directors are also\nrequired, when exercising powers or performing duties as a director, to exercise the care, diligence and skill that a reasonable director would exercise in\ncomparable circumstances, taking into account without limitation, the nature of the company, the nature of the decision and the position of the director and\nthe nature of the responsibilities undertaken. In the exercise of their powers, our directors must ensure neither they nor the company acts in a manner which\ncontravenes the BVI Business Companies Act or our memorandum and articles of association, as amended and re-stated from time to time. A shareholder\nhas the right to seek damages for breaches of duties owed to us by our directors.\nShareholder action by written consent\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, a corporation may eliminate the right of shareholders to act by written consent by amendment to its\ncertificate of incorporation. British Virgin Islands law provides that shareholders may approve corporate matters by way of a written resolution without a\nmeeting signed by or on behalf of shareholders sufficient to constitute the requisite majority of shareholders who would have been entitled to vote on such\nmatter at a general meeting; provided that if the consent is less than unanimous, notice must be given to all non-consenting shareholders. Our memorandum\nand articles of association permit shareholders to act by written consent.\nShareholder proposals\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, a shareholder has the right to put any proposal before the annual meeting of shareholders, provided\nit complies with the notice provisions in the governing documents. A special meeting may be called by the board of directors or any other person authorized\nto do so in the governing documents, but shareholders may be precluded from calling special meetings. British Virgin Islands law and our memorandum\nand articles of association allow our shareholders holding not less than 30% of the votes of the outstanding voting shares to requisition a shareholders’\nmeeting. We are not obliged by law to call shareholders’ annual general meetings, but our memorandum and articles of association do permit the directors\nto call such a meeting. The location of any shareholders’ meeting can be determined by the board of directors and can be held anywhere in the world.\nCumulative voting\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, cumulative voting for elections of directors is not permitted unless the corporation’s certificate of\nincorporation specifically provides for it. Cumulative voting potentially facilitates the representation of minority shareholders on a board of directors since\nit permits the minority shareholder to cast all the votes to which the shareholder is entitled on a single director, which increases the shareholder’s voting\npower with respect to electing such director. As permitted under British Virgin Islands law, our memorandum and articles of association do not provide for\ncumulative voting. As a result, our shareholders are not afforded any less protections or rights on this issue than shareholders of a Delaware corporation.\nRemoval of directors\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, a director of a corporation with a classified board may be removed only for cause with the approval\nof a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote, unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. Under our memorandum and articles of\nassociation, directors can be removed from office, with cause, by a resolution of shareholders or by a resolution of directors passed at a meeting of directors\ncalled for the purpose of removing the director or for purposes including the removal of the director.\nTransactions with interested shareholders\nThe Delaware General Corporation Law contains a business combination statute applicable to Delaware public corporations whereby, unless the\ncorporation has specifically elected not to be governed by such statute by amendment to its certificate of incorporation, it is prohibited from engaging in\ncertain business combinations with an “interested shareholder” for three years following the date that such person becomes an interested shareholder. An\ninterested shareholder generally is a person or group who or which owns or owned 15% or more of the target’s outstanding voting shares within the past\nthree years. This has the effect of limiting the ability of a potential acquirer to make a two-tiered bid for the target in which all shareholders would not be\ntreated equally. The statute does not apply if, among other things, prior to the date on which such shareholder becomes an interested shareholder, the board\nof directors approves either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the person becoming an interested shareholder. This encourages\nany potential acquirer of a Delaware public corporation to negotiate the terms of any acquisition transaction with the target’s board of directors. British\nVirgin Islands law has no comparable statute.\nDissolution; Winding Up\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, unless the board of directors approves the proposal to dissolve, dissolution must be approved by\nshareholders holding 100% of the total voting power of the corporation. Only if the dissolution is initiated by the board of directors may it be approved by a\nsimple majority of the corporation’s outstanding shares. Delaware law allows a Delaware corporation to include in its certificate of incorporation a\nsupermajority voting requirement in connection with dissolutions initiated by the board. Under the BVI Business Companies Act and our memorandum and\narticles of association, we may appoint a voluntary liquidator by a resolution of the shareholders or by resolution of directors.\nVariation of rights of shares\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, a corporation may vary the rights of a class of shares with the approval of a majority of the\noutstanding shares of such class, unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. Under our memorandum and articles of association, if at any\ntime our shares are divided into different classes of shares, the rights attached to any class may only be varied, whether or not our company is in\nliquidation, with the consent in writing of or by a resolution passed at a meeting by the holders of not less than 50 percent of the issued shares in that class.\nAmendment of governing documents\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, a corporation’s governing documents may be amended with the approval of a majority of the\noutstanding shares entitled to vote, unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. As permitted by British Virgin Islands law, our memorandum\nand articles of association may be amended by a resolution of shareholders and, subject to certain exceptions, by a resolution of directors. Any amendment\nis effective from the date it is registered at the Registry of Corporate Affairs in the British Virgin Islands.\nExhibit 8.1\nSUBSIDIARIES OF THE REGISTRANT\nSubsidiary Jurisdiction of incorporation\nABit Hong Kong Limited (formerly known as Woodland Corporation Limited) Hong Kong SAR, People’s Republic of\nChina\nABit USA, Inc.

We agree with the statements\nconcerning our Firm contained therein.\nVery truly yours,\n/s/Centurion ZD & Co.\nHong Kong\nAttachment\nATTACHMENT - CHANGE IN REGISTRANT’S CERTIFYING ACCOUNTANT\nEffective June 30, 2022, the Registrant has appointed Audit Alliance LLP (“Audit Alliance”) as its independent registered public accounting firm\nfor the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 and accepted the resignation of the Registrant’s previous independent auditor, Centurion ZD & Co.\n(“Centurion”), effective on the same date. Audit Alliance is headquartered in Singapore and will be subject to the inspections by the Public Company\nAccounting Oversight Board of the United States. The appointment of Audit Alliance was made after careful consideration and evaluation by the Registrant\nand has been approved by the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors of the Registrant.\nDuring the Registrant’s two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 and September 30, 2020, through the resignation of\nCenturion on June 30, 2022, there were no disagreements between the Registrant or its predecessor, Moxian, Inc., and Centurion on any matter of\naccounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of\nCenturion, would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in connection with its report on the Registrant’s or its\npredecessor’s consolidated financial statements for such periods. In addition, Centurion’s reports on the financial statements as of and for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020 and September 30, 2020 did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to\nuncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 and September 30, 2020 through the\nresignation of Centurion on June 30, 2022, there were no “reportable events” as that term is defined in Item 16F(a)(1)(v) of Form 20-F.\nDuring the two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 and September 30, 2020 and any subsequent interim period prior to\nengaging Audit Alliance, neither the Registrant nor anyone on its behalf consulted Audit Alliance regarding either (i) the application of accounting\nprinciples to any proposed or completed transaction, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Registrant’s financial statements, and neither\na written report nor oral advice was provided to the Registrant that Audit Alliance concluded was an important factor considered by the Registrant in\nreaching a decision as to any accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement (as defined in\nItem 16F(a)(1)(iv) of Form 20-F and the related instructions to Item 16F of Form 20-F) or a reportable event."

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial\nstatements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion\ncontains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the\nforward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this report.\nA. Results of Operations\nResults of Operations for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2022 and 2021\nThe following table summarizes the results of our operations during the six months ended June 30, 2022 with comparatives for the corresponding period\nended June 30, 2021. The Company was incorporated in May 2021 and completed a merger with its predecessor company, Moxian, Inc in August 2021.\nThe predecessor company had its financial year end of September 30 so the results for the corresponding period of six months to June 2021 have been\nobtained by combining the results of the first two quarters of 2021. The figures for the two periods are, therefore, not strictly comparable.\nFor the\nSix Months Ended\nJune 30,\n2022 2021\nRevenue $ 40,422 $ 216,979\nDirect costs of revenue\n(15,377) -\nOther operating costs (161,540) -\nTotal operating costs (176,917) -\nLoss/profit from operations (136,495) 216,979\nGeneral and administrative expenses (785,579) (2,074,528)\nOther income (net) - 291,923\nLoss for the period (922,074) (1,626,898)\nBusiness Overview of the Digital Asset Mining Business\nIn the beginning of the period ended June 30, 2022, the Company began to ship the miners from China to the United States after having refurhished the\nminers in Shenzhen, China to ensure their resilience during transport and operability upon arrival. These miners are securely packaged and shipped by sea.\nFrom the end of March 2022, we began progressively our bitcoin mining operations in the State of Georgia and Buffalo in the State of New York.\nOur digital asset mining operations, hosted by third party providers, use specialized computers, known as miners, to generate bitcoin, a digital asset. The\nminers use application specific integrated circuit (“ASIC”) chips. These chips enable the miners to apply greater computational power, or “hash rate”, to\nprovide transaction verification services (known as “solving a block”) which helps support the bitcoin blockchain. For every block added, the bitcoin\nblockchain awards a bitcoin award equal to a set number of bitcoins per block. Miners with a greater hash rate have a higher chance of solving a block and\nreceiving a bitcoin award.\nThe Company works with third party hosting partners. These partners operate specialized mining data centres, where they install and operate our miners\nand provide IT consulting, maintenance, and repair work on-site for us.\nThe primary intent behind operating our mining business is the accumulation of bitcoins, which we may sell for fiat currency from time to time depending\non market conditions and management’s determination of our cash flow needs. Given bitcoins finite supply, our target is to mine as many bitcoins as\nquickly as possible.\nDuring the period of six months ended June 30, 2022, we had 3,883 miners for bitcoin mining.\nUnfortunately, because of the fall of the value of bitcoins during this period, our fleet remained largely offline as it was unprofitable to mine given the high\nelectricity costs.\nOur fleet of owned miners comprise the following models:\nOwned as of\nJune 30,\nModel 2022\nBitmain Antminer S17 305\ntmain Antminer T17+ 520\nBitmain Antminer T3 70\nMicroBT Whatsminer M21S 1112\nMicroBT Whatsminer M20S 493\nMicroBT Whatsminer M10 249\nBitmain Antminer S19 Pro 8\nInnosilicon T2T 1024\nTaurus 2\nMicroBT Whatsminer M21S 100\nTotal Miners 3,883\nThe comparatives for the previous corresponding period relate to that of the predecessor company, Moxian Inc., which was involved in media advertising\nthrough its wholly-owned subsidiaries in the People’s Republic of China. These comparatives are not strictly comparable because both the industry and the\nsupporting infrastructural costs are totally different. No useful analysis could be obtained by comparing the financials of the two different periods.\nThe Company is in a relatively sound financial base as the recurrent overheads are well within control.

Organization and nature of operations\nThe Company was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands (BVI) on May 18, 2021. On August 17, 2021, the Company completed a redomicile merger\nwith its predecessor company, Moxian, Inc, wherein it acquired all the assets, liabilities, rights, obligations and operations of the latter and its subsidiaries,\nthrough an exchange of an identical number of shares.\nOn December 28, 2021 in a Special Meeting of shareholders, the Company approved the issue of up to 20 million new ordinary shares of the Company, at a\nprice of $2.50 per share to certain non-US based accredited investors. On February 11, 2022 the Company completed this private placement and issued 16\nmillion new shares, raising $40 million, which it has used in bitcoin mining in order to diversify its business operations. Of the issue proceeds, $29.8\nmillion was used to purchase relevant equipment and the balance will be used as working capital.\nOn March 5, 2022 a number of machines were installed and operational at a site near Buffalo in New York State, USA and progressively, other sites will be\nidentified and the purchased equipment put into operation.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the activities of the Company and each of the following entities:\nName of entity Background Ownership\nMoxian CN Group Limited Investment holding company 100% owned by Moxian (BVI) Inc\nMoxian Group Limited Investment holding company 100% owned by Moxian CN Group Limited\nMoxian (Hong Kong) Limited Investment holding company 100% owned by Moxian Group Limited\nMoxian Technology Services (Shenzhen) Co.

Summary of principal accounting policies\nBasis of presentation and consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in\nthe United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and include all the subsidiaries of the Group. The financial year-end of the Company is December 31 while\nthat of the predecessor company is September 30. The consolidated results are presented as of the period ended June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021. All\nintercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in the consolidation.\nThe following assets and liabilities of the VIE are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company as of June 30, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021.\nJune 30, 2022 December 31, 2021\nCurrent assets $ - $ -\nNon-current assets - -\nTotal assets $ - $ -\nCurrent liabilities $ - $ -\nNon-current liabilities - -\nTotal liabilities $ - $ -\nFair value of financial instruments\nThe Company follows the provisions of ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.” ASC 820 clarifies the definition of fair value, prescribes\nmethods for measuring fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:\nLevel 1-Observable inputs such as unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date.\nLevel 2-Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and\nliabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market\ndata.\nLevel 3-Inputs are unobservable inputs that reflect management’s assumptions based on the best available information.\nThe carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, prepayments, deposits and other receivables, accruals and other payables, loans from related parties and\nunrelated party approximate their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments.\nF-6\nMOXIAN (BVI) INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n2. Summary of principal accounting policies (continued)\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the accompanying consolidated\nfinancial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates required to be made by\nmanagement include but not limited to, useful lives of property and equipment, provision for doubtful accounts, intangible assets valuation, inventory\nvaluation, value added recoverable valuation and deferred tax assets valuation. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash includes cash on hand and demand deposits in accounts maintained with commercial banks. The Company considers all highly liquid investment\ninstruments with an original maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.\nThe Company considers all short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and have original maturities of three\nmonths or less to be cash equivalents.\nPrepayments, deposits and other receivables\nPrepayments and deposits represent amounts advanced to suppliers. The suppliers usually require advance payments or deposits when the Company makes\npurchase or orders service and the prepayments and deposits will be utilized to offset the Company’s future payments. Other receivables mainly consist of\nvarious cash advances to employees for business needs. These amounts are unsecured, non-interest bearing and generally short-term in nature.\nAllowances are recorded when utilization and collection of amounts due are in doubt. Delinquent prepayments, deposits and other receivables are written-\noff after management has determined that the likelihood of utilization or collection is not probable and known bad debts are written off against the\nallowances when identified.\nProperty and Equipment, net\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Significant additions or improvements extending useful lives\nof assets are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line\nmethod over the estimated useful lives as follows:\nElectronic equipment 3-6 years\nFurniture and fixtures 3-6 years\nLeasehold improvements Shorter of estimated useful life or term of lease\nIntangible assets, net\nIntangible assets, comprising Intellectual property rights (“IP rights”) and software, which are separable from property and equipment, are stated at cost\nless accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of 3- 10 years.\nF-7\nMOXIAN (BVI) INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nThe Company classifies its long-lived assets into: (i) computer and office equipment; (ii) furniture and fixtures, (iii) leasehold improvements, and (iv)\nfinite-lived intangible assets.\nLong-lived assets held and used by the Company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value\nof such assets may not be fully recoverable. It is possible that these assets could become impaired as a result of technology, economy or other industry\nchanges. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group to be tested for possible impairment, the Company first compares undiscounted cash\nflows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset or asset group is not\nrecoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Fair value is\ndetermined through various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models, relief from royalty income approach, quoted market values and\nthird-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary.\nThe Company makes various assumptions and estimates regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair values of the\nrespective assets. The assumptions and estimates used to determine future values and remaining useful lives of long-lived assets are complex and\nsubjective. They can be affected by various factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as the\nCompany’s business strategy and its forecasts for specific market expansion.\nDue to the continuing losses from operations with minimal revenues, the Company recognized impairment losses of $3,009,732 for the IP rights and other\nintangible assets during the year ended September 30, 2017 resulting in the IP rights and other intangible assets having a nil value as of June 30, 2022 and\nJune 30, 2021.\nDigital assets\nDigital assets (including USDC) are included in current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Digital assets purchased are recorded at\ncost and digital assets awarded to the Company through its mining activities are accounted for in connection with the Company’s revenue recognition\npolicy disclosed below.\nDigital assets held are accounted for as intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized but\nassessed for impairment annually, or more frequently, when events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that it is more likely than not that the\nindefinite-lived asset is impaired. Impairment exists when the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, which is measured using the quoted price of the\ndigital assets at the time its fair value is being measured. In testing for impairment, the Company has the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to\ndetermine whether it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. If it is determined that it is not more likely than not that an impairment exists, a\nquantitative impairment test is not necessary. If the Company concludes otherwise, it is required to perform a quantitative impairment test. To the extent an\nimpairment loss is recognized, the loss establishes the new cost basis of the asset. Subsequent reversal of impairment losses is not permitted.\nPurchases of digital assets by the Company, if any, will be included within investing activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows,\nwhile digital assets awarded to the Company through its mining activities are included within operating activities on the accompanying consolidated\nstatements of cash flows. The sales of digital assets are included within investing activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows and\nany realized gains or losses from such sales are included in “realized gain (loss) on exchange of digital assets” in the consolidated statements of operations\nand comprehensive income (loss). The Company accounts for its gains or losses in accordance with the first-in first-out method of accounting.\nRevenue recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”).\nTo determine revenue recognition for contracts with customers, the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract with the customer,\n(ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, including variable consideration to the extent that it is probable\nthat a significant future reversal will not occur, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the respective performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize\nrevenue when (or as) the Company satisfies the performance obligation.\nIncome taxes\nThe Company utilizes ASC Topic 740 (“ASC 740”) “Income taxes”, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected\nfuture tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred income taxes\nare recognized for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at\neach period end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.\nValuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nASC 740 “Income taxes” clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. This interpretation requires that an entity recognizes in the financial\nstatements the impact of a tax position, if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the\nposition. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or\nmeasurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company has elected to classify interest and penalties related to\nunrecognized tax benefits, if and when required, as part of income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company evaluate the\nlevel of authority for each uncertain tax position (including the potential application of interest and penalties) based on the technical merits, and measure\nthe unrecognized benefits associated with the tax positions. As of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2020 the Company did not have any unrecognized\ntax benefits. The Company does not anticipate any significant increase to its liability for unrecognized tax benefit within the next 12 months.\nAs of June 30, 2022, the tax years ended December 31, 2011 through to December 31, 2020 for the Company’s PRC entities remain open for statutory\nexamination by the PRC tax authorities.\nF-8\nMOXIAN (BVI) INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nForeign currency transactions and translation\nThe reporting currency of the Company is United States Dollars (the “USD”) and the functional currency of the PRC subsidiaries is the Renminbi\n(“RMB”).The functional currency of Moxian HK is Hong Kong Dollar (the “HKD”), and the functional currency of Moxian Malaysia is Malaysia Ringgit\n(the “RM”).\nFor financial reporting purposes, the financial statements of the various subsidiaries are prepared using their respective functional currencies, e translated\ninto the reporting currency, USD so to be consolidated with the Company’s. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the\nreporting currency are translated into the reporting currency at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated\nusing average rates prevailing during the reporting period. Adjustments resulting from the translation are recorded as a separate component of accumulated\nother comprehensive income in stockholders’ deficiency. Translation losses are recognized in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nThe exchange rates applied are as follows:\nBalance sheet items, except for equity accounts June 30, 2022 December 31, 2021\nRMB:USD 6,6995 6,3559\nHKD:USD 7,8473 7,7992\nRM:USD 4,4075 4,1765\nItems in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss, and statements cash flows:\nJune 30, 2022 June 30, 2021\nRMB:USD 6,4783 6,4581\nHKD:USD 7,8257 7,7653\nEarnings per share\nBasic gain per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period while the effects of potential common\nshares outstanding during the period are included in diluted earnings per share.\nFASB Accounting Standard Codification Topic 260 (“ASC 260”), “Earnings Per Share,” requires that employee equity share options, non-vested shares and\nsimilar equity instruments granted to employees be treated as potential common shares in computing diluted earnings per share. Diluted earnings per share\nshould be based on the actual number of options or shares granted and not yet forfeited, unless doing so would be anti-dilutive. The Company uses the\n“treasury stock” method for equity instruments granted in share-based payment transactions provided in ASC 260 to determine diluted earnings per share.\nAntidilutive securities represent potentially dilutive securities which are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings or loss per share as their impact\nwas antidilutive.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic\n740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (“ASU 2019-12”). ASU 2019-12 simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain\nexceptions and enhances and simplifies various aspects of the income tax accounting guidance in ASC 740. ASU 2019-12 was effective January 1, 2021.\nThe adoption of ASU 2019-12 did not have any impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statement presentation or disclosures.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt — Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—\nContracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity (“ASU 2020-06”).\nASU 2020-06 simplifies the accounting for convertible debt by eliminating the beneficial conversion and cash conversion accounting models. Upon\nadoption of ASU 2020-06, convertible debt proceeds, unless issued with a substantial premium or an embedded conversion feature that is not clearly and\nclosely related to the host contract, will no longer be allocated between debt and equity components. This modification will reduce the issue discount and\nresult in less non-cash interest expense in financial statements. ASU 2020-06 also updates the earnings per share calculation and requires entities to assume\nshare settlement when the convertible debt can be settled in cash or shares. For contracts in an entity’s own equity, the type of contracts primarily affected\nby ASU 2020-06 are freestanding and embedded features that are accounted for as derivatives under the current guidance due to a failure to meet the\nsettlement assessment by removing the requirements to (i) consider whether the contract would be settled in registered shares, (ii) consider whether\ncollateral is required to be posted, and (iii) assess shareholder rights. ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. Early\nadoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and only if adopted as of the beginning of such fiscal year. The\nCompany adopted ASU 2020-06 effective January 1, 2021. The adoption of ASU 2020-06 did not have any impact on the Company’s consolidated\nfinancial statement presentation or disclosures.\nF-9\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) (“ASU 2016-13”), which requires entities to measure\nall expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable\nforecasts. ASU 2016-13 replaces the existing incurred loss model and is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at\namortized cost. ASU 2016-13 is to be adopted on a modified retrospective basis. As a smaller reporting company, ASU 2016-13 will be effective for the\nCompany for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption\nof ASU 2016-13 will have on its consolidated financial statement presentations and disclosures.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (Topic 350), Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment (“ASU\n2017-04”). ASU 2017-04 eliminates Step 2 of the two-step goodwill impairment test, under which a goodwill impairment loss was measured by comparing\nthe implied fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. ASU 2017-04 requires only a one-step quantitative\nimpairment test, whereby a goodwill impairment loss is measured as the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value (not to exceed the\ntotal goodwill allocated to that reporting unit). Adoption of the ASUs is on a modified retrospective basis. As a smaller reporting company, the standard\nwill be effective for the Company for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company is currently evaluating the\nimpact that the adoption of ASU 2017-04 will have on its consolidated financial statement presentation or disclosures.\nIn May 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-04, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt — Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50),\nCompensation — Stock Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives and Hedging — Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Issuer’s\nAccounting for Certain Modifications or Exchanges of Freestanding Equity-Classified Written Call Options (“ASU 2021-04”). ASU 2021-04 provides\nguidance as to how an issuer should account for a modification of the terms or conditions or an exchange of a freestanding equity-classified written call\noption (i.e., a warrant) that remains classified after modification or exchange as an exchange of the original instrument for a new instrument. An issuer\nshould measure the effect of a modification or exchange as the difference between the fair value of the modified or exchanged warrant and the fair value of\nthat warrant immediately before modification or exchange and then apply a recognition model that comprises four categories of transactions and the\ncorresponding accounting treatment for each category (equity issuance, debt origination, debt modification, and modifications unrelated to equity issuance\nand debt origination or modification). ASU 2021-04 is effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim\nperiods within those fiscal years. An entity should apply the guidance provided in ASU 2021-04 prospectively to modifications or exchanges occurring on\nor after the effective date. Early adoption is permitted for all entities, including adoption in an interim period. If an entity elects to early adopt ASU 2021-\n04 in an interim period, the guidance should be applied as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. The adoption of ASU 2021-\n04 is not expected to have any impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statement presentation or disclosures.\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance.\nThis update requires certain annual disclosures about transactions with a government that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting\nmodel by analogy. This update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021, and early application is permitted. This guidance should\nbe applied either prospectively to all transactions that are reflected in financial statements at the date of initial application and new transactions that are\nentered into after the date of initial application or retrospectively to those transactions. The Company does not expect the impact of this guidance to have a\nmaterial impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company’s management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, authoritative guidance, if currently adopted, would have\na material impact on the Company’s financial statement presentation or disclosures.\nF-10\nMOXIAN (BVI) INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n3.

As the Company has a September 30 fiscal year-end, the lower corporate income tax\nrate will be phased in, resulting in a U.S. statutory federal rate of approximately 24.5% for our fiscal year ending September 30, 2018, and 21% for\nsubsequent fiscal years. Accordingly, we have to remeasure our deferred tax assets on net operating loss carryforward in the U.S. at the lower enacted\ncooperated tax rate of 21%. However, this re-measurement has no effect on the Company’s income tax expenses as the Company has provided a 100%\nvaluation allowance on its deferred tax assets previously.\nAdditionally, the Tax Act imposes a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of historical earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and future foreign earnings\nare subject to U.S. taxation. The change in rate has caused us to remeasure all U.S. deferred income tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences and\nnet operating loss (NOL) carryforwards and recorded a one-time income tax payable in 8 years.\nBritish Virgin Islands\nMoxian BVI is incorporated in the British Virgin Islands.

Our digital asset mining operations,\nhosted by third party providers, use specialized computers, known as miners, to generate bitcoin, a digital asset. The Company works with third party\nhosting partners who operate specialized mining data centres and provide IT consulting, maintenance, and repair work on-site for us.\nThe primary intent behind operating our mining business is the accumulation of bitcoins, which we may sell for fiat currency from time to time depending\non market conditions and management’s determination of our cash flow needs. Given bitcoins finite supply, our target is to mine as many bitcoins as\nquickly as possible. Unfortunately, because of the fall of the value of bitcoins during this period, our fleet remained largely offline as it was unprofitable to\nmine given the high electricity costs.\nThe Company is in a relatively sound financial base as the recurrent overheads are well within control. Once bitcoin mining resumes because of higher\nmarket prices, the Company is hopeful that its outlook will be steady.\nAbout Moxian (BVI) Inc\nMoxian (BVI) Inc, a company organized in the British Virgin Islands in May 2021, is the surviving company following its merger with Moxian, Inc. in\nAugust 2021.

IDENTITY OF DIRECTORS, SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND ADVISERS\nNot Applicable for annual reports on Form 20-F.\nITEM 2. OFFER STATISTICS AND EXPECTED TIMETABLE\nNot Applicable for annual reports on Form 20-F.\n1\nITEM 3. KEY INFORMATION\nOur Corporate Structure and the Operations of Our PRC Subsidiaries\nMoxian (BVI) Inc, or Moxian BVI, is not a PRC operating company but a British Virgin Islands holding company with operations primarily\nconducted through its operating subsidiaries located in China and the United States. During the 2019, 2020 and 2021 fiscal years, substantially all of the\nbusiness operations were conducted in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC” or “China”) by our PRC subsidiaries. None of our PRC subsidiaries operates\nwith a variable interest entity (“VIE”) structure, but Chinese regulatory authorities could disallow our current operating structure, which would likely result\nin a material change in our operations and/or cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or become worthless. See “Item 3. Key Information\n—D. Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Doing Business in China — The Chinese government may intervene or influence our operations at any time, or may\nexert more control over offerings conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in China-based issuers, which could result in a material change in our\noperations and/or cause the value of our securities to significantly decline or be worthless.”\nWe face significant legal and operational risks and uncertainties relating to our subsidiaries’ operations in China. The Chinese government may\nintervene or influence the operation of our PRC subsidiaries and exercise significant oversight and discretion over the conduct of their business and may\nintervene in or influence their operations at any time, or may exert more control over securities offerings conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in\nChina-based issuers, which could result in a material change in operations of our PRC subsidiaries and/or the value of our common stock. Further, any\nactions by the Chinese government to exert more oversight and control over offerings that are conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in China-based\nissuers could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to\nsignificantly decline or be worthless. Recently, the PRC government initiated a series of regulatory actions and statements to regulate business operations in\nChina with little advance notice, including cracking down on illegal activities in the securities market, adopting new measures to extend the scope of\ncybersecurity reviews, and expanding the efforts in anti-monopoly enforcement. We do not believe that we are directly subject to these regulatory actions or\nstatements, as we do not have a variable interest entity structure and our operations are not subject to cybersecurity review requirements, or involve any\nother type of restricted industry. In addition, starting from the first quarter of 2022, we have changed our primary business operations from digital\nadvertising in China to bitcoin mining operations in the United States. Because these PRC government statements and regulatory actions are new, it is\nhighly uncertain how soon legislative or administrative regulation making bodies in China will respond to them, or what existing or new laws or\nregulations will be modified or promulgated, if any, or the potential impact such modified or new laws and regulations will have on our daily business\noperations or our ability to accept foreign investments and list on an U.S. exchange.\nPermissions Required from the PRC Authorities for Our Operations and Issuance of Securities\nWe conduct our business primarily through our subsidiaries, including our PRC subsidiaries in China. Our operations in China are governed by\nPRC laws and regulations. Our digital advertising business operations are conducted by Moxian Technology Services (Beijing) Co. Ltd. (“Moxian\nBeijing”). Moxian Beijing is required to obtain a Business License and has obtained such license. The remaining subsidiaries have not been in active\noperations and are not currently required to obtain a license or permit from the government authorities. However, given the uncertainties of interpretation\nand implementation of relevant laws and regulations and the enforcement practice by government authorities, we cannot assure you that we have obtained\nall the permits or licenses required by the PRC government authorities for conducting our business in China. We may be required to obtain additional\nlicenses, permits, filings or approvals for the functions and services in our business operations in the future. For more detailed information, see “Item 3.\nKey Information—D. Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Doing Business in China—We may be adversely affected by the complexity, uncertainties and\nchanges in PRC regulation of internet- related or finance-related businesses and companies, and any lack of requisite approvals, licenses, permits or filings\napplicable to our business may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.”\nFurthermore, we are subject to PRC rules and regulations relating to overseas listing and securities offering, and a substantial extension of the\nPRC government’s oversight over our business operations or overseas listings may hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer our securities. Under\ncurrent PRC laws, regulations and regulatory rules, we, our PRC subsidiaries may be required to obtain permissions from the China Securities Regulatory\nCommission, or the CSRC in connection with any future offering and listing on overseas capital markets.\n2\nOn June 10, 2021, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress of China promulgated the Data Security Law which took effect on\nSeptember 1, 2021. The Data Security Law provides for data security and privacy obligations of entities and individuals carrying out data activities,\nprohibits entities and individuals in China from providing any foreign judicial or law enforcement authority with any data stored in China without approval\nfrom the competent PRC authority, and sets forth the legal liabilities of entities and individuals found to be in violation of their data protection obligations,\nincluding rectification order, warning, fines of up to RMB10 million, suspension of relevant business, and revocation of business permits or licenses. The\nData Security Law is relatively new, and therefore there are substantial uncertainties with respect to the interpretation and implementation of the law. We\nmay need to adjust our operations to comply with data security requirements from time to time. If we were found to have violations, we may be ordered to\nrectify and terminate any actions that are deemed illegal by the government authorities and become subject to fines and other government sanctions, which\nmay materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOn July 6, 2021, the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the General Office of the State Council jointly\nissued the Opinions on Severe and Lawful Crackdown on Illegal Securities Activities, which took effect on the same day. These opinions emphasized the\nneed to strengthen the administration over illegal securities activities and the supervision on overseas listings by China-based companies. These opinions\nproposed to take effective measures, such as promoting the construction of relevant regulatory systems, to deal with the risks and incidents facing China-\nbased overseas-listed companies and the demand for cybersecurity and data privacy protection. As of the date of this report, no official guidance and related\nimplementation rules have been issued in relation to these recently issued opinions and the interpretation and implementation of these opinions remain\nunclear at this stage.\nOn July 10, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China and other regulatory agencies issued the Revised Measures for Cybersecurity Review\n(the “Revised Cybersecurity Measures”), which was finalized in December 2021 and took effect on February 15, 2022. The Revised Cybersecurity\nMeasures authorize the relevant government authorities to conduct cybersecurity review on a range of activities that affect or may affect national security,\nincluding listings in foreign countries by companies that possess personal data of more than one million users. The PRC National Security Law covers\nvarious types of national security, including technology security and information security. Given the nature of our business of digital advertising in China\nand the fact that none of our PRC subsidiaries is an “internet platform operator,” or runs an App, we believe that we are not subject to a cybersecurity\nreview pursuant to the Revised Cybersecurity Measures.\nOn December 24, 2021, the CSRC issued Provisions of the State Council on the Administration of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by\nDomestic Companies (Draft for Comments) (the “Administration Provisions”), and the Provisions of the State Council on the Administrative Measures for\nthe Filing of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies (Draft for Comments) (the “Measures”). The Administration Provisions and\nMeasures for overseas listings lay out specific requirements for filing documents and include unified regulation management, strengthening regulatory\ncoordination, and cross-border regulatory cooperation. Domestic companies seeking to list abroad must carry out relevant security screening procedures if\ntheir businesses involve such supervision. Companies endangering national security are among those off-limits for overseas listings. According to Relevant\nOfficials of the CSRC Answered Reporter Questions (“CSRC Answers”), after the Administration Provisions and Measures are implemented upon\ncompletion of public consultation and due legislative procedures, the CSRC will formulate and issue guidance for filing procedures to further specify the\ndetails of filing administration and ensure that market entities could refer to clear guidelines for filing, which means it will still take time to put the\nAdministration Provisions and Measures into effect. As of the date of this report, the Administration Provisions and Measures have not yet come into effect.\nHowever, according to CSRC Answers, only new initial public offerings and financing by existing overseas listed Chinese companies will be required to go\nthrough the filing process; other overseas listed companies will be allowed sufficient transition period to complete their filing procedure. The Company\nmay be required to obtain approval of and filling with the CSRC or other PRC government authorities for its future financing. However, it is uncertain\nwhen the Administration Provision and the Measures will take effect or if they will take effect as currently drafted. Currently, the period for public\ncomment on these draft regulations has ended and their provisions and anticipated adoption or effective date are subject to changes and thus their\ninterpretation and implementation remain substantially uncertain. It also remains unclear on whether a US-listed company, like us, is subject to the CSRC\nfiling procedures, to maintain the listing of its securities in a foreign country. As of the date of this report, we cannot predict the impact of these regulations\non maintaining the listing status of our ordinary shares and/or other securities, or any of our future offerings of securities in the overseas markets.\n3\nBased on PRC laws and regulations effective as of the date of this report and subject to different interpretations of these laws and regulations that\nmay be adopted by PRC authorities, we believe that, as of the date of this report, we and our PRC subsidiaries are not required to obtain any permission\nfrom the CSRC, the CAC or any other PRC authority in connection with our securities offerings. As a result, we have not submitted any application to the\nCSRC, the CAC or other PRC authorities for the approval of our securities offerings. As of the date of this report, we and our PRC subsidiaries have not\nreceived any inquiry, notice, warning or objection in relation to our securities offerings from the CSRC, the CAC or any other PRC authorities. If we fail to\nobtain the relevant approval or complete other review or filing procedures for any future offshore offering or listing, we may face sanctions by the CSRC,\nCAC or other PRC regulatory authorities, which may include fines and penalties on our operations in China, limitations on our operating privileges in\nChina, restrictions on or prohibition of the payments or remittance of dividends by our PRC subsidiaries, restrictions on or delays to our future financing\ntransactions, or other actions that could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and\nprospects, as well as the trading price of our common shares. For more detailed information, see “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors—Risks\nRelating to Doing Business in China—The PRC government may intervene or influence our operations at any time, or may exert more control over\nofferings conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in China-based issuers, which could result in a material change in our operations and/or cause the\nvalue of our securities to significantly decline or be worthless.”\nCash and Other Assets Transfers within our Organization and Dividend Distribution\nCash may be transferred within our organization in the following manners: (i) Moxian BVI may transfer funds to our subsidiaries, including our PRC\nsubsidiaries, by way of capital contributions or loans, through intermediate holding companies or otherwise; (ii) we and our intermediate holding\nsubsidiaries may provide loans to our operating subsidiaries and vice versa; and (iii) our subsidiaries may make dividends or other distributions to us\nthrough intermediate holding companies or otherwise. As a holding company, Moxian BVI, may rely on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by\nour subsidiaries for our cash and liquidity requirements. As of the date of this report, none of our subsidiaries has made any dividends or other distributions\nto Moxian BVI, nor have we ever made a dividend or distribution to our shareholders.\nDuring the 2019, 2020 and 2021 fiscal years, no assets other than cash were transferred through our organization. Moxian BVI, through its\nintermediate holding companies, transferred approximately $3.1 million to its subsidiaries in China in fiscal year 2021.\nOur subsidiaries presently intend to retain any earnings to fund their operations and business expansions. We do not anticipate paying dividends or\nother distributions to our shareholders in the foreseeable future.\nThe Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act\nOur common shares may be prohibited from trading on a national exchange or “over-the-counter” markets under the HFCAA if the PCAOB determines it\nis unable to inspect or investigate completely our auditors for three consecutive years beginning in 2021. Further, on June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed\nthe Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (“AHFCAA”) and on February 4, 2022, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the\nAmerica Creating Opportunities for Manufacturing Pre-Eminence in Technology and Economic Strength (COMPETES) Act of 2022, or the COMPETES\nAct. If either the AHFCAA or COMPETES Act is enacted into law, it would amend the HFCAA and require the SEC to prohibit an issuer’s securities from\ntrading on any U.S. stock exchanges if its auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspections or complete investigations for two consecutive years instead of\nthree.\nPursuant to the HFCAA, the PCAOB issued a Determination Report on December 16, 2021 which found that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or\ninvestigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in: (1) mainland China and (2) Hong Kong. In addition, the PCAOB’s report\nidentified the specific registered public accounting firms which are subject to these determinations. Since our auditor, Centurion ZD CPA & Co. is located\nin Hong Kong, a jurisdiction where the PCAOB found it has been unable to inspect or investigate completely the audit work by auditors because of a\nposition taken by the authorities in Hong Kong, which may impact our ability to remain listed on a United States or other foreign exchange. The related\nrisks and uncertainties could cause the value of our shares to significantly decline. For more details, see “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors—Risks\nRelated to Doing Business in China—The PCAOB is currently unable to inspect our auditor in relation to their audit work performed for our financial\nstatements and the inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections or investigation completely over our auditor deprives our investors with the benefits of\nsuch inspections” and “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Doing Business in China—Our ordinary shares will be prohibited\nfrom trading in the United States under the HFCAA in 2024 if the PCAOB is unable to inspect or fully investigate auditors located in China, or as early as\n2023 if proposed changes to the law are enacted. The delisting of our ordinary shares, or the threat of their being delisted, may materially and adversely\naffect the value of your investment.”\nMerger\nThe Company is the surviving company following a merger in August 2021 with its predecessor company, Moxian, Inc., which was incorporated in\nNevada, U.S. As an offshore holding company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, we are qualified as a “foreign private issuer” within the meaning\nof the rules under the Exchange Act. As such, we are exempt from certain rules under the Exchange Act that are applicable to U.S. domestic issuers.\nMoreover, we are not required to provide as many Exchange Act reports, or as frequently or as promptly, as U.S. domestic issuers. We are also not required\nto provide the same level of disclosure on certain issues. In addition, as a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, we are permitted to adopt\ncertain home country practices in relation to corporate governance matters that differ significantly from that applied to the U.S. domestic issuers under the\nNasdaq listing rules. These exemptions and practices may afford less protection to our shareholders than they would enjoy if we were a U.S. domestic\nissuer.\n4\nOn December 28 2021, the shareholders of the Company approved a private placement of up to 20,000,000 new ordinary shares at a price of $2.50 per\nshare and to use the proceeds as working capital for a bitcoin mining business as the Company intended to diversify its business operations. Pursuant to\nthese approvals, in February 2022, the Company issued 16,000,000 ordinary shares for aggregate gross proceeds of $40 million and acquired mining assets\nand related equipment for $29.8 million. On March 5, 2022 the first of these bitcoin mining machines began operation near Buffalo in the United States and\nthe other machines will progressively be utilized in operation in the ensuing months.\nSelected Financial Data\nThe Company has a December 31 fiscal year-end which is different from that of its predecessor company which fiscal year-end was September 30.\nBecause of this change, the following table presents the selected consolidated financial information of our Company as of December 31, 2021, the\ntransitional period for the three months ended December 31, 2020 and the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019.

Risk Factors\nAn investment in our ordinary shares involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with\nall other information contained in this annual report, including the matters discussed under the headings “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Operating\nand Financial Review and Prospects” before you decide to invest in our ordinary shares. We are a holding company with operations in China and are\nsubject to a legal and regulatory environment that in many respects differs from the United States. If any of the following risks, or any other risks and\nuncertainties that are not presently foreseeable to us, actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and our future growth\nprospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nSummary Of Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to a number of risks, including risks that may prevent us from achieving our business objectives or may adversely affect\nour business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects. These risks are discussed more fully below and include, but are not\nlimited to, risks related to:\nGeneral Risks\n● Failure to manage our liquidity and cash flows may materially and adversely affect our financial conditions and results of operations. As a result,\nwe may need additional capital, and financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\n● We have a history of operating losses, and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability; we have recently shifted our bitcoin mining\nbusiness, and we may not be successful in this business.\n● Our results of operation may fluctuate significantly and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business.\n● We may acquire other businesses, form joint ventures or acquire other companies or businesses that could negatively affect our operating results,\ndilute our stockholders’ ownership, increase our debt or cause us to incur significant expense; notwithstanding the foregoing, our growth may\ndepend on our success in uncovering and completing such transactions.\n● From time to time we may evaluate and potentially consummate strategic investments or acquisitions, which could require significant\nmanagement attention, disrupt our business and adversely affect our financial results.\n● We incur significant costs and demands upon management and accounting and finance resources as a result of complying with the laws and\nregulations affecting public companies; if we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate and timely\nfinancial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, our ability to operate our business and our reputation.\n● We face risks related to the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, which could significantly disrupt our operations and financial results.\nRisks related to Bitcoin Mining\n● Our results of operations are expected to vary with Bitcoin price volatility.\n● Our mining operating costs outpace our mining revenues, which could seriously harm our business or increase our losses.\n● We have an evolving business model which is subject to various uncertainties.\n● Regulatory changes or actions may alter the nature of an investment in us or restrict the use of cryptocurrencies in a manner that adversely affects\nour business, prospects or operations.\n● The development and acceptance of cryptographic and algorithmic protocols governing the issuance of and transactions in cryptocurrencies is\nsubject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate.\n● Banks and financial institutions may not provide banking services, or may cut off services, to businesses that engage in bitcoin-related activities or\nthat accept cryptocurrencies as payment, including financial institutions of investors in our securities.\n● We may face risks of Internet disruptions, which could have an adverse effect on the price of cryptocurrencies.\n● Acceptance and/or widespread use of bitcoin is uncertain.\n● The decentralized nature of bitcoin systems may lead to slow or inadequate responses to crises, which may negatively affect our business.\n● Our bitcoins may be subject to loss, theft or restriction on access.\n● There is a lack of liquid markets, and possible manipulation of blockchain/bitcoin-based assets.\n● Incorrect or fraudulent bitcoin transactions may be irreversible.\n● Our reliance primarily on a single model of miner may subject our operations to increased risk of mine failure.\n● Our future success will depend in large part upon the value of bitcoin; the value of bitcoin may be subject to pricing risk and has historically been\nsubject to wide swings.\n● Cryptocurrencies, including those maintained by or for us, may be exposed to cybersecurity threats and hacks.\n6\n● We are subject to risks associated with our need for significant electrical power. Government regulators may potentially restrict the ability of\nelectricity suppliers to provide electricity to mining operations, such as ours.\n● We may not adequately respond to price fluctuations and rapidly changing technology, which may negatively affect our business.\nRisks related to our Digital Advertising Business\n● We are dependent on our relationship with Xinhua New Media.\n● We may not be able to attract new clients and retain key staff.\n● Our business is largely centered in Beijing and our services provided to our clients are geographically limited.\nRisks Involving Intellectual Property\n● Bitcoin and bitcoin mining operations rely on software and specialized technology.\n● We may not be able to prevent others from unauthorized use of our intellectual property, which could harm our business and competitive position.\n● We may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims, which may be expensive to defend and may disrupt our business and operations\n● Our platform and internal systems rely on software that is highly technical, and if it contains undetected errors, our business could be adversely\naffected.\nRisks Related to Doing Business in China\n● Changes in China’s economic, political or social conditions or government policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and\nresults of operations.\n● Uncertainties in the interpretation and enforcement of Chinese laws and regulations could limit the legal protections available to us.\n● The PRC government may intervene or influence our operations at any time, or may exert more control over offerings conducted overseas and/or\nforeign investment in China-based issuers, which could result in a material change in our operations and/or cause the value of our securities to\nsignificantly decline or be worthless.\n● PRC regulations establish complex procedures for some acquisitions conducted by foreign investors, which could make it more difficult for us to\npursue growth through acquisitions in China.\n● The PCAOB is currently unable to inspect our auditor in relation to their audit work performed for our financial statements and the inability of the\nPCAOB to conduct inspections or investigation completely over our auditor deprives our investors with the benefits of such inspections.\n● Our ordinary shares will be prohibited from trading in the United States under the HFCAA in 2024 if the PCAOB is unable to inspect or fully\ninvestigate auditors located in China, or as early as 2023 if proposed changes to the law are enacted. The delisting of our ordinary shares, or the\nthreat of their being delisted, may materially and adversely affect the value of your investment.\n● PRC regulations relating to the establishment of offshore special purpose companies by PRC residents may limit our ability to inject capital into\nour PRC subsidiaries, limit our subsidiaries’ ability to increase their registered capital or distribute profits to us, or may otherwise adversely affect\nus\n● PRC regulation of loans to and direct investment in PRC entities by offshore holding companies and governmental control of currency conversion\nmay delay or prevent us from using offshore funds to make loans to our PRC subsidiaries, or to make additional capital contributions to our PRC\nsubsidiaries.\n● Regulatory bodies of the United States may be limited in their ability to conduct investigations or inspections of our operations in China.\n● Enhanced scrutiny over acquisition transactions by the PRC tax authorities may have a negative impact on potential acquisitions we may pursue in\nthe future.\n● Fluctuations in exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the value of your investment.\n7\nRisks Related to Our Ordinary Shares\n● Our ordinary shares may be thinly traded and you may be unable to sell at or near ask prices or at all if you need to sell your shares to raise money\nor otherwise desire to liquidate your shares.\n● We are not likely to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\n● You may face difficulties in protecting your interests as a shareholder, as the laws of British Virgin Islands provides substantially less protection\nwhen compared to the laws of the United States and it may be difficult for a shareholder of ours to effect service of process or to enforce\njudgements obtained in the United States courts.\n● Volatility in our ordinary shares price may subject us to securities litigation.\n● We may be unable to comply with the applicable continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, which may adversely impact our\naccess to capital markets and may cause us to default certain of our agreements\nGeneral Risks\nIf we are unable to successfully execute our bitcoin mining, it would adversely affect our financial and business condition and results of operations.\nAs of the date of this Report, the Company has yet to fully implement its plan to diversify into bitcoin mining as various mining sites have not\nbeen finalized. If we cannot execute the bitcoin mining, it would seriously affect our financial and business condition and deepen the losses of the\nCompany.\nFailure to manage our liquidity and cash flows may materially and adversely affect our financial conditions and results of operations. As a result, we\nmay need additional capital, and financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nThe Company is new to bitcoin mining and is operating in the United States for the first time. If we fail to manage our liquidity and cash flows, it\nwill seriously affect our financial condition and results of operations. We may need additional financing and such access may be limited or at unacceptable\nterms.\nWe have a history of operating losses, and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability; we have recently shifted our bitcoin mining business,\nand we may not be successful in this business.\nWe are not profitable and have incurred losses since our inception. We expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and these\nlosses could increase as we continue to work to develop our business. We were previously engaged in the business of mobile payments which we ceased\noperation in June 2018. Whilst we continue with the digital advertising business, it is proving to be increasingly difficult because of restrictions on online\ngaming. which is a key business of our clients. Starting in March 2022, we diversified into the bitcoin mining business. Our current strategy is new and\nunproven, is in an industry that is relatively itself new and evolving and is subject to the risks discussed below. Even if we achieve profitability in the\nfuture, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods.\nOur results of operation may fluctuate significantly and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business.\nOur results of operations, including the levels of our net revenues, expenses, net loss and other key metrics, may vary significantly in the future\ndue to a variety of factors, some of which are outside of our control, and period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful,\nespecially given our limited operating history. Accordingly, the results for any one quarter are not necessarily an indication of future performance.\nFluctuations in quarterly results may adversely affect the market price of our ordinary shares. Factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly financial\nresults include:\n● the amount and timing of operating expenses related to our new business operations and infrastructure;\n● fluctuations in the price of bitcoin; and\n● general economic, industry and market conditions.\n8\nWe may acquire other businesses, form joint ventures or acquire other companies or businesses that could negatively affect our operating results, dilute\nour stockholders’ ownership, increase our debt or cause us to incur significant expense; notwithstanding the foregoing, our growth may depend on our\nsuccess in uncovering and completing such transactions.\nWe are actively seeking other business opportunities, however, we cannot offer any assurance that acquisitions of businesses, assets and/or\nentering into strategic alliances or joint ventures will be successful. We may not be able to find suitable partners or acquisition candidates and may not be\nable to complete such transactions on favorable terms, if at all. If we make any acquisitions, we may not be able to integrate these acquisitions successfully\ninto our existing infrastructure. In addition, in the event we acquire any existing businesses we could assume unknown or contingent liabilities.\nAny future acquisitions also could result in the issuance of stock, incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or future write-offs of intangible assets\nor goodwill, any of which could have a negative impact on our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. Integration of an acquired\ncompany may also disrupt ongoing operations and require management resources that otherwise would be focused on developing and expanding our\nexisting business. We may experience losses related to potential investments in other companies, which could harm our financial condition and results of\noperations. Further, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, strategic alliance or joint venture if such investments do not materialize.\nTo finance any acquisitions or joint ventures, we may choose to issue ordinary shares, preferred stock or a combination of debt and equity as\nconsideration, which could significantly dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders or provide rights to such preferred stock holders in priority over\nour common stock holders. Additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. If the price of our common stock is low or\nvolatile, we may not be able to acquire other companies or fund a joint venture project using stock as consideration.\nFrom time to time we may evaluate and potentially consummate strategic investments or acquisitions, which could require significant management\nattention, disrupt our business and adversely affect our financial results.\nWe may evaluate and consider strategic investments, combinations, acquisitions or alliances in both the bitcoin mining business. These\ntransactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations if consummated. If we are able to identify an appropriate business\nopportunity, we may not be able to successfully consummate the transaction and, even if we do consummate such a transaction, we may be unable to obtain\nthe benefits or avoid the difficulties and risks of such transaction.\nStrategic investments or acquisitions will involve risks commonly encountered in business relationships, including:\n● difficulties in assimilating and integrating the operations, personnel, systems, data, technologies, products and services of the acquired\nbusiness;\n● inability of the acquired technologies, products or businesses to achieve expected levels of revenue, profitability, productivity or other\nbenefits;\n● difficulties in retaining, training, motivating and integrating key personnel;\n● diversion of management’s time and resources from our normal daily operations;\n● difficulties in successfully incorporating licensed or acquired technology and rights into our businesses;\n● difficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies within the combined organizations;\n● difficulties in retaining relationships with customers, employees and suppliers of the acquired business;\n● risks of entering markets, including the U.S., in which we have limited or no prior experience;\n9\nWe may not make any investments or acquisitions, or any future investments or acquisitions may not be successful, may not benefit our business\nstrategy, may not generate sufficient revenues to offset the associated acquisition costs or may not otherwise result in the intended benefits. In addition, we\ncannot assure you that any future investment in or acquisition of new businesses or technology will lead to the successful development of new or enhanced\nloan products and services or that any new or enhanced loan products and services, if developed, will achieve market acceptance or prove to be profitable.\nOur loss of any of our management team, our inability to execute an effective succession plan, or our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel,\ncould adversely affect our business.\nOur success and future growth will depend to a significant degree on the skills and services of our management, including our Chief Executive\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer. We will need to continue to grow our management in order to alleviate pressure on our existing team and in order to\ncontinue to develop our business. If our management, including any new hires that we may make, fails to work together effectively and to execute our plans\nand strategies on a timely basis, our business could be harmed. Furthermore, if we fail to execute an effective contingency or succession plan with the loss\nof any member of management, the loss of such management personnel may significantly disrupt our business.\nThe loss of key members of management could inhibit our growth prospects. Our future success also depends in large part on our ability to attract,\nretain and motivate key management and operating personnel. As we continue to develop and expand our operations, we may require personnel with\ndifferent skills and experiences, and who have a sound understanding of our business and the bitcoin industry. The market for highly qualified personnel in\nthis industry is very competitive and we may be unable to attract such personnel. If we are unable to attract such personnel, our business could be harmed.\nWe incur significant costs and demands upon management and accounting and finance resources as a result of complying with the laws and\nregulations affecting public companies; if we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate and timely\nfinancial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, our ability to operate our business and our reputation.\nAs a public reporting company, we are required to, among other things, maintain a system of effective internal control over financial reporting.\nEnsuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on\na timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently. Substantial work will continue to be required to further\nimplement, document, assess, test and remediate our system of internal controls.\nIf our internal control over financial reporting is not effective, we may be unable to issue our financial statements in a timely manner, we may be\nunable to obtain the required audit or review of our financial statements by our independent registered public accounting firm in a timely manner or we\nmay be otherwise unable to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the SEC, our common stock listing on Nasdaq could be suspended or\nterminated and our stock price could materially suffer. In addition, we or members of our management could be subject to investigation and sanction by the\nSEC and other regulatory authorities and to stockholder lawsuits, which could impose significant additional costs on us and divert management attention.\nBecause cryptocurrencies may be determined to be investment securities, we may inadvertently violate the Investment Company Act and incur large\nlosses as a result and potentially be required to register as an investment company or terminate operations and we may incur third party liabilities.\nWe are engaged in the mining of bitcoins which the SEC said is currency and not securities. We therefore believe that we are not engaged in the\nbusiness of investing, reinvesting, or trading in securities, and we do not hold ourselves out as being engaged in those activities. However, under the\nInvestment Company Act a company may be deemed an investment company under section 3(a)(1)(C) thereof if the value of its investment securities is\nmore than 40% of its total assets (exclusive of government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis.\n10\nIf, as a result of our investments and our mining activities, including investments in which we do not have a controlling interest, the investment\nsecurities we hold could exceed 40% of our total assets, exclusive of cash items and, accordingly, we could determine that we have become an inadvertent\ninvestment company. The bitcoins we own, acquire or mine may be deemed an investment security by the SEC, although we do not believe any of the\ncryptocurrencies we own, acquire or mine are securities. An inadvertent investment company can avoid being classified as an investment company if it can\nrely on one of the exclusions under the Investment Company Act. One such exclusion, Rule 3a-2 under the Investment Company Act, allows an inadvertent\ninvestment company a grace period of one year from the earlier of (a) the date on which an issuer owns securities and/or cash having a value exceeding\n50% of the issuer’s total assets on either a consolidated or unconsolidated basis and (b) the date on which an issuer owns or proposes to acquire investment\nsecurities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of such issuer’s total assets (exclusive of government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated\nbasis. We may take actions to cause the investment securities held by us to be less than 40% of our total assets, which may include acquiring assets with our\ncash and bitcoin on hand or liquidating our investment securities or bitcoin or seeking a no-action letter from the SEC if we are unable to acquire sufficient\nassets or liquidate sufficient investment securities in a timely manner.\nAs the Rule 3a-2 exception is available to a company no more than once every three years, and assuming no other exclusion were available to us,\nwe would have to keep within the 40% limit for at least three years after we cease being an inadvertent investment company. This may limit our ability to\nmake certain investments or enter into joint ventures that could otherwise have a positive impact on our earnings. In any event, we do not intend to become\nan investment company engaged in the business of investing and trading securities.\nClassification as an investment company under the Investment Company Act requires registration with the SEC. If an investment company fails to\nregister, it would have to stop doing almost all business, and its contracts would become voidable. Registration is time consuming and restrictive and would\nrequire a restructuring of our operations, and we would be very constrained in the kind of business we could do as a registered investment company.\nFurther, we would become subject to substantial regulation concerning management, operations, transactions with affiliated persons and portfolio\ncomposition, and would need to file reports under the Investment Company Act regime. The cost of such compliance would result in the Company\nincurring substantial additional expenses, and the failure to register if required would have a materially adverse impact to conduct our operations.\nWe face risks related to the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, which could significantly disrupt our operations and financial results.\nWe believe that our results of operations, business and financial condition has been adversely impacted by the effects of the novel Coronavirus\n(COVID-19). Currently, substantially all of our employees and operations are in China. In addition to global macroeconomic effects, the novel Coronavirus\n(COVID-19) outbreak and any other related adverse public health developments may cause disruption to our mining activities.\nThe novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) or other disease outbreak will in the short-term, and may over the longer term, adversely affect the economies\nand financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that may adversely affect demand for bitcoin and impact our operating results.\nAlthough the magnitude of the impact of the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak on our business and operations remains uncertain, the continued\nspread of the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) or the occurrence of other epidemics and the imposition of related public health measures and travel and\nbusiness restrictions will adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. In addition, we have experienced and will\nexperience disruptions to our business operations resulting from quarantines, self-isolations, or other movement and restrictions on the ability of our\nemployees to perform their jobs. If we are unable to effectively service our miners, our ability to mine bitcoin will be adversely affected as miners go\noffline, which would have an adverse effect on our business and the results of our operations.\n11\nChina has also limited the shipment of products in and out of its borders, which could negatively impact our ability to receive mining equipment\nfrom our China-based suppliers. Our third-party manufacturers, suppliers, sub-contractors and customers have been and will continue to be disrupted by\nworker absenteeism, quarantines, restrictions on employees’ ability to work, office and factory closures, disruptions to ports and other shipping\ninfrastructure, border closures, or other travel or health-related restrictions. Depending on the magnitude of such effects on our supply chain, shipments of\nparts for our existing miners, as well as any new miners we purchase, may be delayed. As our miners require repair or become obsolete and require\nreplacement, our ability to obtain adequate replacements or repair parts from their manufacturer may therefore be hampered. Supply chain disruptions\ncould therefore negatively impact our operations. If not resolved quickly, the impact of the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) global pandemic could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business.\nThe coronavirus pandemic is an emerging serious threat to health and economic wellbeing affecting our employees, investors and our sources of\nsupply.\nThe sweeping nature of the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic makes it extremely difficult to predict how the company’s business and\noperations will be affected in the longer run. However, the likely overall economic impact of the pandemic is viewed as highly negative to the general\neconomy.\nIncreases in labor costs in the PRC may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe economy in China has experienced increases in inflation and labor costs in recent years. As a result, average wages in the PRC are expected to\ncontinue to increase. In addition, we are required by PRC laws and regulations to pay various statutory employee benefits, including pension, housing fund,\nmedical insurance, work-related injury insurance, unemployment insurance and maternity insurance to designated government agencies for the benefit of\nour employees. The relevant government agencies may examine whether an employer has made adequate payments to the statutory employee benefits, and\nthose employers who fail to make adequate payments may be subject to late payment fees, fines and/or other penalties. We expect that our labor costs,\nincluding wages and employee benefits, will continue to increase. Unless we are able to control our labor costs or pass on these increased labor costs to our\nusers by increasing the fees of our services, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIf we cannot maintain our corporate culture as we grow, we could lose the innovation, collaboration and focus that contribute to our business.\nWe believe that a critical component of our success is our corporate culture, which we believe fosters innovation, encourages teamwork and\ncultivates creativity. As we develop the infrastructure of a public company and continue to grow, we may find it difficult to maintain these valuable aspects\nof our corporate culture. Any failure to preserve our culture could negatively impact our future success, including our ability to attract and retain\nemployees, encourage innovation and teamwork and effectively focus on and pursue our corporate objectives.\nWe do not have any business insurance coverage.\nInsurance companies in China currently do not offer as extensive an array of insurance products as insurance companies in more developed\neconomies. Currently, we do not have any business liability or disruption insurance to cover our operations. We have determined that the costs of insuring\nfor these risks and the difficulties associated with acquiring such insurance on commercially reasonable terms make it impractical for us to have such\ninsurance. Any uninsured business disruptions may result in our incurring substantial costs and the diversion of resources, which could have an adverse\neffect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n12\nRisks related to Bitcoin Mining\nOur results of operations are expected to vary with Bitcoin price volatility\nThe price of Bitcoin has experienced significant fluctuations over its relatively short existence and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the\nfuture.\nWe expect our results of operations to continue to be affected by the Bitcoin price as most of the revenue is from bitcoin mining production as of\nthe filing date. Any future significant reductions in the price of Bitcoin will likely have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations and\nfinancial condition. We cannot assure you that the Bitcoin price will remain high enough to sustain our operation or that the Bitcoin price will not decline\nsignificantly in the future.\nVarious factors, mostly beyond our control, could impact the Bitcoin price. For example, the usage of Bitcoins in the retail and commercial\nmarketplace is relatively low in comparison with the usage for speculation, which contributes to Bitcoin price volatility. Additionally, the reward for\nBitcoin mining will decline over time, with the most recent halving event occurred in May 2020 and next one four years later, which may further contribute\nto Bitcoin price volatility.\nOur mining operating costs outpace our mining revenues, which could seriously harm our business or increase our losses.\nOur mining operations are costly and our expenses may increase in the future. We intend to use funds on hand from our private placement to\ncontinue to purchase bitcoin mining machines. This expense increase may not be offset by a corresponding increase in revenue. Our expenses may be\ngreater than we anticipate, and our investments to make our business more efficient may not succeed and may outpace monetization efforts. Increases in\nour costs without a corresponding increase in our revenue would increase our losses and could seriously harm our business and financial perform\nWe have an evolving business model which is subject to various uncertainties.\nAs bitcoin assets may become more widely available, we expect the services and products associated with them to evolve. In order to stay current\nwith the industry, our business model may need to evolve as well. From time to time, we may modify aspects of our business model relating to our strategy.\nWe cannot offer any assurance that these or any other modifications will be successful or will not result in harm to our business. We may not be able to\nmanage growth effectively, which could damage our reputation, limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results. Further, we cannot provide any\nassurance that we will successfully identify all emerging trends and growth opportunities in this business sector and we may lose out on those\nopportunities. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations.\nRegulatory changes or actions may alter the nature of an investment in us or restrict the use of cryptocurrencies in a manner that adversely affects our\nbusiness, prospects or operations.\nAs cryptocurrencies have grown in both popularity and market size, governments around the world have reacted differently to cryptocurrencies;\ncertain governments have deemed them illegal, and others have allowed their use and trade without restriction, while in some jurisdictions, such as in the\nU.S., subject to extensive, and in some cases overlapping, unclear and evolving regulatory requirements. Ongoing and future regulatory actions may impact\nour ability to continue to operate, and such actions could affect our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations.\n13\nThe development and acceptance of cryptographic and algorithmic protocols governing the issuance of and transactions in cryptocurrencies is subject\nto a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate.\nThe use of cryptocurrencies to, among other things, buy and sell goods and services and complete transactions, is part of a new and rapidly\nevolving industry that employs bitcoin assets based upon a computer-generated mathematical and/or cryptographic protocol. Large-scale acceptance of\ncryptocurrencies as a means of payment has not, and may never, occur. The growth of this industry in general, and the use of bitcoin, in particular, is\nsubject to a high degree of uncertainty, and the slowing or stopping of the development or acceptance of developing protocols may occur unpredictably.\nThe factors include, but are not limited to:\n● continued worldwide growth in the adoption and use of cryptocurrencies as a medium to exchange;\n● governmental and quasi-governmental regulation of cryptocurrencies and their use, or restrictions on or regulation of access to and operation\nof the network or similar bitcoin systems;\n● changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences;\n● the maintenance and development of the open-source software protocol of the network;\n14\n● the increased consolidation of contributors to the bitcoin blockchain through mining pools;\n● the availability and popularity of other forms or methods of buying and selling goods and services, including new means of using fiat\ncurrencies;\n● the use of the networks supporting cryptocurrencies for developing smart contracts and distributed applications;\n● general economic conditions and the regulatory environment relating to cryptocurrencies; and\n● negative consumer sentiment and perception of bitcoin specifically and cryptocurrencies generally.\nThe outcome of these factors could have negative effects on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our business strategy at all,\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations as well as potentially negative effect on the value of any bitcoin or\nother cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account, which would harm investors in our securities.\nBanks and financial institutions may not provide banking services, or may cut off services, to businesses that engage in bitcoin-related activities or that\naccept cryptocurrencies as payment, including financial institutions of investors in our securities.\nA number of companies that engage in bitcoin and/or other bitcoin-related activities have been unable to find banks or financial institutions that\nare willing to provide them with bank accounts and other services. Similarly, a number of companies and individuals or businesses associated with\ncryptocurrencies may have had and may continue to have their existing bank accounts closed or services discontinued with financial institutions in response\nto government action, particularly in China, where regulatory response to cryptocurrencies has been to exclude their use for ordinary consumer transactions\nwithin China. We also may be unable to obtain or maintain these services for our business. The difficulty that many businesses that provide bitcoin and/or\nderivatives on other bitcoin-related activities have and may continue to have in finding banks and financial institutions willing to provide them services\nmay be decreasing the usefulness of cryptocurrencies as a payment system and harming public perception of cryptocurrencies, and could decrease their\nusefulness and harm their public perception in the future.\nThe usefulness of cryptocurrencies as a payment system and the public perception of cryptocurrencies could be damaged if banks or financial\ninstitutions were to close the accounts of businesses engaging in bitcoin and/or other bitcoin-related activities. This could occur as a result of compliance\nrisk, cost, government regulation or public pressure. The risk applies to securities firms, clearance and settlement firms, national stock and derivatives on\ncommodities exchanges, the over-the-counter market, and the Depository Trust Company, which, if any of such entities adopts or implements similar\npolicies, rules or regulations, could negatively affect our relationships with financial institutions and impede our ability to convert cryptocurrencies to fiat\ncurrencies. Such factors could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and harm investors.\nWe may face risks of Internet disruptions, which could have an adverse effect on the price of cryptocurrencies.\nA disruption of the Internet may affect the use of cryptocurrencies and subsequently the value of our securities. Generally, cryptocurrencies and\nour business of mining cryptocurrencies is dependent upon the Internet. A significant disruption in Internet connectivity could disrupt a currency’s network\noperations until the disruption is resolved and have an adverse effect on the price of cryptocurrencies and our ability to mine cryptocurrencies.\n15\nThe impact of geopolitical and economic events on the supply and demand for cryptocurrencies is uncertain.\nGeopolitical crises may motivate large-scale purchases of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which could increase the price of bitcoin and other\ncryptocurrencies rapidly. This may increase the likelihood of a subsequent price decrease as crisis-driven purchasing behavior dissipates, adversely\naffecting the value of our inventory following such downward adjustment. Such risks are similar to the risks of purchasing commodities in general\nuncertain times, such as the risk of purchasing, holding or selling gold. Alternatively, as an emerging asset class with limited acceptance as a payment\nsystem or commodity, global crises and general economic downturn may discourage investment in cryptocurrencies as investors focus their investment on\nless volatile asset classes as a means of hedging their investment risk.\nAs an alternative to fiat currencies that are backed by central governments, cryptocurrencies, which are relatively new, are subject to supply and\ndemand forces. How such supply and demand will be impacted by geopolitical events is largely uncertain but could be harmful to us and investors in our\ncommon stock. Political or economic crises may motivate large-scale acquisitions or sales of cryptocurrencies either globally or locally. Such events could\nhave a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect\non our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or any other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our\nown account.\nAcceptance and/or widespread use of bitcoin is uncertain.\nCurrently, there is a relatively limited use of any bitcoin in the retail and commercial marketplace, thus contributing to price volatility that could\nadversely affect an investment in our securities. Banks and other established financial institutions may refuse to process funds for bitcoin transactions,\nprocess wire transfers to or from bitcoin exchanges, bitcoin-related companies or service providers, or maintain accounts for persons or entities transacting\nin bitcoin. Conversely, a significant portion of bitcoin demand is generated by investors seeking a long-term store of value or speculators seeking to profit\nfrom the short- or long-term holding of the asset. Price volatility undermines any bitcoin’s role as a medium of exchange, as retailers are much less likely to\naccept it as a form of payment. Market capitalization for a bitcoin as a medium of exchange and payment method may always be low.\nThe relative lack of acceptance of bitcoins in the retail and commercial marketplace, or a reduction of such use, limits the ability of end users to\nuse them to pay for goods and services. Such lack of acceptance or decline in acceptances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as\na going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the\nvalue of bitcoins we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account.\nTransactional fees may decrease demand for bitcoin and prevent expansion.\nAs the number of bitcoins currency rewards awarded for solving a block in a blockchain decreases, the incentive for miners to continue to\ncontribute to the bitcoin network may transition from a set reward to transaction fees. In order to incentivize miners to continue to contribute to the bitcoin\nnetwork, the bitcoin network may either formally or informally transition from a set reward to transaction fees earned upon solving a block. This transition\ncould be accomplished by miners independently electing to record in the blocks they solve only those transactions that include payment of a transaction\nfee. If transaction fees paid for bitcoin transactions become too high, the marketplace may be reluctant to accept bitcoin as a means of payment and existing\nusers may be motivated to switch from bitcoin to another bitcoin or to fiat currency. Either the requirement from miners of higher transaction fees in\nexchange for recording transactions in a blockchain or a software upgrade that automatically charges fees for all transactions may decrease demand for\nbitcoin and prevent the expansion of the bitcoin network to retail merchants and commercial businesses, resulting in a reduction in the price of bitcoin that\ncould adversely impact an investment in our securities. Decreased use and demand for bitcoin may adversely affect its value and result in a reduction in the\nprice of bitcoin and the value of our common stock.\n16\nThe decentralized nature of bitcoin systems may lead to slow or inadequate responses to crises, which may negatively affect our business.\nThe decentralized nature of the governance of bitcoin systems may lead to ineffective decision making that slows development or prevents a\nnetwork from overcoming emergent obstacles. Governance of many bitcoin systems is by voluntary consensus and open competition with no clear\nleadership structure or authority. To the extent lack of clarity in corporate governance of bitcoin systems leads to ineffective decision making that slows\ndevelopment and growth of such cryptocurrencies, the value of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nIt may be illegal now, or in the future, to acquire, own, hold, sell or use bitcoin, ether, or other cryptocurrencies, participate in blockchains or utilize\nsimilar bitcoin assets in one or more countries, the ruling of which would adversely affect us.\nAlthough currently cryptocurrencies generally are not regulated or are lightly regulated in most countries, one or more countries such as China and\nRussia, which have taken harsh regulatory action, may take regulatory actions in the future that could severely restrict the right to acquire, own, hold, sell\nor use these bitcoin assets or to exchange for fiat currency. In many nations, particularly in China and Russia, it is illegal to accept payment in bitcoin and\nother cryptocurrencies for consumer transactions and banking institutions are barred from accepting deposits of cryptocurrencies. Such restrictions may\nadversely affect us as the large-scale use of cryptocurrencies as a means of exchange is presently confined to certain regions globally. Such circumstances\ncould have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for\nour own account, and harm investors.\nThere is a lack of liquid markets, and possible manipulation of blockchain/bitcoin-based assets.\nCryptocurrencies that are represented and trade on a ledger-based platform may not necessarily benefit from viable trading markets. Stock\nexchanges have listing requirements and vet issuers; requiring them to be subjected to rigorous listing standards and rules, and monitor investors\ntransacting on such platform for fraud and other improprieties. These conditions may not necessarily be replicated on a distributed ledger platform,\ndepending on the platform’s controls and other policies. The laxer a distributed ledger platform is about vetting issuers of bitcoin assets or users that\ntransact on the platform, the higher the potential risk for fraud or the manipulation of the ledger due to a control event. These factors may decrease liquidity\nor volume or may otherwise increase volatility of investment securities or other assets trading on a ledger-based system, which may adversely affect us.\nSuch circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have\na material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise\nacquire or hold for our own account, and harm investors.\nOur operations, investment strategies and profitability may be adversely affected by competition from other methods of investing in cryptocurrencies.\nWe compete with other users and/or companies that are mining cryptocurrencies and other potential financial vehicles, including securities backed\nby or linked to cryptocurrencies through entities similar to us. Market and financial conditions, and other conditions beyond our control, may make it more\nattractive to invest in other financial vehicles, or to invest in cryptocurrencies directly, which could limit the market for our shares and reduce their\nliquidity. The emergence of other financial vehicles and exchange-traded funds have been scrutinized by regulators and such scrutiny and the negative\nimpressions or conclusions resulting from such scrutiny could be applicable to us and impact our ability to successfully pursue our new strategy or operate\nat all, or to establish or maintain a public market for our securities. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a\ngoing concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the\nvalue of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account, and harm investors.\nThe development and acceptance of competing blockchain platforms or technologies may cause consumers to use alternative distributed ledgers or\nother alternatives.\nThe development and acceptance of competing blockchain platforms or technologies may cause consumers to use alternative distributed ledgers or\nan alternative to distributed ledgers altogether. Our business utilizes presently existent digital ledgers and blockchains and we could face difficulty adapting\nto emergent digital ledgers, blockchains, or alternatives thereto. This may adversely affect us and our exposure to various blockchain technologies and\nprevent us from realizing the anticipated profits from our investments. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as\na going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the\nvalue of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account, and harm investors.\n17\nOur bitcoins may be subject to loss, theft or restriction on access.\nThere is a risk that some or all of our bitcoins could be lost or stolen. Cryptocurrencies are stored in bitcoin sites commonly referred to as\n“wallets” by holders of bitcoins which may be accessed to exchange a holder’s bitcoin assets. Access to our bitcoin assets could also be restricted by\ncybercrime (such as a denial of service attack) against a service at which we maintain a hosted hot wallet. A hot wallet refers to any bitcoin wallet that is\nconnected to the Internet. Generally, hot wallets are easier to set up and access than wallets in cold storage, but they are also more susceptible to hackers\nand other technical vulnerabilities. Cold storage refers to any bitcoin wallet that is not connected to the Internet. Cold storage is generally more secure than\nhot storage, but is not ideal for quick or regular transactions and we may experience lag time in our ability to respond to market fluctuations in the price of\nour bitcoin assets. We hold all of our cryptocurrencies in cold storage to reduce the risk of malfeasance, but the risk of loss of our bitcoin assets cannot be\nwholly eliminated.\nHackers or malicious actors may launch attacks to steal, compromise or secure cryptocurrencies, such as by attacking the bitcoin network source\ncode, exchange miners, third-party platforms, cold and hot storage locations or software, or by other means. We may be in control and possession of one of\nthe more substantial holdings of bitcoins. As we increase in size, we may become a more appealing target of hackers, malware, cyber-attacks or other\nsecurity threats. Any of these events may adversely affect our operations and, consequently, our investments and profitability. The loss or destruction of a\nprivate key required to access our digital wallets may be irreversible and we may be denied access for all time to our bitcoin holdings or the holdings of\nothers held in those compromised wallets. Our loss of access to our private keys or our experience of a data loss relating to our digital wallets could\nadversely affect our investments and assets.\nCryptocurrencies are controllable only by the possessor of both the unique public and private keys relating to the local or online digital wallet in\nwhich they are held, which wallet’s public key or address is reflected in the network’s public blockchain. We will publish the public key relating to digital\nwallets in use when we verify the receipt of transfers and disseminate such information into the network, but we will need to safeguard the private keys\nrelating to such digital wallets. To the extent such private keys are lost, destroyed or otherwise compromised, we will be unable to access our bitcoin\nrewards and such private keys may not be capable of being restored by any network. Any loss of private keys relating to digital wallets used to store our\ncryptocurrencies could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise\nacquire or hold for our own account.\nRisks due to hacking or adverse software event.\nIn order to minimize risk, we have established processes to manage wallets that are associated with our bitcoin holdings. There can be no\nassurances that any processes we have adopted or will adopt in the future are or will be secure or effective, and we would suffer significant and immediate\nadverse effects if we suffered a loss of our bitcoin due to an adverse software or cybersecurity event. We utilize several layers of threat reduction\ntechniques, including: (i) the use of hardware wallets to store sensitive private key information; (ii) performance of transactions offline; and (iii) offline\ngeneration storage and use of private keys.\nAt present, the Company is evaluating several third-party custodial wallet alternatives, but there can be no assurance that such services will be\nmore secure than those the Company presently employs. Human error and the constantly evolving state of cybercrime and hacking techniques may render\npresent security protocols and procedures ineffective in ways which we cannot predict. If our security procedures and protocols are ineffectual and our\nbitcoin assets are compromised by cybercriminals, we may not have adequate recourse to recover our losses stemming from such compromise and we may\nlose much of the accumulated value of our bitcoin mining activities. This would have a negative impact on our business and operations.\n18\nIncorrect or fraudulent bitcoin transactions may be irreversible.\nBitcoin transactions are irrevocable and stolen or incorrectly transferred cryptocurrencies may be irretrievable. As a result, any incorrectly\nexecuted or fraudulent bitcoin transactions could adversely affect our investments and assets.\nBitcoin transactions are not, from an administrative perspective, reversible without the consent and active participation of the recipient of the\ncryptocurrencies from the transaction. In theory, bitcoin transactions may be reversible with the control or consent of a majority of processing power on the\nnetwork, however, we do not now, nor is it feasible that we could in the future, possess sufficient processing power to effect this reversal. Once a\ntransaction has been verified and recorded in a block that is added to a blockchain, an incorrect transfer of a bitcoin or a theft thereof generally will not be\nreversible and we may not have sufficient recourse to recover our losses from any such transfer or theft. It is possible that, through computer or human\nerror, or through theft or criminal action, our bitcoin rewards could be transferred in incorrect amounts or to unauthorized third parties, or to uncontrolled\naccounts. Further, according to the SEC, at this time, there is no specifically enumerated U.S. or foreign governmental, regulatory, investigative or\nprosecutorial authority or mechanism through which to bring an action or complaint regarding missing or stolen bitcoin. We are, therefore, presently reliant\non existing private investigative entities, such as Chain analysis and Kroll to investigate any potential loss of our bitcoin assets. These third-party service\nproviders rely on data analysis and compliance of ISPs with traditional court orders to reveal information such as the IP addresses of any attackers who may\nhave target us. To the extent that we are unable to recover our losses from such action, error or theft, such events could have a material adverse effect on\nour ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or\noperations of and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account.\nOur interactions with a blockchain may expose us to SDN or blocked persons or cause us to violate provisions of law that did not contemplate distribute\nledger technology.\nThe Office of Financial Assets Control of the US Department of Treasury requires us to comply with its sanction program and not conduct\nbusiness with persons named on its specially designated nationals (“SDN”) list. However, because of the pseudonymous nature of blockchain transactions\nwe may inadvertently and without our knowledge engage in transactions with persons named on OFAC’s SDN list. Our Company’s policy prohibits any\ntransactions with such SDN individuals, but we may not be adequately capable of determining the ultimate identity of the individual with whom we\ntransact with respect to selling bitcoin assets. Moreover, federal law prohibits any US person from knowingly or unknowingly possessing any visual\ndepiction commonly known as child pornography. Recent media reports have suggested that persons have imbedded such depictions on one or more\nblockchains. Because our business requires us to download and retain one or more blockchains to effectuate our ongoing business, it is possible that such\ndigital ledgers contain prohibited depictions without our knowledge or consent. To the extent government enforcement authorities literally enforce these\nand other laws and regulations that are impacted by decentralized distributed ledger technology, we may be subject to investigation, administrative or court\nproceedings, and civil or criminal monetary fines and penalties, all of which could harm our reputation and affect the value of our common stock.\nCryptocurrencies face significant scaling obstacles that can lead to high fees or slow transaction settlement times.\nCryptocurrencies face significant scaling obstacles that can lead to high fees or slow transaction settlement times, and attempts to increase the\nvolume of transactions may not be effective. Scaling cryptocurrencies is essential to the widespread acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a means of payment,\nwhich widespread acceptance is necessary to the continued growth and development of our business. Many bitcoin networks face significant scaling\nchallenges. For example, cryptocurrencies are limited with respect to how many transactions can occur per second. Participants in the bitcoin ecosystem\ndebate potential approaches to increasing the average number of transactions per second that the network can handle and have implemented mechanisms or\nare researching ways to increase scale, such as increasing the allowable sizes of blocks, and therefore the number of transactions per block, and sharding (a\nhorizontal partition of data in a database or search engine), which would not require every single transaction to be included in every single miner’s or\nvalidator’s block. However, there is no guarantee that any of the mechanisms in place or being explored for increasing the scale of settlement of bitcoin\ntransactions will be effective, or how long they will take to become effective, which could adversely affect an investment in our securities.\n19\nThe price of cryptocurrencies may be affected by the sale of such cryptocurrencies by other vehicles investing in cryptocurrencies or tracking bitcoin\nmarkets.\nThe global market for bitcoin is characterized by supply constraints that differ from those present in the markets for commodities or other assets\nsuch as gold and silver. The mathematical protocols under which certain cryptocurrencies are mined permit the creation of a limited, predetermined amount\nof currency, while others have no limit established on total supply. To the extent that other vehicles investing in cryptocurrencies or tracking bitcoin\nmarkets form and come to represent a significant proportion of the demand for cryptocurrencies, large redemptions of the securities of those vehicles and\nthe subsequent sale of cryptocurrencies by such vehicles could negatively affect bitcoin prices and therefore affect the value of the bitcoin inventory we\nhold. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise\nacquire or hold for our own account.\nBecause there has been limited precedent set for financial accounting of bitcoin and other bitcoin assets, the determination that we have made for how\nto account for bitcoin assets transactions may be subject to change.\nBecause there has been limited precedent set for the financial accounting of cryptocurrencies and related revenue recognition and no official\nguidance has yet been provided by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or the SEC, it is unclear how companies may in the future be required to\naccount for bitcoin transactions and assets and related revenue recognition. A change in regulatory or financial accounting standards could result in the\nnecessity to change our accounting methods and restate our financial statements. Such a restatement could adversely affect the accounting for our newly\nmined bitcoin rewards and more generally negatively impact our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operation. Such circumstances\nwould have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which would have a material adverse\neffect on our business, prospects or operations as well as and potentially the value of any cryptocurrencies we hold or expects to acquire for our own\naccount and harm investors.\nThere are risks related to technological obsolescence, the vulnerability of the global supply chain for bitcoin hardware disruption, and difficulty in\nobtaining new hardware which may have a negative effect on our business.\nOur mining operations can only be successful and ultimately profitable if the costs, including hardware and electricity costs, associated with\nmining cryptocurrencies are lower than the price of a bitcoin. As our mining facility operates, our miners experience ordinary wear and tear, and may also\nface more significant malfunctions caused by a number of extraneous factors beyond our control. The degradation of our miners will require us to, over\ntime, replace those miners which are no longer functional. Additionally, as the technology evolves, we may be required to acquire newer models of miners\nto remain competitive in the market. Reports have been released which indicate that miner manufacturer or seller adjusts the prices of its miners according\nto bitcoin prices, so the cost of new machines is unpredictable but could be extremely high. As a result, at times, we may obtain miners and other hardware\nfrom third parties at premium prices, to the extent they are available. This upgrading process requires substantial capital investment, and we may face\nchallenges. Further, the global supply chain for bitcoin miners is presently heavily dependent on China, which has been severely affected by the emergence\nof the COVID-19 coronavirus global pandemic. The global reliance on China as a main supplier of bitcoin miners has been called into question in the wake\nof the COVID-19 pandemic. Should similar outbreaks or other disruptions to the China-based global supply chain for bitcoin hardware occur, we may not\nbe able to obtain adequate replacement parts for our existing miners or to obtain additional miners from the manufacturer on a timely basis. Such events\ncould have a material adverse effect on our ability to pursue our new strategy, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and the value of\nour ordinary shares.\n20\nOur reliance primarily on a single model of miner may subject our operations to increased risk of mine failure.\nThe performance and reliability of our miners and our technology is critical to our reputation and our operations. Because we currently only use\nMicroBT miners, if there are issues with those machines, our entire system could be affected. Any system error or failure may significantly delay response\ntimes or even cause our system to fail. Any disruption in our ability to continue mining could result in lower yields and harm our reputation and business.\nAny exploitable weakness, flaw, or error common to MicroBT miners affects all our miners, if a defect other flaw is exploited, our entire mine could go\noffline simultaneously. Any interruption, delay or system failure could result in financial losses, a decrease in the trading price of our common stock and\ndamage to our reputation.\nThe Company’s reliance on a third-party mining pool service provider for our mining revenue payouts may have a negative impact on the Company\noperations.\nWe use third–party mining pools to receive our mining rewards from the network. Mining pools allow miners to combine their processing power,\nincreasing their chances of solving a block and getting paid by the network. The rewards are distributed by the pool operator, proportionally to our\ncontribution to the pool’s overall mining power, used to generate each block. Should the pool operator’s system suffer downtime due to a cyber-attack,\nsoftware malfunction or other similar issues, it will negatively impact our ability to mine and receive revenue. Furthermore, we are dependent on the\naccuracy of the mining pool operator’s record keeping to accurately record the total processing power provided to the pool for a given bitcoin mining\napplication in order to assess the proportion of that total processing power we provided. While we have internal methods of tracking both our power\nprovided and the total used by the pool, the mining pool operator uses its own record-keeping to determine our proportion of a given reward. We have little\nmeans of recourse against the mining pool operator if we determine the proportion of the reward paid out to us by the mining pool operator is incorrect,\nother than leaving the pool. If we are unable to consistently obtain accurate proportionate rewards from our mining pool operators, we may experience\nreduced reward for our efforts, which would have an adverse effect on our business and operations.\nThe bitcoin for which we mine, bitcoin, is subject to halving; the bitcoin reward for successfully uncovering a block will halve several times in the\nfuture and their value may not adjust to compensate us for the reduction in the rewards we receive from our mining efforts.\nHalving is a process designed to control the overall supply and reduce the risk of inflation in cryptocurrencies using a Proof-of-Work consensus\nalgorithm. At a predetermined block, the mining reward is cut in half, hence the term “halving.” For bitcoin, the reward was initially set at 50 bitcoin\ncurrency rewards per block and this was cut in half to 25 in November 28, 2012 at block 210,000 and again to 12.5 on July 9, 2016 at block 420,000 and in\nMay 2020 at block 630,000 when the reward reduced to 6.25. This process will reoccur until the total amount of bitcoin currency rewards issued reaches 21\nmillion, which is expected around 2140. While bitcoin prices have had a history of price fluctuations around the halving of its bitcoin rewards, there is no\nguarantee that the price change will be favorable or would compensate for the reduction in mining reward. If a corresponding and proportionate increase in\nthe trading price of bitcoin does not follow these anticipated halving events, the revenue we earn from our mining operations would see a corresponding\ndecrease, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\n21\nOur future success will depend in large part upon the value of bitcoin; the value of bitcoin may be subject to pricing risk and has historically been\nsubject to wide swings.\nOur operating results will depend in large part upon the value of bitcoin because it’s the primary bitcoin we currently mine. Specifically, our\nrevenues from our bitcoin mining operations are based upon two factors: (1) the number of bitcoin rewards we successfully mine and (2) the value of\nbitcoin. In addition, our operating results are directly impacted by changes in the value of bitcoin, because under the value measurement model, both\nrealized and unrealized changes will be reflected in our statement of operations (i.e., we will be marking bitcoin to fair value each quarter). This means that\nour operating results will be subject to swings based upon increases or decreases in the value of bitcoin. Furthermore, our strategy focuses almost entirely\non bitcoin (as opposed to other cryptocurrencies). Further, our current application-specific integrated circuit (“ASIC”) machines (which we refer to as\n“miners”) are principally utilized for mining bitcoin and bitcoin cash and cannot mine other cryptocurrencies, such as ether, that are not mined utilizing the\n“SHA-256 algorithm.” If other cryptocurrencies were to achieve acceptance at the expense of bitcoin or bitcoin cash causing the value of bitcoin or bitcoin\ncash to decline, or if bitcoin were to switch its proof of work algorithm from SHA-256 to another algorithm for which our miners are not specialized, or the\nvalue of bitcoin or bitcoin cash were to decline for other reasons, particularly if such decline were significant or over an extended period of time, our\noperating results would be adversely affected, and there could be a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our\nnew strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations, and harm investors.\nBitcoin and other bitcoin market prices, which have historically been volatile and are impacted by a variety of factors (including those discussed\nbelow), are determined primarily using data from various exchanges, over-the-counter markets and derivative platforms. Furthermore, such prices may be\nsubject to factors such as those that impact commodities, more so than business activities, which could be subjected to additional influence from fraudulent\nor illegitimate actors, real or perceived scarcity, and political, economic, regulatory or other conditions. Pricing may be the result of, and may continue to\nresult in, speculation regarding future appreciation in the value of cryptocurrencies, or our share price, inflating and making their market prices more\nvolatile or creating “bubble” type risks for both bitcoin and shares of our ordinary shares.\nWe may not be able to realize the benefits of forks.\nTo the extent that a significant majority of users and miners on a bitcoin network install software that changes the bitcoin network or properties of\na bitcoin, including the irreversibility of transactions and limitations on the mining of new bitcoin, the bitcoin network would be subject to new protocols\nand software. However, if less than a significant majority of users and miners on the bitcoin network consent to the proposed modification, and the\nmodification is not compatible with the software prior to its modification, the consequence would be what is known as a “fork” of the network, with one\nprong running the pre-modified software and the other running the modified software. The effect of such a fork would be the existence of two versions of\nthe bitcoin running in parallel, yet lacking interchangeability and necessitating exchange-type transaction to convert currencies between the two forks.\nAdditionally, it may be unclear following a fork which fork represents the original asset and which is the new asset. Different metrics adopted by industry\nparticipants to determine which is the original asset include: referring to the wishes of the core developers of a bitcoin, blockchains with the greatest\namount of hashing power contributed by miners or validators; or blockchains with the longest chain. A fork in the network of a particular bitcoin could\nadversely affect an investment in our Company or our ability to operate.\nWe may not be able to realize the economic benefit of a fork, either immediately or ever, which could adversely affect an investment in our\nsecurities. If we hold a bitcoin at the time of a hard fork into two cryptocurrencies, industry standards would dictate that we would be expected to hold an\nequivalent amount of the old and new assets following the fork. However, we may not be able, or it may not be practical, to secure or realize the economic\nbenefit of the new asset for various reasons. For instance, we may determine that there is no safe or practical way to custody the new asset, that trying to do\nso may pose an unacceptable risk to our holdings in the old asset, or that the costs of taking possession and/or maintaining ownership of the new bitcoin\nexceed the benefits of owning the new bitcoin. Additionally, laws, regulation or other factors may prevent us from benefitting from the new asset even if\nthere is a safe and practical way to custody and secure the new asset.\n22\nThere is a possibility of bitcoin mining algorithms transitioning to proof of stake validation and other mining related risks, which could make us less\ncompetitive and ultimately adversely affect our business and the value of our stock.\nProof of stake is an alternative method in validating bitcoin transactions. Should the algorithm shift from a proof of work validation method to a\nproof of stake method, mining would require less energy and may render any company that maintains advantages in the current climate (for example, from\nlower priced electricity, processing, real estate, or hosting) less competitive. We, as a result of our efforts to optimize and improve the efficiency of our\nbitcoin mining operations, may be exposed to the risk in the future of losing the benefit of our capital investments and the competitive advantage we hope\nto gain form this as a result, and may be negatively impacted if a switch to proof of stake validation were to occur. This may additionally have an impact on\nother various investments of ours. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our business\nstrategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other\ncryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account.\nTo the extent that the profit margins of bitcoin mining operations are not high, operators of bitcoin mining operations are more likely to immediately\nsell bitcoin rewards earned by mining in the market, thereby constraining growth of the price of bitcoin that could adversely impact us, and similar\nactions could affect other cryptocurrencies.\nOver the past two years, bitcoin mining operations have evolved from individual users mining with computer processors, graphics processing units\nand first-generation ASIC servers. Currently, new processing power is predominantly added by incorporated and unincorporated “professionalized” mining\noperations. Professionalized mining operations may use proprietary hardware or sophisticated ASIC machines acquired from ASIC manufacturers. They\nrequire the investment of significant capital for the acquisition of this hardware, the leasing of operating space (often in data centers or warehousing\nfacilities), incurring of electricity costs and the employment of technicians to operate the mining farms. As a result, professionalized mining operations are\nof a greater scale than prior miners and have more defined and regular expenses and liabilities. These regular expenses and liabilities require\nprofessionalized mining operations to maintain profit margins on the sale of bitcoin. To the extent the price of bitcoin declines and such profit margin is\nconstrained, professionalized miners are incentivized to more immediately sell bitcoin earned from mining operations, whereas it is believed that individual\nminers in past years were more likely to hold newly mined bitcoin for more extended periods. The immediate selling of newly mined bitcoin greatly\nincreases the trading volume of bitcoin, creating downward pressure on the market price of bitcoin rewards.\nThe extent to which the value of bitcoin mined by a professionalized mining operation exceeds the allocable capital and operating costs\ndetermines the profit margin of such operation. A professionalized mining operation may be more likely to sell a higher percentage of its newly mined\nbitcoin rapidly if it is operating at a low profit margin and it may partially or completely cease operations if its profit margin is negative. In a low profit\nmargin environment, a higher percentage could be sold more rapidly, thereby potentially depressing bitcoin prices. Lower bitcoin prices could result in\nfurther tightening of profit margins for professionalized mining operations creating a network effect that may further reduce the price of bitcoin until\nmining operations with higher operating costs become unprofitable forcing them to reduce mining power or cease mining operations temporarily.\n23\nIf a malicious actor or botnet obtains control of more than 50% of the processing power on a bitcoin network, such actor or botnet could manipulate\nblockchains to adversely affect us, which would adversely affect an investment in us or our ability to operate.\nIf a malicious actor or botnet (a volunteer or hacked collection of computers controlled by networked software coordinating the actions of the\ncomputers) obtains a majority of the processing power dedicated to mining a bitcoin, it may be able to alter blockchains on which transactions of bitcoin\nreside and rely by constructing fraudulent blocks or preventing certain transactions from completing in a timely manner, or at all. The malicious actor or\nbotnet could control, exclude or modify the ordering of transactions, though it could not generate new units or transactions using such control. The\nmalicious actor could “double-spend” its own bitcoin (i.e., spend the same bitcoin in more than one transaction) and prevent the confirmation of other\nusers’ transactions for as long as it maintained control. To the extent that such malicious actor or botnet does not yield its control of the processing power\non the network or the bitcoin community does not reject the fraudulent blocks as malicious, reversing any changes made to blockchains may not be\npossible. The foregoing description is not the only means by which the entirety of blockchains or cryptocurrencies may be compromised but is only an\nexample.\nAlthough there are no known reports of malicious activity or control of blockchains achieved through controlling over 50% of the processing\npower on the network, it is believed that certain mining pools may have exceeded the 50% threshold in bitcoin. The possible crossing of the 50% threshold\nindicates a greater risk that a single mining pool could exert authority over the validation of bitcoin transactions. To the extent that the bitcoin ecosystem,\nand the administrators of mining pools, do not act to ensure greater decentralization of bitcoin mining processing power, the feasibility of a malicious actor\nobtaining control of the processing power will increase because the botnet or malicious actor could compromise more than 50% mining pool and thereby\ngain control of blockchain, whereas if the blockchain remains decentralized it is inherently more difficult for the botnet of malicious actor to aggregate\nenough processing power to gain control of the blockchain, may adversely affect an investment in our common stock. Such lack of controls and responses\nto such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or\notherwise acquire or hold for our own account, and harm investors.\nCryptocurrencies, including those maintained by or for us, may be exposed to cybersecurity threats and hacks.\nAs with any computer code generally, flaws in bitcoin codes may be exposed by malicious actors. Several errors and defects have been found\npreviously, including those that disabled some functionality for users and exposed users’ information. Exploitations of flaws in the source code that allow\nmalicious actors to take or create money have previously occurred. Despite our efforts and processes to prevent breaches, our devices, as well as our\nminers, computer systems and those of third parties that we use in our operations, are vulnerable to cyber security risks, including cyber-attacks such as\nviruses and worms, phishing attacks, denial-of-service attacks, physical or electronic break-ins, employee theft or misuse, and similar disruptions from\nunauthorized tampering with our miners and computer systems or those of third parties that we use in our operations. Such events could have a material\nadverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our business strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own\naccount.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our need for significant electrical power. Government regulators may potentially restrict the ability of electricity\nsuppliers to provide electricity to mining operations, such as ours.\nThe operation of a bitcoin or other bitcoin mine can require massive amounts of electrical power. Further, our mining operations can only be\nsuccessful and ultimately profitable if the costs, including electrical power costs, associated with mining a bitcoin are lower than the price of a bitcoin. As a\nresult, any mine we establish can only be successful if we can obtain sufficient electrical power for that mine on a cost-effective basis, and our\nestablishment of new mines requires us to find locations where that is the case. There may be significant competition for suitable mine locations, and\ngovernment regulators may potentially restrict the ability of electricity suppliers to provide electricity to mining operations in times of electricity shortage,\nor may otherwise potentially restrict or prohibit the provision or electricity to mining operations. Additionally, our mines could be materially adversely\naffected by a power outage. Given the power requirement, it would not be feasible to run miners on back-up power generators in the event of a government\nrestriction on electricity or a power outage. If we are unable to receive adequate power supply and are forced to reduce our operations due to the\navailability or cost of electrical power, our business would experience materially negative impacts.\n24\nIf the award of bitcoin rewards, for us primarily bitcoin for solving blocks and transaction fees are not sufficiently high, we may not have an adequate\nincentive to continue mining and may cease mining operations, which will likely lead to our failure to achieve profitability.\nAs the number of bitcoin rewards awarded for solving a block in a blockchain decreases, our ability to achieve profitability worsens. Decreased\nuse and demand for bitcoin rewards may adversely affect our incentive to expend processing power to solve blocks. If the award of bitcoin rewards for\nsolving blocks and transaction fees are not sufficiently high, we may not have an adequate incentive to continue mining and may cease our mining\noperations. For instance, the current fixed reward for solving a new block on the bitcoin blockchain is twelve and a half bitcoin currency rewards per block,\nwhich decreased from 25 bitcoin in July 2016. It is estimated that it will halve again in about one year. This reduction may result in a reduction in the\naggregate hash rate of the bitcoin network as the incentive for miners decreases. Miners ceasing operations would reduce the collective processing power\non the network, which would adversely affect the confirmation process for transactions (i.e., temporarily decreasing the speed at which blocks are added to\na blockchain until the next scheduled adjustment in difficulty for block solutions) and make bitcoin networks more vulnerable to a malicious actor or botnet\nobtaining control in excess of 50 percent of the processing power active on a blockchain, potentially permitting such actor or botnet to manipulate a\nblockchain in a manner that adversely affects our activities. A reduction in confidence in the confirmation process or processing power of the network could\nresult and be irreversible. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise\nacquire or hold for our own account.\nWe may not adequately respond to price fluctuations and rapidly changing technology, which may negatively affect our business.\nCompetitive conditions within the bitcoin industry require that we use sophisticated technology in the operation of our business. The industry for\nblockchain technology is characterized by rapid technological changes, new product introductions, enhancements and evolving industry standards. New\ntechnologies, techniques or products could emerge that might offer better performance than the software and other technologies we currently utilize, and we\nmay have to manage transitions to these new technologies to remain competitive. We may not be successful, generally or relative to our competitors in the\nbitcoin industry, in timely implementing new technology into our systems, or doing so in a cost-effective manner. During the course of implementing any\nsuch new technology into our operations, we may experience system interruptions and failures during such implementation. Furthermore, there can be no\nassurances that we will recognize, in a timely manner or at all, the benefits that we may expect as a result of our implementing new technology into our\noperations. As a result, our business and operations may suffer, and there may be adverse effects on the price of our common stock.\nRisks related to our Digital Advertising Business\nWe are dependent on our relationship with Xinhua New Media\nOur digital advertising business is dependent on our relationship with Xinhua New Media, the operator of the Xinhua app. The 5-year agreement\nwith Xinhua New Media expired in 2019 but by unwritten consent, we still have access to the New Xinhua app and place advertisements on behalf of our\nclients.\nWe may not be able to attract new clients and retain key staff\nCertain of our staff are key to the above relationship and should we fail to retain these staff, it may jeopardize our ability to continue to provide\nsuch a service to our clients. We are also limited in our ability to attract new clients because of our limited number of staff.\nOur business is largely centered in Beijing and the neighboring cities\nOur base is in Beijing and we have had difficulties serving clients that are not physically nearby. This limits our reach to clients in other major\ncities in China.\nRisks Involving Intellectual Property\nBitcoin and bitcoin mining is software related\nWe actively use specific hardware and software for our bitcoin mining operation. In certain cases, source code and other software assets may be\nsubject to an open source license, as much technology development underway in this sector is open source. For these works, the company intends to adhere\nto the terms of any license agreements that may be in place.\nWe do not currently own, and do not have any current plans to seek, any patents in connection with our existing and planned blockchain and\ncryptocurrency related operations. We do expect to rely upon trade secrets, trademarks, service marks, trade names, copyrights and other intellectual\nproperty rights and expect to license the use of intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others. In addition, we have developed and may further\ndevelop certain proprietary software applications for purposes of our cryptocurrency mining operation.\nOur platform may be subject to damage, interruptions or delays that may adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nIn the event of a platform outage and physical data loss, our ability to perform our bitcoin mining operations would be materially and adversely\naffected. The satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our platform are critical to our operations. Much of our system hardware is hosted in\nleased facilities located in Wuhai, Zhundong, Xilinhot and Sichuan China that is operated by our IT staff. We also maintain a real-time backup system at a\nseparate facility also located in Wuhai, China. Our operations depend on our ability to protect our systems against damage or interruption from natural\ndisasters, power or telecommunications failures, air quality issues, environmental conditions, computer viruses or attempts to harm our systems, criminal\nacts and similar events. If there is a lapse in service or damage to our leased Shanghai facilities, we could experience interruptions in our service as well as\ndelays and additional expense in arranging new facilities.\n25\nAny interruptions or delays in our service, whether as a result of third-party errors, our errors, natural disasters or security breaches, whether\naccidental or willful, could harm our operations and/or reputation. Additionally, in the event of damage or interruption, our insurance policies may not\nadequately compensate us for any losses that we may incur. Our disaster recovery plan has not been tested under actual disaster conditions, and we may not\nhave sufficient capacity to recover all data and services in the event of an outage. These factors could prevent us from mining bitcoins, damage our brand\nand reputation, divert our employees’ attention, subject us to liability, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nOur platform and internal systems rely on software that is highly technical, and if it contains undetected errors, our business could be adversely\naffected.\nOur platform and internal systems rely on software that is highly technical and complex. In addition, our platform and internal systems depend on\nthe ability of such software to store, retrieve, process and manage immense amounts of data. The software on which we rely has contained, and may now or\nin the future contain, undetected errors or bugs. Some errors may only be discovered after the code has been released for external or internal use. Any\nerrors, bugs or defects discovered in the software on which we rely could result in harm to our reputation, or liability for damages, any of which could\nadversely affect our business, results of operations and financial conditions.\nWe may not be able to prevent others from unauthorized use of our intellectual property, which could harm our business and competitive position.\nWe regard our trademarks, domain names, know-how, proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we\nrely on a combination of intellectual property laws and contractual arrangements, including confidentiality and non-compete agreements with our\nemployees and others to protect our proprietary rights. See “Item 4. Information of the Company —Intellectual Property” and “Regulation—Regulation on\nIntellectual Property Rights.” Thus, we cannot assure you that any of our intellectual property rights would not be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or\nmisappropriated, or such intellectual property will be sufficient to provide us with competitive advantages. In addition, because of the rapid pace of\ntechnological change in our industry, parts of our business rely on technologies developed or licensed by third parties, and we may not be able to obtain or\ncontinue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties on reasonable terms, or at all.\nIt is often difficult to register, maintain and enforce intellectual property rights in China. Statutory laws and regulations are subject to judicial\ninterpretation and enforcement and may not be applied consistently due to the lack of clear guidance on statutory interpretation. Confidentiality, invention\nassignment and non-compete agreements may be breached by counterparties, and there may not be adequate remedies available to us for any such breach.\nAccordingly, we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights or to enforce our contractual rights in China. Preventing any\nunauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and costly and the steps we take may be inadequate to prevent the misappropriation of our\nintellectual property. In the event that we resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, such litigation could result in substantial costs and a\ndiversion of our managerial and financial resources. We can provide no assurance that we will prevail in such litigation. In addition, our trade secrets may\nbe leaked or otherwise become available to, or be independently discovered by, our competitors. To the extent that our employees or consultants use\nintellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related know-how and inventions. Any failure in protecting\nor enforcing our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims, which may be expensive to defend and may disrupt our business and operations.\nWe cannot be certain that our operations or any aspects of our business do not or will not infringe upon or otherwise violate trademarks, patents,\ncopyrights, know-how or other intellectual property rights held by third parties. We may be from time to time in the future subject to legal proceedings and\nclaims relating to the intellectual property rights of others. In addition, there may be third-party trademarks, patents, copyrights, know-how or other\nintellectual property rights that are infringed by our products, services or other aspects of our business without our awareness. Holders of such intellectual\nproperty rights may seek to enforce such intellectual property rights against us in China, the United States or other jurisdictions. If any third-party\ninfringement claims are brought against us, we may be forced to divert management’s time and other resources from our business and operations to defend\nagainst these claims, regardless of their merits.\nAdditionally, the application and interpretation of China’s intellectual property right laws and the procedures and standards for granting\ntrademarks, patents, copyrights, know-how or other intellectual property rights in China are still evolving and are uncertain, and we cannot assure you that\nPRC courts or regulatory authorities would agree with our analysis. If we were found to have violated the intellectual property rights of others, we may be\nsubject to liability for our infringement activities or may be prohibited from using such intellectual property, and we may incur licensing fees or be forced\nto develop alternatives of our own. As a result, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\n26\nRisks Related to Doing Business in China\nChanges in China’s economic, political or social conditions or government policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of\noperations.\nAll of our current operations are located in China. Accordingly, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations may be\ninfluenced to a significant degree by political, economic and social conditions in China generally and by continued economic growth in China as a whole.\nThe Chinese economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including the amount of government\ninvolvement, level of development, growth rate, control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources. Although the Chinese government has\nimplemented measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform, the reduction of state ownership of productive assets and the\nestablishment of improved corporate governance in business enterprises, a substantial portion of productive assets in China is still owned by the\ngovernment. In addition, the Chinese government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry development by imposing industrial policies.\nThe Chinese government also exercises significant control over China’s economic growth through allocating resources, controlling payment of foreign\ncurrency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy, and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies.\nWhile the Chinese economy has experienced significant growth over the past decades, growth has been uneven, both geographically and among\nvarious sectors of the economy. The Chinese government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of\nresources. Some of these measures may benefit the overall Chinese economy but may have a negative effect on us. For example, our financial condition\nand results of operations may be adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations. In addition, in the past\nthe Chinese government has implemented certain measures, including interest rate increases, to control the pace of economic growth. These measures may\ncause decreased economic activity in China, and since 2012, and in particular in 2020 as a result of COVID-19,China’s economic growth has slowed down.\nAny prolonged slowdown in the Chinese economy may reduce the demand for our products and services and materially and adversely affect our business\nand results of operations.\nUncertainties in the interpretation and enforcement of Chinese laws and regulations could limit the legal protections available to us.\nThe PRC legal system is based on written statutes and prior court decisions have limited value as precedents. Since these laws and regulations are\nrelatively new and the PRC legal system continues to rapidly evolve, the interpretations of many laws, regulations and rules are not always uniform and\nenforcement of these laws, regulations and rules involves uncertainties.\n27\nFrom time to time, we may have to resort to administrative and court proceedings to enforce our legal rights. However, since PRC administrative\nand court authorities have significant discretion in interpreting and implementing statutory and contractual terms, it may be more difficult to evaluate the\noutcome of administrative and court proceedings and the level of legal protection we enjoy than in more developed legal systems. Furthermore, the PRC\nlegal system is based in part on government policies and internal rules (some of which are not published in a timely manner or at all) that may have\nretroactive effect. This is what, in effect, occurred with regard to our peer to peer lending business. From 2015 to 2019, the guidance for this business from\nthe Chinese government changed from supporting it, to limiting it, to finally shutting it down. As a result, we may not be aware of our violating these\npolicies and rules until sometime after the violation. Such uncertainties, including uncertainty over the scope and effect of our contractual, property\n(including intellectual property) and procedural rights, could materially and adversely affect our business and impede our ability to continue our operations.\nThe PRC government may intervene or influence our operations at any time, or may exert more control over offerings conducted overseas and/or\nforeign investment in China-based issuers, which could result in a material change in our operations and/or cause the value of our securities to\nsignificantly decline or be worthless.\nOur operations in China are governed by PRC laws and regulations. The PRC government has significant oversight over the conduct of our business, and it\nmay influence our operations, which could result in a material adverse change in our operation and/or the value of our securities. Also, the PRC\ngovernment has recently indicated an intent to exert more oversight and control over offerings that are conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in\nChina-based issuers. For example, on July 6, 2021, the relevant PRC government authorities made public the Opinions on Strictly Scrutinizing Illegal\nSecurities Activities in Accordance with the Law, or the Opinions. These opinions emphasized the need to strengthen the administration over illegal\nsecurities activities and the supervision on overseas listings by China-based companies and proposed to take effective measures, such as promoting the\nconstruction of relevant regulatory systems to deal with the risks and incidents faced by China-based overseas-listed companies. On December 28, 2021,\nthe CAC issued the Cybersecurity Review Measures 2021, which required that, among others, network platform operators holding over one million users’\npersonal information shall apply with the Cybersecurity Review Office for a cybersecurity review before any public offering in a foreign country. We\nbelieve we are not subject to a cybersecurity review under the Cybersecurity Review Measures, because our PRC subsidiaries are mainly engaged in digital\nadvertising and none of our PRC subsidiaries is a “network platform operators”. On November 14, 2021, the CAC released the Regulations on the Network\nData Security, or the Draft Regulations, for public comments, which stipulates, among others, that a prior cybersecurity review is required for listing abroad\nof data processors which process over one million users’ personal information, and the listing of data processors in Hong Kong which affects or may affect\nnational security. We believe we are not subject to a cybersecurity review under the Draft Regulations, because none of our PRC subsidiaries is a “data\nprocessor”. Since the Draft Regulations are in the process of being formulated and the Opinions and the Cybersecurity Review Measures 2021 remain\nunclear on how it will be interpreted, amended and implemented by the relevant PRC governmental authorities, it remains uncertain how PRC\ngovernmental authorities will regulate overseas listing in general and whether we are required to obtain any specific regulatory approvals from the CSRC,\nCAC or any other PRC governmental authorities for our offshore offerings. On December 24, 2021, the CSRC released the Provisions of the State Council\non the Administration of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies (Draft for Comments) (the “Administration Provisions”), and\nthe Provisions of the State Council on the Administrative Measures for the Filing of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies\n(Draft for Comments) (the “Measures”). The Administration Provisions and Measures for overseas listings lay out specific requirements for filing\ndocuments and include unified regulation management, strengthening regulatory coordination, and cross-border regulatory cooperation. The Administration\nProvisions and Measures have not yet come into effect as of the date of this report, it is uncertain when the Administration Provision and the Measures will\ntake effect or if they will take effect as currently drafted. Currently, the period for public comment on these draft regulations has ended and their provisions\nand anticipated adoption or effective date are subject to changes and thus their interpretation and implementation remain substantially uncertain. It also\nremains unclear on whether a US-listed company, like us, is subject to the CSRC filing procedures, to maintain the listing of its securities in a foreign\ncountry. If the CSRC, CAC or other regulatory agencies later promulgate new rules or explanations requiring that we obtain their approvals for our future\noffshore offerings, we may be unable to obtain such approvals in a timely manner, or at all, and such approvals may be rescinded even if obtained. Any\nsuch circumstance could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities\nto significantly decline or be worthless. In addition, implementation of industry-wide regulations directly targeting our operations could cause the value of\nour securities to significantly decline. Therefore, investors of our company and our business face potential uncertainty from actions taken by the PRC\ngovernment affecting our business.\n28\nThe PCAOB is currently unable to inspect our auditor in relation to their audit work performed for our financial statements and the inability of the\nPCAOB to conduct inspections or investigation completely over our auditor deprives our investors with the benefits of such inspections.\nOur auditor, the independent registered public accounting firm that issues the audit report included elsewhere in this annual report, as an auditor of\ncompanies that are traded publicly in the United States and a firm registered with the PCAOB, is subject to laws in the United States pursuant to which the\nPCAOB conducts regular inspections to assess its compliance with the applicable professional standards. Since our auditor is located in Hong Kong, a\njurisdiction where the PCAOB found it has been unable to conduct inspections or complete investigations of the audit work performed because of a\nposition taken by the authorities in Hong Kong, our auditor is not currently inspected by the PCAOB. As a result, we and investors in our ordinary shares\nare deprived of the benefits of such PCAOB inspections. The inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections or complete investigations of auditors in China\nand Hong Kong makes it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of our independent registered public accounting firm’s audit procedures or quality\ncontrol procedures as compared to auditors outside of China that are subject to the PCAOB inspections, which could cause investors and potential investors\nin our shares to lose confidence in our audit procedures and reported financial information and the quality of our financial statements.\nOur ordinary shares will be prohibited from trading in the United States under the HFCAA in 2024 if the PCAOB is unable to inspect or fully\ninvestigate auditors located in China, or as early as 2023 if proposed changes to the law are enacted. The delisting of our ordinary shares, or the threat\nof their being delisted, may materially and adversely affect the value of your investment.\nThe HFCAA, which was signed into law on December 18, 2020, states that if the SEC determines that we have filed audit reports issued by a registered\npublic accounting firm that has not been subject to inspection for the PCAOB for three consecutive years beginning in 2021, the SEC shall prohibit our\nshares from being traded on a national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter trading market in the United States. On December 16, 2021, the\nPCAOB issued a report to notify the SEC of its determination that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting\nfirms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong. The PCAOB identified our auditor as one of the registered public accounting firms that the\nPCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely. After we file this annual report on Form 20-F, we may be identified by the SEC under the HFCAA\nas having filed audit reports issued by a registered public accounting firm that cannot be inspected or investigated completely by the PCAOB.\nWhether the PCAOB will be able to conduct inspections of our auditor before the issuance of our financial statements on Form 20-F for the year ending\nDecember 31, 2023 which is due by April 30, 2024, or at all, is subject to substantial uncertainty and depends on a number of factors out of our, and our\nauditor’s control. If our shares are prohibited from trading in the United States, there is no certainty we will be able to list on any stock exchange or trading\nmarkets to facilitate the trading in our securities. Such a prohibition would substantially impair your ability to sell or purchase our ordinary shares when\nyou wish to do so, and the risk and uncertainty associated with delisting would have a negative impact on the price of our ordinary shares. Also, such a\nprohibition would significantly affect our ability to raise capital on terms acceptable to us, or at all, which would have a material adverse impact on our\nbusiness, financial condition, and prospects.\nOn June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed a bill which would reduce the number of consecutive non-inspection years required for triggering the\nprohibitions under the HFCAA from three years to two. On February 4, 2022, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill which contained, among\nother things, an identical provision. If this provision is enacted into law and the number of consecutive non-inspection years required for triggering the\nprohibitions under the HFCAA is reduced from three years to two, then our shares could be prohibited from trading in the United States as early as 2023.\n29\nPRC regulations establish complex procedures for some acquisitions conducted by foreign investors, which could make it more difficult for us to\npursue growth through acquisitions in China.\nThe Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors, adopted by six PRC regulatory agencies in August 2006\nand amended in June 2009, among other things, established additional procedures and requirements that could make merger and acquisition activities by\nforeign investors more time-consuming and complex. In addition, the Implementing Rules Concerning Security Review on the Mergers and Acquisitions\nby Foreign Investors of Domestic Enterprises, or the Rules Concerning Security Review on M&A, issued by the Ministry of Commerce in August 2011,\nspecify that mergers and acquisitions by foreign investors involved in “an industry related to national security” are subject to strict review by the Ministry\nof Commerce, and prohibit any activities attempting to bypass such security review, including by structuring the transaction through a proxy or contractual\ncontrol arrangement. We believe that our business is not in an industry related to national security, but we cannot preclude the possibility that the competent\nPRC government authorities may publish explanations contrary to our understanding or broaden the scope of such security reviews in the future, in which\ncase our future acquisitions and investment in the PRC, including those by way of entering into contractual control arrangements with target entities, may\nbe closely scrutinized or prohibited. Moreover, according to the Anti-Monopoly Law, the SMAR shall be notified in advance of any concentration of\nundertaking if certain filing thresholds are triggered. We may grow our business in part by directly acquiring complementary businesses in China.\nComplying with the requirements of the laws and regulations mentioned above and other PRC regulations to complete such transactions could be time-\nconsuming, and any required approval processes, including obtaining approval from the SMAR, may delay or inhibit our ability to complete such\ntransactions, which could affect our ability to expand our business or maintain our market share. Our ability to expand our business or maintain or expand\nour market share through future acquisitions would as such be materially and adversely affected.\nIn December 2020, the NDRC and the Ministry of Commerce promulgated the Measures for the Security Review of Foreign Investment, which came\ninto effect on January 18, 2021. As these measures are recently promulgated, official guidance has not been issued by the relevant government authority.\nThe interpretation of those measures remains unclear in many aspects such as whether these measures may apply to foreign investment that is implemented\nor completed before the enactment of these new measures. We cannot assure you that our current business operations will remain fully compliant, or we\ncan adapt our business operations to new regulatory requirements on a timely basis, or at all.\n30\nPRC regulation of loans to and direct investment in PRC entities by offshore holding companies and governmental control of currency conversion may\ndelay or prevent us from using offshore funds to make loans or to make additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries.\nUnder PRC laws and regulations, we are permitted to utilize offshore funds to fund our PRC subsidiaries by making loans to or additional capital\ncontributions to our PRC subsidiary, subject to applicable government registration and approval requirements.\nAny loans to our PRC subsidiary, which are treated as foreign-invested enterprises under PRC laws, are subject to PRC regulations and foreign\nexchange loan registrations. For example, loans by us to our PRC subsidiary to finance their activities cannot exceed statutory limits and must be registered\nwith the local counterpart of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE. The statutory limit for the total amount of foreign debts of a foreign-\ninvested company is the difference between the amount of total investment as approved by the MOFCOM or its local counterpart and the amount of\nregistered capital of such foreign-invested company.\nWe may also decide to finance our PRC subsidiaries by means of capital contributions. These capital contributions must be approved by the\nMOFCOM or its local counterpart. In addition, SAFE issued a circular in September 2008, SAFE Circular 142, regulating the conversion by a foreign-\ninvested enterprise of foreign currency registered capital into RMB by restricting how the converted RMB may be used. SAFE Circular 142 provides that\nthe RMB capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of a foreign-invested enterprise may only be used for purposes within the business\nscope approved by the applicable government authority and unless otherwise provided by law, may not be used for equity investments within the PRC.\nAlthough on July 4, 2014, the SAFE issued the Circular of the SAFE on Relevant Issues Concerning the Pilot Reform in Certain Areas of the\nAdministrative Method of the Conversion of Foreign Exchange Funds by Foreign-invested Enterprises, or SAFE Circular 36, which launched a pilot\nreform of the administration of the settlement of the foreign exchange capitals of foreign-invested enterprises in certain designated areas from August 4,\n2014 and some of the restrictions under SAFE Circular 142 will not apply to the settlement of the foreign exchange capitals of the foreign-invested\nenterprises established within the designate areas and such enterprises mainly engaging in investment are allowed to use its RMB capital converted from\nforeign exchange capitals to make equity investment, our PRC subsidiary is not established within the designated areas. On March 30, 2015, SAFE\npromulgated Circular 19, to expand the reform nationwide. Circular 19 came into force and replaced both Circular 142 and Circular 36 on June 1, 2015.\nCircular 19 allows foreign-invested enterprises to make equity investments by using RMB fund converted from foreign exchange capital. However,\nCircular 19 continues to prohibit foreign-invested enterprises from, among other things, using RMB fund converted from its foreign exchange capitals for\nexpenditure beyond its business scope, providing entrusted loans or repaying loans between non-financial enterprises. In addition, SAFE strengthened its\noversight of the flow and use of the RMB capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of a foreign-invested company. The use of such RMB\ncapital may not be altered without SAFE’s approval, and such RMB capital may not in any case be used to repay RMB loans if the proceeds of such loans\nhave not been used. Violations of these Circulars could result in severe monetary or other penalties. These circulars may significantly limit our ability to\nuse RMB converted from offshore funds to fund the establishment of new entities in China by our PRC subsidiary, to invest in or acquire any other PRC\ncompanies through our PRC subsidiary, or to establish new variable interest entities in the PRC.\nIn light of the various requirements imposed by PRC regulations on loans to and direct investment in PRC entities by offshore holding companies,\nwe cannot assure you that we will be able to complete the necessary government registrations or obtain the necessary government approvals on a timely\nbasis, if at all, with respect to future loans to our PRC subsidiary or future capital contributions by us to our PRC subsidiary. If we fail to complete such\nregistrations or obtain such approvals, our ability to use offshore funds to capitalize or otherwise fund our PRC operations may be negatively affected,\nwhich could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business.\n31\nPRC regulations relating to the establishment of offshore special purpose companies by PRC residents may limit our ability to inject capital into our\nPRC subsidiaries, limit our subsidiaries’ ability to increase their registered capital or distribute profits to us, or may otherwise adversely affect us.\nThe Notice on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Administration for PRC Residents to Engage in Financing and Inbound Investment via\nOverseas Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular No. 75, and a series of implementation rules and guidance issued by SAFE, including the circular\nrelating to operating procedures that came into effect in July 2011, require PRC residents and PRC corporate entities to register with local branches of\nSAFE in connection with their direct or indirect offshore investment in an overseas special purpose vehicle, or SPV, for the purposes of overseas equity\nfinancing activities, and to update such registration in the event of any significant changes with respect to that offshore company. SAFE promulgated the\nCircular on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Domestic Residents’ Offshore Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment\nthrough Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular No. 37, on July 4, 2014, which replaced the SAFE Circular No. 75. SAFE Circular No. 37 requires\nPRC residents to register with local branches of SAFE in connection with their direct establishment or indirect control of an offshore entity, for the purpose\nof overseas investment and financing, with such PRC residents’ legally owned assets or equity interests in domestic enterprises or offshore assets or\ninterests, referred to in SAFE Circular No. 37 as a “special purpose vehicle.” The term “control” under SAFE Circular No. 37 is broadly defined as the\noperation rights, beneficiary rights or decision-making rights acquired by the PRC residents in the offshore special purpose vehicles or PRC companies by\nsuch means as acquisition, trust, proxy, voting rights, repurchase, convertible bonds or other arrangements. SAFE Circular No. 37 further requires\namendment to the registration in the event of any changes with respect to the basic information of the special purpose vehicle, such as changes in a PRC\nresident individual shareholder, name or operation period; or any significant changes with respect to the special purpose vehicle, such as increase or\ndecrease of capital contributed by PRC individuals, share transfer or exchange, merger, division or other material event. If the shareholders of the offshore\nholding company who are PRC residents do not complete their registration with the local SAFE branches, the PRC subsidiaries may be prohibited from\ndistributing their profits and proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation to the offshore company, and the offshore company may\nbe restricted in its ability to contribute additional capital to its PRC subsidiaries. Moreover, failure to comply with SAFE registration and amendment\nrequirements described above could result in liability under PRC law for evasion of applicable foreign exchange restrictions. On February 28, 2015, SAFE\npromulgated a Notice on Further Simplifying and Improving Foreign Exchange Administration Policy on Direct Investment, or SAFE Notice 13, which\nbecame effective on June 1, 2015. In accordance with SAFE Notice 13, entities and individuals are required to apply for foreign exchange registration of\nforeign direct investment and overseas direct investment, including those required under the SAFE Circular No. 37, with qualified banks, instead of SAFE.\nThe qualified banks, under the supervision of SAFE, directly examine the applications and conduct the registration.\nIn addition, our shareholders who are PRC entities shall complete their overseas direct investment filings according to applicable laws and regulations\nregarding the overseas direct investment by PRC entities, including certificates, filings or registrations with the MOFCOM and the NDRC, or the local\nbranch of the MOFCOM and NDRC based on the investment amount, invested industry or other factors thereof, and shall also update or apply for\namendment in respect to the certificates, filings or registrations in the event of any significant changes with respect to the offshore investment.\nWe have notified holders of ordinary shares of our company whom we know are PRC residents to register with the local SAFE branch and update their\nregistrations as required under the SAFE regulations described above. We, however, cannot provide any assurances that all of our shareholders who are\nPRC residents will file all applicable registrations or update previously filed registrations as required by these SAFE regulations. The failure or inability of\nour PRC resident shareholders to comply with the registration procedures or other applicable PRC regulations may subject the PRC resident shareholders to\nfines and legal sanctions, restrict our cross-border investment activities, or limit our PRC subsidiaries’ ability to distribute dividends to or obtain foreign\nexchange-dominated loans from our company.\nAs it is uncertain how the SAFE regulations described above will be interpreted or implemented, we cannot predict how these regulations will affect our\nbusiness operations or future strategy. For example, we may be subject to more stringent review and approval process with respect to our foreign exchange\nactivities, such as remittance of dividends and foreign currency-denominated borrowings, which may adversely affect our results of operations and\nfinancial condition. In addition, if we decide to acquire a PRC domestic company, we cannot assure you that we or the owners of such company will be\nable to obtain the necessary approvals or complete the necessary filings and registrations required by the SAFE regulations. This may restrict our ability to\nimplement our acquisition strategy and could adversely affect our business and prospects.\n32\nFluctuations in exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the value of your investment.\nTo date, substantially all of our revenues and expenditures have been denominated in RMB, whereas our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. As a\nresult, fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and RMB will affect the relative purchasing power in RMB terms of our U.S. dollar assets.\nOur reporting currency is the U.S. dollar while the functional currency for our PRC subsidiaries is RMB. Gains and losses from the remeasurement of\nassets and liabilities that are receivable or payable in RMB are included in our consolidated statements of operations. The remeasurement has caused the\nU.S. dollar value of our results of operations to vary with exchange rate fluctuations, and the U.S. dollar value of our results of operations will continue to\nvary with exchange rate fluctuations. A fluctuation in the value of RMB relative to the U.S. dollar could reduce our profits from operations and the\ntranslated value of our net assets when reported in U.S. dollars in our financial statements. This could have a negative impact on our business, financial\ncondition or results of operations as reported in U.S. dollars. If we decide to convert our RMB into U.S. dollars for the purpose of making payments for\ndividends on our ordinary shares or for other business purposes, appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the RMB would have a negative effect on the U.S.\ndollar amount available to us. In addition, fluctuations in currencies relative to the periods in which the earnings are generated may make it more difficult\nto perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations.\nThere remains significant international pressure on the PRC government to adopt a flexible currency policy. Any significant appreciation or\ndepreciation of the RMB may materially and adversely affect our revenues, earnings and financial position, and the value of, and any dividends payable on,\nour ordinary shares in U.S. dollars. For example, to the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars into RMB to pay our operating expenses, appreciation of\nthe RMB against the U.S. dollar would have an adverse effect on the RMB amount we would receive from the conversion. Conversely, a significant\ndepreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar may significantly reduce the U.S. dollar equivalent of our earnings, which in turn could adversely affect\nthe market price of our ordinary shares.\nVery limited hedging options are available in China to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. To date, we have not entered into any\nhedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. While we may decide to enter into hedging transactions in the\nfuture, the availability and effectiveness of these hedges may be limited and we may not be able to adequately hedge our exposure or at all. In addition, our\ncurrency exchange losses may be magnified by PRC exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert RMB into foreign currency. As a result,\nfluctuations in exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on your investment.\nRegulatory bodies of the United States may be limited in their ability to conduct investigations or inspections of our operations in China.\nFrom time to time, the Company may receive requests from certain U.S. agencies to investigate or inspect the Company’s operations, or to\notherwise provide information. While the Company will be compliant with these requests from these regulators, there is no guarantee that such requests\nwill be honored by those entities who provide services to us or with whom we associate, especially as those entities are located in China. Furthermore, an\non-site inspection of our facilities by any of these regulators may be limited or entirely prohibited. Such inspections, though permitted by the Company and\nits affiliates, are subject to the unpredictability of the Chinese enforcers, and may therefore be impossible to facilitate.\nEnhanced scrutiny over acquisition transactions by the PRC tax authorities may have a negative impact on potential acquisitions we may pursue in the\nfuture.\nThe PRC tax authorities have enhanced their scrutiny over the direct or indirect transfer of certain taxable assets, including, in particular, equity\ninterests in a PRC resident enterprise, by a non-resident enterprise by promulgating and implementing SAT Circular 59 and Circular 698, which became\neffective in January 2008, and a Circular 7 in replacement of some of the existing rules in Circular 698, which became effective in February 2015.\nUnder Circular 698, where a non-resident enterprise conducts an “indirect transfer” by transferring the equity interests of a PRC “resident\nenterprise” indirectly by disposing of the equity interests of an overseas holding company, the non-resident enterprise, being the transferor, may be subject\nto PRC enterprise income tax, if the indirect transfer is considered to be an abusive use of company structure without reasonable commercial purposes. As a\nresult, gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to PRC tax at a rate of up to 10%. Circular 698 also provides that, where a non-PRC\nresident enterprise transfers its equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise to its related parties at a price lower than the fair market value, the relevant tax\nauthority has the power to make a reasonable adjustment to the taxable income of the transaction.\n33\nIn February 2015, the SAT issued Circular 7 to replace the rules relating to indirect transfers in Circular 698. Circular 7 has introduced a new tax\nregime that is significantly different from that under Circular 698. Circular 7 extends its tax jurisdiction to not only indirect transfers set forth under\nCircular 698 but also transactions involving transfer of other taxable assets, through the offshore transfer of a foreign intermediate holding company. In\naddition, Circular 7 provides clearer criteria than Circular 698 on how to assess reasonable commercial purposes and has introduced safe harbors for\ninternal group restructurings and the purchase and sale of equity through a public securities market. Circular 7 also brings challenges to both the foreign\ntransferor and transferee (or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer) of the taxable assets. Where a non-resident enterprise conducts an\n“indirect transfer” by transferring the taxable assets indirectly by disposing of the equity interests of an overseas holding company, the non-resident\nenterprise being the transferor, or the transferee, or the PRC entity which directly owned the taxable assets may report to the relevant tax authority such\nindirect transfer. Using a “substance over form” principle, the PRC tax authority may disregard the existence of the overseas holding company if it lacks a\nreasonable commercial purpose and was established for the purpose of reducing, avoiding or deferring PRC tax. As a result, gains derived from such\nindirect transfer may be subject to PRC enterprise income tax, and the transferee or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer is obligated to\nwithhold the applicable taxes, currently at a rate of 10% for the transfer of equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise.\nWe face uncertainties on the reporting and consequences on future private equity financing transactions, share exchange or other transactions\ninvolving the transfer of shares in our company by investors that are non-PRC resident enterprises. The PRC tax authorities may pursue such non-resident\nenterprises with respect to a filing or the transferees with respect to withholding obligation and request our PRC subsidiaries to assist in the filing. As a\nresult, we and non-resident enterprises in such transactions may become at risk of being subject to filing obligations or being taxed, under Circular 59 or\nCircular 698 and Circular 7, and may be required to expend valuable resources to comply with Circular 59, Circular 698 and Circular 7 or to establish that\nwe and our non-resident enterprises should not be taxed under these circulars, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nThe PRC tax authorities have the discretion under SAT Circular 59, Circular 698 and Circular 7 to make adjustments to the taxable capital gains\nbased on the difference between the fair value of the taxable assets transferred and the cost of investment. Although we currently have no plans to pursue\nany acquisitions in China or elsewhere in the world, we may pursue acquisitions in the future that may involve complex corporate structures. If we are\nconsidered a non-resident enterprise under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and if the PRC tax authorities make adjustments to the taxable income of\nthe transactions under SAT Circular 59 or Circular 698 and Circular 7, our income tax costs associated with such potential acquisitions will be increased,\nwhich may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nShareholders may experience difficulties in effecting service of legal process, enforcing foreign judgments, including those obtained in the U.S., or\nbringing actions in China against us or our management based on foreign laws.\nWe are a holding company incorporated under the laws of the British Virgin Islands. We have historically conducted most of our operations in China.\nIn addition, most of our key employees and directors are PRC residents and reside within China. As a result, it may be difficult for our shareholders to\neffect service of process upon us or those persons inside mainland China, including our management. In addition, China does not have treaties providing\nfor the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments of courts with the British Virgin Islands and many other countries and regions. Therefore,\nrecognition and enforcement in China of judgments of a court in any of these non-PRC jurisdictions, including the U.S., in relation to any matter not\nsubject to a binding arbitration provision may be difficult or impossible.\nRisks Related to Our Ordinary Shares\nThe trading price of our common stock is subject to arbitrary pricing factors that are not necessarily associated with traditional factors that\ninfluence stock prices or the value of non-bitcoin assets such as revenue, cash flows, profitability, growth prospects or business activity levels since the\nvalue and price, as determined by the investing public, may be influenced by future anticipated adoption or appreciation in value of cryptocurrencies or\nblockchains generally, factors over which we have little or no influence or control.\n34\nOther factors which could cause volatility in the market price of our common stock include, but are not limited to:\n● actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results or those of companies perceived to be similar to us;\n● actual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\n● commercial success and market acceptance of blockchain and bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies;\n● actions by our competitors, such as new business initiatives, acquisitions and divestitures;\n● strategic transactions undertaken by us;\n● additions or departures of key personnel;\n● prevailing economic conditions;\n● disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\n● sales of our common stock by our officers, directors or significant stockholders;\n● other actions taken by our stockholders;\n● future sales or issuances of equity or debt securities by us;\n● business disruptions caused by earthquakes, tornadoes or other natural disasters;\n● issuance of new or changed securities analysts’ reports or recommendations regarding us;\n● legal proceedings involving our company, our industry or both;\n● changes in market valuations of companies similar to ours;\n● the prospects of the industry in which we operate;\n● speculation or reports by the press or investment community with respect to us or our industry in general;\n● the level of short interest in our stock; and\n● other risks, uncertainties and factors described in this annual report.\n35\nIn addition, the stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of the\nissuer. These broad market fluctuations may negatively impact the price or liquidity of our common stock. When the price of a stock has been volatile,\nholders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the issuer.\nWe may be unable to comply with the applicable continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, which may adversely impact our access\nto capital markets and may cause us to default certain of our agreements.\nOur common stock is currently traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Nasdaq rules require us to maintain a minimum closing bid price of $1.00\nper share of our common stock. The closing bid price of our common stock fell below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive trading days, so we were not in\ncompliance with Nasdaq’s rules for listing standards. Although we regained compliance, there can be no assurance we will continue to meet the minimum\nbid price requirements or any other requirements in the future, in which case our common stock could be delisted.\nIn the event that our common stock is delisted from Nasdaq and is not eligible for quotation or listing on another market or exchange, trading of\nour common stock could be conducted only in the over-the-counter market or on an electronic bulletin board established for unlisted securities such as the\nOTC. In such event, it could become more difficult to dispose of, or obtain accurate price quotations for our common stock and there would likely also be a\nreduction in our coverage by securities analysts and the news media, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline further. In addition, our\nability to raise additional capital may be severely impacted, which may negatively affect our plans and the results of our operations.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could\ndecline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by whether industry or securities analysts publish research and reports about us, our\nbusiness, our market or our competitors and, if any analysts do publish such reports, what they publish in those reports. We may not obtain or maintain\nanalyst coverage in the future. Any analysts that do cover us may make adverse recommendations regarding our stock, adversely change their\nrecommendations from time to time and/or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors. If analysts who may cover us in the\nfuture were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, or if analysts fail to cover us or publish reports about us at all, we\ncould lose (or never gain) visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the stock price of our common stock or trading volume to decline.\nMoreover, if our operating results do not meet the expectations of the investor community, one or more of the analysts who cover our company may change\ntheir recommendations regarding our company and our stock price could decline.\nOur ordinary shares may be thinly traded and you may be unable to sell at or near ask prices or at all if you need to sell your shares to raise money or\notherwise desire to liquidate your shares.\nOur ordinary shares may be “thinly-traded”, meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our ordinary shares at or near bid prices\nat any given time may be relatively small or non-existent. This situation may be attributable to a number of factors, including the fact that we are relatively\nunknown to stock analysts, stock brokers, institutional investors and others in the investment community that generate or influence sales volume, and that\neven if we came to the attention of such persons, they tend to be risk-averse and might be reluctant to follow an unproven company such as ours or\npurchase or recommend the purchase of our shares until such time as we became more seasoned. As a consequence, there may be periods of several days or\nmore when trading activity in our shares is minimal or non-existent, as compared to a seasoned issuer which has a large and steady volume of trading\nactivity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price. Broad or active public trading market for our ordinary shares\nmay not develop or be sustained.\n36\nVolatility in our ordinary shares price may subject us to securities litigation.\nThe market for our ordinary shares may have, when compared to seasoned issuers, significant price volatility and we expect that our share price\nmay continue to be more volatile than that of a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future. In the past, plaintiffs have often initiated securities class action\nlitigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We may, in the future, be the target of similar litigation.\nSecurities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert management’s attention and resources.\nWe are not likely to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe currently intend to retain any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business. Accordingly, we do not expect to pay any\ncash dividends in the foreseeable future but will review this policy as circumstances dictate. Should we determine to pay dividends in the future, our ability\nto do so will depend upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from WFOE. WFOE may, from time to time, be subject to restrictions on its ability to\nmake distributions to us, including restrictions on the conversion of RMB into U.S. dollars or other hard currency and other regulatory restrictions.\nYou may face difficulties in protecting your interests as a shareholder, as the laws of British Virgin Islands provides substantially less protection when\ncompared to the laws of the United States and it may be difficult for a shareholder of ours to effect service of process or to enforce judgements obtained\nin the United States courts.\nOur corporate affairs are governed by our memorandum and articles of association and by the Companies Law (2016 Revision) and common law\nof the British Virgin Islands. The rights of shareholders to take legal action against our directors and us, actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary\nresponsibilities of our directors to us under British Islands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the British Virgin Islands. The common\nlaw of the British Virgin Islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the British Virgin Islands as well as from English\ncommon law. Decisions of the Privy Council (which is the final court of appeal for British overseas territories such as the British Virgin Islands) are\nbinding on a court in the British Virgin Islands. Decisions of the English courts, and particularly the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom and the Court\nof Appeal are generally of persuasive authority but are not binding on the courts of the British Virgin Islands. The rights of our shareholders and the\nfiduciary responsibilities of our directors under British Virgin Islands law are not as clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial\nprecedents in the United States. In particular, the British Virgin Islands has a less developed body of securities laws as compared to the United States and\nprovide significantly less protection to investors. In addition,British Virgin Islands companies may not have standing to initiate a shareholder derivative\naction before the United States federal courts. The British Islands courts are also unlikely to impose liabilities against us in original actions brought in the\nBritish Virgin Islands, based on certain civil liability provisions of United States securities laws.\nAs of December 31, 2021, all of our operations are conducted outside the United States, and substantially all of our assets are located outside the\nUnited States. All of our directors and officers are nationals or residents of jurisdictions other than the United States and a substantial portion of their assets\nare located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for a shareholder to effect service of process within the United States upon these\npersons, or to enforce against us or them judgments obtained in United States courts, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of\nthe securities laws of the United States or any state in the United States.\nAs a result of all of the above, our shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests through actions against us or our officers,\ndirectors or major shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction in the United States.\n37\nWe are a foreign private issuer within the meaning of the rules under the Exchange Act, and as such we are exempt from certain provisions applicable\nto United States domestic public companies.\nWe are a foreign private issuer within the meaning of the rules under the Exchange Act. As such, we are exempt from certain provisions applicable\nto United States domestic public companies. For example:\n● we are not required to provide as many Exchange Act reports, or as frequently, as a domestic public company;\n● for interim reporting, we are permitted to comply solely with our home country requirements, which are less rigorous than the rules that apply\nto domestic public companies;\n● we are not required to provide the same level of disclosure on certain issues, such as executive compensation;\n● we are exempt from provisions of Regulation FD aimed at preventing issuers from making selective disclosures of material information;\n● we are not required to comply with the sections of the Exchange Act regulating the solicitation of proxies, consents or authorizations in\nrespect of a security registered under the Exchange Act; and\n● we are not required to comply with Section 16 of the Exchange Act requiring insiders to file public reports of their share ownership and\ntrading activities and establishing insider liability for profits realized from any “short-swing” trading transaction.\n● We currently intend to file annual reports on Form 20-F and reports on Form 6-K as a foreign private issuer. Accordingly, our shareholders\nmay not have access to certain information they may deem important.\n38\nIf we are classified as a passive foreign investment company, United States taxpayers who own our ordinary shares may have adverse United States\nfederal income tax consequences.\nA non-U.S. corporation such as ourselves will be classified as a passive foreign investment company, which is known as a PFIC, for any taxable\nyear if, for such year, either\n● at least 75% of our gross income for the year is passive income; or\n● the average percentage of our assets (determined at the end of each quarter) during the taxable year which produce passive income or which\nare held for the production of passive income is at least 50%.\nPassive income generally includes dividends, interest, rents and royalties (other than rents or royalties derived from the active conduct of a trade or\nbusiness) and gains from the disposition of passive assets.\nIf we are determined to be a PFIC for any taxable year (or portion thereof) that is included in the holding period of a U.S. taxpayer who holds our\nordinary shares, the U.S. taxpayer may be subject to increased U.S. federal income tax liability and may be subject to additional reporting requirements.\nDepending on the amount of cash we raise in a public offering completed in March 2018, together with any other assets held for the production of\npassive income, it is possible that, for our 2018 taxable year or for any subsequent year, more than 50% of our assets may be assets which produce passive\nincome. We will make this determination following the end of any particular tax year. Although the law in this regard is unclear, we treat our consolidated\naffiliated entities as being owned by us for United States federal income tax purposes, not only because we exercise effective control over the operation of\nsuch entities but also because we are entitled to substantially all of their economic benefits, and, as a result, we consolidate their operating results in our\nconsolidated financial statements. For purposes of the PFIC analysis, in general, a non-U.S. corporation is deemed to own its pro rata share of the gross\nincome and assets of any entity in which it is considered to own at least 25% of the equity by value.\nFor a more detailed discussion of the application of the PFIC rules to us and the consequences to U.S. taxpayers if we were determined to be a\nPFIC, see “Item 10.E. Taxation — United States Federal Income Taxation — Passive Foreign Investment Company.”\nWe expect that our capital expenditures in fiscal year 2022 will be incurred primarily in connection with the purchase of bitcoin mining machines,\nadditional computer equipment and IT server to support our services.\n39\nITEM 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY\nHistory and Development of the Company\nOur Company was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands on May 18, 2021. On August 16, 2021, the Company completed a redomicile merger with its\npredecessor company, Moxian, Inc., a Nevada corporation pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger entered into on May 28, 2021, wherein it acquired\nall the assets, liabilities, rights, obligations and operations of the latter and its subsidiaries, through an exchange of an identical number of its ordinary\nshares.\nOn October 25, 2021, the Board approved to re-designate 50,000,000 of its authorized but unissued ordinary shares of par value of $0.001 each (the\n“Ordinary Shares”) as 50,000,000 preferred shares of par value of $0.00101 each (the “Preferred Shares”) and amend its Memorandum and Articles of\nAssociation, among other things, to specify the rights attaching to the preferred shares. On October 28, 2021, the Company filed its Amended and Restated\nMemorandum and Articles of Association (the “Amended and Restated M&A”) with the British Virgin Islands Registrar of Corporate Affairs. The\nCompany is authorized to issue 150,000,000 Ordinary Shares and 50,000,000 Preferred Shares pursuant to the Amended and Restated M&A.\nOn November 11, 2021, the Board approved to issue 5,000,000 Preferred Shares to Bridgeforrest (BVI) Inc., a holding company owned by Conglin\n(Forrest) Deng , the Chief Executive Officer and an Executive Director of the Company, for gross proceeds of $5,000,000. The shares were issued on\nDecember 1, 2021.\nOn December 28, 2021, in a Special Meeting, the shareholders approved the issue of up to 20 million new ordinary shares of the Company, at a price of\n$2.50 per share to certain non-US based accredited investors. On February 11, 2022, the Company completed this private placement and issued 16,000,000\nnew shares, raising $40 million, which it will use in bitcoin mining in order to diversify its business operations. Of the proceeds raised, $29.8 million was\nused to purchase relevant equipment and the balance will be used as working capital.\nOur predecessor company, Moxian, Inc (“Moxian”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada, United States of America, on October 12, 2010. It was\nuplisted to the Nasdaq Capital Market on November 14, 2016, operating as an O2O enterprise, with two major lines of business mobile applications linking\nsmall and medium enterprises to its network platform and digital advertising through a partnership with Xinhua New Media, which operates the official app\nof the New China News Agency, a state-backed media firm. The mobile app business failed to achieve a meaningful share of the market and incurred huge\nlosses, primarily because users found the Moxian app wieldy and not user-friendly. By September 30, 2018, the Company had to halt this business as it ran\nout of working capital whilst the digital advertising continued.\nThere were discussions with various parties for strategic partnerships between June 2018 to the end of 2020 but none of these business opportunities\nmaterialized.\nIn August, 2021, Moxian, Inc decided to redomicile to the British Virgin Islands through a merger with its wholly-owned subsidiary, Moxian BVI. Moxian\nBVI became the surviving company when the merger was completed in August 2021. In September 2021, the Company appointed a new CEO who was\ntasked to identify new business for the Company in order to broaden its earnings base. Following non-binding expressions of support from some\nshareholders, the Company decided to venture into bitcoin mining and called for a Special Meeting of shareholders in December 2021 to approve related\nproposals as noted above.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the subsidiaries of the Company are as follows:\nCountry of Date of\nName of Company Incorporation Incorporation Principal Activity\nMoxian CN Samoa Limited Samoa February 17, 2014 Investment holding\nMoxian Group Limited British Virgin Islands July 3, 2012 Investment holding\nMoxian (Hong Kong) Limited Hong Kong SAR January 18, 2013 Investment holding\nMoxian Technology Services Internet Technology, Commercial Information\n(Shenzhen) Co.

Peoples’ Republic of China December 10, 2015 Internet Technology\nWoodland Corporation Limited Hong Kong SAR May 8, 2019 Investment Holding\nBeijing Bitmatrix Co. Ltd. Peoples’ Republic of China December 20, 2019 Internet Technology\n40\nOrganization Chart\nThe following diagram illustrates our corporate structure, as of the date of this Report:\nMoxian (BVI) Inc\nOrganization Chart\n41\nBusiness Overview\nBitcoin Mining\nOperations of bitcoin mining\nIn view of the widespread adoption of blockchain technology and bitcoin worldwide, the Company determined to enter the bitcoin mining\nindustry, which is the production of bitcoin. Management believes that bitcoin mining is profitable and its business plan is viable.\nAs of the date of this Report, the Company is in the process of identifying suitable sites in the United States for the sole purpose of mining bitcoin.\nOur facility and mining platform will operate with the primary intent of accumulating bitcoin which we may sell for fiat currency from time to time\ndepending on market conditions and management’s determination of our cash flow needs.\nPerformance Metrics of bitcoin mining\nThe Company operates mining hardware which performs computational operations in support of the blockchain measured in “hash rate” or\n“hashes per second.” A “hash” is the computation run by mining hardware in support of the blockchain; therefore, a miner’s “hash rate” refers to the rate at\nwhich it is capable of solving such computations. The original equipment used for mining bitcoin utilized the Central Processing Unit (CPU) of a computer\nto mine various forms of bitcoin. Due to performance limitations, CPU mining was rapidly replaced by the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), which offers\nsignificant performance advantages over CPUs. General purpose chipsets like CPUs and GPUs have since been replaced in the mining industry by\nApplication Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC) chips like those found in the MicroBT M21S miner currently utilized by the Company at its mining\nfacility. These ASIC chips are designed specifically to maximize the rate of hashing operations.\nThe Company measures our mining performance and competitive position based on overall hash rate being produced in our mining sites. The\nlatest equipment the MicroBT M21S miner, performs in the range of approximately 50 - 58 terahash per second (TH/s) per unit, M20S performs in the\nrange of 64 - 68 TH/s per unit, M10 performs in the range of 31 – 35 TH/s per unit; Bitmain T17+ performs with a maximum hashrate of 64 TH/s per unit;\nInnosilicon T3 performs in the range of 41 – 45 TH/s per unit. This group of mining hardware is on the cutting edge of available mining equipment,\nhowever, advances and improvements to the technology are ongoing and may be available in quantities to the market in the near future which may affect\nour perceived position.\n42\nHalving\nFurther affecting the industry, and particularly for the bitcoin blockchain, the cryptocurrency reward for solving a block is subject to periodic\nincremental halving. Halving is a process designed to control the overall supply and reduce the risk of inflation in cryptocurrencies using a Proof-of-Work\nconsensus algorithm. At a predetermined block, the mining reward is cut in half, hence the term “halving”. For bitcoin, the reward was initially set at 50\nbitcoin currency rewards per block and this was cut in half to 25 in November 28, 2012 at block 210,000 and again to 12.5 on July 9, 2016 at block 420,000\nand on May 11, 2020 at block 630,000 when the reward was halved to 6.25. This process will reoccur until the total amount of bitcoin currency rewards\nissued reaches 21 million, which is expected to occur around 2140.\nNetwork Hash Rate and Difficulty\nIn cryptocurrency mining, “hash rate” is a measure of the processing speed by a mining computer for a specific coin. An individual miner, such as\nRiot has a hash rate total of its miners seeking to mine a specific coin, and system wide there is a total has rate of all miners seeking to mine each specific\ntype of coin. The higher total hash rate of a specific miner, as a percentage of the system wide total hash rate, generally results over time in a corresponding\nhigher success rate in coin rewards as compared to miners with lower hash rates.\nMining Pools\nA “mining pool” is the pooling of resources by miners, who share their processing power over a network and split rewards according to the\namount of work they contributed to the probability of placing a block on the blockchain. Mining pools emerged in response to the growing difficulty and\navailable hashing power that competes to place a block on the bitcoin blockchain.\nThe Company participates in mining pools wherein groups of miners associate to pool resources and earn cryptocurrency together allocated to\neach miner according to the “hashing” capacity they contribute to the pool. As additional miners competed for the limited supply of blocks, individuals\nfound that they were working for months without finding a block and receiving any reward for their mining efforts. To address this variance, miners started\norganizing into pools to share mining rewards more evenly on a pro rata basis based on total hashing capacity contributed to the mining pool.\nThe mining pool operator provides a service that coordinates the computing power of the independent mining enterprise. Fees are paid to the\nmining pool operator to cover the costs of maintaining the pool. The pool uses software that coordinates the pool members’ hashing power, identifies new\nblock rewards, records how much work all the participants are doing, and assigns block rewards for successful algorithm solutions in-proportion to the\nindividual hash rate that each participant contributed to a given successful mining transaction. While we do not pay pool fees directly, pool fees are\ndeducted from amounts we may otherwise earn. Fees (and payouts) fluctuate and historically have been approximately 2% on average.\nMining pools are subject to various risks such as disruption and down time. Riot has internally created software that monitors its hashing\nperformance and reward rates to monitor credits for our contributed hashing power. In the event that a pool experiences down time or not yielding returns,\nour results may be impacted.\nCompetition\nIn bitcoin mining, companies, individuals and groups generate units of bitcoin through mining. Miners can range from individual enthusiasts to\nprofessional mining operations with dedicated data centers. Miners may organize themselves in mining pools. The Company competes or may in the future\ncompete with other companies that focus all or a portion of their activities on owning or operating bitcoin exchanges, developing programming for the\nblockchain, and mining activities. At present, the information concerning the activities of these enterprises is not readily available as the vast majority of\nthe participants in this sector do not publish information publicly or the information may be unreliable. Published sources of information include\n“bitcoin.org” and “blockchain.info”; however, the reliability of that information and its continued availability cannot be assured.\n43\nThe bitcoin industry is a highly competitive and evolving industry and new competitors and/or emerging technologies could enter the market and\naffect our competitiveness in the future. For more information regarding those risk factors known to us, see the section entitled “Risk Factors” herein.\nDigital Advertising\nThe Company’s subsidiary is a general agent for advertisements on the Xinhua app and specializes in the niche fields of mobile games and e-sports. Its\nclients are all corporate entities\nEmployees\nAs required by PRC regulations, we participate in various government statutory employee benefit plans, including social insurance funds, namely\na pension contribution plan, a medical insurance plan, an unemployment insurance plan, a work-related injury insurance plan and a maternity insurance\nplan, and a housing provident fund. We are required under PRC law to make contributions to employee benefit plans at specified percentages of the\nsalaries, bonuses and certain allowances of our employees, up to a maximum amount specified by the local government from time to time. As of the date of\nthis report, we have made adequate employee benefit payments. However, if we were found by the relevant authorities that we failed to make adequate\npayment, we may be required to make up the contributions for these plans as well as to pay late fees and fines. See “Item 3.D. Risk Factors — Risks\nRelated to Doing Business in China — Failure to make adequate contributions to various employee benefit plans as required by PRC regulations may\nsubject us to penalties.”\nWe enter into standard labor and confidentiality agreements with our employees. We believe that we maintain a good working relationship with\nour employees, and we have not experienced any major labor disputes.\nInsurance\nWe provide social security insurance including pension insurance, unemployment insurance, work-related injury insurance and medical insurance\nfor our employees. We do not maintain business interruption insurance or general third-party liability insurance, nor do we maintain product liability\ninsurance or key-man insurance. We consider our insurance coverage to be sufficient for our business operations in China.\nLegal Proceedings\nWe are currently not a party to any material legal or administrative proceedings. We may from time to time be subject to various legal or\nadministrative claims and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Litigation or any other legal or administrative proceeding, regardless of\nthe outcome, is likely to result in substantial cost and diversion of our resources, including our management’s time and attention.\nRegulations\nThis section sets forth a summary of the most significant rules and regulations that affect our business activities in China.\n44\nRegulations Relating to Foreign Investment\nThe Draft PRC Foreign Investment Law\nIn January 2015, the MOFCOM published a discussion draft of the proposed Foreign Investment Law for public review and comments. The draft\nlaw purports to change the existing “case-by-case” approval regime to a “filing or approval” procedure for foreign investments in China. The State Council\nwill determine a list of industry categories that are subject to special administrative measures, which is referred to as a “negative list,” consisting of a list of\nindustry categories where foreign investments are strictly prohibited, or the “prohibited list” and a list of industry categories where foreign investments are\nsubject to certain restrictions, or the “restricted list.” Foreign investments in business sectors outside of the “negative list” will only be subject to a filing\nprocedure, in contrast to the existing prior approval requirements, whereas foreign investments in any industry categories that are on the “restricted list”\nmust apply for approval from the foreign investment administration authority.\nThe draft for the first time defines a foreign investor not only based on where it is incorporated or organized, but also by using the standard of\n“actual control.” The draft specifically provides that entities established in China, but “controlled” by foreign investors will be treated as FIEs. Once an\nentity is considered to be an FIE, it may be subject to the foreign investment restrictions in the “restricted list” or prohibitions set forth in the “prohibited\nlist.” If an FIE proposes to conduct business in an industry subject to foreign investment restrictions in the “restricted list,” the FIE must go through a\nmarket entry clearance by the MOFCOM before being established. If an FIE proposes to conduct business in an industry subject to foreign investment\nprohibitions in the “prohibited list,” it must not engage in the business. However, an FIE that conducts business in an industry that is in the “restricted list,”\nupon market entry clearance, may apply in writing for being treated as a PRC domestic investment if it is ultimately “controlled” by PRC government\nauthorities and its affiliates and/or PRC citizens. In this connection, “control” is broadly defined in the draft law to cover the following summarized\ncategories: (i) holding 50% or more of the voting rights of the subject entity; (ii) holding less than 50% of the voting rights of the subject entity but having\nthe power to secure at least 50% of the seats on the board or other equivalent decision making bodies, or having the voting power to exert material\ninfluence on the board, the shareholders’ meeting or other equivalent decision making bodies; or (iii) having the power to exert decisive influence, via\ncontractual or trust arrangements, over the subject entity’s operations, financial matters or other key aspects of business operations. According to the draft,\nvariable interest entities would also be deemed as FIEs, if they are ultimately “controlled” by foreign investors, and be subject to restrictions on foreign\ninvestments. However, the draft law has not taken a position on what actions will be taken with respect to the existing companies with the “variable interest\nentity” structure, whether or not these companies are controlled by Chinese parties.\nThe draft emphasizes on the security review requirements, whereby all foreign investments that jeopardize or may jeopardize national security\nmust be reviewed and approved in accordance with the security review procedure. In addition, the draft imposes stringent ad hoc and periodic information\nreporting requirements on foreign investors and the applicable FIEs. Aside from investment implementation report and investment amendment report that\nare required at each investment and alteration of investment specifics, an annual report is mandatory, and large foreign investors meeting certain criteria are\nrequired to report on a quarterly basis. Any company found to be non-compliant with these information reporting obligations may potentially be subject to\nfines and/or administrative or criminal liabilities, and the persons directly responsible may be subject to criminal liabilities.\nIn December 2018, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress published a discussion draft of a new proposed Foreign Investment\nLaw, aiming to replace the major existing laws governing foreign direct investment in China. On January 29, 2019, the discussion draft with slight\nrevisions, or the New Draft Foreign Investment Law, was submitted for review. Pursuant to the New Draft Foreign Investment Law, foreign investments\nshall be subject to the negative list management system. The “negative list”, which is issued or approved by the State Council, specifies the special\nmanagement measures for the access of foreign investment in specific areas. If a foreign investor is found to invest in any prohibited industry in the\n“negative list”, such foreign investor may be required to, among other aspects, suspend its investment activities, dispose of its equity interests or assets in\nthe target companies, and forfeit its income. In addition, if a foreign investor is found to invest in any restricted industry in the “negative list”, the relevant\ncompetent department shall require the foreign investor to take the measures to correct itself.\nHowever, the New Draft Foreign Investment Law does not mention the “actual control” as regulated in the previous draft and the position to be\ntaken with respect to existing or future companies with the “variable interest entity” structure. On March 15, 2019, the Foreign Investment Law of the\nPeople’s Republic of China, or the Final Foreign Investment Law, with slight revision, is finally issued and will become effective on January 1, 2020.\nAlthough variable interest entity structures are not included in the Final Foreign Investment Law, it is uncertain whether any interpretation and\nimplementation of the Final Foreign Investment Law or new PRC laws, rules or regulations relating to variable interest entity structures will be adopted or\nif adopted, what they would provide.\n45\nWhen the Final Foreign Investment Law becomes effective, the trio of existing laws regulating foreign investment in China, namely, the Sino-\nforeign Equity Joint Venture Enterprise Law, the Sino-foreign Cooperative Joint Venture Enterprise Law and the Wholly Foreign-invested Enterprise Law,\ntogether with their implementation rules and ancillary regulations, will be abolished. The FIEs established in accordance with the Sino-foreign Equity Joint\nVenture Enterprise Law, the Sino-foreign Cooperative Joint Venture Enterprise Law and the Wholly Foreign-invested Enterprise Law before the Final\nForeign Investment Law becomes effective, may keep their original organizational forms for five years after the effectiveness of the Final Foreign\nInvestment Law. See “Risk Factors—Substantial uncertainties exist with respect to the enactment timetable, interpretation and implementation of draft PRC\nForeign Investment Law and how it may impact the viability of our current corporate structure, corporate governance and business operations.”\nIndustry Catalog Relating to Foreign Investment\nInvestment activities in the PRC by foreign investors are principally governed by the Guidance Catalog of Industries for Foreign Investment, or\nthe Catalog, which was promulgated and is amended from time to time by the MOFCOM and the National Development and Reform Commission.\nIndustries listed in the Catalog are divided into three categories: encouraged, restricted and prohibited. Industries not listed in the Catalog are generally\ndeemed as constituting a fourth “permitted” category. Establishment of wholly foreign-owned enterprises is generally allowed in encouraged and permitted\nindustries. Some restricted industries are limited to equity or contractual joint ventures, while in some cases Chinese partners are required to hold the\nmajority interests in such joint ventures. In addition, restricted category projects are subject to higher-level government approvals. Foreign investors are not\nallowed to invest in industries in the prohibited category. Industries not listed in the Catalog are generally open to foreign investment unless specifically\nrestricted by other PRC regulations.\nOur PRC subsidiary is mainly engaged in providing investment and financing consultations and technical services, which fall into the\n“encouraged” or “permitted” category under the Catalog. Our PRC subsidiary has obtained all material approvals required for its business operations.\nHowever, industries such as value-added telecommunication services (except e-commerce), including Internet information services, are restricted from\nforeign investment. We provide the value-added telecommunication services that are in the “restricted” category through our consolidated variable interest\nentities.\n46\nRegulations on Internet Information Security\nInternet information in China is also regulated and restricted from a national security standpoint. The National People’s Congress, China’s national\nlegislative body, has enacted the Decisions on Maintaining Internet Security, which may subject violators to criminal punishment in China for any effort to:\n(i) gain improper entry into a computer or system of strategic importance; (ii) disseminate politically disruptive information; (iii) leak state secrets; (iv)\nspread false commercial information; or (v) infringe intellectual property rights. The Ministry of Public Security has promulgated measures that prohibit\nuse of the internet in ways which, among other things, result in a leakage of state secrets or a spread of socially destabilizing content. If an internet\ninformation service provider violates these measures, the Ministry of Public Security and the local security bureaus may revoke its operating license and\ntemporarily suspend its websites.\nIn addition, the Guidelines jointly released by ten PRC regulatory agencies in July 2015 purport, among other things, to require internet finance\nservice providers, including peer-to-peer lending platforms, to improve technology security standards, and safeguard customer and transaction information.\nThe PBOC and other relevant regulatory authorities will jointly adopt the implementing rules and technology security standards.\nRegulations on Privacy Protection\nIn recent years, PRC government authorities have enacted laws and regulations on internet use to protect personal information from any\nunauthorized disclosure. Under the Several Provisions on Regulating the Market Order of Internet Information Services, issued by the MIIT in December\n2011, an Internet information service provider may not collect any user personal information or provide any such information to third parties without the\nconsent of a user. An Internet information service provider must expressly inform the users of the method, content and purpose of the collection and\nprocessing of such user personal information and may only collect such information necessary for the provision of its services. An Internet information\nservice provider is also required to properly maintain the user personal information, and in case of any leak or likely leak of the user personal information,\nthe Internet information service provider must take immediate remedial measures and, in severe circumstances, make an immediate report to the\ntelecommunications regulatory authority. In addition, pursuant to the Decision on Strengthening the Protection of Online Information issued by the\nStanding Committee of the National People’s Congress in December 2012 and the Order for the Protection of Telecommunication and Internet User\nPersonal Information issued by the MIIT in July 2013, any collection and use of user personal information must be subject to the consent of the user, abide\nby the principles of legality, rationality and necessity and be within the specified purposes, methods and scopes. An Internet information service provider\nmust also keep such information strictly confidential, and is further prohibited from divulging, tampering or destroying of any such information, or selling\nor providing such information to other parties. An Internet information service provider is required to take technical and other measures to prevent the\ncollected personal information from any unauthorized disclosure, damage or loss. Any violation of these laws and regulations may subject the Internet\ninformation service provider to warnings, fines, confiscation of illegal gains, revocation of licenses, cancellation of filings, closedown of websites or even\ncriminal liabilities. The Guidelines jointly released by ten PRC regulatory agencies in July 2015 also prohibit internet finance service providers, including\nonline peer-to-peer lending platforms, from illegally selling or disclosing customers’ personal information. The PBOC and other relevant regulatory\nauthorities will jointly adopt the implementing rules. Pursuant to the Ninth Amendment to the Criminal Law issued by the Standing Committee of the\nNational People’s Congress in August 2015 and becoming effective in November, 2015, any internet service provider that fails to fulfill the obligations\nrelated to internet information security administration as required by applicable laws and refuses to rectify upon orders, shall be subject to criminal penalty\nfor the result of (i) any dissemination of illegal information in large scale; (ii) any severe effect due to the leakage of the client’s information; (iii) any\nserious loss of criminal evidence; or (iv) other severe situation, and any individual or entity that (i) sells or provides personal information to others in a way\nviolating the applicable law, or (ii) steals or illegally obtain any personal information, shall be subject to criminal penalty in severe situation.\n47\nRegulations Relating to Dividend Withholding Tax\nPursuant to the Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation rules, if a non-resident enterprise has not set up an organization or\nestablishment in the PRC, or has set up an organization or establishment but the income derived has no actual connection with such organization or\nestablishment, it will be subject to a withholding tax on its PRC-sourced income at a rate of 10%. Pursuant to the Arrangement between Mainland China\nand the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Tax Evasion on Income, the withholding tax rate in respect to\nthe payment of dividends by a PRC enterprise to a Hong Kong enterprise is reduced to 5% from a standard rate of 10% if the Hong Kong enterprise\ndirectly holds at least 25% of the PRC enterprise. Pursuant to the Notice of the State Administration of Taxation on the Issues concerning the Application of\nthe Dividend Clauses of Tax Agreements, or Circular 81, a Hong Kong resident enterprise must meet the following conditions, among others, in order to\nenjoy the reduced withholding tax: (i) it must directly own the required percentage of equity interests and voting rights in the PRC resident enterprise; and\n(ii) it must have directly owned such percentage in the PRC resident enterprise throughout the 12 months prior to receiving the dividends. There are also\nother conditions for enjoying the reduced withholding tax rate according to other relevant tax rules and regulations. In August 2015, the State\nAdministration of Taxation promulgated the Administrative Measures for Non-Resident Taxpayers to Enjoy Treatments under Tax Treaties, or Circular 60,\nwhich became effective on November 1, 2015. Circular 60 provides that non-resident enterprises are not required to obtain pre-approval from the relevant\ntax authority in order to enjoy the reduced withholding tax rate. Instead, non-resident enterprises and their withholding agents may, by self-assessment and\non confirmation that the prescribed criteria to enjoy the tax treaty benefits are met, directly apply the reduced withholding tax rate, and file necessary forms\nand supporting documents when performing tax filings, which will be subject to post-tax filing examinations by the relevant tax authorities.\nRegulations on Foreign Currency Exchange\nThe principal regulations governing foreign currency exchange in China are the Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations, most recently\namended in August 2008. Under the PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, such as profit distributions, interest payments\nand trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from SAFE by complying with\ncertain procedural requirements. By contrast, approval from or registration with appropriate government authorities is required where RMB is to be\nconverted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital account items, such as direct investments, repayment of foreign currency-\ndenominated loans, repatriation of investments and investments in securities outside of China. On February 28, 2015, the SAFE promulgated the Notice on\nFurther Simplifying and Improving the Administration of the Foreign Exchange Concerning Direct Investment, or SAFE Notice 13. After SAFE Notice 13\nbecame effective on June 1, 2015, instead of applying for approvals regarding foreign exchange registrations of foreign direct investment and overseas\ndirect investment from SAFE, entities and individuals will be required to apply for such foreign exchange registrations from qualified banks. The qualified\nbanks, under the supervision of the SAFE, will directly examine the applications and conduct the registration.\nIn August 2008, SAFE issued the Circular on the Relevant Operating Issues Concerning the Improvement of the Administration of the Payment\nand Settlement of Foreign Currency Capital of Foreign-Invested Enterprises, or SAFE Circular 142, regulating the conversion by a foreign-invested\nenterprise of foreign currency-registered capital into RMB by restricting how the converted RMB may be used. SAFE Circular 142 provides that the RMB\ncapital converted from foreign currency registered capital of a foreign-invested enterprise may only be used for purposes within the business scope\napproved by the applicable government authority and may not be used for equity investments within the PRC. In addition, SAFE strengthened its oversight\nof the flow and use of the RMB capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of foreign-invested enterprises. The use of such RMB capital\nmay not be changed without SAFE’s approval, and such RMB capital may not in any case be used to repay RMB loans if the proceeds of such loans have\nnot been used. Violations may result in severe monetary or other penalties.\n48\nIn November 2012, SAFE promulgated the Circular of Further Improving and Adjusting Foreign Exchange Administration Policies on Foreign\nDirect Investment, which substantially amends and simplifies the current foreign exchange procedure. Pursuant to this circular, the opening of various\nspecial purpose foreign exchange accounts, such as pre-establishment expenses accounts, foreign exchange capital accounts and guarantee accounts, the\nreinvestment of RMB proceeds derived by foreign investors in the PRC, and remittance of foreign exchange profits and dividends by a foreign-invested\nenterprise to its foreign shareholders no longer require the approval or verification of SAFE, and multiple capital accounts for the same entity may be\nopened in different provinces, which was not possible previously. In addition, SAFE promulgated another circular in May 2013, which specifies that the\nadministration by SAFE or its local branches over direct investment by foreign investors in the PRC must be conducted by way of registration and banks\nmust process foreign exchange business relating to the direct investment in the PRC based on the registration information provided by SAFE and its\nbranches.\nIn July 2014, SAFE issued SAFE Circular 36, which purports to reform the administration of settlement of the foreign exchange capitals of\nforeign-invested enterprises in certain designated areas on a trial basis. Under the pilot program, some of the restrictions under SAFE Circular 142 will not\napply to the settlement of the foreign exchange capitals of the foreign-invested enterprises established within the designated areas and the enterprises\nmainly engaging in investment are allowed to use its RMB capital converted from foreign exchange capitals to make equity investment. However, our PRC\nsubsidiary is not established within the designated areas. On March 30, 2015, the SAFE promulgated Circular 19, to expand the reform nationwide.\nCircular 19 came into force and replaced both Circular 142 and Circular 36 on June 1, 2015. Circular 19 allows foreign-invested enterprises to make equity\ninvestments by using RMB fund converted from foreign exchange capital. However, Circular 19 continues to, prohibit foreign-invested enterprises from,\namong other things, using RMB fund converted from its foreign exchange capitals for expenditure beyond its business scope, providing entrusted loans or\nrepaying loans between non-financial enterprises.\nRegulations on Foreign Exchange Registration of Overseas Investment by PRC Residents\nSAFE issued SAFE Circular on Relevant Issues Relating to Domestic Resident’s Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment through\nSpecial Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular 37, that became effective in July 2014, replacing the previous SAFE Circular 75. SAFE Circular 37 regulates\nforeign exchange matters in relation to the use of special purpose vehicles, or SPVs, by PRC residents or entities to seek offshore investment and financing\nor conduct round trip investment in China. Under SAFE Circular 37, a SPV refers to an offshore entity established or controlled, directly or indirectly, by\nPRC residents or entities for the purpose of seeking offshore financing or making offshore investment, using legitimate onshore or offshore assets or\ninterests, while “round trip investment” refers to direct investment in China by PRC residents or entities through SPVs, namely, establishing foreign-\ninvested enterprises to obtain the ownership, control rights and management rights. SAFE Circular 37 provides that, before making contribution into an\nSPV, PRC residents or entities are required to complete foreign exchange registration with SAFE or its local branch. SAFE promulgated the Notice on\nFurther Simplifying and Improving the Administration of the Foreign Exchange Concerning Direct Investment in February 2015, which took effect on June\n1, 2015. This notice has amended SAFE Circular 37 requiring PRC residents or entities to register with qualified banks rather than SAFE or its local branch\nin connection with their establishment or control of an offshore entity established for the purpose of overseas investment or financing.\nPRC residents or entities who had contributed legitimate onshore or offshore interests or assets to SPVs but had not obtained registration as\nrequired before the implementation of the SAFE Circular 37 must register their ownership interests or control in the SPVs with qualified banks. An\namendment to the registration is required if there is a material change with respect to the SPV registered, such as any change of basic information\n(including change of the PRC residents, name and operation term), increases or decreases in investment amount, transfers or exchanges of shares, and\nmergers or divisions. Failure to comply with the registration procedures set forth in SAFE Circular 37 and the subsequent notice, or making\nmisrepresentation on or failure to disclose controllers of the foreign-invested enterprise that is established through round-trip investment, may result in\nrestrictions being imposed on the foreign exchange activities of the relevant foreign-invested enterprise, including payment of dividends and other\ndistributions, such as proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation, to its offshore parent or affiliate, and the capital inflow from the\noffshore parent, and may also subject relevant PRC residents or entities to penalties under PRC foreign exchange administration regulations. We are aware\nthat our PRC resident beneficial owners subject to these registration requirements. Mr. Erxin Zeng and Mr. Xiaohui Liu have all fulfilled the registration\nunder relevant SAFE regulations.\n49\nRegulations on Stock Incentive Plans\nSAFE promulgated the Stock Option Rules in February 2012, replacing the previous rules issued by SAFE in March 2007. Under the Stock\nOption Rules and other relevant rules and regulations, PRC residents who participate in stock incentive plan in an overseas publicly-listed company are\nrequired to register with SAFE or its local branches and complete certain other procedures. Participants of a stock incentive plan who are PRC residents\nmust retain a qualified PRC agent, which could be a PRC subsidiary of the overseas publicly listed company or another qualified institution selected by the\nPRC subsidiary, to conduct the SAFE registration and other procedures with respect to the stock incentive plan on behalf of the participants. In addition, the\nPRC agent is required to amend the SAFE registration with respect to the stock incentive plan if there is any material change to the stock incentive plan, the\nPRC agent or other material changes. The PRC agent must, on behalf of the PRC residents who have the right to exercise the employee share options, apply\nto SAFE or its local branches for an annual quota for the payment of foreign currencies in connection with the PRC residents’ exercise of the employee\nshare options. The foreign exchange proceeds received by the PRC residents from the sale of shares under the stock incentive plans granted and dividends\ndistributed by the overseas listed companies must be remitted into the bank accounts in the PRC opened by the PRC agents before distribution to such PRC\nresidents.\nRegulations Relating to Employment\nThe PRC Labor Law and the Labor Contract Law require that employers must execute written employment contracts with full-time employees. If\nan employer fails to enter into a written employment contract with an employee within one year from the date on which the employment relationship is\nestablished, the employer must rectify the situation by entering into a written employment contract with the employee and pay the employee twice the\nemployee’s salary for the period from the day following the lapse of one month from the date of establishment of the employment relationship to the day\nprior to the execution of the written employment contract. All employers must compensate their employees with wages equal to at least the local minimum\nwage standards. Violations of the PRC Labor Law and the Labor Contract Law may result in the imposition of fines and other administrative sanctions, and\nserious violations may result in criminal liabilities.\nEnterprises in China are required by PRC laws and regulations to participate in certain employee benefit plans, including social insurance funds,\nnamely a pension plan, a medical insurance plan, an unemployment insurance plan, a work-related injury insurance plan and a maternity insurance plan,\nand a housing provident fund, and contribute to the plans or funds in amounts equal to certain percentages of salaries, including bonuses and allowances, of\nthe employees as specified by the local government from time to time at locations where they operate their businesses or where they are located.\n50\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we leased Units B&C, Block D, Fuhua Tower, 8 Chaoyangmen North Street, Dongcheng District in Beijing at a\nmonthly rental of approximately of $18,900. These office premises of about 560 square metres are too large for our current usage and in March 2022, we\nmoved to a smaller office of about 250 square metres, for which the monthly rental is $9,230 on a two year lease which expires on February 29, 2024. The\nnew office address is Room 1202, Block B, Jiahui Center, 6 Jiqing Li, Chaoyangmenwai Street, Chaoyang District, Beijing.\nITEM 4A. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone\nITEM 5. OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS\nBecause of a change of financial year end from September 30 to December 31, the following discussion considered the results for the year ended December\n31, 2021 against that for the year ended September 30, 2020 in order to have a meaningful comparison.\nThe operating loss of the year was the direct result of the loss of a major client involved in e-sports, an industry which was largely restricted during the year\nbecause of the periodic Covid-19 outbreaks in China. Revenue amounted to only $219,330 during this financial year compared with $946,466 for a similar\n12-month period ended September 30, 2020.\nRecurrent overheads, largely that of office rent and staff costs, increased by 18% for the period due to staff increments and new hires but operating\noverheads swelled to $1,903,554 compared with $873,750 for the previous year. This was due to higher one-off legal fees and other corporate costs\nattributable to the redomicile merger in August 2021 and a charge of $262,500 as placement fees for the 3,000,000 ordinary shares in March 2021.\nThe operating loss for the year was further exacerbated by the provision for doubtful debt amounting to $1,181,916, arising from a dispute with the major\nclient over the development costs of a mobile game which both parties have agreed to jointly develop. The net result was an operating loss of $2,866,140\ncompared with a gain of $72,716 for the year ended September 30, 2020.\nBecause of the availability of past and current losses, there was no provision for taxation.\nThe financial position of the Company improved significantly during the year, following the injection of $3,983,828 from the issue of 3.15 million new\nshares for cash to a fresh group of investors. This enabled the Company to report a cash balance of $2,507,404 at the end of December, 2021. The Balance\nSheet position was further strengthened in December 2021 by the issue of 5 million new preferred shares at $1 per share to the new CEO appointed on\nSeptember 21, 2021. as the Company sought to enter a new business in bit-coin mining in pursuit of additional revenue.Based on the vast experience of the\nnew CEO, the Company is reasonable confident that the new business will provide a steady stream of earnings.\nIn December 2021, at a Special Meeting of shareholders, the Company obtained approval to enter into bitcoin mining as an additional business activity to\ndiversify the earnings base, as the outlook for digital advertising remains bleak. 16 million new ordinary shares were issued in February 2022, of which\n$29.8 million was utilized to purchase equipment and the balance retained as working capital.\nThe Company is hopeful that with this additional business activity, the fiscal year 2022 should see an improvement in its operating results.\nITEM 6.

Our Board of Directors has adopted written charters for\neach of these committees. All our three independent directors are members of the board committees. Our Board of Directors may establish other\ncommittees as it deems necessary or appropriate from time to time.\nAudit Committee\nKhuat Leok Choong, Lionel, Tao Xu and Chuan Zhang currently serve on the Audit Committe, which is chaired by Khuat Leok Choong, Lionel.\nThe Audit Committee will be responsible for, among other matters:\n● appointing, compensating, retaining, evaluating, terminating, and overseeing our independent registered public accounting firm;\n● discussing with our independent registered public accounting firm the independence of its members from its management;\n● reviewing with our independent registered public accounting firm the scope and results of their audit;\n● approving all audit and permissible non-audit services to be performed by our independent registered public accounting firm;\n● overseeing the financial reporting process and discussing with management and our independent registered public accounting firm the interim\nand annual financial statements that we file with the SEC;\n● reviewing and monitoring our accounting principles, accounting policies, financial and accounting controls, and compliance with legal and\nregulatory requirements;\n● coordinating the oversight by our board of directors of our code of business conduct and our disclosure controls and procedures;\n● establishing procedures for the confidential and/or anonymous submission of concerns regarding accounting, internal controls or auditing\nmatters; and\n● reviewing and approving related-party transactions.\nOur Board of Directors has affirmatively determined that each of the members of the Audit Committee meets the definition of “independent director” for\npurposes of serving on an Audit Committee under Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act and NASDAQ rules. In addition, our Board of Directors has determined\nthat Lionel Choong qualifies as an “audit committee financial expert” as such term is currently defined in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K and meets the\nfinancial sophistication requirements of the NASDAQ rules.\n53\nCompensation Committee\nTao Xu, Chuan Zhan and Khuat Leok Choong, Lionel currently serve on the Compensation Committee, which is chaired by Tao Xu.\nThe Compensation Committee will be responsible for, among other matters:\n● reviewing and approving, or recommending to the board of directors to approve the compensation of our CEO and other executive officers\nand directors;\n● reviewing key employee compensation goals, policies, plans and programs;\n● administering incentive and equity-based compensation;\n● reviewing and approving employment agreements and other similar arrangements between us and our executive officers; and\n● appointing and overseeing any compensation consultants or advisors.\nCorporate Governance and Nominating Committee\nChuan Zhan, Tao Xu and Khuat Leok Choong, Lione; currently serve on the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, which is chaired by Chuan\nZhan.\nThe Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will be responsible for, among other matters:\n● selecting or recommending for selection candidates for directorships;\n● evaluating the independence of directors and director nominees;\n● reviewing and making recommendations regarding the structure and composition of our board and the board committees;\n● developing and recommending to the board corporate governance principles and practices;\n● reviewing and monitoring the Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics; and\n● overseeing the evaluation of the Company’s management.\nBoard of Directors\nAll directors hold office until the next annual meeting of shareholders or until their successors have been duly elected and qualified.

We have complied with these requirements in all aspects.\n54\nDirector Independence\nThe Board of Directors has reviewed the independence of our directors, applying the NASDAQ independence standards. Based on this review, the Board of\nDirectors determined that each of Khuat Leok Choong, Lionel, Tao Xu and Chuan Zhan are independent within the meaning of the NASDAQ rules. In\nmaking this determination, our Board of Directors considered the relationships that each of these non-employee directors has with us and all other facts and\ncircumstances our Board of Directors deemed relevant in determining their independence. As required under applicable NASDAQ rules, we anticipate that\nour independent directors will meet on a regular basis as often as necessary to fulfill their responsibilities, including at least annually in executive session\nwithout the presence of non-independent directors and management.\nInvolvement in Certain Legal Proceedings\nTo the best of our knowledge, none of our directors or officers has been convicted in a criminal proceeding, excluding traffic violations or similar\nmisdemeanors, nor has any been a party to any judicial or administrative proceeding during the past five years that resulted in a judgment, decree or final\norder enjoining the person from future violations of, or prohibiting activities subject to, federal or state securities laws, or a finding of any violation of\nfederal or state securities laws, except for matters that were dismissed without sanction or settlement.

Our Board of Directors will determine the appropriate risk level for us\ngenerally, assess the specific risks faced by us and review the steps taken by management to manage those risks. While our Board of Directors will have\nultimate oversight responsibility for the risk management process, its committees will oversee risk in certain specified areas.\nSpecifically, our Compensation Committee will be responsible for overseeing the management of risks relating to our executive compensation plans and\narrangements, and the incentives created by the compensation awards it administers. Our Audit Committee will oversee management of enterprise risks and\nfinancial risks, as well as potential conflicts of interests. Our Board of Directors will be responsible for overseeing the management of risks associated with\nthe independence of our Board of Directors.\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics\nOn September 7, 2016, our Board of Directors adopted a code of business conduct and ethics that applies to our directors, officers and employees.

MAJOR SHAREHOLDERS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nThe following table sets forth information with respect to beneficial ownership of our ordinary shares as of April 30, 2022 by:\n● Each person who is known by us to beneficially own more than 5% of our outstanding ordinary shares;\n● Each of our director, director nominees and named executive officers; and\n● All directors and named executive officers as a group.\nThe beneficial ownership of ordinary shares is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC and generally includes any ordinary shares over which a\nperson exercises sole or shared voting or investment power. For purposes of the table below, we deem shares subject to options, warrants or other\nexercisable or convertible securities that are exercisable or convertible currently or within 60 days of April 30, 2022, to be outstanding and to be\nbeneficially owned by the person holding the options, warrants or other currently exercisable or convertible securities for the purposes of computing the\npercentage ownership of that person but we do not treat them as outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person.\nUnless otherwise indicated below, to our knowledge, all persons named in the table have sole voting and investment power with respect to their shares,\nexcept to the extent authority is shared by spouses under community property laws.\nPercentage of\nNumber of Ordinary\nShares Shares\nBeneficially Beneficially Percentage of\nName of Beneficial Owner Owned Owned(1) Voting Power\nDirectors and Executive Officers:\nConglin Deng, CEO and Director (2) - - 43.4%\nWanhong Tan, CFO - - -\nKhuat Leok Choong, Lionel, Director - - -\nTai Xu, Director - - -\nChuan Zhan, Director - - -\nPanpan Wang, Director * *\nAll directors and executive officers as a group (six individuals) * 43.4%\n5% Beneficial Owners:\nYunxia Li (3) 1,900,000 5.34% 3.75%\nYonghui Tao (4) 1,855,000 5.22% 3.67%\nDanqing Sun (5) 1,820,000 5.12% 3.60%\n(1) The percentage of shares beneficially owned is based on 35,554,677 ordinary shares outstanding as of April 30, 2022.\n(2) Mr. Deng is the sole shareholder of Bridgeforrest (BVI) Inc, which holds 5,000,000 preferred shares of the Company. Each preferred share carries\nthree ordinary votes at meetings of shareholders and as a result, Mr. Deng owns has approximately 43.4% of the outstanding voting power.

Consolidated Statements and Other Financial Information\nSee Item 17 “Financial Statements.”\nLegal Proceedings\nWe are currently not a party to any material legal or administrative proceedings. We may from time to time be subject to various legal or administrative\nclaims and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Litigation or any other legal or administrative proceeding, regardless of the outcome, is\nlikely to result in substantial cost and diversion of our resources, including our management’s time and attention.\nDividend Policy\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our ordinary shares. We anticipate that we will retain any earnings to support operations and to\nfinance the growth and development of our business. Therefore, we do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination\nrelating to our dividend policy will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on a number of factors, including future earnings,\ncapital requirements, financial conditions and future prospects and other factors the board of directors may deem relevant.\nBecause we are a holding company with no operations of our own and all of our operations are conducted through our Chinese subsidiary, our ability to pay\ndividends and to finance any debt that we may incur is dependent upon dividends and other distributions paid.\nPayments of dividends by our subsidiary in China to the Company are also subject to restrictions including primarily the restriction that foreign invested\nenterprises may only buy, sell and/or remit foreign currencies at those banks authorized to conduct foreign exchange business after providing valid\ncommercial documents. There are no such similar foreign exchange restrictions in the British Virgin Islands.\n8B.

Memorandum and Articles of Association\nThe following represents a summary of certain key provisions of our memorandum and articles of association and the BVI Business Companies Act 2004 of\nthe British Virgin Islands, which we refer to as the Act below.\nSummary\nRegistered Office. Under our Amended and Restated Memorandum of Association, the address of our registered office is Floor 4, Banco Popular Building,\nRoad Town, Tortola, VG 1110, British Virgin Islands.\nCapacity and Powers. Under Clause 4(1) of our Amended and Restated Memorandum of Association, we have the capacity to carry on or undertake any\nbusiness or activity, do any act or enter into any transaction.\nDirectors. Under Article 23 of our Articles of Association, no contract or transaction between us and one or more of our Directors (an “Interested Director”)\nor officers, or between us and any of their affiliates (an “Interested Transaction”), will be void or voidable solely for this reason, or solely because the\ndirector or officer is present at or participates in the meeting of our board or committee which authorizes the contract or transaction, or solely because any\nsuch director’s or officer’s votes are counted for such purpose, if:\n(a) The material facts as to the director’s or officer’s relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the our\nBoard of Directors or the committee, and the board or committee in good faith authorizes the contract or transaction by the affirmative votes of a\nmajority of the disinterested directors, even though the disinterested directors be less than a quorum; or\n(b) The material facts as to the director’s or officer’s relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to our\nshareholders entitled to vote thereon, and the contract or transaction is specifically approved in good faith by vote of our shareholders; or\n(c) The contract or transaction is fair as to us as of the time it is authorized, approved or ratified, by the board, a committee or the Shareholders.\nA majority of independent directors must vote in favor of any Interested Transaction and determine that the terms of the Interested Transaction are no less\nfavorable to us than those that would be available to us with respect to such a transaction from unaffiliated third parties.\nOur board shall review and approve all payments made to the founders, officers, directors, special advisors, consultants and their respective affiliates and\nany Interested Director shall abstain from such review and approval.\nRights, Preferences and Restrictions Attaching to Our Ordinary Shares. We are authorized to issue an unlimited number of shares divided into the\nfollowing classes of shares: (i) 150,000,000 ordinary shares, par valur $0.001 per share; and (ii) 50,000,000 preferred shares, par value $0.00101 per share.\nAs of March 31, 2022, 35,544,041 ordinary shares and 5,000,000 preferred shares were outstanding. Each share, regardless if it is part of a class of ordinary\nshares, has the right to one vote at a meeting of shareholders or on any resolution of shareholders, the right to an equal share in any dividend paid by us,\nand the right to an equal share in the distribution of surplus assets. Each preferred share has the right to three votes at a meeting of shareholers or on any\nresolution of shareholders but does not participate in any distribution of the company. We may by a resolution of the Board of Directors redeem our shares\nfor such consideration as the Board of Directors determines.\nAlteration of Rights. The rights attached to any class or series of shares (unless otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the shares of that class or\nseries), whether or not the Company is being wound-up, may be varied with the consent in writing of all the holders of the issued shares of that class or\nseries or with the sanction of a resolution passed by a majority of the votes cast at a separate meeting of the holders of the shares of the class or series.\n58\nMeetings. A meeting of Members may be called by not less than ten (10) clear days’ Notice, but a meeting of Members may be called by shorter notice if\nMembers holding a 50 per cent majority of the total voting rights on all the matters to be considered at the meeting have waived notice of the meeting and,\nfor this purpose, the presence of a Member shall be deemed to constitute a waiver on his part. The notice shall specify the time and place of the meeting\nand the general nature of the business. The accidental omission to give Notice of a meeting or (in cases where instruments of proxy are sent out with the\nNotice) to send such instrument of proxy to, or the non-receipt of such Notice or such instrument of proxy by, any person entitled to receive such Notice\nshall not invalidate any resolution passed or the proceedings at that meeting.\nLimitations on the Right to Own Securities. There are no limitations on the rights to own our securities, or limitations on the rights of non-resident or\nforeign shareholders to hold or exercise voting rights on our securities, contained in our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association\n(or under British Virgin Islands law).\nC. Material Contracts\nWe have not entered into any material contracts other than in the ordinary course of business and otherwise described elsewhere in this annual report.\nD. Exchange Controls\nBVI Exchange Controls\nThere are no material exchange controls restrictions on payment of dividends, interest or other payments to the holders of our ordinary shares or on the\nconduct of our operations in the BVI. There are no material BVI laws that impose any material exchange controls on us or that affect the payment of\ndividends, interest or other payments to nonresident holders of our ordinary shares. BVI law and our memorandum and articles of association do not\nimpose any material limitations on the right of non-residents or foreign owners to hold or vote our ordinary shares.\nPRC Exchange Controls\nUnder the Foreign Currency Administration Rules promulgated in 1996 and revised in 1997, and various regulations issued by SAFE and other relevant\nPRC government authorities, RMB is convertible into other currencies without prior approval from SAFE only to the extent of current account items, such\nas trade related receipts and payments, interest and dividends and after complying with certain procedural requirements. The conversion of RMB into other\ncurrencies and remittance of the converted foreign currency outside PRC for the purpose of capital account items, such as direct equity investments, loans\nand repatriation of investment, requires the prior approval from SAFE or its local office. Payments for transactions that take place within China must be\nmade in RMB. Unless otherwise approved, PRC companies must repatriate foreign currency payments received from abroad. Foreign-invested enterprises\nmay retain foreign exchange in accounts with designated foreign exchange banks subject to a cap set by SAFE or its local office. Unless otherwise\napproved, domestic enterprises must convert all of their foreign currency proceeds into RMB.\nOn October 21, 2005, SAFE issued the Notice on Issues Relating to the Administration of Foreign Exchange in Fund-raising and Reverse Investment\nActivities of Domestic Residents Conducted via Offshore Special Purpose Companies, which became effective as of November 1, 2005. According to the\nnotice, a special purpose company, or SPV, refers to an offshore company established or indirectly controlled by PRC residents for the special purpose of\ncarrying out financing of their assets or equity interest in PRC domestic enterprises. Prior to establishing or assuming control of an SPV, each PRC resident,\nwhether a natural or legal person, must complete the overseas investment foreign exchange registration procedures with the relevant local SAFE branch.\nThe notice applies retroactively. As a result, PRC residents who have established or acquired control of these SPVs that previously made onshore\ninvestments in China were required to complete the relevant overseas investment foreign exchange registration procedures by March 31, 2006. These PRC\nresidents must also amend the registration with the relevant SAFE branch in the following circumstances: (i) the PRC residents have completed the\ninjection of equity investment or assets of a domestic company into the SPV; (ii) the overseas funding of the SPV has been completed; (iii) there is a\nmaterial change in the capital of the SPV. Under the rules, failure to comply with the foreign exchange registration procedures may result in restrictions\nbeing imposed on the foreign exchange activities of the violator, including restrictions on the payment of dividends and other distributions to its offshore\nparent company, and may also subject the violators to penalties under the PRC foreign exchange administration regulations.\n59\nOn August 29, 2008, SAFE promulgated Notice 142 which regulates the conversion by a foreign-funded enterprise of foreign currency into RMB by\nrestricting how the converted RMB may be used. Notice 142 requires that RMB funds converted from the foreign currency capital of a foreign-funded\nenterprise may only be used for purposes within the business scope approved by the applicable governmental authority and may not be used for equity\ninvestments within the PRC unless specifically provided for otherwise. In addition, SAFE strengthened its supervision over the flow and use of RMB funds\nconverted from the foreign currency capital of a foreign-funded enterprise. The use of such RMB capital may not be changed without SAFE’s approval,\nand may not, in any case, be used to repay or prepay RMB loans if such loans are outstanding. Violations of Notice 142 will result in severe penalties, such\nas heavy fines as set out in the relevant foreign exchange control regulations.\nE. Taxation\nBritish Virgin Islands Taxation\nUnder the law of the British Virgin Islands as currently in effect, a holder of our shares who is not a resident of the British Virgin Islands is not liable for\nBritish Virgin Islands income tax on dividends paid with respect to our shares, and all holders of our securities are not liable to the British Virgin Islands for\nincome tax on gains realized on the sale or disposal of such securities. The British Virgin Islands does not impose a withholding tax on dividends paid by a\ncompany incorporated or re-registered under the BVI Act.\nThere are no capital gains, gift or inheritance taxes levied by the British Virgin Islands on companies incorporated or re-registered under the BVI Act. In\naddition, securities of companies incorporated or re-registered under the BVI Act are not subject to transfer taxes, stamp duties or similar charges.\nThere is no income tax treaty or convention currently in effect between the United States and the British Virgin Islands, although a Tax Information\nExchange Agreement is in force.\nPRC Taxation\nUnder the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, or the EIT Law, and its implementation rules that became effective on January 1, 2008, a non-resident\nenterprise is generally subject to PRC enterprise income tax with respect to PRC-sourced income. A circular issued by the State Administration of Taxation\non April 22, 2009 provides that a foreign enterprise controlled by a PRC company or a PRC company group will be classified as a “resident enterprise”\nwith its “de facto management body” located within China if the following requirements are satisfied: (i) the senior management and core management\ndepartments in charge of its daily operations function are mainly in the PRC; (ii) its financial and human resources decisions are subject to determination or\napproval by persons or bodies in the PRC; (iii) its major assets, accounting books, company seals, and minutes and files of its board and shareholders’\nmeetings are located or kept in the PRC; and (iv) at least half of the enterprise’s directors with voting right or senior management reside in the PRC. In\naddition, the State Administration of Taxation issued a bulletin on August 3, 2011, effective as of September 1, 2011, to provide more guidance on the\nimplementation of the above circular. The bulletin clarified certain matters relating to resident status determination, post-determination administration and\ncompetent tax authorities. It also specifies that when provided with a copy of a PRC tax resident determination certificate from a resident PRC-controlled\noffshore incorporated enterprise, the payer should not withhold 10% income tax when paying the PRC-sourced dividends, interest and royalties to the PRC-\ncontrolled offshore incorporated enterprise. Although both the circular and the bulletin only apply to offshore enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises and\nnot those by PRC individuals, the determination criteria set forth in the circular and administration clarification made in the bulletin may reflect the State\nAdministration of Taxation’s general position on how the “de facto management body” test should be applied in determining the tax residency status of\noffshore enterprises and the administration measures should be implemented, regardless of whether they are controlled by PRC enterprises or PRC\nindividuals. If we are deemed to be a PRC resident enterprise, dividends distributed to our non-PRC enterprise shareholders by us, or the gain our non-PRC\nenterprise shareholders may realize from the transfer of our ordinary shares, may be treated as PRC-sourced income and therefore be subject to a 10% PRC\nwithholding tax pursuant to the EIT Law.\n60\nU.S. Federal Income Taxation\nGeneral\nThe following are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences to an investor of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of our securities.\nThe discussion below of the U.S. federal income tax consequences to “U.S. Holders” will apply to a beneficial owner of our securities that is treated for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes as:\n● an individual citizen or resident of the United States;\n● a corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation) that is created or organized (or treated as created or organized) in or under the laws of the\nUnited States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;\n● an estate whose income is includible in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless of its source; or\n● a trust if (i) a U.S. court can exercise primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one or more U.S. persons are authorized to control all\nsubstantial decisions of the trust, or (ii) it has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person.\nIf a beneficial owner of our securities is not described as a U.S. Holder and is not an entity treated as a partnership or other pass-through entity for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes, such an owner will be considered a “Non-U.S. Holder.” The material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the acquisition,\nownership and disposition of our securities applicable specifically to Non-U.S. Holders are described below under the heading “Non-U.S. Holders.”\nThis discussion is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), its legislative history, Treasury regulations promulgated\nthereunder, published rulings and court decisions, all as currently in effect. These authorities are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly on a\nretroactive basis.\nThis discussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to any particular holder of our securities based on such\nholder’s individual circumstances. In particular, this discussion considers only holders that own and hold our securities as capital assets within the meaning\nof Section 1221 of the Code, and does not address the alternative minimum tax. In addition, this discussion does not address the U.S. federal income tax\nconsequences to holders that are subject to special rules, including:\n● financial institutions or financial services entities;\n● broker-dealers;\n● persons that are subject to the mark-to-market accounting rules under Section 475 of the Code;\n● tax-exempt entities;\n● governments or agencies or instrumentalities thereof;\n● insurance companies;\n● regulated investment companies;\n● real estate investment trusts;\n● certain expatriates or former long-term residents of the United States;\n61\n● persons that actually or constructively own 5% or more of our public shares;\n● persons that acquired our securities pursuant to the exercise of employee options, in connection with employee incentive plans or otherwise as\ncompensation;\n● persons that hold our securities as part of a straddle, constructive sale, hedging, conversion or other integrated transaction;\n● persons whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;\n● controlled foreign corporations; or passive foreign investment companies.\nThis discussion does not address any aspect of U.S. federal non-income tax laws, such as gift or estate tax laws, state, local or non-U.S. tax laws or, except\nas discussed herein, any tax reporting obligations applicable to a holder of our securities. Additionally, this discussion does not consider the tax treatment of\npartnerships or other pass-through entities or persons who hold our securities through such entities. If a partnership (or other entity classified as a\npartnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is the beneficial owner of our securities, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in the\npartnership will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. This discussion also assumes that any distributions made\n(or deemed made) by us on our securities and any consideration received (or deemed received) by a holder in consideration for the sale or other disposition\nof our securities will be in U.S. dollars.\nWe have not sought, and will not seek a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) or an opinion of counsel as to any U.S. federal income tax\nconsequence described herein. The IRS may disagree with the description herein, and its determination may be upheld by a court. Moreover, there can be\nno assurance that future legislation, regulations, administrative rulings or court decisions will not adversely affect the accuracy of the statements in this\ndiscussion.\nTHIS DISCUSSION OF THE MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE ACQUISITION, OWNERSHIP AND\nDISPOSITION OF OUR SECURITIES IS NOT TAX ADVICE. EACH HOLDER OF OUR SECURITIES IS URGED TO CONSULT ITS OWN TAX\nADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO THE PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES TO SUCH HOLDER OF THE ACQUISITION, OWNERSHIP AND\nDISPOSITION OF OUR SECURITIES, INCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF ANY STATE, LOCAL, AND NON-U.S. TAX LAWS,\nAS WELL AS U.S. FEDERAL TAX LAWS AND ANY APPLICABLE TAX TREATIES.\nU.S. Holders\nTaxation of Cash Distributions\nSubject to the passive foreign investment company (“PFIC”) rules discussed below, a U.S. Holder generally will be required to include in gross income as\nordinary income the amount of any cash dividend paid on our shares. A cash distribution on such shares generally will be treated as a dividend for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes to the extent paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined under U.S. federal income tax\nprinciples). Such dividend generally will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction generally allowed to domestic corporations in respect of\ndividends received from other domestic corporations. The portion of such distribution, if any, in excess of such earnings and profits generally will\nconstitute a return of capital that will be applied against and reduce (but not below zero) the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in such shares. Any remaining\nexcess will be treated as gain from the sale or other taxable disposition of such shares and will be treated as described under “— Taxation on the\nDisposition of Securities” below.\nWith respect to non-corporate U.S. Holders, dividends on our shares may be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the lower applicable long-term capital\ngains tax rate (see “— Taxation on the Disposition of Securities” below) provided that (1) such shares are readily tradable on an established securities\nmarket in the United States, (2) we are not a PFIC, as discussed below, for either the taxable year in which the dividend was paid or the preceding taxable\nyear, and (3) certain holding period requirements are met. Under published IRS authority, our shares are considered for purposes of clause (1) above to be\nreadily tradable on an established securities market in the United States only if they are listed on certain exchanges, which presently include the NASDAQ\nCapital Market. Although our ordinary shares and warrants are currently listed and traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market, we cannot guarantee that our\nsecurities will continue to be listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the availability of the\nlower rate for any cash dividends paid with respect to our securities.\n62\nPossible Constructive Distributions with Respect to Redeemable Warrants\nThe terms of each redeemable warrant provide for an adjustment to the number of ordinary shares for which the redeemable warrant may be exercised in\ncertain events. An adjustment that has the effect of preventing dilution generally is not taxable. However, the U.S. Holders of the redeemable warrants\nwould be treated as receiving a constructive distribution from us if, for example, the adjustment increases the redeemable warrant holders’ proportionate\ninterest in our assets or earnings and profits (e.g., through an increase in the number of ordinary shares that would be obtained upon exercise) as a result of\na distribution of cash to the holders of our shares, which is taxable to the U.S. Holders of such shares as described under “Taxation of Cash Distributions”\nabove. Such constructive distribution would be subject to tax as described under that section in the same manner as if the U.S. Holders of the redeemable\nwarrants received a cash distribution from us equal to the fair market value of such increased interest.\nTaxation on the Disposition of Securities\nUpon a sale or other taxable disposition of our securities (which, in general, would include a distribution in connection with our liquidation or a redemption\nof redeemable warrants), and subject to the PFIC rules discussed below, a U.S. Holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to\nthe difference between the amount realized and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the securities. See “— Exercise or Lapse of Redeemable Warrants”\nbelow for a discussion regarding a U.S. Holder’s basis in the ordinary share acquired pursuant to the exercise of a warrant.\nThe regular U.S. federal income tax rate on capital gains recognized by U.S. Holders generally is the same as the regular U.S. federal income tax rate on\nordinary income, except that long-term capital gains recognized by non-corporate U.S. Holders generally are subject to U.S. federal income tax at reduced\nrates of tax. Capital gain or loss will constitute long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the securities exceeds one year. The\ndeductibility of capital losses is subject to various limitations.\nAdditional Taxes\nU.S. Holders that are individuals, estates or trusts and whose income exceeds certain thresholds generally will be subject to a 3.8% Medicare contribution\ntax on unearned income, including, without limitation, dividends on, and gains from the sale or other taxable disposition of, our securities, subject to certain\nlimitations and exceptions. Under recently issued regulations, in the absence of a special election, such unearned income generally would not include\nincome inclusions under the qualified electing fund, or QEF rules discussed below under “— Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules,” but would\ninclude distributions of earnings and profits from a QEF. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect, if any, of such tax on their\nownership and disposition of our securities.\nExercise or Lapse of Redeemable Warrants\nSubject to the PFIC rules discussed below, a U.S. Holder generally will not recognize gain or loss upon the acquisition of ordinary shares on the exercise of\nredeemable warrants for cash. Ordinary shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of redeemable warrants for cash will have a tax basis equal to the U.S.\nHolder’s tax basis in the redeemable warrants, increased by the amount paid to exercise the redeemable warrants. The holding period of such ordinary\nshares should begin on the day after the date of exercise of the redeemable warrants. If redeemable warrants are allowed to lapse unexercised, a U.S.\nHolder generally will recognize a capital loss equal to such holder’s adjusted tax basis in the redeemable warrants.\nThe tax consequences of a cashless exercise of redeemable warrants are not clear under current tax law. A cashless exercise may be tax-free, either because\nit is not a realization event (i.e., not a transaction in which gain or loss is realized) or because the transaction is treated as a recapitalization for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes. In either tax-free situation, a U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the ordinary shares received would equal the U.S. Holder’s basis in the\nredeemable warrants. If the cashless exercise were treated as not being a realization event, the U.S. Holder’s holding period in the ordinary shares could be\ntreated as commencing on the date following the date of exercise of the redeemable warrants. If the cashless exercise were treated as a recapitalization, the\nholding period of the ordinary shares received would include the holding period of the redeemable warrants.\n63\nIt is also possible that a cashless exercise could be treated as a taxable exchange in which gain or loss is recognized. In such event, a U.S. Holder could be\ndeemed to have surrendered a number of redeemable warrants with a fair market value equal to the exercise price for the number of redeemable warrants\ndeemed exercised. For this purpose, the number of redeemable warrants deemed exercised would be equal to the number of ordinary shares issued pursuant\nto the cashless exercise of the redeemable warrants. In this situation, the U.S. Holder would recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the\ndifference between the fair market value of the redeemable warrants deemed surrendered to pay the exercise price and the U.S. Holder’s tax basis in such\nredeemable warrants deemed surrendered. Such gain or loss would be long-term or short-term depending on the U.S. Holder’s holding period in the\nredeemable warrants. In this case, a U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the ordinary shares received would equal the sum of the fair market value of the redeemable\nwarrants deemed surrendered to pay the exercise price and the U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the redeemable warrants deemed exercised, and a U.S. Holder’s\nholding period for the ordinary shares should commence on the date following the date of exercise of the redeemable warrants. There also may be\nalternative characterizations of any such taxable exchange that would result in similar tax consequences, except that a U.S. Holder’s gain or loss would be\nshort-term.\nDue to the absence of authority on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a cashless exercise of redeemable warrants it is unclear which, if any, of the\nalternative tax consequences and holding periods described above would be adopted by the IRS or a court of law. Accordingly, U.S. Holders should consult\ntheir tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of a cashless exercise of redeemable warrants.\nPassive Foreign Investment Company Rules\nA foreign (i.e., non-U.S.) corporation will be a PFIC if at least 75% of its gross income in a taxable year of the foreign corporation, including its pro rata\nshare of the gross income of any corporation in which it is considered to own at least 25% of the shares by value, is passive income. Alternatively, a foreign\ncorporation will be a PFIC if at least 50% of its assets in a taxable year of the foreign corporation, ordinarily determined based on fair market value and\naveraged quarterly over the year, including its pro rata share of the assets of any corporation in which it is considered to own at least 25% of the shares by\nvalue, are held for the production of, or produce, passive income. Passive income generally includes dividends, interest, rents and royalties (other than\ncertain rents or royalties derived from the active conduct of a trade or business) and gains from the disposition of passive assets.\nBased on the composition of our assets and the nature of the Company’s income and subsidiaries’ income for our taxable year ended June 30, 2015, we do\nnot expect to be treated as a PFIC for such year and we do not expect to be one for our taxable year ending June 30, 2016 or become one in the foreseeable\nfuture. Nevertheless, the application of the PFIC rules is subject to ambiguity in several respects and, in addition, we must make a separate determination\neach year as to whether we are a PFIC (after the close of each taxable year). Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will not be a PFIC for the current or\nany other taxable year. Moreover, although we do not believe we would be treated as a PFIC, we have not engaged any U.S. tax advisers to determine our\nPFIC status. In addition, if a U.S. Holder owned our ordinary shares at any time prior to our acquisition of Elite, such U.S. Holder may be considered to\nown stock of a PFIC by virtue of the fact that we may have been a PFIC during the period prior to our acquisition of Elite, unless such U.S. Holder made\neither a valid and timely QEF election or a valid and timely mark-to-market election, in each case as described below.\nIf we are determined to be a PFIC for any taxable year (or portion thereof) that is included in the holding period of a U.S. Holder of our shares or\nredeemable warrants and, in the case of our shares, the U.S. Holder did not make either a timely qualified electing fund (“QEF”) election for our first\ntaxable year as a PFIC in which the U.S. Holder held (or was deemed to hold) such shares, a QEF election along with a purging election, or a mark-to-\nmarket election, each as described below, such holder generally will be subject to special rules for regular U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to:\n● any gain recognized by the U.S. Holder on the sale or other disposition of its shares or redeemable warrants; and\n● any “excess distribution” made to the U.S. Holder (generally, any distributions to such U.S. Holder during a taxable year of the U.S. Holder that\nare greater than 125% of the average annual distributions received by such U.S. Holder in respect of the shares or warrants during the three\npreceding taxable years of such U.S. Holder or, if shorter, such U.S. Holder’s holding period for the shares or warrants).\n64\nUnder these rules,\n● the U.S. Holder’s gain or excess distribution will be allocated ratably over the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the shares or redeemable warrants;\n● the amount allocated to the U.S. Holder’s taxable year in which the U.S. Holder recognized the gain or received the excess distribution, or to the\nperiod in the U.S. Holder’s holding period before the first day of our first taxable year in which we are a PFIC, will be taxed as ordinary income;\n● the amount allocated to other taxable years (or portions thereof) of the U.S. Holder and included in its holding period will be taxed at the highest\ntax rate in effect for that year and applicable to the U.S. Holder; and\n● the interest charge generally applicable to underpayments of tax will be imposed in respect of the tax attributable to each such other taxable year\nof the U.S. Holder.\nIn general, if we are determined to be a PFIC, a U.S. Holder may avoid the PFIC tax consequences described above in respect to our shares by making a\ntimely QEF election (or a QEF election along with a purging election, as described below). Pursuant to the QEF election, a U.S. Holder will be required to\ninclude in income its pro rata share of our net capital gains (as long-term capital gain) and other earnings and profits (as ordinary income), on a current\nbasis, in each case whether or not distributed, in the taxable year of the U.S. Holder in which or with which our taxable year ends. A U.S. Holder may make\na separate election to defer the payment of taxes on undistributed income inclusions under the QEF rules, but if deferred, any such taxes will be subject to\nan interest charge.\nA U.S. Holder may not make a QEF election with respect to its redeemable warrants. As a result, if a U.S. Holder sells or otherwise disposes of a\nredeemable warrant (other than upon exercise of the redeemable warrant), any gain recognized generally will be subject to the special tax and interest\ncharge rules treating the gain as an excess distribution, as described above, if we were a PFIC at any time during the period the U.S. Holder held the\nredeemable warrants. If a U.S. Holder that exercises such redeemable warrants properly makes a QEF election with respect to the newly acquired ordinary\nshares (or has previously made a QEF election with respect to our shares), the QEF election will apply to the newly acquired ordinary shares, but the\nadverse tax consequences relating to PFIC shares, adjusted to take into account the current income inclusions resulting from the QEF election, will\ncontinue to apply with respect to such newly acquired ordinary shares (which generally will be deemed to have a holding period for purposes of the PFIC\nrules that includes the period the U.S. Holder held the redeemable warrants), unless the U.S. Holder makes a purging election with respect to such shares.\nThe purging election creates a deemed sale of such shares at their fair market value. The gain recognized by the purging election will be subject to the\nspecial tax and interest charge rules treating the gain as an excess distribution, as described above. As a result of the purging election, the U.S. Holder will\nincrease the adjusted tax basis in its ordinary shares acquired upon the exercise of the redeemable warrants by the gain recognized and will also have a new\nholding period in such ordinary shares for purposes of the PFIC rules.\nThe QEF election is made on a shareholder-by-shareholder basis and, once made, can be revoked only with the consent of the IRS. A U.S. Holder generally\nmakes a QEF election by attaching a completed IRS Form 8621 (Information Return by a Shareholder of a Passive Foreign Investment Company or\nQualified Electing Fund), including the information provided in a PFIC annual information statement, to a timely filed U.S. federal income tax return for\nthe taxable year to which the election relates. Retroactive QEF elections generally may be made only by filing a protective statement with such return and if\ncertain other conditions are met or with the consent of the IRS.\nIn order to comply with the requirements of a QEF election, a U.S. Holder must receive certain information from us. Upon request from a U.S. Holder, we\nwill endeavor to provide to the U.S. Holder no later than 90 days after the request such information as the IRS may require, including a PFIC annual\ninformation statement, in order to enable the U.S. Holder to make and maintain a QEF election. However, there is no assurance that we will have timely\nknowledge of our status as a PFIC in the future or of the required information to be provided.\n65\nIf a U.S. Holder has made a QEF election with respect to our shares and the special tax and interest charge rules do not apply to such shares (because of a\ntimely QEF election for our first taxable year as a PFIC in which the U.S. Holder holds (or is deemed to hold) such shares or a QEF election, along with a\npurge of the PFIC taint pursuant to a purging election, as described above), any gain recognized on the sale or other taxable disposition of our shares\ngenerally will be taxable as capital gain and no interest charge will be imposed. As discussed above, for regular U.S. federal income tax purposes, U.S.\nHolders of a QEF are currently taxed on their pro rata shares of the QEF’s earnings and profits, whether or not distributed. In such case, a subsequent\ndistribution of such earnings and profits that were previously included in income generally should not be taxable as a dividend to such U.S. Holders. The\nadjusted tax basis of a U.S. Holder’s shares in a QEF will be increased by amounts that are included in income, and decreased by amounts distributed but\nnot taxed as dividends, under the above rules. Similar basis adjustments apply to property if by reason of holding such property the U.S. Holder is treated\nunder the applicable attribution rules as owning shares in a QEF.\nAlthough a determination as to our PFIC status will be made annually, the initial determination that we are a PFIC generally will apply for subsequent years\nto a U.S. Holder who held shares or redeemable warrants while we were a PFIC, whether or not we meet the test for PFIC status in those subsequent years,\nunless such U.S. Holder made a purging election as described below. A U.S. Holder who makes the QEF election discussed above for our first taxable year\nas a PFIC in which the U.S. Holder holds (or is deemed to hold) our shares, however, will not be subject to the PFIC tax and interest charge rules discussed\nabove in respect to such shares. In addition, such U.S. Holder will not be subject to the QEF inclusion regime with respect to such shares for any of our\ntaxable years that end within or with a taxable year of the U.S. Holder and in which we are not a PFIC. On the other hand, if the QEF election is not\neffective for each of our taxable years in which we are a PFIC and during which the U.S. Holder holds (or is deemed to hold) our shares, the PFIC rules\ndiscussed above will continue to apply to such shares unless the holder files on a timely filed U.S. income tax return (including extensions) a QEF election\nand a purging election to recognize under the rules of Section 1291 of the Code any gain that the U.S. Holder would otherwise recognize if the U.S. Holder\nhad sold our shares for their fair market value on the “qualification date.” The qualification date is the first day of our tax year in which we qualify as a\nQEF with respect to such U.S. Holder. The purging election can only be made if such U.S. Holder held our ordinary shares on the qualification date. The\ngain recognized by the purging election will be subject to the special tax and interest charge rules treating the gain as an excess distribution, as described\nabove. As a result of the purging election, the U.S. Holder will increase the adjusted tax basis in its ordinary shares by the amount of the gain recognized\nand will also have a new holding period in the shares for purposes of the PFIC rules.\nIf a U.S. Holder did not make a timely “mark-to-market” election (as described above), and if we were a PFIC at any time during the period such U.S.\nHolder held our ordinary shares, then such ordinary shares will continue to be treated as stock of a PFIC with respect to such U.S. Holder even if we cease\nto be a PFIC in a future year, unless such U.S. Holder makes a “purging election” for the year we cease to be a PFIC. A “purging election” creates a deemed\nsale of such ordinary shares at their fair market value on the last day of the last year in which we are treated as a PFIC. The gain recognized by the purging\nelection will be subject to the special tax and interest charge rules treating the gain as an excess distribution, as described above. As a result of the purging\nelection, such U.S. Holder will have a new tax basis (equal to the fair market value of the ordinary shares on the last day of the last year in which we are\ntreated as a PFIC) and tax holding period (which new holding period will begin the day after such last day) in such ordinary shares.\nAs an alternative to the QEF election, if a U.S. Holder, at the close of its taxable year, owns shares in a PFIC that are treated as marketable stock, the U.S.\nHolder may make a mark-to-market election with respect to such shares for such taxable year. If the U.S. Holder makes a valid mark-to-market election for\nthe first taxable year of the U.S. Holder in which the U.S. Holder holds (or is deemed to hold) our shares and for which we are determined to be a PFIC,\nsuch holder generally will not be subject to the PFIC rules described above in respect to its shares. Instead, in general, the U.S. Holder will include as\nordinary income each year the excess, if any, of the fair market value of its shares at the end of its taxable year over the adjusted tax basis in its shares. The\nU.S. Holder also will be allowed to take an ordinary loss in respect of the excess, if any, of the adjusted tax basis of its shares over the fair market value of\nits shares at the end of its taxable year (but only to the extent of the net amount of previously included income as a result of the mark-to-market election).\nThe U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in its shares will be adjusted to reflect any such income or loss amounts, and any further gain recognized on a sale or\nother taxable disposition of the shares will be treated as ordinary income. Currently, a mark-to-market election may not be made with respect to our\nredeemable warrants.\n66\nThe mark-to-market election is available only for stock that is regularly traded on a national securities exchange that is registered with the Securities and\nExchange Commission, including the NASDAQ Capital Market, or on a foreign exchange or market that the IRS determines has rules sufficient to ensure\nthat the market price represents a legitimate and sound fair market value. Although our ordinary shares are listed and traded on the NASDAQ Capital\nMarket, we cannot guarantee that our shares will continue to be listed and traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market. U.S. Holders should consult their own\ntax advisors regarding the availability and tax consequences of a mark-to-market election in respect to our shares under their particular circumstances.\nIf we are a PFIC and, at any time, have a foreign subsidiary that is classified as a PFIC, a U.S. Holder generally would be deemed to own a portion of the\nshares of such lower-tier PFIC, and generally could incur liability for the deferred tax and interest charge described above if we receive a distribution from,\nor dispose of all or part of our interest in, or the U.S. Holder otherwise were deemed to have disposed of an interest in, the lower-tier PFIC. Upon request,\nwe will endeavor to cause any lower-tier PFIC to provide to a U.S. Holder no later than 90 days after the request the information that may be required to\nmake or maintain a QEF election with respect to the lower-tier PFIC. However, there is no assurance that we will have timely knowledge of the status of\nany such lower-tier PFIC, and we do not plan to make annual determinations or otherwise notify U.S. Holders of the PFIC status of any such lower-tier\nPFIC. There also is no assurance that we will be able to cause the lower-tier PFIC to provide the required information. U.S. Holders are urged to consult\ntheir own tax advisors regarding the tax issues raised by lower-tier PFICs.\nA U.S. Holder that owns (or is deemed to own) shares in a PFIC during any taxable year of the U.S. Holder may have to file an IRS Form 8621 (whether or\nnot a QEF election or mark-to-market election is or has been made) with such U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax return and provide such other\ninformation as may be required by the U.S. Treasury Department.\nThe rules dealing with PFICs and with the QEF and mark-to-market elections are very complex and are affected by various factors in addition to those\ndescribed above. Accordingly, U.S. Holders of our shares and redeemable warrants should consult their own tax advisors concerning the application of the\nPFIC rules to our shares and redeemable warrants under their particular circumstances.\nNon-U.S. Holders\nDividends (including constructive dividends) paid or deemed paid to a Non-U.S. Holder in respect to our securities generally will not be subject to U.S.\nfederal income tax, unless the dividends are effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business within the United States (and,\nif required by an applicable income tax treaty, are attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base that such holder maintains or maintained in the\nUnited States).\nIn addition, a Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain attributable to a sale or other taxable disposition of our\nsecurities unless such gain is effectively connected with its conduct of a trade or business in the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax\ntreaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base that such holder maintains or maintained in the United States) or the Non-U.S. Holder is an\nindividual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of sale or other disposition and certain other conditions are met (in\nwhich case, such gain from U.S. sources generally is subject to U.S. federal income tax at a 30% rate or a lower applicable tax treaty rate).\nDividends and gains that are effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the United States (and, if required by an\napplicable income tax treaty, are attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base that such holder maintains or maintained in the United States)\ngenerally will be subject to regular U.S. federal income tax at the same regular U.S. federal income tax rates applicable to a comparable U.S. Holder and, in\nthe case of a Non-U.S. Holder that is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, may also be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a 30%\nrate or a lower applicable tax treaty rate.\nThe U.S. federal income tax treatment of a Non-U.S. Holder’s exercise of redeemable warrants, or the lapse of redeemable warrants held by a Non-U.S.\nHolder, generally will correspond to the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the exercise or lapse of redeemable warrants by a U.S. Holder, as described\nunder “U.S. Holders — Exercise or Lapse of Redeemable Warrants” above.\n67\nBackup Withholding and Information Reporting\nIn general, information reporting for U.S. federal income tax purposes should apply to distributions made on our securities within the United States to a\nU.S. Holder (other than an exempt recipient) and to the proceeds from sales and other dispositions of our securities by a U.S. Holder (other than an exempt\nrecipient) to or through a U.S. office of a broker. Payments made (and sales and other dispositions effected at an office) outside the United States will be\nsubject to information reporting in limited circumstances. In addition, certain information concerning a U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in its securities and\nadjustments to that tax basis and whether any gain or loss with respect to such securities is long-term or short-term also may be required to be reported to\nthe IRS, and certain holders may be required to file an IRS Form 8938 (Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets) to report their interest in our\nsecurities.\nMoreover, backup withholding of U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 28% generally will apply to dividends paid on our securities to a U.S. Holder (other\nthan an exempt recipient) and the proceeds from sales and other dispositions of shares or warrants by a U.S. Holder (other than an exempt recipient), in\neach case who\n● fails to provide an accurate taxpayer identification number;\n● is notified by the IRS that backup withholding is required; or\n● in certain circumstances, fails to comply with applicable certification requirements.\nA Non-U.S. Holder generally may eliminate the requirement for information reporting and backup withholding by providing certification of its foreign\nstatus, under penalties of perjury, on a duly executed applicable IRS Form W-8 or by otherwise establishing an exemption. Backup withholding is not an\nadditional tax. Rather, the amount of any backup withholding will be allowed as a credit against a U.S. Holder’s or a Non-U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal\nincome tax liability and may entitle such holder to a refund, provided that certain required information is timely furnished to the IRS. Holders are urged to\nconsult their own tax advisors regarding the application of backup withholding and the availability of and procedures for obtaining an exemption from\nbackup withholding in their particular circumstances.\nF.

Subsidiary Information\nNot applicable.\n68\nITEM 11. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe deposit any surplus funds with Chinese banks earning daily interest. We do not invest in any instruments for trading purposes. Our operations generally\nare not directly sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates and we currently do not have any long-term debt outstanding. Management monitors the banks’\nprime rates in conjunction with our cash requirements to determine the appropriate level of debt balances relative to other sources of funds. We have not\nentered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to interest rate risk.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nWhile our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, substantially all of our consolidated revenues and consolidated costs and expenses are denominated in\nRMB. Substantially all of our assets are denominated in RMB. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk as our revenues and results of\noperations may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the RMB. If the RMB depreciates against the U.S. dollar, the\nvalue of our RMB revenues, earnings and assets as expressed in our U.S. dollar financial statements will decline. Assets and liabilities are translated at\nexchange rates at the balance sheet dates and revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates and equity is translated at historical\nexchange rates. Any resulting translation adjustments are not included in determining net income but are included in determining other comprehensive\nincome, a component of equity. An average appreciation (depreciation) of the RMB against the U.S. dollar of 5% would increase (decrease) our\ncomprehensive loss by $30,000 based on our outstanding revenues, costs and expenses, assets and liabilities denominated in RMB as of December 31,\n2021.\nThe value of RMB against the U.S. dollar and other currencies is affected by, among other things, changes in China’s political and economic conditions.\nSince July 2005, RMB has not been pegged to the U.S. dollar. Although the People’s Bank of China regularly intervenes in the foreign exchange market to\nprevent significant short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate, RMB may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the U.S. dollar in the\nmedium to long term. Moreover, it is possible that in the future, PRC authorities may lift restrictions on fluctuations in RMB exchange rate and lessen\nintervention in the foreign exchange market.\nInflation\nInflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results. Although we do not believe\nthat inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse\neffect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues if the selling\nprices of our products do not increase with these increased costs.\nITEM 12.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of December 31, 2021 our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls\nand procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the year covered by this report. Disclosure controls\nand procedure include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the\nreports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management as appropriate to allow timely\ndecisions regarding required disclosure. Our Management is responsible for monitoring the process pursuant to which information is gathered and\nanalyzing such information to determine the extent to which such information requires disclosure, in the reports filed with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission.\nBased on such evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that as of December 31, 2021, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were\nineffective due to the Company’s lacks of formal documented controls and procedures applicable to all officers and directors to disclose the required\ninformation under the Exchange Act.\nWe have appointed outside independent directors, established board committees, strengthened the financial personnel and introduced written policies and\nprocedures.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting\nis defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act. It is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s\nprincipal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company’s board of directors, management and other personnel. The objective is to\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance\nwith accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that:\n● Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the\ncompany;\n● Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made\nonly in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and\n● Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets\nthat could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore,\neven those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.\nBecause of the inherent limitations of internal control, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the\ninternal controls over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible\nto design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.\n70\nAs December 31, 2021 management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal\ncontrol over financial reporting established in by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission’s 2013 Internal Control\nIntegrated Framework and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. Based on that evaluation, they concluded that, during the period covered by this\nreport, such internal controls and procedures were not effective to detect the inappropriate application of US GAAP rules. This was primarily due to\ndeficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls. These\ndeficiencies may be considered to be material weaknesses.\nIdentified Material Weakness\nA material weakness in internal control over financial reporting is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a\nremote likelihood that a material misstatement of the financial statements will not be prevented or detected.\nManagement identified the following material weaknesses during its assessment of internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021:\n(1) A lack of understanding of the requirements of NASDAQ, made worse by a poor or no command of the English language\n(2) Contracts are often done hurriedly, in Chinese and presented late to the Board for approval. Often the contracting parties vary the written terms.\nEnforcement is difficult and time-consuming\n(3) There are no written policies and procedures covering such operational activities such as sales and procurement due to a lack of staff stability,\nespecially at senior management levels\n(4) Chinese accounting rules require standard official invoices to be issued before they can be recognized in the accounting records so cut-offs remain\nan issue\nAs a result of the material weaknesses described above, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2021 based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by COSO (2013 framework).\nHowever, management does not believe that any of our annual or interim financial statements issued to date contain a material misstatement as a result of\nthe aforementioned weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.\n71\nManagement’s Remediation Initiatives\nTo mediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies, we have introduced the following measures:\n(1) Continue to educate senior management on the requirements of NASDAQ\n(2) Set a monetary limit above which senior Management cannot contract on behalf of the Company, without the written approval of at least two\nindependent directors.\n(3) Design and monitor controls over financial reporting, including the introduction of a proper checklist of cut-off procedures to ensure proper\naccounting of accruals and payables.\n(4) Continue to provide training to financial staff on U.S. GAAP and educate management staff and directors on NASDAQ Listing Rules and SEC\nReporting Requirements.\nAttestation report of the registered public accounting firm\nOur independent registered public accounting firm, Centurion ZD CPA & Co., has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting\nas of December 31, 2021, as stated in its report, which appears on page F-2 of this annual report on Form 20-F.\nChanges in internal controls over financial reporting\nExcept as described above, there have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this\nReport that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.\n72\nITEM 16.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position\nof the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and September 30, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then\nended December 31, 2021, the three months ended December 31, 2020, and for the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 in conformity with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s\ninternal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued\nby the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated May 13, 2022 expressed a qualified opinion on the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial\nstatements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules\nand regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing\nprocedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated\nfinancial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as\nevaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and\nperforming procedures that respond to those risks.

Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as\nevaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was\ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated\nfinancial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not\nalter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below,\nproviding a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAllowance for current expected credit losses (“CECL”) on accounts receivable\nAs described in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (codified\nas Accounting Standard Codification Topic 326), since January 1, 2020, which requires measurement and recognition of current expected credit losses for\nfinancial instruments held at amortized cost. The management of the Company has estimated an allowance accrued for CECL of $1,181,916 for the year\nended December 31, 2021, on accounts receivables, based on the credit risk of the respective receivables. The allowance amount has been measured as the\ndifference of the asset’s carrying amount and the estimates of present value of future cash flows based on the historical experience, current conditions, and\nreasonable and supportable forecasts.\nWe have identified allowance for CECL on accounts receivable as a critical audit matter due to the involvement of subjective judgment and management\nestimates in evaluating the CECL of these receivable items, and the significance to the Company’s consolidated financial position.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements. Our audit procedures to respond the risk of error in the allowance for CECL included (i) obtaining an understanding and assessing\nmanagement’s method for developing the allowance for doubtful accounts (credit losses); (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the model, by reviewing the\ncalculation schedules prepared by the management; (iii) testing the accuracy of management’s basic input in calculating CECL including aging report,\nhistorical write-offs and recoveries, on a sample basis; (iv) independently evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions and judgments made by\nmanagement to estimate the allowance for credit loss, including the Company’s assessment on significant factors, and the basis of estimated loss rates\napplied with reference to historical default rates and forward-looking information; (v) sending confirmations to debtors to confirm the accuracy of the basic\ninformation and terms of the loan receivables; (vi) performing credit review with both individual and corporation borrowers of significant loan receivables,\nto assess the borrowers’ capability and willing to repay the debt; and (vii) evaluating the competence, capabilities and objectivity of the professionals\nengaged by the Company.\n/s/ Centurion ZD CPA & Co\nCenturion ZD CPA & Co.\nHong Kong\nMay 13, 2022\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2018\nF-1\n(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)\nCenturion ZD CPA & Co.\nCertified Public Accountants (Practising)\nUnit 1304, 13/F, Two Harbourfront, 22 Tak Fung Street, Hunghom, Hong Kong.\n(cid:0)(cid:0) (cid:0)(cid:0) (cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)22(cid:0) (cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0) 13(cid:0)1304(cid:0)\nTel (cid:0)(cid:0): (852) 2126 2388 Fax (cid:0)(cid:0): (852) 2122 9078\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Moxian (BVI) Inc\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Moxian (BVI) Inc (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established\nin Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our\nopinion, the Company did not maintain, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated\nbalance sheets and the related consolidated statements of comprehensive loss, consolidated statements of shareholders’ equity (deficit), and consolidated\nstatement of cash flows and our report dated May 13, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of\ninternal control over financial reporting, included in the Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to\nexpress an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the\nPCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over\nfinancial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other\nprocedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting\nand the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control\nover financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly\nreflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding\nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial\nstatements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility\nthat a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Certain control\ndeficiencies existed in the internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, including (1) A lack of understanding of the requirements of\nNASDAQ, made worse by a poor or no command of the English language; (2) Contracts are often done hurriedly, in Chinese and presented late to the\nBoard for approval. Often the contracting parties vary the written terms. Enforcement is difficult and time-consuming; (3) There are no written policies and\nprocedures covering such operational activities such as sales and procurement due to a lack of staff stability, especially at senior management levels; and\n(4) Chinese accounting rules require standard official invoices to be issued before they can be recognized in the accounting records so cut-offs remain an\nissue.

Organization and nature of operations\nThe Company was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands (BVI) on May 18, 2021. On August 17, 2021, the Company completed a redomicile merger\nwith its predecessor company, Moxian, Inc, wherein it acquired all the assets, liabilities, rights, obligations and operations of the latter and its subsidiaries,\nthrough an exchange of an identical number of shares.\nOn December 28, 2021 in a Special Meeting of shareholders, the Company approved the issue of up to 20 million new ordinary shares of the Company, at a\nprice of $2.50 per share to certain non-US based accredited investors. On February 11, 2022 the Company completed this private placement and issued 16\nmillion new shares, raising $40 million, which it will use in bitcoin mining in order to diversify its business operations. Of the issue proceeds, $29.8 million\nwas used to purchase relevant equipment and the balance will be used as working capital.\nOn March 5, 2022 a number of machines were installed and operational at a site near Buffalo in New York State, USA and progressively, other sites will be\nidentified and the purchased equipment put into operation.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the activities of the Company and each of the following entities:\nName of entity Background Ownership\nMoxian CN Group Limited Investment holding company 100% owned by Moxian (BVI) Inc\nMoxian Group Limited Investment holding company 100% owned by Moxian CN Group Limited\nMoxian (Hong Kong) Limited Investment holding company 100% owned by Moxian Group Limited\nMoxian Technology Services (Shenzhen) Co.

Summary of principal accounting policies\nBasis of presentation and consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in\nthe United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and include all the subsidiaries of the Group. The financial year-end of the Company is December 31 while\nthat of the predecessor company is September 30. The consolidated results are presented as of the year ended December 31, 2021 and that of the\ntransitional period of three months from October 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020, with the results for the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 also\nincluded for comparison purposes. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in the consolidation.\nThe following assets and liabilities of the VIE are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company as of December 31,\n2021, December 31, 2020, September 30, 2020 and 2019.\nDecember 31, December 31, September 30, September 30,\n2021 2020 2020 2019\nCurrent assets $ - $ - $ - $ -\nNon-current assets - - - -\nTotal assets $ - $ - $ - $ -\nCurrent liabilities $ - $ - $ - $ -\nNon-current liabilities - - - -\nTotal liabilities $ - $ - $ - $ -\nFair value of financial instruments\nThe Company follows the provisions of ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.” ASC 820 clarifies the definition of fair value, prescribes\nmethods for measuring fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:\nLevel 1-Observable inputs such as unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date.\nLevel 2-Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and\nliabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market\ndata.\nLevel 3-Inputs are unobservable inputs that reflect management’s assumptions based on the best available information.\nThe carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, prepayments, deposits and other receivables, accruals and other payables, loans from related parties and\nunrelated party approximate their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments.\nF-7\nMOXIAN (BVI) INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n2. Summary of principal accounting policies (continued)\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the accompanying consolidated\nfinancial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates required to be made by\nmanagement include but not limited to, useful lives of property and equipment, provision for doubtful accounts, intangible assets valuation, inventory\nvaluation, value added recoverable valuation and deferred tax assets valuation. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash includes cash on hand and demand deposits in accounts maintained with commercial banks. The Company considers all highly liquid investment\ninstruments with an original maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.\nThe Company considers all short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and have original maturities of three\nmonths or less to be cash equivalents.\nPrepayments, deposits and other receivables\nPrepayments and deposits represent amounts advanced to suppliers. The suppliers usually require advance payments or deposits when the Company makes\npurchase or orders service and the prepayments and deposits will be utilized to offset the Company’s future payments. Other receivables mainly consist of\nvarious cash advances to employees for business needs. These amounts are unsecured, non-interest bearing and generally short-term in nature.\nAllowances are recorded when utilization and collection of amounts due are in doubt. Delinquent prepayments, deposits and other receivables are written-\noff after management has determined that the likelihood of utilization or collection is not probable and known bad debts are written off against the\nallowances when identified.\nProperty and Equipment, net\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Significant additions or improvements extending useful lives\nof assets are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line\nmethod over the estimated useful lives as follows:\nElectronic equipment 3-6 years\nFurniture and fixtures 3-6 years\nLeasehold improvements Shorter of estimated useful life or term of lease\nIntangible assets, net\nIntangible assets, comprising Intellectual property rights (“IP rights”) and software, which are separable from property and equipment, are stated at cost\nless accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of 3- 10 years.\nF-8\nMOXIAN (BVI) INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nThe Company classifies its long-lived assets into: (i) computer and office equipment; (ii) furniture and fixtures, (iii) leasehold improvements, and (iv)\nfinite-lived intangible assets.\nLong-lived assets held and used by the Company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value\nof such assets may not be fully recoverable. It is possible that these assets could become impaired as a result of technology, economy or other industry\nchanges. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group to be tested for possible impairment, the Company first compares undiscounted cash\nflows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset or asset group is not\nrecoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Fair value is\ndetermined through various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models, relief from royalty income approach, quoted market values and\nthird-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary.\nThe Company makes various assumptions and estimates regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair values of the\nrespective assets. The assumptions and estimates used to determine future values and remaining useful lives of long-lived assets are complex and\nsubjective. They can be affected by various factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as the\nCompany’s business strategy and its forecasts for specific market expansion.\nDue to the continuing losses from operations with minimal revenues, the Company recognized impairment losses of $3,009,732 for the IP rights and other\nintangible assets during the year ended September 30, 2017 resulting in the IP rights and other intangible assets having a nil value as of December 31, 2021,\nDecember 31, 2020 and as of September 30, 2020 and 2019.\nDigital assets\nDigital assets (including USDC) are included in current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Digital assets purchased are recorded at\ncost and digital assets awarded to the Company through its mining activities are accounted for in connection with the Company’s revenue recognition\npolicy disclosed below.\nDigital assets held are accounted for as intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized but\nassessed for impairment annually, or more frequently, when events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that it is more likely than not that the\nindefinite-lived asset is impaired. Impairment exists when the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, which is measured using the quoted price of the\ndigital assets at the time its fair value is being measured. In testing for impairment, the Company has the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to\ndetermine whether it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. If it is determined that it is not more likely than not that an impairment exists, a\nquantitative impairment test is not necessary. If the Company concludes otherwise, it is required to perform a quantitative impairment test. To the extent an\nimpairment loss is recognized, the loss establishes the new cost basis of the asset. Subsequent reversal of impairment losses is not permitted.\nPurchases of digital assets by the Company, if any, will be included within investing activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows,\nwhile digital assets awarded to the Company through its mining activities are included within operating activities on the accompanying consolidated\nstatements of cash flows. The sales of digital assets are included within investing activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows and\nany realized gains or losses from such sales are included in “realized gain (loss) on exchange of digital assets” in the consolidated statements of operations\nand comprehensive income (loss). The Company accounts for its gains or losses in accordance with the first-in first-out method of accounting.\nRevenue recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”).\nTo determine revenue recognition for contracts with customers, the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract with the customer,\n(ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, including variable consideration to the extent that it is probable\nthat a significant future reversal will not occur, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the respective performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize\nrevenue when (or as) the Company satisfies the performance obligation.\nIncome taxes\nThe Company utilizes ASC Topic 740 (“ASC 740”) “Income taxes”, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected\nfuture tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred income taxes\nare recognized for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at\neach period end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.\nValuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nASC 740 “Income taxes” clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. This interpretation requires that an entity recognizes in the financial\nstatements the impact of a tax position, if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the\nposition. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or\nmeasurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company has elected to classify interest and penalties related to\nunrecognized tax benefits, if and when required, as part of income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company evaluate the\nlevel of authority for each uncertain tax position (including the potential application of interest and penalties) based on the technical merits, and measure\nthe unrecognized benefits associated with the tax positions. As of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2020 the Company did not have any unrecognized\ntax benefits. The Company does not anticipate any significant increase to its liability for unrecognized tax benefit within the next 12 months.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the tax years ended December 31, 2011 through to December 31, 2020 for the Company’s PRC entities remain open for statutory\nexamination by the PRC tax authorities.\nF-9\nMOXIAN (BVI) INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nForeign currency transactions and translation\nThe reporting currency of the Company is United States Dollars (the “USD”) and the functional currency of the PRC subsidiaries is the Renminbi\n(“RMB”).The functional currency of Moxian HK is Hong Kong Dollar (the “HKD”), and the functional currency of Moxian Malaysia is Malaysia Ringgit\n(the “RM”).\nFor financial reporting purposes, the financial statements of the various subsidiarie are prepared using their respective functional currencies, e translated\ninto the reporting currency, USD so to be consolidated with the Company’s. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the\nreporting currency are translated into the reporting currency at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated\nusing average rates prevailing during the reporting period. Adjustments resulting from the translation are recorded as a separate component of accumulated\nother comprehensive income in stockholders’ deficiency. Translation losses are recognized in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nThe exchange rates applied are as follows:\nBalance sheet items, except for equity December 31, December 31, September 30, September 30,\naccounts 2021 2020 2020 2019\nRMB:USD 6.3559 6.5401 6.8141 7.1484\nHKD:USD 7.7992 7.7521 7.7502 7.8391\nRM:USD 4.1765 4.1070 4.1486 4.1889\nItems in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss, and statements cash flows:\nDecember 31, December 31, September 30, September 30,\n2021 2020 2020 2019\nRMB:USD 6.4525 6.6222 7.0072 6.8766\nHKD:USD 7.7727 7.7517 7.7746 7.8363\nEarnings per share\nBasic gain per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period while the effects of potential common\nshares outstanding during the period are included in diluted earnings per share.\nFASB Accounting Standard Codification Topic 260 (“ASC 260”), “Earnings Per Share,” requires that employee equity share options, non-vested shares and\nsimilar equity instruments granted to employees be treated as potential common shares in computing diluted earnings per share. Diluted earnings per share\nshould be based on the actual number of options or shares granted and not yet forfeited, unless doing so would be anti-dilutive. The Company uses the\n“treasury stock” method for equity instruments granted in share-based payment transactions provided in ASC 260 to determine diluted earnings per share.\nAntidilutive securities represent potentially dilutive securities which are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings or loss per share as their impact\nwas antidilutive.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic\n740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (“ASU 2019-12”). ASU 2019-12 simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain\nexceptions and enhances and simplifies various aspects of the income tax accounting guidance in ASC 740. ASU 2019-12 was effective January 1, 2021.\nThe adoption of ASU 2019-12 did not have any impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statement presentation or disclosures.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt — Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—\nContracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity (“ASU 2020-06”).\nASU 2020-06 simplifies the accounting for convertible debt by eliminating the beneficial conversion and cash conversion accounting models. Upon\nadoption of ASU 2020-06, convertible debt proceeds, unless issued with a substantial premium or an embedded conversion feature that is not clearly and\nclosely related to the host contract, will no longer be allocated between debt and equity components. This modification will reduce the issue discount and\nresult in less non-cash interest expense in financial statements. ASU 2020-06 also updates the earnings per share calculation and requires entities to assume\nshare settlement when the convertible debt can be settled in cash or shares. For contracts in an entity’s own equity, the type of contracts primarily affected\nby ASU 2020-06 are freestanding and embedded features that are accounted for as derivatives under the current guidance due to a failure to meet the\nsettlement assessment by removing the requirements to (i) consider whether the contract would be settled in registered shares, (ii) consider whether\ncollateral is required to be posted, and (iii) assess shareholder rights. ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. Early\nadoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and only if adopted as of the beginning of such fiscal year. The\nCompany adopted ASU 2020-06 effective January 1, 2021. The adoption of ASU 2020-06 did not have any impact on the Company’s consolidated\nfinancial statement presentation or disclosures.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) (“ASU 2016-13”), which requires entities to measure\nall expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable\nforecasts. ASU 2016-13 replaces the existing incurred loss model and is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at\namortized cost. ASU 2016-13 is to be adopted on a modified retrospective basis. As a smaller reporting company, ASU 2016-13 will be effective for the\nCompany for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption\nof ASU 2016-13 will have on its consolidated financial statement presentations and disclosures.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (Topic 350), Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment (“ASU\n2017-04”). ASU 2017-04 eliminates Step 2 of the two-step goodwill impairment test, under which a goodwill impairment loss was measured by comparing\nthe implied fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. ASU 2017-04 requires only a one-step quantitative\nimpairment test, whereby a goodwill impairment loss is measured as the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value (not to exceed the\ntotal goodwill allocated to that reporting unit). Adoption of the ASUs is on a modified retrospective basis. As a smaller reporting company, the standard will\nbe effective for the Company for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company is currently evaluating the impact\nthat the adoption of ASU 2017-04 will have on its consolidated financial statement presentation or disclosures.\nIn May 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-04, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt — Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50),\nCompensation — Stock Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives and Hedging — Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Issuer’s\nAccounting for Certain Modifications or Exchanges of Freestanding Equity-Classified Written Call Options (“ASU 2021-04”). ASU 2021-04 provides\nguidance as to how an issuer should account for a modification of the terms or conditions or an exchange of a freestanding equity-classified written call\noption (i.e., a warrant) that remains classified after modification or exchange as an exchange of the original instrument for a new instrument. An issuer\nshould measure the effect of a modification or exchange as the difference between the fair value of the modified or exchanged warrant and the fair value of\nthat warrant immediately before modification or exchange and then apply a recognition model that comprises four categories of transactions and the\ncorresponding accounting treatment for each category (equity issuance, debt origination, debt modification, and modifications unrelated to equity issuance\nand debt origination or modification). ASU 2021-04 is effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim\nperiods within those fiscal years. An entity should apply the guidance provided in ASU 2021-04 prospectively to modifications or exchanges occurring on\nor after the effective date. Early adoption is permitted for all entities, including adoption in an interim period. If an entity elects to early adopt ASU 2021-04\nin an interim period, the guidance should be applied as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. The adoption of ASU 2021-04 is\nnot expected to have any impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statement presentation or disclosures.\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance.\nThis update requires certain annual disclosures about transactions with a government that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting\nmodel by analogy. This update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021, and early application is permitted. This guidance should\nbe applied either prospectively to all transactions that are reflected in financial statements at the date of initial application and new transactions that are\nentered into after the date of initial application or retrospectively to those transactions. The Company does not expect the impact of this guidance to have a\nmaterial impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company’s management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, authoritative guidance, if currently adopted, would have\na material impact on the Company’s financial statement presentation or disclosures.\nF-10\nMOXIAN (BVI) INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n3.

Income taxes\nThe Company and its subsidiaries file separate income tax returns.\nThe United States of America\nMoxian is incorporated in the State of Nevada in the U.S. and is subject to U.S. federal corporate income taxes. The State of Nevada does not impose any\nstate corporate income tax. As of September 30, 2020, future net operation losses of approximately $8.9 million are available to offset future operating\nincome through 2036.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”) was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code.\nChanges include, but are not limited to, a U.S. corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the\ntransition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed\nrepatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017. As the Company has a September 30 fiscal year-end, the lower corporate income tax\nrate will be phased in, resulting in a U.S. statutory federal rate of approximately 24.5% for our fiscal year ending September 30, 2018, and 21% for\nsubsequent fiscal years. Accordingly, we have to remeasure our deferred tax assets on net operating loss carryforward in the U.S. at the lower enacted\ncooperated tax rate of 21%. However, this re-measurement has no effect on the Company’s income tax expenses as the Company has provided a 100%\nvaluation allowance on its deferred tax assets previously.\nAdditionally, the Tax Act imposes a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of historical earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and future foreign earnings\nare subject to U.S. taxation. The change in rate has caused us to remeasure all U.S. deferred income tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences and\nnet operating loss (NOL) carryforwards and recorded a one-time income tax payable in 8 years. However, this one-time transition tax has no effect on the\nCompany’s income tax expenses as the Company has no undistributed foreign earnings prior to September 30, 2018, and further, the Company has\ncumulative foreign losses as of September 30, 2018.\nBritish Virgin Islands\nMoxian BVI is incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. Under the current laws of the British Virgin Islands, Moxian BVI is not subject to tax on income\nor capital gains. In addition, upon payments of dividends by Moxian BVI, no British Virgin Islands withholding tax is imposed.\nHong Kong\nMoxian HK is incorporated in Hong Kong and Hong Kong’s profits tax rate is 16.5%. Moxian HK did not earn any income that was derived in Hong Kong\nfor the year ended December 31, 2021, the period of three months ended December 31, 2020 and the year ended September 30, 2020 and therefore, Moxian\nHK was not subject to any Hong Kong profits tax.\nMalaysia\nMoxian Malaysia has been dormant since June 2017 and did not have taxable income since such date. The management estimates that Moxian Malaysia\nwill not generate any taxable income in the foreseeable future.\nF-13\n10. Income taxes (continued)\nPRC\nEffective from January 1, 2008, the PRC’s statutory income tax rate is 25%. The Company’s PRC subsidiaries are subject to income tax rate of 25%, unless\notherwise specified.\nAs of September 30, 2020, the Company had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately of $20.2 million in PRC tax jurisdiction, which expires by\n2022.\nMoxian Shenzhen was incorporated in the People’s Republic of China. Moxian Shenzhen did not generate taxable income in the People’s Republic of\nChina for the period from April 8, 2013 (date of inception) to December 31, 2021. Moxian Shenzhen has ceased operations and will not generate any\ntaxable income in the future.\nMoyi was incorporated in the People’s Republic of China. Moyi did not generate taxable income in the People’s Republic of China for the period from July\n19, 2013 (date of inception) to December 31, 2021.\nMoxian Beijing was incorporated in the People’s Republic of China. Moxian Beijing did not generate taxable income in the People’s Republic of China for\nthe period from December 10, 2015 (date of inception) to December 31, 2021.\nThe Company’s effective income tax rate was 0% for the year ended December 31, 2021, the period of three months ended December, 2020 and the years\nended September 30, 2020 and 2019. Income tax mainly consists of foreign income tax at statutory rates and the effects of permanent and temporary\ndifferences.\nDecember 31, December 31, September 30, September 30,\n2021 2020 2020 2019\nU.S. statutory rate 34.0% 34.0% 34.0% 34%\nForeign income not registered in the\nU.S. (34.0)% (34.0)% (34.0)% (34.0)%\nPRC statutory rate 25.0% 25.0% 25.0% 25.0%\nChanges in valuation allowance and\nothers (25.0)% (25.0)% (25.0)% (25.0)%\nEffective tax rate 0% 0% 0% 0%\nBecause of the uncertainty regarding the Company’s ability to realize its deferred tax assets, a 100% valuation allowance has been established in the year\nended September 30, 2017 and carried forward since.

Rental expenses under operating leases for the year\nended December 31, 2021, the three months ended December 31, 2020 and the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 were approximately $232,985,\n$56,522, $231,000 and $253,000 respectively. A new two year operating lease commenced on March 1, 2022 at a monthly rental of about $9,230 per\nmonth.\n12. Subsequent events\n1. On February 11, 2021 the Company issued 16,000,000 new ordinary shares at a price of $2.50 per share, for total proceeds of $40 million. $29.8\nmillion was used to purchase bitcoin mining equipment and the balance retained as working capital.

As of December\n31, 2021, 19,554,677 ordinary shares were issued and outstanding and 5,000,000 preferred share issued and outstanding. The ordinary shares are registered\nfor trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the trading symbol “MOXC.”\nCapitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings given to them in the annual report on Form 20-F.\nThis Exhibit sets forth a description of our ordinary shares and certain provisions of our memorandum and articles of association which are\nsummaries and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, which\nwas previously filed as Exhibit 99.1 to the Company’s current report on Form 6-K on December 6, 2021 (referred to hereafter as our “Memorandum and\nArticles”).\nDividend Distributions\nThe holders of our ordinary shares are entitled to such dividends as may be declared by our board of directors subject to the BVI Business\nCompanies Act. The holders of our preferred shares have no right to share in any dividend paid by the Company and no right to share in the distribution of\nthe surplus assets of the Company on its liquidation.\nVoting rights\nAny action required or permitted to be taken by the shareholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of the shareholders\nentitled to vote on such action and may be effected by a resolution in writing. At each shareholder’s meeting, each shareholder who is present in person or\nby proxy (or, in the case of a shareholder being a corporation, by its duly authorized representative) will be entitled to one vote for each ordinary share\nwhich such shareholder holds and be entitled to three votes for each preferred share which such shareholder holds on all matters subject to vote at each\nshareholders’ meeting of the Company.\nElection of directors\nDelaware law permits cumulative voting for the election of directors only if expressly authorized in the certificate of incorporation. The laws of\nthe British Virgin Islands, however, do not specifically prohibit or restrict the creation of cumulative voting rights for the election of our directors.\nCumulative voting is not a concept that is accepted as a common practice in the British Virgin Islands, and we have made no provisions in our\nmemorandum and articles of association to allow cumulative voting for elections of directors.\nMeetings\nWe must provide written notice of all meetings of shareholders, stating the time, place and, in the case of a special meeting of shareholders, the\npurpose or purposes thereof, at least 7 days before the date of the proposed meeting to those persons whose names appear as shareholders in the register of\nmembers on the date of the notice and are entitled to vote at the meeting. Our board of directors shall call a special meeting upon the written request of\nshareholders holding at least 30% of our outstanding voting shares. In addition, our board of directors may call a special meeting of shareholders on its own\nmotion. A meeting of shareholders held in contravention of the requirement to give notice is valid if shareholders holding at least 90 percent of the total\nvoting rights on all the matters to be considered at the meeting have waived notice of the meeting and, for this purpose, the presence of a shareholder at the\nmeeting shall constitute waiver in relation to all the shares which that shareholder holds.\nThe management of us is entrusted to our board of directors, who will make corporate decisions by board resolution. Our directors are free to meet\nat such times and in such manner and places within or outside the BVI as the directors determine to be necessary or desirable. A 3 days’ notice of a meeting\nof directors must be given. At any meeting of directors, a quorum will be present if half of the total number of directors is present, unless there are only 2\ndirectors in which case the quorum is 2. If a quorum is not present, the meeting will be dissolved. If a quorum is present, votes of half of present directors\nare required to pass a resolution of directors.\nAs few as one third of our outstanding shares may be sufficient to hold a shareholder meeting. Although our memorandum and articles of\nassociation require that holders of at least one-third of our outstanding shares appear in person or by proxy to hold a shareholder meeting, to the extent we\nfail to have quorum on this initial meeting date, we can reschedule the meeting for the next business day or later, at which second meeting the holders of\none third or more of our outstanding shares will constitute a quorum. As mentioned, at the initial date set for any meeting of shareholders, a quorum will be\npresent if there are shareholders present in person or by proxy representing not less than one-third of the issued Ordinary Shares entitled to vote on the\nresolutions to be considered at the meeting. A quorum may comprise a single shareholder or proxy and then such person may pass a resolution of\nshareholders and a certificate signed by such person accompanied where such person be a proxy by a copy of the proxy instrument shall constitute a valid\nresolution of shareholder. If within two hours from the time appointed for the meeting a quorum is not present, the meeting, if convened upon the\nrequisition of shareholders, shall be dissolved; in any other case it shall stand adjourned to the next business day in the jurisdiction in which the meeting\nwas to have been held at the same time and place or to such other time and place as the directors may determine, and if at the adjourned meeting there are\npresent within one hour from the time appointed for the meeting in person or by proxy not less than one third of the votes of the shares or each class or\nseries of shares entitle to vote on the matter to be considered by the meeting, those present shall constitute a quorum but otherwise the meeting shall be\ndissolved. No business may be transacted at any general meeting unless a quorum is present at the commencement of business. If present, the chair of our\nboard of directors shall be the chair presiding at any meeting of the shareholders.\nA corporation that is a shareholder shall be deemed for the purpose of our memorandum and articles of association to be present in person if\nrepresented by its duly authorized representative. This duly authorized representative shall be entitled to exercise the same powers on behalf of the\ncorporation which he represents as that corporation could exercise if it were our individual shareholder.\nProtection of minority shareholders\nWe would normally expect British Virgin Islands courts to follow English case law precedents, which permit a minority shareholder to commence\na representative action, or derivative actions in our name, to challenge (1) an act which is ultra vires or illegal, (2) an act which constitutes a fraud against\nthe minority by parties in control of us, (3) the act complained of constitutes an infringement of individual rights of shareholders, such as the right to vote\nand pre-emptive rights and (4) an irregularity in the passing of a resolution which requires a special or extraordinary majority of the shareholders.\nPre-emptive rights\nThere are no pre-emptive rights applicable to the issue by us of new Ordinary Shares under either British Virgin Islands law or our memorandum\nand articles of association.\nTransfer of ordinary shares\nSubject to the restrictions in our memorandum and articles of association and applicable securities laws, any of our shareholders may transfer all\nor any of his or her ordinary shares by written instrument of transfer signed by the transferor and containing the name and address of the transferee. Our\nboard of directors may resolve by resolution to refuse or delay the registration of the transfer of any common share. If our board of directors resolves to\nrefuse or delay any transfer, it shall specify the reasons for such refusal in the resolution. Our directors may not resolve or refuse or delay the transfer of a\ncommon share unless: (a) the person transferring the shares has failed to pay any amount due in respect of any of those shares; or (b) such refusal or delay\nis deemed necessary or advisable in our view or that of our legal counsel in order to avoid violation of, or in order to ensure compliance with, any\napplicable, corporate, securities and other laws and regulations.\nLiquidation\nIf we are wound up and the assets available for distribution among our shareholders are more than sufficient to repay all amounts paid to us on\naccount of the issue of shares immediately prior to the winding up, the excess shall be distributable pari passu among those shareholders in proportion to\nthe amount paid up immediately prior to the winding up on the shares held by them, respectively. If we are wound up and the assets available for\ndistribution among the shareholders as such are insufficient to repay the whole of the amounts paid to us on account of the issue of shares, those assets shall\nbe distributed so that, to the greatest extent possible, the losses shall be borne by the shareholders in proportion to the amounts paid up immediately prior to\nthe winding up on the shares held by them, respectively. If we are wound up, the liquidator appointed by us may, in accordance with the BVI Business\nCompanies Act, divide among our shareholders in specie or kind the whole or any part of our assets (whether they shall consist of property of the same\nkind or not) and may, for such purpose, set such value as the liquidator deems fair upon any property to be divided and may determine how such division\nshall be carried out as between the shareholders or different classes of shareholders.\nCalls on ordinary shares and forfeiture of ordinary shares\nOur board of directors may from time to time make calls upon shareholders for any amounts unpaid on their ordinary shares in a notice served to\nsuch shareholders at least 14 days prior to the specified time of payment. The ordinary shares that have been called upon and remain unpaid are subject to\nforfeiture.\nRedemption of ordinary shares\nSubject to the provisions of the BVI Business Companies Act, we may issue shares on terms that are subject to redemption, at our option or at the\noption of the holders, on such terms and in such manner as may be determined by our memorandum and articles of association and subject to any\napplicable requirements imposed from time to time by, the BVI Business Companies Act, the SEC, The NASDAQ Capital Market, or by any recognized\nstock exchange on which our securities are listed.\nModifications of rights\nAll or any of the special rights attached to any class of shares may, subject to the provisions of the BVI Business Companies Act, be amended only\npursuant to a resolution passed at a meeting by a majority of the votes cast by those entitled to vote at a meeting of the holders of the shares of that class.\nChanges in the number of shares we are authorized to issue and those in issue\nWe may from time to time by resolution of our board of directors:\n● amend our memorandum of association to increase or decrease the maximum number of shares we are authorized to issue;\n● subject to our memorandum, divide our authorized and issued shares into a larger number of shares; and\n● subject to our memorandum, combine our authorized and issued shares into a smaller number of shares.\nUntraceable shareholders\nWe are entitled to sell any shares of a shareholder who is untraceable, provided that:\n● all checks or warrants in respect of dividends of these shares, not being less than three in number, for any sums payable in cash to the holder of\nsuch shares have remained uncashed for a period of twelve years prior to the publication of the notice and during the three months referred to in\nthe third bullet point below;\n● we have not during that time received any indication of the whereabouts or existence of the shareholder or person entitled to these shares by death,\nbankruptcy or operation of law; and\n● we have caused a notice to be published in newspapers in the manner stipulated by our memorandum and articles of association, giving notice of\nour intention to sell these shares, and a period of three months has elapsed since such notice.\n● The net proceeds of any such sale shall belong to us, and when we receive these net proceeds we shall become indebted to the former shareholder\nfor an amount equal to the net proceeds.\nInspection of books and records\nUnder British Virgin Islands Law, holders of our ordinary shares are entitled, upon giving written notice to us, to inspect (i) our memorandum and\narticles of association, (ii) the register of members, (iii) the register of directors and (iv) minutes of meetings and resolutions of members, and to make\ncopies and take extracts from the documents and records. However, our directors can refuse access if they are satisfied that to allow such access would be\ncontrary to our interests. See “Where You Can Find Additional Information.”\nRights of non-resident or foreign shareholders\nThere are no limitations imposed by our memorandum and articles of association on the rights of non-resident or foreign shareholders to hold or\nexercise voting rights on our shares. In addition, there are no provisions in our memorandum and articles of association governing the ownership threshold\nabove which shareholder ownership must be disclosed.\nIssuance of additional ordinary shares\nOur memorandum and articles of association authorizes our board of directors to issue additional ordinary shares from authorized but unissued\nshares, to the extent available, from time to time as our board of directors shall determine.\nDifferences in Corporate Law\nThe BVI Business Companies Act and the laws of the British Virgin Islands affecting British Virgin Islands companies like us and our\nshareholders differ from laws applicable to U.S. corporations and their shareholders. Set forth below is a summary of the material differences between the\nprovisions of the laws of the British Virgin Islands applicable to us and the laws applicable to companies incorporated in the United States and their\nshareholders.\nMergers and similar arrangements\nUnder the laws of the British Virgin Islands, two or more companies may merge or consolidate in accordance with Section 170 of the BVI\nBusiness Companies Act. A merger means the merging of two or more constituent companies into one of the constituent companies and a consolidation\nmeans the uniting of two or more constituent companies into a new company. In order to merge or consolidate, the directors of each constituent company\nmust approve a written plan of merger or consolidation, which must be authorized by a resolution of shareholders.\nWhile a director may vote on the plan of merger or consolidation even if he has a financial interest in the plan, the interested director must disclose\nthe interest to all other directors of the company promptly upon becoming aware of the fact that he is interested in a transaction entered into or to be entered\ninto by the company.\nA transaction entered into by our company in respect of which a director is interested (including a merger or consolidation) is voidable by us\nunless the director’s interest was (a) disclosed to the board prior to the transaction or (b) the transaction is (i) between the director and the company and (ii)\nthe transaction is in the ordinary course of the company’s business and on usual terms and conditions.\nNotwithstanding the above, a transaction entered into by the company is not voidable if the material facts of the interest are known to the\nshareholders and they approve or ratify it or the company received fair value for the transaction.\nShareholders not otherwise entitled to vote on the merger or consolidation may still acquire the right to vote if the plan of merger or consolidation\ncontains any provision which, if proposed as an amendment to the memorandum or articles of association, would entitle them to vote as a class or series on\nthe proposed amendment. In any event, all shareholders must be given a copy of the plan of merger or consolidation irrespective of whether they are\nentitled to vote at the meeting to approve the plan of merger or consolidation.\nThe shareholders of the constituent companies are not required to receive shares of the surviving or consolidated company but may receive debt\nobligations or other securities of the surviving or consolidated company, other assets, or a combination thereof. Further, some or all of the shares of a class\nor series may be converted into a kind of asset while the other shares of the same class or series may receive a different kind of asset. As such, not all the\nshares of a class or series must receive the same kind of consideration.\nAfter the plan of merger or consolidation has been approved by the directors and authorized by a resolution of the shareholders, articles of merger\nor consolidation are executed by each company and filed with the Registrar of Corporate Affairs in the British Virgin Islands.\nA shareholder may dissent from a mandatory redemption of his shares, an arrangement (if permitted by the court), a merger (unless the\nshareholder was a shareholder of the surviving company prior to the merger and continues to hold the same or similar shares after the merger) or a\nconsolidation. A shareholder properly exercising his dissent rights is entitled to a cash payment equal to the fair value of his shares.\nA shareholder dissenting from a merger or consolidation must object in writing to the merger or consolidation before the vote by the shareholders\non the merger or consolidation, unless notice of the meeting was not given to the shareholder. If the merger or consolidation is approved by the\nshareholders, the company must give notice of this fact to each shareholder within 20 days who gave written objection. These shareholders then have 20\ndays to give to the company their written election in the form specified by the BVI Business Companies Act to dissent from the merger or consolidation,\nprovided that in the case of a merger, the 20 days starts when the plan of merger is delivered to the shareholder.\nUpon giving notice of his election to dissent, a shareholder ceases to have any shareholder rights except the right to be paid the fair value of his\nshares. As such, the merger or consolidation may proceed in the ordinary course notwithstanding his dissent.\nWithin seven days of the later of the delivery of the notice of election to dissent and the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the company\nmust make a written offer to each dissenting shareholder to purchase his shares at a specified price per share that the company determines to be the fair\nvalue of the shares. The company and the shareholder then have 30 days to agree upon the price. If the company and a shareholder fail to agree on the price\nwithin the 30 days, then the company and the shareholder shall, within 20 days immediately following the expiration of the 30-day period, each designate\nan appraiser and these two appraisers shall designate a third appraiser. These three appraisers shall fix the fair value of the shares as of the close of business\non the day prior to the shareholders’ approval of the transaction without taking into account any change in value as a result of the transaction.\nShareholders’ suits\nThere are both statutory and common law remedies available to our shareholders as a matter of British Virgin Islands law. These are summarized\nbelow:\nPrejudiced members\nA shareholder who considers that the affairs of the company have been, are being, or are likely to be, conducted in a manner that is, or any act or\nacts of the company have been, or are, likely to be oppressive, unfairly discriminatory or unfairly prejudicial to him in that capacity, can apply to the court\nunder Section 184I of the BVI Business Companies Act, inter alia, for an order that his shares be acquired, that he be provided compensation, that the Court\nregulate the future conduct of the company, or that any decision of the company which contravenes the BVI Business Companies Act or our memorandum\nand articles of association be set aside.\nDerivative actions\nSection 184C of the BVI Business Companies Act provides that a shareholder of a company may, with the leave of the Court, bring an action in\nthe name of the company to redress any wrong done to it.\nJust and equitable winding up\nIn addition to the statutory remedies outlined above, shareholders can also petition for the winding up of a company on the grounds that it is just\nand equitable for the court to so order. Save in exceptional circumstances, this remedy is only available where the company has been operated as a quasi\npartnership and trust and confidence between the partners has broken down.\nIndemnification of directors and executive officers and limitation of liability\nBritish Virgin Islands law does not limit the extent to which a company’s articles of association may provide for indemnification of officers and\ndirectors, except to the extent any provision providing indemnification may be held by the British Virgin Islands courts to be contrary to public policy, such\nas to provide indemnification against civil fraud or the consequences of committing a crime.\nUnder our memorandum and articles of association, we indemnify against all expenses, including legal fees, and against all judgments, fines and\namounts paid in settlement and reasonably incurred in connection with legal, administrative or investigative proceedings for any person who:\n● is or was a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed proceedings, whether civil, criminal, administrative or\ninvestigative, by reason of the fact that the person is or was our director; or\n● is or was, at our request, serving as a director or officer of, or in any other capacity is or was acting for, another body corporate or a partnership, joint\nventure, trust or other enterprise.\nThese indemnities only apply if the person acted honestly and in good faith with a view to our best interests and, in the case of criminal\nproceedings, the person had no reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. This standard of conduct is generally the same as permitted\nunder the Delaware General Corporation Law for a Delaware corporation.\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers or persons controlling us under\nthe foregoing provisions, we have been advised that in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities\nAct and is therefore unenforceable.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our memorandum and articles of association\nSome provisions of our memorandum and articles of association may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or\nmanagement that shareholders may consider favorable, including provisions that provide for a staggered board of directors and prevent shareholders from\ntaking an action by written consent in lieu of a meeting. However, under British Virgin Islands law, our directors may only exercise the rights and powers\ngranted to them under our memorandum and articles of association, as amended and restated from time to time, as they believe in good faith to be in the\nbest interests of our company.\nDirectors’ fiduciary duties\nUnder Delaware corporate law, a director of a Delaware corporation has a fiduciary duty to the corporation and its shareholders. This duty has two\ncomponents: the duty of care and the duty of loyalty. The duty of care requires that a director act in good faith, with the care that an ordinarily prudent\nperson would exercise under similar circumstances. Under this duty, a director must inform himself of, and disclose to shareholders, all material\ninformation reasonably available regarding a transaction that is material to the company. The duty of loyalty requires that a director act in a manner he\nreasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation. He must not use his corporate position for personal gain or advantage. This duty prohibits\nself-dealing by a director and mandates that the best interest of the corporation and its shareholders take precedence over any interest possessed by a\ndirector, officer or controlling shareholder and not shared by the shareholders generally. In general, actions of a director are presumed to have been made\non an informed basis, in good faith and in the honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the corporation. However, this presumption may\nbe rebutted by evidence of a breach of one of the fiduciary duties. Should such evidence be presented concerning a transaction by a director, a director must\nprove the procedural fairness of the transaction and that the transaction was of fair value to the corporation.\nUnder British Virgin Islands law, our directors owe the company certain statutory and fiduciary duties including, among others, a duty to act\nhonestly, in good faith, for a proper purpose and with a view to what the directors believe to be in the best interests of the company. Our directors are also\nrequired, when exercising powers or performing duties as a director, to exercise the care, diligence and skill that a reasonable director would exercise in\ncomparable circumstances, taking into account without limitation, the nature of the company, the nature of the decision and the position of the director and\nthe nature of the responsibilities undertaken. In the exercise of their powers, our directors must ensure neither they nor the company acts in a manner which\ncontravenes the BVI Business Companies Act or our memorandum and articles of association, as amended and re-stated from time to time. A shareholder\nhas the right to seek damages for breaches of duties owed to us by our directors.\nShareholder action by written consent\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, a corporation may eliminate the right of shareholders to act by written consent by amendment to its\ncertificate of incorporation. British Virgin Islands law provides that shareholders may approve corporate matters by way of a written resolution without a\nmeeting signed by or on behalf of shareholders sufficient to constitute the requisite majority of shareholders who would have been entitled to vote on such\nmatter at a general meeting; provided that if the consent is less than unanimous, notice must be given to all non-consenting shareholders. Our memorandum\nand articles of association permit shareholders to act by written consent.\nShareholder proposals\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, a shareholder has the right to put any proposal before the annual meeting of shareholders, provided\nit complies with the notice provisions in the governing documents. A special meeting may be called by the board of directors or any other person authorized\nto do so in the governing documents, but shareholders may be precluded from calling special meetings. British Virgin Islands law and our memorandum\nand articles of association allow our shareholders holding not less than 30% of the votes of the outstanding voting shares to requisition a shareholders’\nmeeting. We are not obliged by law to call shareholders’ annual general meetings, but our memorandum and articles of association do permit the directors\nto call such a meeting. The location of any shareholders’ meeting can be determined by the board of directors and can be held anywhere in the world.\nCumulative voting\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, cumulative voting for elections of directors is not permitted unless the corporation’s certificate of\nincorporation specifically provides for it. Cumulative voting potentially facilitates the representation of minority shareholders on a board of directors since\nit permits the minority shareholder to cast all the votes to which the shareholder is entitled on a single director, which increases the shareholder’s voting\npower with respect to electing such director. As permitted under British Virgin Islands law, our memorandum and articles of association do not provide for\ncumulative voting. As a result, our shareholders are not afforded any less protections or rights on this issue than shareholders of a Delaware corporation.\nRemoval of directors\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, a director of a corporation with a classified board may be removed only for cause with the approval\nof a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote, unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. Under our memorandum and articles of\nassociation, directors can be removed from office, with cause, by a resolution of shareholders or by a resolution of directors passed at a meeting of directors\ncalled for the purpose of removing the director or for purposes including the removal of the director.\nTransactions with interested shareholders\nThe Delaware General Corporation Law contains a business combination statute applicable to Delaware public corporations whereby, unless the\ncorporation has specifically elected not to be governed by such statute by amendment to its certificate of incorporation, it is prohibited from engaging in\ncertain business combinations with an “interested shareholder” for three years following the date that such person becomes an interested shareholder. An\ninterested shareholder generally is a person or group who or which owns or owned 15% or more of the target’s outstanding voting shares within the past\nthree years. This has the effect of limiting the ability of a potential acquirer to make a two-tiered bid for the target in which all shareholders would not be\ntreated equally. The statute does not apply if, among other things, prior to the date on which such shareholder becomes an interested shareholder, the board\nof directors approves either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the person becoming an interested shareholder. This encourages\nany potential acquirer of a Delaware public corporation to negotiate the terms of any acquisition transaction with the target’s board of directors. British\nVirgin Islands law has no comparable statute.\nDissolution; Winding Up\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, unless the board of directors approves the proposal to dissolve, dissolution must be approved by\nshareholders holding 100% of the total voting power of the corporation. Only if the dissolution is initiated by the board of directors may it be approved by a\nsimple majority of the corporation’s outstanding shares. Delaware law allows a Delaware corporation to include in its certificate of incorporation a\nsupermajority voting requirement in connection with dissolutions initiated by the board. Under the BVI Business Companies Act and our memorandum and\narticles of association, we may appoint a voluntary liquidator by a resolution of the shareholders or by resolution of directors.\nVariation of rights of shares\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, a corporation may vary the rights of a class of shares with the approval of a majority of the\noutstanding shares of such class, unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. Under our memorandum and articles of association, if at any\ntime our shares are divided into different classes of shares, the rights attached to any class may only be varied, whether or not our company is in\nliquidation, with the consent in writing of or by a resolution passed at a meeting by the holders of not less than 50 percent of the issued shares in that class.\nAmendment of governing documents\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, a corporation’s governing documents may be amended with the approval of a majority of the\noutstanding shares entitled to vote, unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. As permitted by British Virgin Islands law, our memorandum\nand articles of association may be amended by a resolution of shareholders and, subject to certain exceptions, by a resolution of directors. Any amendment\nis effective from the date it is registered at the Registry of Corporate Affairs in the British Virgin Islands.\nExhibit 8.1\nSUBSIDIARIES OF THE REGISTRANT\nSubsidiary Jurisdiction of incorporation\nMoxian CN Group Limited Samoa\nMoxian Group Limited British Virgin Islands\nMoxian (Hong Kong) Limited Hong Kong\nWoodland Corporation Limited Hong Kong\nMoxian Malaysia Sdn.Bhd Malaysia\nAbit USA, Inc.

Please follow\nthe directions that your bank or broker provides.\nMay I vote at the meeting?\nIf you are a shareholder of record, you may vote in person at the meeting. If you hold your shares through an account with a bank or broker, please\nfollow the directions provided to you by your bank or broker. If you wish to vote in person at the meeting, please contact your bank or broker to learn the\nprocedures necessary to allow you to vote your shares in person. Even if you plan to attend the meeting, we encourage you to vote your shares by proxy.\nYou may vote by proxy through the Internet, by telephone or by mail.\nCan I change my mind after I return my proxy?\nYou may change your vote at any time before the polls close at the conclusion of voting at the meeting. You may do this by (1) signing another\nproxy card with a later date and returning it to us prior to 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on December 9, 2024, (2) voting again via email prior to 5:00 p.m.,\nEastern Time, on December 9, 2024, (3) voting again via fax prior to 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on December 9, 2024, or (4) voting at the meeting if you are\na registered shareholder or have followed the necessary procedures required by your bank or broker.\nWhat if I return my proxy card but do not provide voting instructions?\nProxies that are signed and returned but do not contain instructions will be voted in favor of Proposals 1, 2, 3 and 4 in accordance with the best\njudgment of the named proxies on any other matters properly brought before the meeting.\nWhat does it mean if I receive more than one proxy card or instruction form?\nIt indicates that your Ordinary Shares are registered differently and are in more than one account. To ensure that all shares are voted, please either vote\neach account by telephone or on the Internet, or sign and return all proxy cards. We encourage you to register all your accounts in the same name and\naddress. Those holding shares through a bank or broker should contact their bank or broker and request consolidation.\nWill my shares be voted if I do not provide my proxy or instruction form?\nIf you are a registered shareholder and do not provide a proxy, you must attend the meeting in order to vote your shares. If you hold shares through an\naccount with a bank or broker, your shares may be voted even if you do not provide voting instructions on your instruction form. Brokerage firms have the\nauthority to vote shares for which their customers do not provide voting instructions on certain routine matters. The ratification of Audit Alliance LLP as\nthe Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024 is considered a routine matter for which\nbrokerage firms may vote without specific instructions. However, election of directors is no longer considered a routine matter for which brokerage firms\nmay vote without specific instructions. Approval of the Reverse Share Split is not a routine matter. When a proposal is not a routine matter and the\nbrokerage firm has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares with respect to that proposal, the brokerage firm cannot vote the\nshares on that proposal. Shares that a broker is not authorized to vote are counted as “broker non-votes.”\nHow can I attend the meeting?\nThe meeting is open to all holders of the Company’s Ordinary Shares and Preferred Shares as of October 23, 2024.\nMay shareholders ask questions at the meeting?\nYes. Representatives of the Company will answer questions of general interest at the end of the meeting. You may also submit questions in advance via\nemail to yf@abitgrp.com or a letter to the offices of the Company at Level 24, Lee Garden One, 33 Hysan Avenue, Causeway Bay, Hong Kong SAR. Such\nquestions will also be addressed at the end of the meeting.\nHow many votes must be present to hold the meeting?\nYour shares are counted as present at the meeting if you attend the meeting and vote in person or if you properly return a proxy by internet, email, fax\nor mail. In order for us to conduct our meeting, one-third (1/3) of our outstanding Ordinary Shares as of October 23, 2024 must be present in person or by\nproxy. This is referred to as a quorum. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum at the meeting.\nHow many votes are needed to approve the Company’s proposals?\nProposal 1. The nominees receiving the highest number of “For” votes will be elected as directors. This number is called a plurality. Shares not voted\nwill have no impact on the election of directors. The proxy given will be voted “For” each of the nominees for director unless a properly executed proxy\ncard is marked “Abstain” as to a particular nominee or nominees for director..\nProposal 2. The ratification of the appointment of Audit Alliance LLP as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal\nyear ending December 31, 2024 requires that a majority of the votes cast at the meeting be voted “For” the proposal. A properly executed proxy card\nmarked “Abstain” with respect to this proposal will not be voted.\nProposal 3. The approval of a Reverse Share Split at a ratio ranging from any whole number between one-for-six and one-for-fifteen, with the exact\nratio to be determined by the Board in its discretion, requires that a majority of the votes cast at the meeting be voted “For” the proposal. A properly\nexecuted proxy card marked “Abstain” with respect to this proposal will not be voted.\nProposal 4. Transacting any other business properly coming before the meeting requires that a majority of the votes cast at the meeting be voted “For”\nthe proposal. A properly executed proxy card marked “Abstain” with respect to this proposal will not be voted.\nPROPOSAL ONE\nELECTION OF DIRECTORS AND DIRECTOR BIOGRAPHIES\n(ITEM 1 ON THE PROXY CARD)\nA brief biography of each Director follows.

Mr. Zhan is a well-known investor in China, having successfully invested in a\nnumber of start-ups and public companies in the sectors of new technologies and renewable energies.

Ms. Sun received her Bachelor of Law degree from Beijing Technology and Business University in 2009.\nMs. Sun is nominated to serve as a director because of her in-depth knowledge of our organization and extensive experience in corporate human\nresources management.\nInvolvement in Certain Legal Proceedings\nTo the best of our knowledge, none of our directors or officers has been convicted in a criminal proceeding, excluding traffic violations or similar\nmisdemeanors, nor has any been a party to any judicial or administrative proceeding during the past five years that resulted in a judgment, decree or final\norder enjoining the person from future violations of, or prohibiting activities subject to, federal or state securities laws, or a finding of any violation of\nfederal or state securities laws, except for matters that were dismissed without sanction or settlement. Except as set forth in our discussion in “Related Party\nTransactions,” our directors and officers have not been involved in any transactions with us or any of our affiliates or associates which are required to be\ndisclosed pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC.\nDirector Independence\nThe Board of Directors has reviewed the independence of our directors, applying the NASDAQ independence standards. Based on this review, the\nBoard of Directors determined that each of Lionel Choong, Tao Xu and Chuan Zhan are independent within the meaning of the NASDAQ rules. In making\nthis determination, our Board of Directors considered the relationships that each of these non-employee directors has with us and all other facts and\ncircumstances our Board of Directors deemed relevant in determining their independence. As required under applicable NASDAQ rules, we anticipate that\nour independent directors will meet on a regular basis as often as necessary to fulfill their responsibilities, including at least annually in executive session\nwithout the presence of non-independent directors and management.\nBoard Leadership Structure\nMr. Conglin Deng serves as the Chief Executive Officer and Executive Director of the Company. As a smaller public company, we believe it is in the\ncompany’s best interest to allow the company to benefit from guidance from key members of management in a variety of capacities. We do not have a lead\nindependent director and do not anticipate having a lead independent director because we will encourage our independent directors to freely voice their\nopinions on a relatively small company board. We believe this leadership structure is appropriate because we are a relatively small public company.\nRisk Oversight\nOur Board of Directors plays a significant role in our risk oversight. The Board of Directors makes or approve all relevant Company decisions. As\nsuch, it is important for us to have our Chief Executive Officer serve on the Board as he plays a key role in the risk oversight of the Company. As a smaller\nreporting company with a small board of directors, we believe it is appropriate to have the involvement and input of all of our directors in risk oversight\nmatters.\nWE RECOMMEND THAT YOU VOTE FOR THE ELECTION OF All\nNOMINEES TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.\nPROPOSAL TWO\nRATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF AUDIT ALLIANCE LLP\n(ITEM 2 ON THE PROXY CARD)\nWhat am I voting on?\nA proposal to ratify the appointment of Audit Alliance LLP as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending\nDecember 31, 2024. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has appointed Audit Alliance LLP to serve as the Company’s fiscal year 2023\nindependent registered public accounting firm. Although the Company’s governing documents do not require the submission of this matter to shareholders,\nthe Board of Directors considers it desirable that the appointment of Audit Alliance LLP be ratified by shareholders.\nHas the Company changed its independent registered public accounting firm during its two most recent fiscal years?\nNo. Audit Alliance LLP served as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023.\nWhat services will Audit Alliance LLP provide?\nAudit services provided by Audit Alliance LLP for fiscal 2024 will include the examination of the consolidated financial statements of the Company\nand services related to periodic reports made with the SEC.\nWill a representative of Audit Alliance LLP be present at the meeting?\nOne or more representatives of Audit Alliance LLP may be present at the meeting. The representatives will have an opportunity to make a statement if\nthey desire and will be available to respond to questions from shareholders.\nWhat if this proposal is not approved?\nIf the appointment of Audit Alliance LLP is not ratified, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors will reconsider the appointment.\nWE RECOMMEND THAT YOU VOTE FOR THE RATIFICATION OF\nAUDIT ALLIANCE LLP AS THE COMPANY’S FISCAL 2024 INDEPENDENT\nREGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM.\nPROPOSAL THREE\nREVERSE SHARE SPLIT PROPOSAL\n(ITEM 3 ON THE PROXY CARD)\nThe Company is asking its shareholders to approve an amendment (the “Amendment”) to the Company’s existing memorandum and articles of\nassociation, as amended, (the “Memorandum and Articles”) giving effect to a share consolidation of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s\nordinary shares at a ratio within a range of one-for-six to one-for-fifteen, subject to and as determined by the Board of Directors, or the Reverse Split\nProposal.\nOur Board of Directors is submitting the Reverse Split Proposal to our shareholders for approval with the intent of increasing the market price of our\nordinary shares to enhance our ability to meet the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market. Immediately upon completion of the\nReverse Split, our ordinary shares are expected to have a bid price of at least $1.00 per share. The Board has approved and declared advisable an\namendment to the Memorandum and Articles giving effect to the Reverse Split and recommends that our shareholders approve such amendment. Even if\nshareholders approve the Reverse Split Proposal, the Board of Directors acting in its discretion could elect not to complete a Reverse Split if it determines\nsuch action to be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.\nPurpose and Background of the Reverse Share Split\nOn November 4, 2024, the Board approved the Reverse Share Split and the resulting amendment to our Memorandum and Articles and believes that it\nis in our shareholders’ best interests for the following reasons:\n● Effecting the Reverse Share Split would be the most effective means of regaining compliance with Nasdaq’s minimum bid price requirement\n(as described below) for continued listing of our ordinary shares on the Nasdaq Capital Market;\n● Continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market provides overall credibility to an investment in our shares, given the stringent listing and\ndisclosure requirements of Nasdaq Stock Markets;\n● Effecting the Reverse Share Split could improve the liquidity and marketability of our ordinary shares, attract potential investment from\ninstitutional investors, and drive future anticipated growth.\nOn April 12, 2024, the Company received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) notifying\nthe Company that the minimum closing bid price per share for the Company’s ordinary shares was below $1.00 for a period of 30 consecutive business\ndays and that the Company did not meet the minimum bid price requirement set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the “Minimum Bid Price\nRequirement”). The Company was provided 180 calendar days, or until October 9, 2024, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement.\nThe Company’s ordinary shares had not regained compliance within the initial compliance period. On October 10, 2024, Nasdaq granted the Company an\nadditional 180 calendar day period, or until April 7, 2025, to regain compliance with the requirement. To regain compliance, the bid price of the Company’s\nordinary shares must close at or above $1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days at any time during the second 180-day compliance\nperiod.\nOn November 1, 2024, the closing price of our ordinary shares on the Nasdaq was $0.55 per share. A decrease in the number of issued ordinary shares\nresulting from the Reverse Share Split should, absent other factors, cause the per share market price of our ordinary shares to trade above the required price.\nHowever, we cannot provide any assurance that we will regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, or other listing requirements of\nNasdaq.\nIf shareholders do not approve the Reverse Share Split Proposal and the Company’s share price does not otherwise increase to greater than $1.00 per\nshare for at least 10 consecutive trading days, we expect the ordinary shares to be subject to a delisting action by Nasdaq. We believe that the Reverse Share\nSplit is the most likely way to assist the share price in reaching the level under the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, although effecting the Reverse Split\ncannot guarantee that the ordinary shares would be in compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement for even the minimum 10-day trading period,\nor that our minimum bid price would remain over the Minimum Bid Price Requirement following the Reverse Share Split.\nProcedure for Implementing the Reverse Share Split\nThe Reverse Split would become effective upon the filing (the “Effective Time”) of a certificate of amendment to our Memorandum and Articles in the\nBritish Virgin Islands. The exact timing of the filing of the certificate of amendment that will effect the Reverse Split will be determined by our board of\ndirectors based on its evaluation as to when such action will be the most advantageous to the Company and our shareholders. In addition, our board of\ndirectors reserves the right, notwithstanding shareholder approval and without further action by the shareholders, to elect not to proceed with the Reverse\nSplit if, at any time prior to filing the amendment to the Company’s Memorandum and Articles, our board of directors, in its sole discretion, determines that\nit is no longer in our best interest and the best interests of our shareholders to proceed with the Reverse Split.\nEffects of the Reverse Share Split\nDepending on the ratio for the Reverse Split determined by our Board, a minimum of six and a maximum of fifteen shares of existing ordinary shares\nwill be combined into one new ordinary share. The actual number of shares issued after giving effect to the Reverse Split, if implemented, will depend on\nthe reverse split ratio that is ultimately determined by our Board of Directors.\nThe Reverse Split will affect all holders of our ordinary shares uniformly and will not affect any holder’s percentage interest in the Company, except as\ndescribed herein the effects with respect to any resulting fractional shares. No fractional ordinary shares will be issued to any shareholders in connection\nwith the Reverse Split. The Company will purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire at market value any fractional shares.\nThe Reverse Split may result in some shareholders owning “odd lots” of less than 100 ordinary shares. Odd lot shares may be more difficult to sell,\nand brokerage commissions and other costs of transactions in odd lots are generally somewhat higher than the costs of transactions in “round lots” of even\nmultiples of 100 shares.\nIf the Reverse Split Proposal is effected, then we would continue to have two classes of shares outstanding, and holders of preferred shares would\ncontinue to have six votes per share, while holders of ordinary shares would have one vote per share following the Reverse Split. The voting rights, rights\nto dividends and distributions and other rights of ordinary shares will not be changed as a result of the Reverse Split (subject to the treatment of fractional\nshares and preferred shares). However, as a result of the Reverse Split, the voting rights of all ordinary shares would effectively be reduced, as compared to\nthat of preferred shares, by the reverse split ratio that is ultimately determined by our board of directors.\nThe Reverse Share Split, if implemented, will not affect the issued and outstanding preferred shares. However, in the event of a conversion of preferred\nshares into ordinary shares, pursuant to an amendment to the Memorandum and Articles, the number of ordinary shares into which the preferred shares will\nbe converted will be reduced by the same reverse split ratio as that for the Reverse Split of ordinary shares that is ultimately adopted by our Board of\nDirectors.\nBeneficial Holders of Ordinary Shares (i.e. shareholders who hold in street name)\nUpon the implementation of the Reverse Split, we intend to treat shares held by shareholders through a bank, broker, custodian or other nominee in the\nsame manner as registered shareholders whose shares are registered in their names. Banks, brokers, custodians or other nominees will be instructed to\naffect the Reverse Split for their beneficial holders holding our ordinary shares in street name. However, these banks, brokers, custodians or other nominees\nmay have different procedures than registered shareholders for processing the Reverse Split. Shareholders who hold our ordinary shares with a bank,\nbroker, custodian or other nominee and who have any questions in this regard are encouraged to contact their banks, brokers, custodians or other nominees.\nRegistered “Book-Entry” Holders of Ordinary Shares (i.e. shareholders that are registered on the transfer agent’s books and records but do not\nhold share certificates)\nCertain of our registered holders of ordinary shares may hold some or all of their shares electronically in book-entry form with the transfer agent.\nThese shareholders do not have share certificates evidencing their ownership of the ordinary shares. They are, however, provided with a statement\nreflecting the number of shares registered in their accounts.\nShareholders who hold shares electronically in book-entry form with the transfer agent will not need to take action (the exchange will be automatic) to\nreceive whole shares of post-Reverse Split ordinary shares, and the Company will purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any fractional shares resulting\nfrom the Reverse Split.\nHolders of Certificated Ordinary Shares\nShareholders holding ordinary shares in certificated form will be sent a transmittal letter by our transfer agent after the Effective Time. The letter of\ntransmittal will contain instructions on how a shareholder should surrender his, her or its certificate(s) representing ordinary shares (the “Old Certificates”)\nto the transfer agent in exchange for certificates representing the appropriate number of whole shares of post-Reverse Split ordinary shares (the “New\nCertificates”). No New Certificates will be issued to a shareholder until such shareholder has surrendered all Old Certificates, together with a properly\ncompleted and executed letter of transmittal, to the transfer agent. No shareholder will be required to pay a transfer or other fee to exchange his, her or its\nOld Certificates. Shareholders will then receive a statement electronically in book-entry form reflecting the number of shares registered in their accounts, or\nif any shareholders so elect, a New Certificate(s) representing the number of whole ordinary shares that they are entitled as a result of the Reverse Split.\nUntil surrendered, we will deem outstanding Old Certificates held by shareholders to be cancelled and only to represent the number of whole shares of\npost-Reverse Split ordinary shares to which these shareholders are entitled. Any Old Certificates submitted for exchange, whether because of a sale,\ntransfer or other disposition of shares, will automatically be exchanged for electronic book-entry statements or New Certificates. If an Old Certificate has a\nrestrictive legend on the back of the Old Certificate(s), the book-entry statements or New Certificates will be issued with the same restrictive legends\nreflected in the book-entry statement(s) or on the back of the Old Certificate(s).\nSHAREHOLDERS SHOULD NOT DESTROY ANY SHARE CERTIFICATE(S) AND SHOULD NOT SUBMIT ANY SHARE\nCERTIFICATE(S) UNTIL REQUESTED TO DO SO.\nFederal Income Tax Consequences of the Reverse Split\nThe following summary describes material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Reverse Split to holders of our ordinary shares.\nUnless otherwise specifically indicated herein, this summary addresses the tax consequences only to a beneficial owner of our ordinary shares that is a\ncitizen or individual resident of the United States, a corporation organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of\nColumbia or otherwise subject to U.S. federal income taxation on a net income basis in respect of our ordinary shares (a “U.S. holder”). A trust may also be\na U.S. holder if (1) a U.S. court is able to exercise primary supervision over administration of such trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to\ncontrol all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) it has a valid election in place to be treated as a U.S. person.

Therefore, a shareholder generally will not recognize\ngain or loss on the Reverse Split, except to the extent of cash, if any, received in lieu of a fractional share interest in the post-Reverse Split shares. The\naggregate tax basis of the post-split shares received will be equal to the aggregate tax basis of the pre-split shares exchanged therefore (excluding any\nportion of the holder’s basis allocated to fractional shares), and the holding period of the post-split shares received will include the holding period of the\npre-split shares exchanged. A holder of the pre-split shares who receives cash will generally recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the\nportion of the tax basis of the pre-split shares allocated to the fractional share interest and the cash received. Such gain or loss will be a capital gain or loss\nand will be short term if the pre-split shares were held for one year or less and long term if held more than one year. No gain or loss will be recognized by\nus as a result of the Reverse Split.\nNo Appraisal Rights\nUnder the BVI law and our charter documents, holders of our ordinary shares will not be entitled to dissenter’s rights or appraisal rights with respect to\nthe Reverse Split.\nRequired Vote\nThe affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of votes cast by our issued and outstanding ordinary shares and preferred shares that are present in\nperson or by proxy at our annual meeting is required to approve the Reverse Split Proposal, provided we have quorum for the meeting. For the Reverse\nSplit Proposal, ordinary shares will have one vote per share, preferred shares will have six votes per share, and ordinary shares and preferred shares will be\ncounted as a single group, with a majority of the group required for approval.\nWE RECOMMEND THAT YOU VOTE FOR THE REVERSE SHARE SPLIT PROPOSAL.\nBOARD OF DIRECTORS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE INFORMATION\nWhat if a nominee is unwilling or unable to serve?\nThe nominee listed in the Proxy Statement has agreed to serve as a director, if elected.

After accounting for direct costs of revenue\namounting to $2.68 million, primarily electricity costs of $1.1 million and depreciation of $1.27 million, the gross profit from the mining operation was\n$0.75 million.\nThe loss before tax of the group was $0.14 million after accounting for administrative and general overheads.his result compares favorably with the\nprevious period when the loss was $3.5 million. Administrative and general overheads during the period almost doubled to 1.11 million compared to $0.7\nmillion as new staff were added to support production on a 24/7 basis as well as an increase on maintenance and insurance costs now that the data center\nwas fully operational.\nIn April, the Company further improved its water supply and since then, all production lines have been kept running. During the peak construction periods,\na 100,000-gallon reservoir helps to subsidize any shortages from the water company during the day and is replenished at night when consumption is much\nlower. The hydro cooling method introduced with the new batch of machines helps to reduce noise and dust instead of the traditional air cooling by fans.\nThere is no substantial change in the Balance Sheet of the Group except that more Ant-miner machines were purchased for $0.86 million and a piece of\nproperty in Wisconsin acquired for $0.65 million in the period to June. Cash and cash balances dwindled to $0.4 million as of June 30, 2024.\nWith the halving of mining rewards in late in April, production output will be much lower for the rest of 2024.

Organization and nature of operations\nThe Company was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands (BVI) on May 18, 2021. On August 17, 2021, the Company completed a re-domicile merger\nwith its predecessor company, Moxian, Inc, wherein it acquired all the assets, liabilities, rights, obligations and operations of the latter and its subsidiaries,\nthrough an exchange of an identical number of shares.\nOn December 28, 2021 in a Special Meeting of shareholders, the Company approved the issue of up to 20 million new ordinary shares of the Company, at a\nprice of $2.50 per share to certain non-US based accredited investors. On February 11, 2022 the Company completed this private placement and issued 16\nmillion new shares, raising $40 million, which it has used in bitcoin mining operations.\nThe Company operates in the United States of America through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Abit USA Inc which has a mining facility in the town of\nDuff, Eastern Tennessee.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the activities of the Company and each of the following entities:\nName of entity Background Ownership\nAbit Hong Kong Limited Investment Holding 100% owned by Moxian (BVI) Inc\nAbit USA Inc. Bitcoin Mining 100% owned by Abit Hong Kong Limited\nBeijing BitMarix Co. Ltd. Inhouse Treasury and Administration 100% owned by Abit Hong Kong Limited\nAbits Inc Bitcoin Mining 100% owned by Abit Hong Kong Limited\n2. Summary of principal accounting policies\nBasis of presentation and consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in\nthe United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and include all the subsidiaries of the Group. The financial year-end of the Company is December 31 while\nthat of the predecessor company is September 30. The consolidated results are presented as of the period ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023. All inter\ncompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in the consolidation.\nFair value of financial instruments\nThe Company follows the provisions of ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.” ASC 820 clarifies the definition of fair value, prescribes\nmethods for measuring fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:\nLevel 1-Observable inputs such as unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date.\nLevel 2-Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and\nliabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market\ndata.\nLevel 3-Inputs are unobservable inputs that reflect management’s assumptions based on the best available information.\nThe carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, prepayments, deposits and other receivables, accruals and other payables, loans from related parties and\nunrelated party approximate their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments.\nF-5\nABITS GROUP INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n2. Summary of principal accounting policies (continued)\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the accompanying consolidated\nfinancial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates required to be made by\nmanagement include but not limited to, useful lives of property and equipment, provision for doubtful accounts, intangible assets valuation, inventory\nvaluation, value added recoverable valuation and deferred tax assets valuation. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash includes cash on hand and demand deposits in accounts maintained with commercial banks. The Company considers all highly liquid investment\ninstruments with an original maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.\nThe Company considers all short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and have original maturities of three\nmonths or less to be cash equivalents.\nPrepayments, deposits and other receivables\nPrepayments and deposits represent amounts advanced to suppliers. The suppliers usually require advance payments or deposits when the Company makes\npurchase or orders service and the prepayments and deposits will be utilized to offset the Company’s future payments. Other receivables mainly consist of\nvarious cash advances to employees for business needs. These amounts are unsecured, non-interest bearing and generally short-term in nature.\nAllowances are recorded when utilization and collection of amounts due are in doubt. Delinquent prepayments, deposits and other receivables are written-\noff after management has determined that the likelihood of utilization or collection is not probable and known bad debts are written off against the\nallowances when identified.\nProperty, Equipment and Vehicles, net\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Significant additions or improvements extending useful lives\nof assets are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line\nmethod over the estimated useful lives as follows:\nElectronic and mining equipment 3-6 years\nFurniture and fixtures 3-6 years\nVehicles 3 years\nIntangible assets, net\nIntangible assets, comprising Intellectual property rights (“IP rights”) and software, which are separable from property and equipment, are stated at cost\nless accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of 3- 10 years.\nF-6\nABITS GROUP INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n2. Summary of principal accounting policies (continued)\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nThe Company classifies its long-lived assets into: (i) computer and office equipment; (ii) furniture and fixtures, (iii) leasehold improvements, and (iv)\nfinite-lived intangible assets.\nLong-lived assets held and used by the Company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value\nof such assets may not be fully recoverable. It is possible that these assets could become impaired as a result of technology, economy or other industry\nchanges. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group to be tested for possible impairment, the Company first compares undiscounted cash\nflows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset or asset group is not\nrecoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Fair value is\ndetermined through various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models, relief from royalty income approach, quoted market values and\nthird-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary.\nThe Company makes various assumptions and estimates regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair values of the\nrespective assets. The assumptions and estimates used to determine future values and remaining useful lives of long-lived assets are complex and\nsubjective. They can be affected by various factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as the\nCompany’s business strategy and its forecasts for specific market expansion.\nDigital assets\nDigital assets are included in non-current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Digital assets purchased are recorded at cost and digital\nassets awarded to the Company through its mining activities are accounted for in connection with the Company’s revenue recognition policy disclosed\nbelow.\nDigital assets held are accounted for as intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized but\nassessed for impairment annually, or more frequently, when events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that it is more likely than not that the\nindefinite-lived asset is impaired. Impairment exists when the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, which is measured using the quoted price of the\ndigital assets at the time its fair value is being measured. In testing for impairment, the Company has the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to\ndetermine whether it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. If it is determined that it is not more likely than not that an impairment exists, a\nquantitative impairment test is not necessary. If the Company concludes otherwise, it is required to perform a quantitative impairment test. To the extent an\nimpairment loss is recognized, the loss establishes the new cost basis of the asset.\nMeanwhile, on December 13, 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-08, which addresses the accounting and disclosure requirements for certain crypto assets.\nThe new guidance requires entities to subsequently measure certain crypto assets at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in net income in each\nreporting period. For all entities, the ASU’s amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, including interim periods within\nthose years. Early adoption is permitted. If an entity adopts the amendments in an interim period, it must adopt them as of the beginning of the fiscal year\nthat includes that interim period.\nEffective January 1, 2023, the Company early adopted ASU 2023-08, which requires entities to measure crypto assets at fair value with changes recognized\nin the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss) each reporting period.\nThe Company’s digital assets are within the scope of ASU 2023-08 and the transition guidance requires a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the beginning\nof the current fiscal year for any difference between the carrying amount of the Company’s digital assets and fair value.\nPurchases of digital assets by the Company, if any, will be included within investing activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows,\nwhile digital assets awarded to the Company through its mining activities are included within operating activities on the accompanying consolidated\nstatements of cash flows. The sales of digital assets are included within investing activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows and\nany realized gains or losses from such sales are included in “realized gain (loss) on exchange of digital assets” in the consolidated statements of operations\nand comprehensive income (loss). The Company accounts for its gains or losses in accordance with the first-in first-out method of accounting.\nRevenue recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”).\nThe Company has entered into digital asset mining pools by executing contracts with mining pool operators to provide computing power to the mining\npool. The Company’s enforceable right to compensation begins only when, and lasts as long as, the Company provides computing power to the mining\npool operator and is created as power is provided over time. The only consideration due to the Company relates to the provision of computing power. The\ncontracts are terminable at any time by and at no cost to the Company, and by the pool operator under certain conditions specified in the contract. Providing\ncomputing power in digital asset transaction verification services is an output of the Company’s ordinary activities. Providing such computing power is the\nonly performance obligation in the Company’s contracts with mining pool operators.\nThe transaction consideration the Company receives, if any, is noncash consideration in the form of bitcoin. Changes in the fair value of the noncash\nconsideration due to form of the consideration (changes in the market price of Bitcoin) are not included in the transaction price and therefore, are not\nincluded in revenue. Certain mining pool operators charge fees to cover the costs of maintaining the pool and are deducted from amounts we may otherwise\nearn and are treated as a reduction to the consideration received. Fees fluctuate and historically have been no more than approximately 2% per reward\nearned, on average.\nF-7\n2. Summary of principal accounting policies (continued)\nRevenue recognition (continued)\nIn exchange for providing computing power, the Company is entitled to either:\na Full-Pay-Per-Share pay out of bitcoin based on a contractual formula, which primarily calculates the hash rate provided by the Company to the mining\npool as a percentage of total network hash rate, and other inputs. The Company is entitled to consideration even if a block is not successfully placed by the\nmining pool operator. The contract is in effect until terminated by either party.\nThe consideration is all variable. Because it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue will not occur and the Company is able to calculate\nthe payout based on the contractual formula, noncash revenue is estimated and recognized based on the spot price of Bitcoin determined using the\nCompany’s primary trading platform for bitcoin at the inception of each contract, which is determined to be daily. Non cash consideration is measured at\nfair value at contract inception. Fair value of the crypto asset consideration is determined using the quoted price on the Company’s primary trading\nplatform for bitcoin at the beginning of the contract period at the single bitcoin level (one bitcoin). This amount is estimated and recognized in revenue\nupon inception, which is when hash rate is provided.\nOr:\na fractional share of the fixed Bitcoin award the mining pool operator receives (less digital asset transaction fees to the mining pool operator which are\nimmaterial and are recorded as a deduction from revenue) for successfully adding a block to the blockchain based on a proportion of the Company’s\n“scoring hash rate” to the pool’s “scoring hash rate” where the scoring hash rate as defined by the pool is the exponential moving average of the hash\npower contributed by the Company or by all pool members combined. The Company’s fractional share of the bitcoin reward is based on the proportion of\ncomputing power the Company contributed to the mining pool operator to the total computing power contributed by all mining pool participants in solving\nthe current algorithm.\nIncome taxes\nThe Company utilizes ASC Topic 740 (“ASC 740”) “Income taxes”, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected\nfuture tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred income taxes\nare recognized for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at\neach period end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.\nValuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nF-8\nABITS GROUP INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n2. Summary of principal accounting policies (continued)”\nIncome taxes (continued)\nASC 740 “Income taxes” clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. This interpretation requires that an entity recognizes in the financial\nstatements the impact of a tax position, if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the\nposition. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or\nmeasurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company has elected to classify interest and penalties related to\nunrecognized tax benefits, if and when required, as part of income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company evaluate the\nlevel of authority for each uncertain tax position (including the potential application of interest and penalties) based on the technical merits, and measure\nthe unrecognized benefits associated with the tax positions.\nForeign currency transactions and translation\nThe reporting currency of the Company is United States Dollars (the “USD”) and the functional currency of the PRC subsidiary is the Renminbi\n(“RMB”).The functional currency of ABit Hong Kong is the Hong Kong Dollar (the “HKD”).\nFor financial reporting purposes, the financial statements of the various subsidiaries are prepared using their respective functional currencies, translated into\nthe reporting currency, USD so to be consolidated with the Company’s. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the reporting\ncurrency are translated into the reporting currency at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated using\naverage rates prevailing during the reporting period. Adjustments resulting from the translation are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other\ncomprehensive income in stockholders’ deficiency. Translation losses are recognized in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nThe exchange rates applied are as follows:\nBalance sheet items, except for equity accounts June 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nRMB:USD 7.1268 7.0827\nHKD:USD 7.8087 7.8157\nItems in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss, and statements cash flows:\nJune 30, 2024 June 30, 2023\nRMB:USD 7.1162 6.9291\nHKD:USD 7.8187 7.8392\nEarnings per share\nBasic gain per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period while the effects of potential common\nshares outstanding during the period are included in diluted earnings per share.\nFASB Accounting Standard Codification Topic 260 (“ASC 260”), “Earnings Per Share,” requires that employee equity share options, non-vested shares and\nsimilar equity instruments granted to employees be treated as potential common shares in computing diluted earnings per share. Diluted earnings per share\nshould be based on the actual number of options or shares granted and not yet forfeited, unless doing so would be anti-dilutive. The Company uses the\n“treasury stock” method for equity instruments granted in share-based payment transactions provided in ASC 260 to determine diluted earnings per share.\nAntidilutive securities represent potentially dilutive securities which are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings or loss per share as their impact\nwas antidilutive.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic\n740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (“ASU 2019-12”). ASU 2019-12 simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain\nexceptions and enhances and simplifies various aspects of the income tax accounting guidance in ASC 740. ASU 2019-12 was effective January 1, 2021.\nThe adoption of ASU 2019-12 did not have any impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statement presentation or disclosures.\nF-9\nABITS GROUP INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n2. Summary of principal accounting policies (continued)\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements (continued)\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt — Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—\nContracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity (“ASU 2020-06”).\nASU 2020-06 simplifies the accounting for convertible debt by eliminating the beneficial conversion and cash conversion accounting models. Upon\nadoption of ASU 2020-06, convertible debt proceeds, unless issued with a substantial premium or an embedded conversion feature that is not clearly and\nclosely related to the host contract, will no longer be allocated between debt and equity components. This modification will reduce the issue discount and\nresult in less non-cash interest expense in financial statements. ASU 2020-06 also updates the earnings per share calculation and requires entities to assume\nshare settlement when the convertible debt can be settled in cash or shares. For contracts in an entity’s own equity, the type of contracts primarily affected\nby ASU 2020-06 are freestanding and embedded features that are accounted for as derivatives under the current guidance due to a failure to meet the\nsettlement assessment by removing the requirements to (i) consider whether the contract would be settled in registered shares, (ii) consider whether\ncollateral is required to be posted, and (iii) assess shareholder rights. ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. Early\nadoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and only if adopted as of the beginning of such fiscal year. The\nCompany adopted ASU 2020-06 effective January 1, 2021. The adoption of ASU 2020-06 did not have any impact on the Company’s consolidated\nfinancial statement presentation or disclosures.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) (“ASU 2016-13”), which requires entities to measure\nall expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable\nforecasts. ASU 2016-13 replaces the existing incurred loss model and is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at\namortized cost. ASU 2016-13 is to be adopted on a modified retrospective basis. As a smaller reporting company, ASU 2016-13 will be effective for the\nCompany for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption\nof ASU 2016-13 will have on its consolidated financial statement presentations and disclosures.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (Topic 350), Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment (“ASU\n2017-04”). ASU 2017-04 eliminates Step 2 of the two-step goodwill impairment test, under which a goodwill impairment loss was measured by comparing\nthe implied fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. ASU 2017-04 requires only a one-step quantitative\nimpairment test, whereby a goodwill impairment loss is measured as the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value (not to exceed the\ntotal goodwill allocated to that reporting unit). Adoption of the ASUs is on a modified retrospective basis. As a smaller reporting company, the standard\nwill be effective for the Company for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company is currently evaluating the\nimpact that the adoption of ASU 2017-04 will have on its consolidated financial statement presentation or disclosures.\nIn May 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-04, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt — Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50),\nCompensation — Stock Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives and Hedging — Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Issuer’s\nAccounting for Certain Modifications or Exchanges of Freestanding Equity-Classified Written Call Options (“ASU 2021-04”). ASU 2021-04 provides\nguidance as to how an issuer should account for a modification of the terms or conditions or an exchange of a freestanding equity-classified written call\noption (i.e., a warrant) that remains classified after modification or exchange as an exchange of the original instrument for a new instrument. An issuer\nshould measure the effect of a modification or exchange as the difference between the fair value of the modified or exchanged warrant and the fair value of\nthat warrant immediately before modification or exchange and then apply a recognition model that comprises four categories of transactions and the\ncorresponding accounting treatment for each category (equity issuance, debt origination, debt modification, and modifications unrelated to equity issuance\nand debt origination or modification). ASU 2021-04 is effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim\nperiods within those fiscal years. An entity should apply the guidance provided in ASU 2021-04 prospectively to modifications or exchanges occurring on\nor after the effective date. Early adoption is permitted for all entities, including adoption in an interim period. If an entity elects to early adopt ASU 2021-\n04 in an interim period, the guidance should be applied as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. The adoption of ASU 2021-\n04 is not expected to have any impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statement presentation or disclosures.\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance.\nThis update requires certain annual disclosures about transactions with a government that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting\nmodel by analogy. This update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021, and early application is permitted. This guidance should\nbe applied either prospectively to all transactions that are reflected in financial statements at the date of initial application and new transactions that are\nentered into after the date of initial application or retrospectively to those transactions. The Company does not expect the impact of this guidance to have a\nmaterial impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company’s management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, authoritative guidance, if currently adopted, would have\na material impact on the Company’s financial statement presentation or disclosures.\nF-10\nABITS GROUP INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n3.

Income taxes\nThe Company and its subsidiaries file separate income tax returns.\nUnited States of America\nAbit USA Inc. was incorporated in April 2022 and will have to file a tax return for the year ending December 31, 2022.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”) was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code.\nChanges include, but are not limited to, a U.S. corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the\ntransition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed\nrepatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017. As the Company has a September 30 fiscal year-end, the lower corporate income tax\nrate will be phased in, resulting in a U.S. statutory federal rate of approximately 24.5% for our fiscal year ending September 30, 2018, and 21% for\nsubsequent fiscal years. Accordingly, we have to remeasure our deferred tax assets on net operating loss carryforward in the U.S. at the lower enacted\ncooperated tax rate of 21%. However, this re-measurement has no effect on the Company’s income tax expenses as the Company has provided a 100%\nvaluation allowance on its deferred tax assets previously.\nAdditionally, the Tax Act imposes a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of historical earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and future foreign earnings\nare subject to U.S. taxation. The change in rate has caused us to remeasure all U.S. deferred income tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences and\nnet operating loss (NOL) carryforwards and recorded a one-time income tax payable in 8 years.\nBritish Virgin Islands\nAbits Group Inc is incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. Under the current laws of the British Virgin Islands, Abits Group Inc is not subject to tax on\nincome or capital gains. In addition, upon payments of dividends by Abits Group Inc, no British Virgin Islands withholding tax is imposed.\nHong Kong\nAbit Hong Kong did not earn any income that was derived in Hong Kong since its incorporation and is therefore not to any Hong Kong profits tax.\nF-12\nABITS GROUP INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n6.

After accounting for direct costs of revenue\namounting to $2.68 million, primarily electricity costs of $1.1 million and depreciation of $1.27 million, the gross profit from the mining operation was\n$0.75 million.\nThe loss before tax of the group was $0.14 million after accounting for administrative and general overheads.his result compares favorably with the\nprevious period when the loss was $3.5 million. Administrative and general overheads during the period almost doubled to 1.11 million compared to $0.7\nmillion as new staff were added to support production on a 24/7 basis as well as an increase on maintenance and insurance costs now that the data center\nwas fully operational.\nIn April, the Company further improved its water supply and since then, all production lines have been kept running. During the peak construction periods,\na 100,000-gallon reservoir helps to subsidize any shortages from the water company during the day and is replenished at night when consumption is much\nlower. The hydro cooling method introduced with the new batch of machines helps to reduce noise and dust instead of the traditional air cooling by fans.\nThere is no substantial change in the Balance Sheet of the Group except that more Ant-miner machines were purchased for $0.86 million and a piece of\nproperty in Wisconsin acquired for $0.65 million in the period to June. Cash and cash balances dwindled to $0.4 million as of June 30, 2024.\nWith the halving of mining rewards in late in April, production output will be much lower for the rest of 2024. However, the Company will maintain a strict\ncontrol of its costs and hopes to secure more hosting contracts to improve on its revenue.\nFor more information, please visit www.abitsgroup.com or email ir@abitgrp.com.\nABITS GROUP INC\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nAs of\nJune 30, 2024\nNote (Unaudited) December 31, 2023\nASSETS\nCurrent Assets\nCash and cash equivalents $ 396,583 $ 884,199\nOther receivables and prepayments 3 370,801 774,345\nTotal current assets 767,384 1,658,544\nDigital assets 4 1,546,184 1,194,157\nProperty, equipment and vehicles 5 9,888,446 9,465,567\nConstruction-in-progress - -\nTOTAL ASSETS 12,202,014 12,318,268\nLIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nOther payables and accruals $ 920,700 $ 1,005,608\nStockholders’ Equity\nPreferred stock, $0.001010 par value, authorized; 50,000,000 shares,\n5,000,000 shares issued and outstanding as of June 30, 2024 and\nDecember,31 2023 $ 5,050 $ 5,050\nCommon stock, $0.001 par value, authorized: 50,000,000 shares.

OFFER STATISTICS AND EXPECTED TIMETABLE\nNot Applicable for annual reports on Form 20-F.\nITEM 3. KEY INFORMATION\nOur Corporate Structure\nMoxian (BVI) Inc, or Moxian BVI, is not a PRC operating company but a British Virgin Islands holding company (“the Company”) resulting from\na merger with a U.S. domiciled subsidiary in August 2021. In July 2022, the Company divested its entire interest in Moxian (Hong Kong) Limited with the\nresult that it no longer has any business operations in the PRC and now solely operates in the bitcoin mining industry, with an operation through its U.S.\nsubsidiary, ABit USA Inc.\nBecause of the Company’s past history in operating in China, it could be subject to investigative action by the Chinese authorities but as of the\ndate of this report, the Company has not received any formal notification of such action. Whilst the Company acknowledges that such risks exist at any\ntime, it also believes that repeating them in great depth serves no purpose and can preclude a proper reading of this Report.\n1\nThe Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act\nOur common shares may be prohibited from trading on a national exchange or “over-the-counter” markets under the HFCAA if the PCAOB determines it\nis unable to inspect or investigate completely our auditors for three consecutive years beginning in 2021. Further, on June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed\nthe Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (“AHFCAA”) and on February 4, 2022, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the\nAmerica Creating Opportunities for Manufacturing Pre-Eminence in Technology and Economic Strength (COMPETES) Act of 2022, or the COMPETES\nAct. If either the AHFCAA or COMPETES Act is enacted into law, it would amend the HFCAA and require the SEC to prohibit an issuer’s securities from\ntrading on any U.S. stock exchanges if its auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspections or complete investigations for two consecutive years instead of\nthree.\nAt the Annual Meeting of its stockholders on August 12, 2022, the Company decided to appoint Audit Alliance LLP, a firm of accountants incorporated in\nthe Republic of Singapore, as the Company’s auditors for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nMerger\nThe Company is the surviving company following a merger in August 2021 with its predecessor company, Moxian, Inc., which was incorporated in\nNevada, U.S. As an offshore holding company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, we are qualified as a “foreign private issuer” within the meaning\nof the rules under the Exchange Act. As such, we are exempt from certain rules under the Exchange Act that are applicable to U.S. domestic issuers.\nMoreover, we are not required to provide as many Exchange Act reports, or as frequently or as promptly, as U.S. domestic issuers. We are also not required\nto provide the same level of disclosure on certain issues. In addition, as a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, we are permitted to adopt\ncertain home country practices in relation to corporate governance matters that differ significantly from that applied to the U.S. domestic issuers under the\nNasdaq listing rules. These exemptions and practices may afford less protection to our shareholders than they would enjoy if we were a U.S. domestic\nissuer.\nSelected Financial Data\nThe Company has a December 31 fiscal year-end which is different from that of its predecessor company which fiscal year-end was September 30.\nBecause of this change, the following table presents the selected consolidated financial information of our Company as of December 31, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021, The selected consolidated statements of operations data and the selected consolidated balance sheets data have been derived from our\naudited consolidated financial statements, which are included in this annual report.

As a result,\nwe may need additional capital, and financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\n● We have a history of operating losses, and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability; we have recently shifted our bitcoin mining\nbusiness, and we may not be successful in this business.\n● Our results of operation may fluctuate significantly and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business.\n● We may acquire other businesses, form joint ventures or acquire other companies or businesses that could negatively affect our operating results,\ndilute our stockholders’ ownership, increase our debt or cause us to incur significant expense; notwithstanding the foregoing, our growth may\ndepend on our success in uncovering and completing such transactions.\n● From time to time, we may evaluate and potentially consummate strategic investments or acquisitions, which could require significant\nmanagement attention, disrupt our business and adversely affect our financial results.\nRisks Related to Bitcoin Mining\n● Our results of operations are expected to vary with Bitcoin price volatility.\n● Our mining operating costs outpace our mining revenues, which could seriously harm our business or increase our losses.\n● We have an evolving business model which is subject to various uncertainties.\n● Regulatory changes or actions may alter the nature of an investment in us or restrict the use of cryptocurrencies in a manner that adversely affects\nour business, prospects or operations.\n● The development and acceptance of cryptographic and algorithmic protocols governing the issuance of and transactions in cryptocurrencies is\nsubject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate.\n● Banks and financial institutions may not provide banking services, or may cut off services, to businesses that engage in bitcoin-related activities or\nthat accept cryptocurrencies as payment, including financial institutions of investors in our securities.\n● We may face risks of Internet disruptions, which could have an adverse effect on the price of cryptocurrencies.\n● Acceptance and/or widespread use of bitcoin is uncertain.\n● The decentralized nature of bitcoin systems may lead to slow or inadequate responses to crises, which may negatively affect our business.\n● Our bitcoins may be subject to loss, theft or restriction on access.\n● There is a lack of liquid markets, and possible manipulation of blockchain/bitcoin-based assets.\n● Incorrect or fraudulent bitcoin transactions may be irreversible.\n● Our reliance primarily on a single model of miner may subject our operations to increased risk of mine failure.\n● Our future success will depend in large part upon the value of bitcoin; the value of bitcoin may be subject to pricing risk and has historically been\nsubject to wide swings.\n● Cryptocurrencies, including those maintained by or for us, may be exposed to cybersecurity threats and hacks.\n3\n● We are subject to risks associated with our need for significant electrical power. Government regulators may potentially restrict the ability of\nelectricity suppliers to provide electricity to mining operations, such as ours.\n● We may not adequately respond to price fluctuations and rapidly changing technology, which may negatively affect our business.\nRisks Involving Intellectual Property\n● Bitcoin and bitcoin mining operations rely on software and specialized technology.\n● We may not be able to prevent others from unauthorized use of our intellectual property, which could harm our business and competitive position.\n● We may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims, which may be expensive to defend and may disrupt our business and operations\n● Our platform and internal systems rely on software that is highly technical, and if it contains undetected errors, our business could be adversely\naffected.\nRisks Related to Our Ordinary Shares\n● Our ordinary shares may be thinly traded and you may be unable to sell at or near ask prices or at all if you need to sell your shares to raise money\nor otherwise desire to liquidate your shares.\n● We are not likely to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\n● You may face difficulties in protecting your interests as a shareholder, as the laws of British Virgin Islands provides substantially less protection\nwhen compared to the laws of the United States and it may be difficult for a shareholder of ours to effect service of process or to enforce\njudgements obtained in the United States courts.\n● Volatility in our ordinary shares price may subject us to securities litigation.\n● We may be unable to comply with the applicable continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, which may adversely impact our\naccess to capital markets and may cause us to default certain of our agreements\nGeneral Risks\nIf we are unable to successfully execute our bitcoin mining, it would adversely affect our financial and business condition and results of operations.\nAs of the date of this Report, the Company has yet to fully implement its plan to diversify into bitcoin mining as various mining sites have not\nbeen finalized. If we cannot execute the bitcoin mining, it would seriously affect our financial and business condition and deepen the losses of the\nCompany.\nFailure to manage our liquidity and cash flows may materially and adversely affect our financial conditions and results of operations. As a result, we\nmay need additional capital, and financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nThe Company is new to bitcoin mining and is operating in the United States for the first time. If we fail to manage our liquidity and cash flows, it\nwill seriously affect our financial condition and results of operations. We may need additional financing and such access may be limited or at unacceptable\nterms.\nWe have a history of operating losses, and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability; we have recently shifted our bitcoin mining business,\nand we may not be successful in this business.\nWe are not profitable and have incurred losses since our inception. We expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and these\nlosses could increase as we continue to work to develop our business. We were previously engaged in the business of mobile payments which we ceased\noperation in June 2018. Whilst we continue with the digital advertising business, it is proving to be increasingly difficult because of restrictions on online\ngaming. which is a key business of our clients. Starting in March 2022, we diversified into the bitcoin mining business. Our current strategy is new and\nunproven, is in an industry that is relatively itself new and evolving and is subject to the risks discussed below. Even if we achieve profitability in the\nfuture, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods.\nOur results of operation may fluctuate significantly and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business.\nOur results of operations, including the levels of our net revenues, expenses, net loss and other key metrics, may vary significantly in the future\ndue to a variety of factors, some of which are outside of our control, and period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful,\nespecially given our limited operating history. Accordingly, the results for any one quarter are not necessarily an indication of future performance.\nFluctuations in quarterly results may adversely affect the market price of our ordinary shares. Factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly financial\nresults include:\n● the amount and timing of operating expenses related to our new business operations and infrastructure;\n● fluctuations in the price of bitcoin; and\n● general economic, industry and market conditions.\n4\nWe may acquire other businesses, form joint ventures or acquire other companies or businesses that could negatively affect our operating results, dilute\nour stockholders’ ownership, increase our debt or cause us to incur significant expense; notwithstanding the foregoing, our growth may depend on our\nsuccess in uncovering and completing such transactions.\nWe are actively seeking other business opportunities, however, we cannot offer any assurance that acquisitions of businesses, assets and/or\nentering into strategic alliances or joint ventures will be successful. We may not be able to find suitable partners or acquisition candidates and may not be\nable to complete such transactions on favorable terms, if at all. If we make any acquisitions, we may not be able to integrate these acquisitions successfully\ninto our existing infrastructure. In addition, in the event we acquire any existing businesses we could assume unknown or contingent liabilities.\nAny future acquisitions also could result in the issuance of stock, incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or future write-offs of intangible assets\nor goodwill, any of which could have a negative impact on our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. Integration of an acquired\ncompany may also disrupt ongoing operations and require management resources that otherwise would be focused on developing and expanding our\nexisting business. We may experience losses related to potential investments in other companies, which could harm our financial condition and results of\noperations. Further, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, strategic alliance or joint venture if such investments do not materialize.\nTo finance any acquisitions or joint ventures, we may choose to issue ordinary shares, preferred stock or a combination of debt and equity as\nconsideration, which could significantly dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders or provide rights to such preferred stock holders in priority over\nour common stock holders. Additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. If the price of our common stock is low or\nvolatile, we may not be able to acquire other companies or fund a joint venture project using stock as consideration.\nFrom time to time we may evaluate and potentially consummate strategic investments or acquisitions, which could require significant management\nattention, disrupt our business and adversely affect our financial results.\nWe may evaluate and consider strategic investments, combinations, acquisitions or alliances in both the bitcoin mining business. These\ntransactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations if consummated. If we are able to identify an appropriate business\nopportunity, we may not be able to successfully consummate the transaction and, even if we do consummate such a transaction, we may be unable to obtain\nthe benefits or avoid the difficulties and risks of such transaction.\nStrategic investments or acquisitions will involve risks commonly encountered in business relationships, including:\n● difficulties in assimilating and integrating the operations, personnel, systems, data, technologies, products and services of the acquired\nbusiness;\n● inability of the acquired technologies, products or businesses to achieve expected levels of revenue, profitability, productivity or other\nbenefits;\n● difficulties in retaining, training, motivating and integrating key personnel;\n● diversion of management’s time and resources from our normal daily operations;\n● difficulties in successfully incorporating licensed or acquired technology and rights into our businesses;\n● difficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies within the combined organizations;\n● difficulties in retaining relationships with customers, employees and suppliers of the acquired business;\n● risks of entering markets, including the U.S., in which we have limited or no prior experience;\n5\nWe may not make any investments or acquisitions, or any future investments or acquisitions may not be successful, may not benefit our business\nstrategy, may not generate sufficient revenues to offset the associated acquisition costs or may not otherwise result in the intended benefits. In addition, we\ncannot assure you that any future investment in or acquisition of new businesses or technology will lead to the successful development of new or enhanced\nloan products and services or that any new or enhanced loan products and services, if developed, will achieve market acceptance or prove to be profitable.\nOur loss of any of our management team, our inability to execute an effective succession plan, or our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel,\ncould adversely affect our business.\nOur success and future growth will depend to a significant degree on the skills and services of our management, including our Chief Executive\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer. We will need to continue to grow our management in order to alleviate pressure on our existing team and in order to\ncontinue to develop our business. If our management, including any new hires that we may make, fails to work together effectively and to execute our plans\nand strategies on a timely basis, our business could be harmed. Furthermore, if we fail to execute an effective contingency or succession plan with the loss\nof any member of management, the loss of such management personnel may significantly disrupt our business.\nThe loss of key members of management could inhibit our growth prospects. Our future success also depends in large part on our ability to attract,\nretain and motivate key management and operating personnel. As we continue to develop and expand our operations, we may require personnel with\ndifferent skills and experiences, and who have a sound understanding of our business and the bitcoin industry. The market for highly qualified personnel in\nthis industry is very competitive and we may be unable to attract such personnel. If we are unable to attract such personnel, our business could be harmed.\nWe incur significant costs and demands upon management and accounting and finance resources as a result of complying with the laws and\nregulations affecting public companies; if we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate and timely\nfinancial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, our ability to operate our business and our reputation.\nAs a public reporting company, we are required to, among other things, maintain a system of effective internal control over financial reporting.\nEnsuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on\na timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently. Substantial work will continue to be required to further\nimplement, document, assess, test and remediate our system of internal controls.\nIf our internal control over financial reporting is not effective, we may be unable to issue our financial statements in a timely manner, we may be\nunable to obtain the required audit or review of our financial statements by our independent registered public accounting firm in a timely manner or we\nmay be otherwise unable to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the SEC, our common stock listing on Nasdaq could be suspended or\nterminated and our stock price could materially suffer. In addition, we or members of our management could be subject to investigation and sanction by the\nSEC and other regulatory authorities and to stockholder lawsuits, which could impose significant additional costs on us and divert management attention.\nBecause cryptocurrencies may be determined to be investment securities, we may inadvertently violate the Investment Company Act and incur large\nlosses as a result and potentially be required to register as an investment company or terminate operations and we may incur third party liabilities.\nWe are engaged in the mining of bitcoins which the SEC said is currency and not securities. We therefore believe that we are not engaged in the\nbusiness of investing, reinvesting, or trading in securities, and we do not hold ourselves out as being engaged in those activities. However, under the\nInvestment Company Act a company may be deemed an investment company under section 3(a)(1)(C) thereof if the value of its investment securities is\nmore than 40% of its total assets (exclusive of government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis.\n6\nIf, as a result of our investments and our mining activities, including investments in which we do not have a controlling interest, the investment\nsecurities we hold could exceed 40% of our total assets, exclusive of cash items and, accordingly, we could determine that we have become an inadvertent\ninvestment company. The bitcoins we own, acquire or mine may be deemed an investment security by the SEC, although we do not believe any of the\ncryptocurrencies we own, acquire or mine are securities. An inadvertent investment company can avoid being classified as an investment company if it can\nrely on one of the exclusions under the Investment Company Act. One such exclusion, Rule 3a-2 under the Investment Company Act, allows an inadvertent\ninvestment company a grace period of one year from the earlier of (a) the date on which an issuer owns securities and/or cash having a value exceeding\n50% of the issuer’s total assets on either a consolidated or unconsolidated basis and (b) the date on which an issuer owns or proposes to acquire investment\nsecurities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of such issuer’s total assets (exclusive of government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated\nbasis. We may take actions to cause the investment securities held by us to be less than 40% of our total assets, which may include acquiring assets with our\ncash and bitcoin on hand or liquidating our investment securities or bitcoin or seeking a no-action letter from the SEC if we are unable to acquire sufficient\nassets or liquidate sufficient investment securities in a timely manner.\nAs the Rule 3a-2 exception is available to a company no more than once every three years, and assuming no other exclusion were available to us,\nwe would have to keep within the 40% limit for at least three years after we cease being an inadvertent investment company. This may limit our ability to\nmake certain investments or enter into joint ventures that could otherwise have a positive impact on our earnings. In any event, we do not intend to become\nan investment company engaged in the business of investing and trading securities.\nClassification as an investment company under the Investment Company Act requires registration with the SEC. If an investment company fails to\nregister, it would have to stop doing almost all business, and its contracts would become voidable. Registration is time consuming and restrictive and would\nrequire a restructuring of our operations, and we would be very constrained in the kind of business we could do as a registered investment company.\nFurther, we would become subject to substantial regulation concerning management, operations, transactions with affiliated persons and portfolio\ncomposition, and would need to file reports under the Investment Company Act regime. The cost of such compliance would result in the Company\nincurring substantial additional expenses, and the failure to register if required would have a materially adverse impact to conduct our operations.\nWe face risks similar to that of the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, which could significantly disrupt our operations and financial results.\nAlthough the outbreak of the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) appears to be over, we believe that our results of operations, business and financial\ncondition could be adversely impacted by the effects of any outbreak of any severe virus affecting public health.\nThe continued spread of the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) or the occurrence of other epidemics and the imposition of public health measures\nand travel and business restrictions will adversely affect impact our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. In addition, we have\nexperienced and will experience disruptions to our business operations resulting from quarantines, self-isolations, or other movement and restrictions on the\nability of our employees to perform their jobs. If we are unable to effectively service our miners, our ability to mine bitcoin will be adversely affected as\nminers go offline, which would have an adverse effect on our business and the results of our operations.\n7\nIf we cannot maintain our corporate culture as we grow, we could lose the innovation, collaboration and focus that contribute to our business.\nWe believe that a critical component of our success is our corporate culture, which we believe fosters innovation, encourages teamwork and\ncultivates creativity. As we develop the infrastructure of a public company and continue to grow, we may find it difficult to maintain these valuable aspects\nof our corporate culture. Any failure to preserve our culture could negatively impact our future success, including our ability to attract and retain\nemployees, encourage innovation and teamwork and effectively focus on and pursue our corporate objectives.\nIf the PRC government determines that the historical contractual arrangements with the former PRC subsidiaries structure did not comply with PRC\nregulation, or if these regulations change or are interpreted differently in the future, our shares may decline in value or become worthless if we are\ndeemed to be unable to assert our contractual control rights over the assets of the former subsidiaries.\nMoxian (BVI) Inc. is a British Virgin islands holding company with operations primarily conducted by its subsidiaries and, historically, through\ncontractual arrangements with former subsidiaries based in China. In the past we primarily operated our businesses in China through the former\nsubsidiaries.\nIn order to streamline our corporate structure and considering the changing regulatory environment, we have completed the divestment of our\nPRC subsidiaries to Jiantao Liu, a resident of China, for the disposal of all equity interests of Moxian (Hong Kong) Limited for a cash consideration of\nHKD 1,000. Accordingly, all contractual arrangements involving the PRC subsidiaries were effectively terminated.\nAlthough we have completed the divestment in July 2022, the PRC government could find any one of our previous agreements non-compliant\nwith relevant PRC laws, regulations, and rules, or if these laws, regulations, and rules or the interpretation thereof change in the future, and such changes\nmay be retroactively applied to our historical contractual arrangements, we could be subject to severe penalties and require a potential restatement of our\nfinancial statements included elsewhere in this annual report. As a result, our shares may decline in value or become worthless.\nThere remain substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current and future PRC laws, regulations, and rules which may\nbe relevant to our former PRC subsidiaries’ and our former operations in China, including potential future actions by the PRC government which may\nretroactively affect the enforceability and legality of our historical operations involving the former PRC subsidiaries.\nAlthough we divested ourselves of the PRC subsidiaries in July 2022 and we no longer have operations in China, we may be subject to potential\nfuture actions by the PRC government which may retroactively affect the enforceability and legality of our historical operations involving the former PRC\nsubsidiaries. If the PRC government finds such agreements non-compliant with relevant PRC laws, regulations, and rules, or if these laws, regulations, and\nrules or the interpretation thereof change in the future, and such changes may be retroactively applied to our historical contractual arrangements, we could\nbe subject to severe penalties. As such, the following former risk factors of doing business in China may still apply:\n● Changes in China’s economic, political or social conditions or government policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and\nresults of operations.\n● Uncertainties in the interpretation and enforcement of Chinese laws and regulations could limit the legal protections available to us.\n● The PRC government may intervene or influence our operations at any time, or may exert more control over offerings conducted overseas and/or\nforeign investment in China-based issuers, which could result in a material change in our operations and/or cause the value of our securities to\nsignificantly decline or be worthless.\n● PRC regulations establish complex procedures for some acquisitions conducted by foreign investors, which could make it more difficult for us to\npursue growth through acquisitions in China.\n● The PCAOB is currently unable to inspect our auditor in relation to their audit work performed for our financial statements and the inability of the\nPCAOB to conduct inspections or investigation completely over our auditor deprives our investors with the benefits of such inspections.\n● Our ordinary shares will be prohibited from trading in the United States under the HFCAA in 2024 if the PCAOB is unable to inspect or fully\ninvestigate auditors located in China, or as early as 2023 if proposed changes to the law are enacted. The delisting of our ordinary shares, or the\nthreat of their being delisted, may materially and adversely affect the value of your investment.\n● PRC regulations relating to the establishment of offshore special purpose companies by PRC residents may limit our ability to inject capital into\nour PRC subsidiaries, limit our subsidiaries’ ability to increase their registered capital or distribute profits to us, or may otherwise adversely affect\nus\n● PRC regulation of loans to and direct investment in PRC entities by offshore holding companies and governmental control of currency conversion\nmay delay or prevent us from using offshore funds to make loans to our PRC subsidiaries, or to make additional capital contributions to our PRC\nsubsidiaries.\n● Regulatory bodies of the United States may be limited in their ability to conduct investigations or inspections of our operations in China.\n● Enhanced scrutiny over acquisition transactions by the PRC tax authorities may have a negative impact on potential acquisitions we may pursue in\nthe future.\n● Fluctuations in exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the value of your investment.\n8\nRisks related to Bitcoin Mining\nOur results of operations are expected to vary with Bitcoin price volatility\nThe price of Bitcoin has experienced significant fluctuations over its relatively short existence and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the\nfuture.\nWe expect our results of operations to continue to be affected by the Bitcoin price as most of the revenue is from bitcoin mining production as of\nthe filing date. Any future significant reductions in the price of Bitcoin will likely have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations and\nfinancial condition. We cannot assure you that the Bitcoin price will remain high enough to sustain our operation or that the Bitcoin price will not decline\nsignificantly in the future.\nVarious factors, mostly beyond our control, could impact the Bitcoin price. For example, the usage of Bitcoins in the retail and commercial\nmarketplace is relatively low in comparison with the usage for speculation, which contributes to Bitcoin price volatility. Additionally, the reward for\nBitcoin mining will decline over time, with the most recent halving event occurred in May 2020 and next one four years later, which may further contribute\nto Bitcoin price volatility.\nOur mining operating costs outpace our mining revenues, which could seriously harm our business or increase our losses.\nOur mining operations are costly and our expenses may increase in the future. We intend to use funds on hand from our private placement to\ncontinue to purchase bitcoin mining machines. This expense increase may not be offset by a corresponding increase in revenue. Our expenses may be\ngreater than we anticipate, and our investments to make our business more efficient may not succeed and may outpace monetization efforts. Increases in\nour costs without a corresponding increase in our revenue would increase our losses and could seriously harm our business and financial perform\nWe have an evolving business model which is subject to various uncertainties.\nAs bitcoin assets may become more widely available, we expect the services and products associated with them to evolve. In order to stay current\nwith the industry, our business model may need to evolve as well. From time to time, we may modify aspects of our business model relating to our strategy.\nWe cannot offer any assurance that these or any other modifications will be successful or will not result in harm to our business. We may not be able to\nmanage growth effectively, which could damage our reputation, limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results. Further, we cannot provide any\nassurance that we will successfully identify all emerging trends and growth opportunities in this business sector and we may lose out on those\nopportunities. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations.\nRegulatory changes or actions may alter the nature of an investment in us or restrict the use of cryptocurrencies in a manner that adversely affects our\nbusiness, prospects or operations.\nAs cryptocurrencies have grown in both popularity and market size, governments around the world have reacted differently to cryptocurrencies;\ncertain governments have deemed them illegal, and others have allowed their use and trade without restriction, while in some jurisdictions, such as in the\nU.S., subject to extensive, and in some cases overlapping, unclear and evolving regulatory requirements. Ongoing and future regulatory actions may impact\nour ability to continue to operate, and such actions could affect our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations.\nThe development and acceptance of cryptographic and algorithmic protocols governing the issuance of and transactions in cryptocurrencies is subject\nto a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate.\nThe use of cryptocurrencies to, among other things, buy and sell goods and services and complete transactions, is part of a new and rapidly\nevolving industry that employs bitcoin assets based upon a computer-generated mathematical and/or cryptographic protocol. Large-scale acceptance of\ncryptocurrencies as a means of payment has not, and may never, occur. The growth of this industry in general, and the use of bitcoin, in particular, is\nsubject to a high degree of uncertainty, and the slowing or stopping of the development or acceptance of developing protocols may occur unpredictably.\nThe factors include, but are not limited to:\n● continued worldwide growth in the adoption and use of cryptocurrencies as a medium to exchange;\n● governmental and quasi-governmental regulation of cryptocurrencies and their use, or restrictions on or regulation of access to and operation\nof the network or similar bitcoin systems;\n● changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences;\n● the maintenance and development of the open-source software protocol of the network;\n9\n● the increased consolidation of contributors to the bitcoin blockchain through mining pools;\n● the availability and popularity of other forms or methods of buying and selling goods and services, including new means of using fiat\ncurrencies;\n● the use of the networks supporting cryptocurrencies for developing smart contracts and distributed applications;\n● general economic conditions and the regulatory environment relating to cryptocurrencies; and\n● negative consumer sentiment and perception of bitcoin specifically and cryptocurrencies generally.\nThe outcome of these factors could have negative effects on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our business strategy at all,\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations as well as potentially negative effect on the value of any bitcoin or\nother cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account, which would harm investors in our securities.\nBanks and financial institutions may not provide banking services, or may cut off services, to businesses that engage in bitcoin-related activities or that\naccept cryptocurrencies as payment, including financial institutions of investors in our securities.\nA number of companies that engage in bitcoin and/or other bitcoin-related activities have been unable to find banks or financial institutions that\nare willing to provide them with bank accounts and other services. Similarly, a number of companies and individuals or businesses associated with\ncryptocurrencies may have had and may continue to have their existing bank accounts closed or services discontinued with financial institutions in response\nto government action, particularly in China, where regulatory response to cryptocurrencies has been to exclude their use for ordinary consumer transactions\nwithin China. We also may be unable to obtain or maintain these services for our business. The difficulty that many businesses that provide bitcoin and/or\nderivatives on other bitcoin-related activities have and may continue to have in finding banks and financial institutions willing to provide them services\nmay be decreasing the usefulness of cryptocurrencies as a payment system and harming public perception of cryptocurrencies, and could decrease their\nusefulness and harm their public perception in the future.\nThe usefulness of cryptocurrencies as a payment system and the public perception of cryptocurrencies could be damaged if banks or financial\ninstitutions were to close the accounts of businesses engaging in bitcoin and/or other bitcoin-related activities. This could occur as a result of compliance\nrisk, cost, government regulation or public pressure. The risk applies to securities firms, clearance and settlement firms, national stock and derivatives on\ncommodities exchanges, the over-the-counter market, and the Depository Trust Company, which, if any of such entities adopts or implements similar\npolicies, rules or regulations, could negatively affect our relationships with financial institutions and impede our ability to convert cryptocurrencies to fiat\ncurrencies. Such factors could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and harm investors.\nWe may face risks of Internet disruptions, which could have an adverse effect on the price of cryptocurrencies.\nA disruption of the Internet may affect the use of cryptocurrencies and subsequently the value of our securities. Generally, cryptocurrencies and\nour business of mining cryptocurrencies is dependent upon the Internet. A significant disruption in Internet connectivity could disrupt a currency’s network\noperations until the disruption is resolved and have an adverse effect on the price of cryptocurrencies and our ability to mine cryptocurrencies.\n10\nThe impact of geopolitical and economic events on the supply and demand for cryptocurrencies is uncertain.\nGeopolitical crises may motivate large-scale purchases of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which could increase the price of bitcoin and other\ncryptocurrencies rapidly. This may increase the likelihood of a subsequent price decrease as crisis-driven purchasing behavior dissipates, adversely\naffecting the value of our inventory following such downward adjustment. Such risks are similar to the risks of purchasing commodities in general\nuncertain times, such as the risk of purchasing, holding or selling gold. Alternatively, as an emerging asset class with limited acceptance as a payment\nsystem or commodity, global crises and general economic downturn may discourage investment in cryptocurrencies as investors focus their investment on\nless volatile asset classes as a means of hedging their investment risk.\nAs an alternative to fiat currencies that are backed by central governments, cryptocurrencies, which are relatively new, are subject to supply and\ndemand forces. How such supply and demand will be impacted by geopolitical events is largely uncertain but could be harmful to us and investors in our\ncommon stock. Political or economic crises may motivate large-scale acquisitions or sales of cryptocurrencies either globally or locally. Such events could\nhave a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect\non our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or any other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our\nown account.\nAcceptance and/or widespread use of bitcoin is uncertain.\nCurrently, there is a relatively limited use of any bitcoin in the retail and commercial marketplace, thus contributing to price volatility that could\nadversely affect an investment in our securities. Banks and other established financial institutions may refuse to process funds for bitcoin transactions,\nprocess wire transfers to or from bitcoin exchanges, bitcoin-related companies or service providers, or maintain accounts for persons or entities transacting\nin bitcoin. Conversely, a significant portion of bitcoin demand is generated by investors seeking a long-term store of value or speculators seeking to profit\nfrom the short- or long-term holding of the asset. Price volatility undermines any bitcoin’s role as a medium of exchange, as retailers are much less likely to\naccept it as a form of payment. Market capitalization for a bitcoin as a medium of exchange and payment method may always be low.\nThe relative lack of acceptance of bitcoins in the retail and commercial marketplace, or a reduction of such use, limits the ability of end users to\nuse them to pay for goods and services. Such lack of acceptance or decline in acceptances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as\na going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the\nvalue of bitcoins we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account.\nTransactional fees may decrease demand for bitcoin and prevent expansion.\nAs the number of bitcoins currency rewards awarded for solving a block in a blockchain decreases, the incentive for miners to continue to\ncontribute to the bitcoin network may transition from a set reward to transaction fees. In order to incentivize miners to continue to contribute to the bitcoin\nnetwork, the bitcoin network may either formally or informally transition from a set reward to transaction fees earned upon solving a block. This transition\ncould be accomplished by miners independently electing to record in the blocks they solve only those transactions that include payment of a transaction\nfee. If transaction fees paid for bitcoin transactions become too high, the marketplace may be reluctant to accept bitcoin as a means of payment and existing\nusers may be motivated to switch from bitcoin to another bitcoin or to fiat currency. Either the requirement from miners of higher transaction fees in\nexchange for recording transactions in a blockchain or a software upgrade that automatically charges fees for all transactions may decrease demand for\nbitcoin and prevent the expansion of the bitcoin network to retail merchants and commercial businesses, resulting in a reduction in the price of bitcoin that\ncould adversely impact an investment in our securities. Decreased use and demand for bitcoin may adversely affect its value and result in a reduction in the\nprice of bitcoin and the value of our common stock.\n11\nThe decentralized nature of bitcoin systems may lead to slow or inadequate responses to crises, which may negatively affect our business.\nThe decentralized nature of the governance of bitcoin systems may lead to ineffective decision making that slows development or prevents a\nnetwork from overcoming emergent obstacles. Governance of many bitcoin systems is by voluntary consensus and open competition with no clear\nleadership structure or authority. To the extent lack of clarity in corporate governance of bitcoin systems leads to ineffective decision making that slows\ndevelopment and growth of such cryptocurrencies, the value of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nIt may be illegal now, or in the future, to acquire, own, hold, sell or use bitcoin, ether, or other cryptocurrencies, participate in blockchains or utilize\nsimilar bitcoin assets in one or more countries, the ruling of which would adversely affect us.\nAlthough currently cryptocurrencies generally are not regulated or are lightly regulated in most countries, one or more countries such as China and\nRussia, which have taken harsh regulatory action, may take regulatory actions in the future that could severely restrict the right to acquire, own, hold, sell\nor use these bitcoin assets or to exchange for fiat currency. In many nations, particularly in China and Russia, it is illegal to accept payment in bitcoin and\nother cryptocurrencies for consumer transactions and banking institutions are barred from accepting deposits of cryptocurrencies. Such restrictions may\nadversely affect us as the large-scale use of cryptocurrencies as a means of exchange is presently confined to certain regions globally. Such circumstances\ncould have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for\nour own account, and harm investors.\nThere is a lack of liquid markets, and possible manipulation of blockchain/bitcoin-based assets.\nCryptocurrencies that are represented and trade on a ledger-based platform may not necessarily benefit from viable trading markets. Stock\nexchanges have listing requirements and vet issuers; requiring them to be subjected to rigorous listing standards and rules, and monitor investors\ntransacting on such platform for fraud and other improprieties. These conditions may not necessarily be replicated on a distributed ledger platform,\ndepending on the platform’s controls and other policies. The laxer a distributed ledger platform is about vetting issuers of bitcoin assets or users that\ntransact on the platform, the higher the potential risk for fraud or the manipulation of the ledger due to a control event. These factors may decrease liquidity\nor volume or may otherwise increase volatility of investment securities or other assets trading on a ledger-based system, which may adversely affect us.\nSuch circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have\na material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise\nacquire or hold for our own account, and harm investors.\nOur operations, investment strategies and profitability may be adversely affected by competition from other methods of investing in cryptocurrencies.\nWe compete with other users and/or companies that are mining cryptocurrencies and other potential financial vehicles, including securities backed\nby or linked to cryptocurrencies through entities similar to us. Market and financial conditions, and other conditions beyond our control, may make it more\nattractive to invest in other financial vehicles, or to invest in cryptocurrencies directly, which could limit the market for our shares and reduce their\nliquidity. The emergence of other financial vehicles and exchange-traded funds have been scrutinized by regulators and such scrutiny and the negative\nimpressions or conclusions resulting from such scrutiny could be applicable to us and impact our ability to successfully pursue our new strategy or operate\nat all, or to establish or maintain a public market for our securities. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a\ngoing concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the\nvalue of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account, and harm investors.\nThe development and acceptance of competing blockchain platforms or technologies may cause consumers to use alternative distributed ledgers or\nother alternatives.\nThe development and acceptance of competing blockchain platforms or technologies may cause consumers to use alternative distributed ledgers or\nan alternative to distributed ledgers altogether. Our business utilizes presently existent digital ledgers and blockchains and we could face difficulty adapting\nto emergent digital ledgers, blockchains, or alternatives thereto. This may adversely affect us and our exposure to various blockchain technologies and\nprevent us from realizing the anticipated profits from our investments. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as\na going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the\nvalue of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account, and harm investors.\n12\nOur bitcoins may be subject to loss, theft or restriction on access.\nThere is a risk that some or all of our bitcoins could be lost or stolen. Cryptocurrencies are stored in bitcoin sites commonly referred to as\n“wallets” by holders of bitcoins which may be accessed to exchange a holder’s bitcoin assets. Access to our bitcoin assets could also be restricted by\ncybercrime (such as a denial of service attack) against a service at which we maintain a hosted hot wallet. A hot wallet refers to any bitcoin wallet that is\nconnected to the Internet. Generally, hot wallets are easier to set up and access than wallets in cold storage, but they are also more susceptible to hackers\nand other technical vulnerabilities. Cold storage refers to any bitcoin wallet that is not connected to the Internet. Cold storage is generally more secure than\nhot storage, but is not ideal for quick or regular transactions and we may experience lag time in our ability to respond to market fluctuations in the price of\nour bitcoin assets. We hold all of our cryptocurrencies in cold storage to reduce the risk of malfeasance, but the risk of loss of our bitcoin assets cannot be\nwholly eliminated.\nHackers or malicious actors may launch attacks to steal, compromise or secure cryptocurrencies, such as by attacking the bitcoin network source\ncode, exchange miners, third-party platforms, cold and hot storage locations or software, or by other means. We may be in control and possession of one of\nthe more substantial holdings of bitcoins. As we increase in size, we may become a more appealing target of hackers, malware, cyber-attacks or other\nsecurity threats. Any of these events may adversely affect our operations and, consequently, our investments and profitability. The loss or destruction of a\nprivate key required to access our digital wallets may be irreversible and we may be denied access for all time to our bitcoin holdings or the holdings of\nothers held in those compromised wallets. Our loss of access to our private keys or our experience of a data loss relating to our digital wallets could\nadversely affect our investments and assets.\nCryptocurrencies are controllable only by the possessor of both the unique public and private keys relating to the local or online digital wallet in\nwhich they are held, which wallet’s public key or address is reflected in the network’s public blockchain. We will publish the public key relating to digital\nwallets in use when we verify the receipt of transfers and disseminate such information into the network, but we will need to safeguard the private keys\nrelating to such digital wallets. To the extent such private keys are lost, destroyed or otherwise compromised, we will be unable to access our bitcoin\nrewards and such private keys may not be capable of being restored by any network. Any loss of private keys relating to digital wallets used to store our\ncryptocurrencies could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise\nacquire or hold for our own account.\nRisks due to hacking or adverse software event.\nIn order to minimize risk, we have established processes to manage wallets that are associated with our bitcoin holdings. There can be no\nassurances that any processes we have adopted or will adopt in the future are or will be secure or effective, and we would suffer significant and immediate\nadverse effects if we suffered a loss of our bitcoin due to an adverse software or cybersecurity event. We utilize several layers of threat reduction\ntechniques, including: (i) the use of hardware wallets to store sensitive private key information; (ii) performance of transactions offline; and (iii) offline\ngeneration storage and use of private keys.\nAt present, the Company is evaluating several third-party custodial wallet alternatives, but there can be no assurance that such services will be\nmore secure than those the Company presently employs. Human error and the constantly evolving state of cybercrime and hacking techniques may render\npresent security protocols and procedures ineffective in ways which we cannot predict. If our security procedures and protocols are ineffectual and our\nbitcoin assets are compromised by cybercriminals, we may not have adequate recourse to recover our losses stemming from such compromise and we may\nlose much of the accumulated value of our bitcoin mining activities. This would have a negative impact on our business and operations.\n13\nIncorrect or fraudulent bitcoin transactions may be irreversible.\nBitcoin transactions are irrevocable and stolen or incorrectly transferred cryptocurrencies may be irretrievable. As a result, any incorrectly\nexecuted or fraudulent bitcoin transactions could adversely affect our investments and assets.\nBitcoin transactions are not, from an administrative perspective, reversible without the consent and active participation of the recipient of the\ncryptocurrencies from the transaction. In theory, bitcoin transactions may be reversible with the control or consent of a majority of processing power on the\nnetwork, however, we do not now, nor is it feasible that we could in the future, possess sufficient processing power to effect this reversal. Once a\ntransaction has been verified and recorded in a block that is added to a blockchain, an incorrect transfer of a bitcoin or a theft thereof generally will not be\nreversible and we may not have sufficient recourse to recover our losses from any such transfer or theft. It is possible that, through computer or human\nerror, or through theft or criminal action, our bitcoin rewards could be transferred in incorrect amounts or to unauthorized third parties, or to uncontrolled\naccounts. Further, according to the SEC, at this time, there is no specifically enumerated U.S. or foreign governmental, regulatory, investigative or\nprosecutorial authority or mechanism through which to bring an action or complaint regarding missing or stolen bitcoin. We are, therefore, presently reliant\non existing private investigative entities, such as Chain analysis and Kroll to investigate any potential loss of our bitcoin assets. These third-party service\nproviders rely on data analysis and compliance of ISPs with traditional court orders to reveal information such as the IP addresses of any attackers who may\nhave target us. To the extent that we are unable to recover our losses from such action, error or theft, such events could have a material adverse effect on\nour ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or\noperations of and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account.\nOur interactions with a blockchain may expose us to SDN or blocked persons or cause us to violate provisions of law that did not contemplate distribute\nledger technology.\nThe Office of Financial Assets Control of the US Department of Treasury requires us to comply with its sanction program and not conduct\nbusiness with persons named on its specially designated nationals (“SDN”) list. However, because of the pseudonymous nature of blockchain transactions\nwe may inadvertently and without our knowledge engage in transactions with persons named on OFAC’s SDN list. Our Company’s policy prohibits any\ntransactions with such SDN individuals, but we may not be adequately capable of determining the ultimate identity of the individual with whom we\ntransact with respect to selling bitcoin assets. Moreover, federal law prohibits any US person from knowingly or unknowingly possessing any visual\ndepiction commonly known as child pornography. Recent media reports have suggested that persons have imbedded such depictions on one or more\nblockchains. Because our business requires us to download and retain one or more blockchains to effectuate our ongoing business, it is possible that such\ndigital ledgers contain prohibited depictions without our knowledge or consent. To the extent government enforcement authorities literally enforce these\nand other laws and regulations that are impacted by decentralized distributed ledger technology, we may be subject to investigation, administrative or court\nproceedings, and civil or criminal monetary fines and penalties, all of which could harm our reputation and affect the value of our common stock.\nCryptocurrencies face significant scaling obstacles that can lead to high fees or slow transaction settlement times.\nCryptocurrencies face significant scaling obstacles that can lead to high fees or slow transaction settlement times, and attempts to increase the\nvolume of transactions may not be effective. Scaling cryptocurrencies is essential to the widespread acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a means of payment,\nwhich widespread acceptance is necessary to the continued growth and development of our business. Many bitcoin networks face significant scaling\nchallenges. For example, cryptocurrencies are limited with respect to how many transactions can occur per second. Participants in the bitcoin ecosystem\ndebate potential approaches to increasing the average number of transactions per second that the network can handle and have implemented mechanisms or\nare researching ways to increase scale, such as increasing the allowable sizes of blocks, and therefore the number of transactions per block, and sharding (a\nhorizontal partition of data in a database or search engine), which would not require every single transaction to be included in every single miner’s or\nvalidator’s block. However, there is no guarantee that any of the mechanisms in place or being explored for increasing the scale of settlement of bitcoin\ntransactions will be effective, or how long they will take to become effective, which could adversely affect an investment in our securities.\n14\nThe price of cryptocurrencies may be affected by the sale of such cryptocurrencies by other vehicles investing in cryptocurrencies or tracking bitcoin\nmarkets.\nThe global market for bitcoin is characterized by supply constraints that differ from those present in the markets for commodities or other assets\nsuch as gold and silver. The mathematical protocols under which certain cryptocurrencies are mined permit the creation of a limited, predetermined amount\nof currency, while others have no limit established on total supply. To the extent that other vehicles investing in cryptocurrencies or tracking bitcoin\nmarkets form and come to represent a significant proportion of the demand for cryptocurrencies, large redemptions of the securities of those vehicles and\nthe subsequent sale of cryptocurrencies by such vehicles could negatively affect bitcoin prices and therefore affect the value of the bitcoin inventory we\nhold. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise\nacquire or hold for our own account.\nBecause there has been limited precedent set for financial accounting of bitcoin and other bitcoin assets, the determination that we have made for how\nto account for bitcoin assets transactions may be subject to change.\nBecause there has been limited precedent set for the financial accounting of cryptocurrencies and related revenue recognition and no official\nguidance has yet been provided by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or the SEC, it is unclear how companies may in the future be required to\naccount for bitcoin transactions and assets and related revenue recognition. A change in regulatory or financial accounting standards could result in the\nnecessity to change our accounting methods and restate our financial statements. Such a restatement could adversely affect the accounting for our newly\nmined bitcoin rewards and more generally negatively impact our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operation. Such circumstances\nwould have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which would have a material adverse\neffect on our business, prospects or operations as well as and potentially the value of any cryptocurrencies we hold or expects to acquire for our own\naccount and harm investors.\nThere are risks related to technological obsolescence, the vulnerability of the global supply chain for bitcoin hardware disruption, and difficulty in\nobtaining new hardware which may have a negative effect on our business.\nOur mining operations can only be successful and ultimately profitable if the costs, including hardware and electricity costs, associated with\nmining cryptocurrencies are lower than the price of a bitcoin. As our mining facility operates, our miners experience ordinary wear and tear, and may also\nface more significant malfunctions caused by a number of extraneous factors beyond our control. The degradation of our miners will require us to, over\ntime, replace those miners which are no longer functional. Additionally, as the technology evolves, we may be required to acquire newer models of miners\nto remain competitive in the market. Reports have been released which indicate that miner manufacturer or seller adjusts the prices of its miners according\nto bitcoin prices, so the cost of new machines is unpredictable but could be extremely high. As a result, at times, we may obtain miners and other hardware\nfrom third parties at premium prices, to the extent they are available. This upgrading process requires substantial capital investment, and we may face\nchallenges. Further, the global supply chain for bitcoin miners is presently heavily dependent on China, which has been severely affected by the emergence\nof the COVID-19 coronavirus global pandemic. The global reliance on China as a main supplier of bitcoin miners has been called into question in the wake\nof the COVID-19 pandemic. Should similar outbreaks or other disruptions to the China-based global supply chain for bitcoin hardware occur, we may not\nbe able to obtain adequate replacement parts for our existing miners or to obtain additional miners from the manufacturer on a timely basis. Such events\ncould have a material adverse effect on our ability to pursue our new strategy, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and the value of\nour ordinary shares.\n15\nOur reliance primarily on a single model of miner may subject our operations to increased risk of mine failure.\nThe performance and reliability of our miners and our technology is critical to our reputation and our operations. Because we currently only use\nMicroBT miners, if there are issues with those machines, our entire system could be affected. Any system error or failure may significantly delay response\ntimes or even cause our system to fail. Any disruption in our ability to continue mining could result in lower yields and harm our reputation and business.\nAny exploitable weakness, flaw, or error common to MicroBT miners affects all our miners, if a defect other flaw is exploited, our entire mine could go\noffline simultaneously. Any interruption, delay or system failure could result in financial losses, a decrease in the trading price of our common stock and\ndamage to our reputation.\nThe Company’s reliance on a third-party mining pool service provider for our mining revenue payouts may have a negative impact on the Company\noperations.\nWe use third–party mining pools to receive our mining rewards from the network. Mining pools allow miners to combine their processing power,\nincreasing their chances of solving a block and getting paid by the network. The rewards are distributed by the pool operator, proportionally to our\ncontribution to the pool’s overall mining power, used to generate each block. Should the pool operator’s system suffer downtime due to a cyber-attack,\nsoftware malfunction or other similar issues, it will negatively impact our ability to mine and receive revenue. Furthermore, we are dependent on the\naccuracy of the mining pool operator’s record keeping to accurately record the total processing power provided to the pool for a given bitcoin mining\napplication in order to assess the proportion of that total processing power we provided. While we have internal methods of tracking both our power\nprovided and the total used by the pool, the mining pool operator uses its own record-keeping to determine our proportion of a given reward. We have little\nmeans of recourse against the mining pool operator if we determine the proportion of the reward paid out to us by the mining pool operator is incorrect,\nother than leaving the pool. If we are unable to consistently obtain accurate proportionate rewards from our mining pool operators, we may experience\nreduced reward for our efforts, which would have an adverse effect on our business and operations.\nThe bitcoin for which we mine, bitcoin, is subject to halving; the bitcoin reward for successfully uncovering a block will halve several times in the\nfuture and their value may not adjust to compensate us for the reduction in the rewards we receive from our mining efforts.\nHalving is a process designed to control the overall supply and reduce the risk of inflation in cryptocurrencies using a Proof-of-Work consensus\nalgorithm. At a predetermined block, the mining reward is cut in half, hence the term “halving.” For bitcoin, the reward was initially set at 50 bitcoin\ncurrency rewards per block and this was cut in half to 25 in November 28, 2012 at block 210,000 and again to 12.5 on July 9, 2016 at block 420,000 and in\nMay 2020 at block 630,000 when the reward reduced to 6.25. This process will reoccur until the total amount of bitcoin currency rewards issued reaches 21\nmillion, which is expected around 2140. While bitcoin prices have had a history of price fluctuations around the halving of its bitcoin rewards, there is no\nguarantee that the price change will be favorable or would compensate for the reduction in mining reward. If a corresponding and proportionate increase in\nthe trading price of bitcoin does not follow these anticipated halving events, the revenue we earn from our mining operations would see a corresponding\ndecrease, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\n16\nOur future success will depend in large part upon the value of bitcoin; the value of bitcoin may be subject to pricing risk and has historically been\nsubject to wide swings.\nOur operating results will depend in large part upon the value of bitcoin because it’s the primary bitcoin we currently mine. Specifically, our\nrevenues from our bitcoin mining operations are based upon two factors: (1) the number of bitcoin rewards we successfully mine and (2) the value of\nbitcoin. In addition, our operating results are directly impacted by changes in the value of bitcoin, because under the value measurement model, both\nrealized and unrealized changes will be reflected in our statement of operations (i.e., we will be marking bitcoin to fair value each quarter). This means that\nour operating results will be subject to swings based upon increases or decreases in the value of bitcoin. Furthermore, our strategy focuses almost entirely\non bitcoin (as opposed to other cryptocurrencies). Further, our current application-specific integrated circuit (“ASIC”) machines (which we refer to as\n“miners”) are principally utilized for mining bitcoin and bitcoin cash and cannot mine other cryptocurrencies, such as ether, that are not mined utilizing the\n“SHA-256 algorithm.” If other cryptocurrencies were to achieve acceptance at the expense of bitcoin or bitcoin cash causing the value of bitcoin or bitcoin\ncash to decline, or if bitcoin were to switch its proof of work algorithm from SHA-256 to another algorithm for which our miners are not specialized, or the\nvalue of bitcoin or bitcoin cash were to decline for other reasons, particularly if such decline were significant or over an extended period of time, our\noperating results would be adversely affected, and there could be a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our\nnew strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations, and harm investors.\nBitcoin and other bitcoin market prices, which have historically been volatile and are impacted by a variety of factors (including those discussed\nbelow), are determined primarily using data from various exchanges, over-the-counter markets and derivative platforms. Furthermore, such prices may be\nsubject to factors such as those that impact commodities, more so than business activities, which could be subjected to additional influence from fraudulent\nor illegitimate actors, real or perceived scarcity, and political, economic, regulatory or other conditions. Pricing may be the result of, and may continue to\nresult in, speculation regarding future appreciation in the value of cryptocurrencies, or our share price, inflating and making their market prices more\nvolatile or creating “bubble” type risks for both bitcoin and shares of our ordinary shares.\nWe may not be able to realize the benefits of forks.\nTo the extent that a significant majority of users and miners on a bitcoin network install software that changes the bitcoin network or properties of\na bitcoin, including the irreversibility of transactions and limitations on the mining of new bitcoin, the bitcoin network would be subject to new protocols\nand software. However, if less than a significant majority of users and miners on the bitcoin network consent to the proposed modification, and the\nmodification is not compatible with the software prior to its modification, the consequence would be what is known as a “fork” of the network, with one\nprong running the pre-modified software and the other running the modified software. The effect of such a fork would be the existence of two versions of\nthe bitcoin running in parallel, yet lacking interchangeability and necessitating exchange-type transaction to convert currencies between the two forks.\nAdditionally, it may be unclear following a fork which fork represents the original asset and which is the new asset. Different metrics adopted by industry\nparticipants to determine which is the original asset include: referring to the wishes of the core developers of a bitcoin, blockchains with the greatest\namount of hashing power contributed by miners or validators; or blockchains with the longest chain. A fork in the network of a particular bitcoin could\nadversely affect an investment in our Company or our ability to operate.\nWe may not be able to realize the economic benefit of a fork, either immediately or ever, which could adversely affect an investment in our\nsecurities. If we hold a bitcoin at the time of a hard fork into two cryptocurrencies, industry standards would dictate that we would be expected to hold an\nequivalent amount of the old and new assets following the fork. However, we may not be able, or it may not be practical, to secure or realize the economic\nbenefit of the new asset for various reasons. For instance, we may determine that there is no safe or practical way to custody the new asset, that trying to do\nso may pose an unacceptable risk to our holdings in the old asset, or that the costs of taking possession and/or maintaining ownership of the new bitcoin\nexceed the benefits of owning the new bitcoin. Additionally, laws, regulation or other factors may prevent us from benefitting from the new asset even if\nthere is a safe and practical way to custody and secure the new asset.\n17\nThere is a possibility of bitcoin mining algorithms transitioning to proof of stake validation and other mining related risks, which could make us less\ncompetitive and ultimately adversely affect our business and the value of our stock.\nProof of stake is an alternative method in validating bitcoin transactions. Should the algorithm shift from a proof of work validation method to a\nproof of stake method, mining would require less energy and may render any company that maintains advantages in the current climate (for example, from\nlower priced electricity, processing, real estate, or hosting) less competitive. We, as a result of our efforts to optimize and improve the efficiency of our\nbitcoin mining operations, may be exposed to the risk in the future of losing the benefit of our capital investments and the competitive advantage we hope\nto gain form this as a result, and may be negatively impacted if a switch to proof of stake validation were to occur. This may additionally have an impact on\nother various investments of ours. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our business\nstrategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other\ncryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account.\nTo the extent that the profit margins of bitcoin mining operations are not high, operators of bitcoin mining operations are more likely to immediately\nsell bitcoin rewards earned by mining in the market, thereby constraining growth of the price of bitcoin that could adversely impact us, and similar\nactions could affect other cryptocurrencies.\nOver the past two years, bitcoin mining operations have evolved from individual users mining with computer processors, graphics processing units\nand first-generation ASIC servers. Currently, new processing power is predominantly added by incorporated and unincorporated “professionalized” mining\noperations. Professionalized mining operations may use proprietary hardware or sophisticated ASIC machines acquired from ASIC manufacturers. They\nrequire the investment of significant capital for the acquisition of this hardware, the leasing of operating space (often in data centers or warehousing\nfacilities), incurring of electricity costs and the employment of technicians to operate the mining farms. As a result, professionalized mining operations are\nof a greater scale than prior miners and have more defined and regular expenses and liabilities. These regular expenses and liabilities require\nprofessionalized mining operations to maintain profit margins on the sale of bitcoin. To the extent the price of bitcoin declines and such profit margin is\nconstrained, professionalized miners are incentivized to more immediately sell bitcoin earned from mining operations, whereas it is believed that individual\nminers in past years were more likely to hold newly mined bitcoin for more extended periods. The immediate selling of newly mined bitcoin greatly\nincreases the trading volume of bitcoin, creating downward pressure on the market price of bitcoin rewards.\nThe extent to which the value of bitcoin mined by a professionalized mining operation exceeds the allocable capital and operating costs\ndetermines the profit margin of such operation. A professionalized mining operation may be more likely to sell a higher percentage of its newly mined\nbitcoin rapidly if it is operating at a low profit margin and it may partially or completely cease operations if its profit margin is negative. In a low profit\nmargin environment, a higher percentage could be sold more rapidly, thereby potentially depressing bitcoin prices. Lower bitcoin prices could result in\nfurther tightening of profit margins for professionalized mining operations creating a network effect that may further reduce the price of bitcoin until\nmining operations with higher operating costs become unprofitable forcing them to reduce mining power or cease mining operations temporarily.\n18\nIf a malicious actor or botnet obtains control of more than 50% of the processing power on a bitcoin network, such actor or botnet could manipulate\nblockchains to adversely affect us, which would adversely affect an investment in us or our ability to operate.\nIf a malicious actor or botnet (a volunteer or hacked collection of computers controlled by networked software coordinating the actions of the\ncomputers) obtains a majority of the processing power dedicated to mining a bitcoin, it may be able to alter blockchains on which transactions of bitcoin\nreside and rely by constructing fraudulent blocks or preventing certain transactions from completing in a timely manner, or at all. The malicious actor or\nbotnet could control, exclude or modify the ordering of transactions, though it could not generate new units or transactions using such control. The\nmalicious actor could “double-spend” its own bitcoin (i.e., spend the same bitcoin in more than one transaction) and prevent the confirmation of other\nusers’ transactions for as long as it maintained control. To the extent that such malicious actor or botnet does not yield its control of the processing power\non the network or the bitcoin community does not reject the fraudulent blocks as malicious, reversing any changes made to blockchains may not be\npossible. The foregoing description is not the only means by which the entirety of blockchains or cryptocurrencies may be compromised but is only an\nexample.\nAlthough there are no known reports of malicious activity or control of blockchains achieved through controlling over 50% of the processing\npower on the network, it is believed that certain mining pools may have exceeded the 50% threshold in bitcoin. The possible crossing of the 50% threshold\nindicates a greater risk that a single mining pool could exert authority over the validation of bitcoin transactions. To the extent that the bitcoin ecosystem,\nand the administrators of mining pools, do not act to ensure greater decentralization of bitcoin mining processing power, the feasibility of a malicious actor\nobtaining control of the processing power will increase because the botnet or malicious actor could compromise more than 50% mining pool and thereby\ngain control of blockchain, whereas if the blockchain remains decentralized it is inherently more difficult for the botnet of malicious actor to aggregate\nenough processing power to gain control of the blockchain, may adversely affect an investment in our common stock. Such lack of controls and responses\nto such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or\notherwise acquire or hold for our own account, and harm investors.\nCryptocurrencies, including those maintained by or for us, may be exposed to cybersecurity threats and hacks.\nAs with any computer code generally, flaws in bitcoin codes may be exposed by malicious actors. Several errors and defects have been found\npreviously, including those that disabled some functionality for users and exposed users’ information. Exploitations of flaws in the source code that allow\nmalicious actors to take or create money have previously occurred. Despite our efforts and processes to prevent breaches, our devices, as well as our\nminers, computer systems and those of third parties that we use in our operations, are vulnerable to cyber security risks, including cyber-attacks such as\nviruses and worms, phishing attacks, denial-of-service attacks, physical or electronic break-ins, employee theft or misuse, and similar disruptions from\nunauthorized tampering with our miners and computer systems or those of third parties that we use in our operations. Such events could have a material\nadverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our business strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own\naccount.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our need for significant electrical power. Government regulators may potentially restrict the ability of electricity\nsuppliers to provide electricity to mining operations, such as ours.\nThe operation of a bitcoin or other bitcoin mine can require massive amounts of electrical power. Further, our mining operations can only be\nsuccessful and ultimately profitable if the costs, including electrical power costs, associated with mining a bitcoin are lower than the price of a bitcoin. As a\nresult, any mine we establish can only be successful if we can obtain sufficient electrical power for that mine on a cost-effective basis, and our\nestablishment of new mines requires us to find locations where that is the case. There may be significant competition for suitable mine locations, and\ngovernment regulators may potentially restrict the ability of electricity suppliers to provide electricity to mining operations in times of electricity shortage,\nor may otherwise potentially restrict or prohibit the provision or electricity to mining operations. Additionally, our mines could be materially adversely\naffected by a power outage. Given the power requirement, it would not be feasible to run miners on back-up power generators in the event of a government\nrestriction on electricity or a power outage. If we are unable to receive adequate power supply and are forced to reduce our operations due to the\navailability or cost of electrical power, our business would experience materially negative impacts.\n19\nIf the award of bitcoin rewards, for us primarily bitcoin for solving blocks and transaction fees are not sufficiently high, we may not have an adequate\nincentive to continue mining and may cease mining operations, which will likely lead to our failure to achieve profitability.\nAs the number of bitcoin rewards awarded for solving a block in a blockchain decreases, our ability to achieve profitability worsens. Decreased\nuse and demand for bitcoin rewards may adversely affect our incentive to expend processing power to solve blocks. If the award of bitcoin rewards for\nsolving blocks and transaction fees are not sufficiently high, we may not have an adequate incentive to continue mining and may cease our mining\noperations. For instance, the current fixed reward for solving a new block on the bitcoin blockchain is twelve and a half bitcoin currency rewards per block,\nwhich decreased from 25 bitcoin in July 2016. It is estimated that it will halve again in about one year. This reduction may result in a reduction in the\naggregate hash rate of the bitcoin network as the incentive for miners decreases. Miners ceasing operations would reduce the collective processing power\non the network, which would adversely affect the confirmation process for transactions (i.e., temporarily decreasing the speed at which blocks are added to\na blockchain until the next scheduled adjustment in difficulty for block solutions) and make bitcoin networks more vulnerable to a malicious actor or botnet\nobtaining control in excess of 50 percent of the processing power active on a blockchain, potentially permitting such actor or botnet to manipulate a\nblockchain in a manner that adversely affects our activities. A reduction in confidence in the confirmation process or processing power of the network could\nresult and be irreversible. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise\nacquire or hold for our own account.\nWe may not adequately respond to price fluctuations and rapidly changing technology, which may negatively affect our business.\nCompetitive conditions within the bitcoin industry require that we use sophisticated technology in the operation of our business. The industry for\nblockchain technology is characterized by rapid technological changes, new product introductions, enhancements and evolving industry standards. New\ntechnologies, techniques or products could emerge that might offer better performance than the software and other technologies we currently utilize, and we\nmay have to manage transitions to these new technologies to remain competitive. We may not be successful, generally or relative to our competitors in the\nbitcoin industry, in timely implementing new technology into our systems, or doing so in a cost-effective manner. During the course of implementing any\nsuch new technology into our operations, we may experience system interruptions and failures during such implementation. Furthermore, there can be no\nassurances that we will recognize, in a timely manner or at all, the benefits that we may expect as a result of our implementing new technology into our\noperations. As a result, our business and operations may suffer, and there may be adverse effects on the price of our common stock.\nRisks Involving Intellectual Property\nBitcoin and bitcoin mining is software related\nWe actively use specific hardware and software for our bitcoin mining operation. In certain cases, source code and other software assets may be\nsubject to an open source license, as much technology development underway in this sector is open source. For these works, the company intends to adhere\nto the terms of any license agreements that may be in place.\nWe do not currently own, and do not have any current plans to seek, any patents in connection with our existing and planned blockchain and\ncryptocurrency related operations. We do expect to rely upon trade secrets, trademarks, service marks, trade names, copyrights and other intellectual\nproperty rights and expect to license the use of intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others. In addition, we have developed and may further\ndevelop certain proprietary software applications for purposes of our cryptocurrency mining operation.\nOur platform may be subject to damage, interruptions or delays that may adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nIn the event of a platform outage and physical data loss, our ability to perform our bitcoin mining operations would be materially and adversely\naffected. The satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our platform are critical to our operations. Our operations depend on our ability to\nprotect our systems against damage or interruption from natural disasters, power or telecommunications failures, air quality issues, environmental\nconditions, computer viruses or attempts to harm our systems, criminal acts and similar events.\n20\nAny interruptions or delays in our service, whether as a result of third-party errors, our errors, natural disasters or security breaches, whether\naccidental or willful, could harm our operations and/or reputation. Additionally, in the event of damage or interruption, our insurance policies may not\nadequately compensate us for any losses that we may incur. Our disaster recovery plan has not been tested under actual disaster conditions, and we may not\nhave sufficient capacity to recover all data and services in the event of an outage. These factors could prevent us from mining bitcoins, damage our brand\nand reputation, divert our employees’ attention, subject us to liability, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nOur platform and internal systems rely on software that is highly technical, and if it contains undetected errors, our business could be adversely\naffected.\nOur platform and internal systems rely on software that is highly technical and complex. In addition, our platform and internal systems depend on\nthe ability of such software to store, retrieve, process and manage immense amounts of data. The software on which we rely has contained, and may now or\nin the future contain, undetected errors or bugs. Some errors may only be discovered after the code has been released for external or internal use. Any\nerrors, bugs or defects discovered in the software on which we rely could result in harm to our reputation, or liability for damages, any of which could\nadversely affect our business, results of operations and financial conditions.\nWe may not be able to prevent others from unauthorized use of our intellectual property, which could harm our business and competitive position.\nWe regard our trademarks, domain names, know-how, proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we\nrely on a combination of intellectual property laws and contractual arrangements, including confidentiality and non-compete agreements with our\nemployees and others to protect our proprietary rights. See “Item 4. Information of the Company —Intellectual Property” and “Regulation—Regulation on\nIntellectual Property Rights.” Thus, we cannot assure you that any of our intellectual property rights would not be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or\nmisappropriated, or such intellectual property will be sufficient to provide us with competitive advantages. In addition, because of the rapid pace of\ntechnological change in our industry, parts of our business rely on technologies developed or licensed by third parties, and we may not be able to obtain or\ncontinue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties on reasonable terms, or at all.\nOur trade secrets may be leaked or otherwise become available to, or be independently discovered by, our competitors. To the extent that our\nemployees or consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related know-how and\ninventions. Any failure in protecting or enforcing our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition\nand results of operations.\nWe may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims, which may be expensive to defend and may disrupt our business and operations.\nWe cannot be certain that our operations or any aspects of our business do not or will not infringe upon or otherwise violate trademarks, patents,\ncopyrights, know-how or other intellectual property rights held by third parties. We may be from time to time in the future subject to legal proceedings and\nclaims relating to the intellectual property rights of others. In addition, there may be third-party trademarks, patents, copyrights, know-how or other\nintellectual property rights that are infringed by our products, services or other aspects of our business without our awareness. Holders of such intellectual\nproperty rights may seek to enforce such intellectual property rights against us in China, the United States or other jurisdictions. If any third-party\ninfringement claims are brought against us, we may be forced to divert management’s time and other resources from our business and operations to defend\nagainst these claims, regardless of their merits. As a result, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nFluctuations in exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the value of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Ordinary Shares\nThe trading price of our common stock is subject to arbitrary pricing factors that are not necessarily associated with traditional factors that\ninfluence stock prices or the value of non-bitcoin assets such as revenue, cash flows, profitability, growth prospects or business activity levels since the\nvalue and price, as determined by the investing public, may be influenced by future anticipated adoption or appreciation in value of cryptocurrencies or\nblockchains generally, factors over which we have little or no influence or control.\n21\nOther factors which could cause volatility in the market price of our common stock include, but are not limited to:\n● actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results or those of companies perceived to be similar to us;\n● actual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\n● commercial success and market acceptance of blockchain and bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies;\n● actions by our competitors, such as new business initiatives, acquisitions and divestitures;\n● strategic transactions undertaken by us;\n● additions or departures of key personnel;\n● prevailing economic conditions;\n● disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\n● sales of our common stock by our officers, directors or significant stockholders;\n● other actions taken by our stockholders;\n● future sales or issuances of equity or debt securities by us;\n● business disruptions caused by earthquakes, tornadoes or other natural disasters;\n● issuance of new or changed securities analysts’ reports or recommendations regarding us;\n● legal proceedings involving our company, our industry or both;\n● changes in market valuations of companies similar to ours;\n● the prospects of the industry in which we operate;\n● speculation or reports by the press or investment community with respect to us or our industry in general;\n● the level of short interest in our stock; and\n● other risks, uncertainties and factors described in this annual report.\n22\nIn addition, the stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of the\nissuer. These broad market fluctuations may negatively impact the price or liquidity of our common stock. When the price of a stock has been volatile,\nholders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the issuer.\nWe may be unable to comply with the applicable continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, which may adversely impact our access\nto capital markets and may cause us to default certain of our agreements.\nOur common stock is currently traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Nasdaq rules require us to maintain a minimum closing bid price of $1.00\nper share of our common stock. The closing bid price of our common stock fell below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive trading days, so we were not in\ncompliance with Nasdaq’s rules for listing standards. Although we regained compliance, there can be no assurance we will continue to meet the minimum\nbid price requirements or any other requirements in the future, in which case our common stock could be delisted.\nIn the event that our common stock is delisted from Nasdaq and is not eligible for quotation or listing on another market or exchange, trading of\nour common stock could be conducted only in the over-the-counter market or on an electronic bulletin board established for unlisted securities such as the\nOTC. In such event, it could become more difficult to dispose of, or obtain accurate price quotations for our common stock and there would likely also be a\nreduction in our coverage by securities analysts and the news media, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline further. In addition, our\nability to raise additional capital may be severely impacted, which may negatively affect our plans and the results of our operations.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could\ndecline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by whether industry or securities analysts publish research and reports about us, our\nbusiness, our market or our competitors and, if any analysts do publish such reports, what they publish in those reports. We may not obtain or maintain\nanalyst coverage in the future. Any analysts that do cover us may make adverse recommendations regarding our stock, adversely change their\nrecommendations from time to time and/or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors. If analysts who may cover us in the\nfuture were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, or if analysts fail to cover us or publish reports about us at all, we\ncould lose (or never gain) visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the stock price of our common stock or trading volume to decline.\nMoreover, if our operating results do not meet the expectations of the investor community, one or more of the analysts who cover our company may change\ntheir recommendations regarding our company and our stock price could decline.\nOur ordinary shares may be thinly traded and you may be unable to sell at or near ask prices or at all if you need to sell your shares to raise money or\notherwise desire to liquidate your shares.\nOur ordinary shares may be “thinly-traded”, meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our ordinary shares at or near bid prices\nat any given time may be relatively small or non-existent. This situation may be attributable to a number of factors, including the fact that we are relatively\nunknown to stock analysts, stock brokers, institutional investors and others in the investment community that generate or influence sales volume, and that\neven if we came to the attention of such persons, they tend to be risk-averse and might be reluctant to follow an unproven company such as ours or\npurchase or recommend the purchase of our shares until such time as we became more seasoned. As a consequence, there may be periods of several days or\nmore when trading activity in our shares is minimal or non-existent, as compared to a seasoned issuer which has a large and steady volume of trading\nactivity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price. Broad or active public trading market for our ordinary shares\nmay not develop or be sustained.\n23\nVolatility in our ordinary shares price may subject us to securities litigation.\nThe market for our ordinary shares may have, when compared to seasoned issuers, significant price volatility and we expect that our share price\nmay continue to be more volatile than that of a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future. In the past, plaintiffs have often initiated securities class action\nlitigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We may, in the future, be the target of similar litigation.\nSecurities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert management’s attention and resources.\nWe are not likely to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe currently intend to retain any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business. Accordingly, we do not expect to pay any\ncash dividends in the foreseeable future but will review this policy as circumstances dictate.\nYou may face difficulties in protecting your interests as a shareholder, as the laws of British Virgin Islands provides substantially less protection when\ncompared to the laws of the United States and it may be difficult for a shareholder of ours to effect service of process or to enforce judgements obtained\nin the United States courts.\nOur corporate affairs are governed by our memorandum and articles of association and by the Companies Law (2016 Revision) and common law\nof the British Virgin Islands. The rights of shareholders to take legal action against our directors and us, actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary\nresponsibilities of our directors to us under British Islands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the British Virgin Islands. The common\nlaw of the British Virgin Islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the British Virgin Islands as well as from English\ncommon law. Decisions of the Privy Council (which is the final court of appeal for British overseas territories such as the British Virgin Islands) are\nbinding on a court in the British Virgin Islands. Decisions of the English courts, and particularly the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom and the Court\nof Appeal are generally of persuasive authority but are not binding on the courts of the British Virgin Islands. The rights of our shareholders and the\nfiduciary responsibilities of our directors under British Virgin Islands law are not as clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial\nprecedents in the United States. In particular, the British Virgin Islands has a less developed body of securities laws as compared to the United States and\nprovide significantly less protection to investors. In addition, British Virgin Islands companies may not have standing to initiate a shareholder derivative\naction before the United States federal courts. The British Islands courts are also unlikely to impose liabilities against us in original actions brought in the\nBritish Virgin Islands, based on certain civil liability provisions of United States securities laws.\nAll of our directors and officers are nationals or residents of jurisdictions other than the United States and a substantial portion of their assets are\nlocated outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for a shareholder to effect service of process within the United States upon these persons,\nor to enforce against us or them judgments obtained in United States courts, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the\nsecurities laws of the United States or any state in the United States.\nAs a result of all of the above, our shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests through actions against us or our officers,\ndirectors or major shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction in the United States.\n24\nWe are a foreign private issuer within the meaning of the rules under the Exchange Act, and as such we are exempt from certain provisions applicable\nto United States domestic public companies.\nWe are a foreign private issuer within the meaning of the rules under the Exchange Act. As such, we are exempt from certain provisions applicable\nto United States domestic public companies. For example:\n● we are not required to provide as many Exchange Act reports, or as frequently, as a domestic public company;\n● for interim reporting, we are permitted to comply solely with our home country requirements, which are less rigorous than the rules that apply\nto domestic public companies;\n● we are not required to provide the same level of disclosure on certain issues, such as executive compensation;\n● we are exempt from provisions of Regulation FD aimed at preventing issuers from making selective disclosures of material information;\n● we are not required to comply with the sections of the Exchange Act regulating the solicitation of proxies, consents or authorizations in\nrespect of a security registered under the Exchange Act; and\n● we are not required to comply with Section 16 of the Exchange Act requiring insiders to file public reports of their share ownership and\ntrading activities and establishing insider liability for profits realized from any “short-swing” trading transaction.\n● We currently intend to file annual reports on Form 20-F and reports on Form 6-K as a foreign private issuer. Accordingly, our shareholders\nmay not have access to certain information they may deem important.\n25\nIf we are classified as a passive foreign investment company, United States taxpayers who own our ordinary shares may have adverse United States\nfederal income tax consequences.\nA non-U.S. corporation such as ourselves will be classified as a passive foreign investment company, which is known as a PFIC, for any taxable\nyear if, for such year, either\n● at least 75% of our gross income for the year is passive income; or\n● the average percentage of our assets (determined at the end of each quarter) during the taxable year which produce passive income or which\nare held for the production of passive income is at least 50%.\nPassive income generally includes dividends, interest, rents and royalties (other than rents or royalties derived from the active conduct of a trade or\nbusiness) and gains from the disposition of passive assets.\nIf we are determined to be a PFIC for any taxable year (or portion thereof) that is included in the holding period of a U.S. taxpayer who holds our\nordinary shares, the U.S. taxpayer may be subject to increased U.S. federal income tax liability and may be subject to additional reporting requirements.\nDepending on the amount of cash we raise in a public offering completed in March 2018, together with any other assets held for the production of\npassive income, it is possible that, for our 2018 taxable year or for any subsequent year, more than 50% of our assets may be assets which produce passive\nincome. We will make this determination following the end of any particular tax year. Although the law in this regard is unclear, we treat our consolidated\naffiliated entities as being owned by us for United States federal income tax purposes, not only because we exercise effective control over the operation of\nsuch entities but also because we are entitled to substantially all of their economic benefits, and, as a result, we consolidate their operating results in our\nconsolidated financial statements. For purposes of the PFIC analysis, in general, a non-U.S. corporation is deemed to own its pro rata share of the gross\nincome and assets of any entity in which it is considered to own at least 25% of the equity by value.\nFor a more detailed discussion of the application of the PFIC rules to us and the consequences to U.S. taxpayers if we were determined to be a\nPFIC, see “Item 10.E. Taxation — United States Federal Income Taxation — Passive Foreign Investment Company.”\nWe expect that our capital expenditures in fiscal year 2022 will be incurred primarily in connection with the purchase of bitcoin mining machines,\nadditional computer equipment and IT server to support our services.\n26\nITEM 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY\nHistory and Development of the Company\nOur Company was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands on May 18, 2021. On August 16, 2021, the Company completed a redomicile merger with its\npredecessor company, Moxian, Inc., a Nevada corporation pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger entered into on May 28, 2021, wherein it acquired\nall the assets, liabilities, rights, obligations and operations of the latter and its subsidiaries, through an exchange of an identical number of its ordinary\nshares.\nOn October 25, 2021, the Board approved to re-designate 50,000,000 of its authorized but unissued ordinary shares of par value of $0.001 each (the\n“Ordinary Shares”) as 50,000,000 preferred shares of par value of $0.00101 each (the “Preferred Shares”) and amend its Memorandum and Articles of\nAssociation, among other things, to specify the rights attaching to the preferred shares. On October 28, 2021, the Company filed its Amended and Restated\nMemorandum and Articles of Association (the “Amended and Restated M&A”) with the British Virgin Islands Registrar of Corporate Affairs. The\nCompany is authorized to issue 150,000,000 Ordinary Shares and 50,000,000 Preferred Shares pursuant to the Amended and Restated M&A.\nOn November 11, 2021, the Board approved to issue 5,000,000 Preferred Shares to Bridgeforrest (BVI) Inc., a holding company owned by Conglin\n(Forrest) Deng , the Chief Executive Officer and an Executive Director of the Company, for gross proceeds of $5,000,000. The shares were issued on\nDecember 1, 2021.\nOn December 28, 2021, in a Special Meeting, the shareholders approved the issue of up to 20 million new ordinary shares of the Company, at a price of\n$2.50 per share to certain non-US based accredited investors. On February 11, 2022, the Company completed this private placement and issued 16,000,000\nnew shares, raising $40 million, which it will use in bitcoin mining in order to diversify its business operations. Of the proceeds raised, $29.8 million was\nused to purchase relevant equipment and the balance will be used as working capital.\nOur predecessor company, Moxian, Inc (“Moxian”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada, United States of America, on October 12, 2010. It was\nuplisted to the Nasdaq Capital Market on November 14, 2016, operating as an O2O enterprise, with two major lines of business mobile applications linking\nsmall and medium enterprises to its network platform and digital advertising through a partnership with Xinhua New Media, which operates the official app\nof the New China News Agency, a state-backed media firm. The mobile app business failed to achieve a meaningful share of the market and incurred huge\nlosses, primarily because users found the Moxian app unwieldy and not user-friendly. By September 30, 2018, the Company had to halt this business as it\nran out of working capital whilst the digital advertising continued.\nThere were discussions with various parties for strategic partnerships between June 2018 to the end of 2020 but none of these business opportunities\nmaterialized.\nIn August, 2021, Moxian, Inc decided to redomicile to the British Virgin Islands through a merger with its wholly-owned subsidiary, Moxian BVI. Moxian\nBVI became the surviving company when the merger was completed in August 2021. In September 2021, the Company appointed a new CEO who was\ntasked to identify new business for the Company in order to broaden its earnings base. Following non-binding expressions of support from some\nshareholders, the Company decided to venture into bitcoin mining and called for a Special Meeting of shareholders in December 2021 to approve related\nproposals as noted above. All these proposals were approved at the Special Meeting and in February 2022, the Company completed its capital raising\nexercise, with a total subscription of 16 million new ordinary shares for $40 million.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the subsidiaries of the Company are as follows:\nDate of\nName of Company Country of Incorporation Incorporation Principal Activity\nABit Hong Kong Limited Hong Kong SAR May 8, 2019 Investment Holding\nBeijing Bitmatrix Technology Co. Ltd. Peoples’ Republic of China December 20, 2019 In-house Support Services\nABit USA, Inc Delaware, United States of America April 26, 2022 Bitcoin Mining\n27\nOrganization Chart\nThe following diagram illustrates our corporate structure, as of the date of this Report:\nMoxian (BVI) Inc\n28\nBusiness Overview\nBitcoin Mining\nOperations of bitcoin mining\nIn view of the widespread adoption of blockchain technology and bitcoin worldwide, the Company determined to enter the bitcoin mining\nindustry, which is the production of bitcoin. Management believes that bitcoin mining is profitable and its business plan is viable.\nAs of the date of this Report, the Company has identified a suitable site in Eastern Tennessee and will continue to identify other suitable sites for\nthe sole purpose of mining bitcoin. Our facility and mining platform will operate with the primary intent of accumulating bitcoin which we may sell for fiat\ncurrency from time to time depending on market conditions and management’s determination of our cash flow needs.\nPerformance Metrics of bitcoin mining\nThe Company operates mining hardware which performs computational operations in support of the blockchain measured in “hash rate” or\n“hashes per second.” A “hash” is the computation run by mining hardware in support of the blockchain; therefore, a miner’s “hash rate” refers to the rate at\nwhich it is capable of solving such computations. The original equipment used for mining bitcoin utilized the Central Processing Unit (CPU) of a computer\nto mine various forms of bitcoin. Due to performance limitations, CPU mining was rapidly replaced by the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), which offers\nsignificant performance advantages over CPUs. General purpose chipsets like CPUs and GPUs have since been replaced in the mining industry by\nApplication Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC) chips like those found in the MicroBT M21S miner currently utilized by the Company at its mining\nfacility. These ASIC chips are designed specifically to maximize the rate of hashing operations.\nThe Company measures our mining performance and competitive position based on overall hash rate being produced in our mining sites. The\nlatest equipment the MicroBT M21S miner, performs in the range of approximately 50 – 58 terahash per second (TH/s) per unit, M20S performs in the\nrange of 64 – 68 TH/s per unit, M10 performs in the range of 31 – 35 TH/s per unit; Bitmain T17+ performs with a maximum hashrate of 64 TH/s per unit;\nInnosilicon T3 performs in the range of 41 – 45 TH/s per unit. This group of mining hardware is on the cutting edge of available mining equipment,\nhowever, advances and improvements to the technology are ongoing and may be available in quantities to the market in the near future which may affect\nour perceived position.\n29\nHalving\nFurther affecting the industry, and particularly for the bitcoin blockchain, the cryptocurrency reward for solving a block is subject to periodic\nincremental halving. Halving is a process designed to control the overall supply and reduce the risk of inflation in cryptocurrencies using a Proof-of-Work\nconsensus algorithm. At a predetermined block, the mining reward is cut in half, hence the term “halving”. For bitcoin, the reward was initially set at 50\nbitcoin currency rewards per block and this was cut in half to 25 in November 28, 2012 at block 210,000 and again to 12.5 on July 9, 2016 at block 420,000\nand on May 11, 2020 at block 630,000 when the reward was halved to 6.25. This process will reoccur until the total amount of bitcoin currency rewards\nissued reaches 21 million, which is expected to occur around 2140.\nNetwork Hash Rate and Difficulty\nIn cryptocurrency mining, “hash rate” is a measure of the processing speed by a mining computer for a specific coin. An individual miner, such as\nRiot has a hash rate total of its miners seeking to mine a specific coin, and system wide there is a total has rate of all miners seeking to mine each specific\ntype of coin. The higher total hash rate of a specific miner, as a percentage of the system wide total hash rate, generally results over time in a corresponding\nhigher success rate in coin rewards as compared to miners with lower hash rates.\nMining Pools\nA “mining pool” is the pooling of resources by miners, who share their processing power over a network and split rewards according to the\namount of work they contributed to the probability of placing a block on the blockchain. Mining pools emerged in response to the growing difficulty and\navailable hashing power that competes to place a block on the bitcoin blockchain.\nThe Company participates in mining pools wherein groups of miners associate to pool resources and earn cryptocurrency together allocated to\neach miner according to the “hashing” capacity they contribute to the pool. As additional miners competed for the limited supply of blocks, individuals\nfound that they were working for months without finding a block and receiving any reward for their mining efforts. To address this variance, miners started\norganizing into pools to share mining rewards more evenly on a pro rata basis based on total hashing capacity contributed to the mining pool.\nThe mining pool operator provides a service that coordinates the computing power of the independent mining enterprise. Fees are paid to the\nmining pool operator to cover the costs of maintaining the pool. The pool uses software that coordinates the pool members’ hashing power, identifies new\nblock rewards, records how much work all the participants are doing, and assigns block rewards for successful algorithm solutions in-proportion to the\nindividual hash rate that each participant contributed to a given successful mining transaction. While we do not pay pool fees directly, pool fees are\ndeducted from amounts we may otherwise earn. Fees (and payouts) fluctuate and historically have been approximately 2% on average.\nMining pools are subject to various risks such as disruption and down time. Riot has internally created software that monitors its hashing\nperformance and reward rates to monitor credits for our contributed hashing power. In the event that a pool experiences down time or not yielding returns,\nour results may be impacted.\nCompetition\nIn bitcoin mining, companies, individuals and groups generate units of bitcoin through mining. Miners can range from individual enthusiasts to\nprofessional mining operations with dedicated data centers. Miners may organize themselves in mining pools. The Company competes or may in the future\ncompete with other companies that focus all or a portion of their activities on owning or operating bitcoin exchanges, developing programming for the\nblockchain, and mining activities. At present, the information concerning the activities of these enterprises is not readily available as the vast majority of\nthe participants in this sector do not publish information publicly or the information may be unreliable. Published sources of information include\n“bitcoin.org” and “blockchain.info”; however, the reliability of that information and its continued availability cannot be assured.\n30\nThe bitcoin industry is a highly competitive and evolving industry and new competitors and/or emerging technologies could enter the market and\naffect our competitiveness in the future. For more information regarding those risk factors known to us, see the section entitled “Risk Factors” herein.\nEmployees\nAs required by PRC regulations, we participate in various government statutory employee benefit plans, including social insurance funds, namely\na pension contribution plan, a medical insurance plan, an unemployment insurance plan, a work-related injury insurance plan and a maternity insurance\nplan, and a housing provident fund. We are required under PRC law to make contributions to employee benefit plans at specified percentages of the\nsalaries, bonuses and certain allowances of our employees, up to a maximum amount specified by the local government from time to time. As of the date of\nthis report, we have made adequate employee benefit payments. However, if we were found by the relevant authorities that we failed to make adequate\npayment, we may be required to make up the contributions for these plans as well as to pay late fees and fines. See “Item 3.D. Risk Factors — Risks\nRelated to Doing Business in China — Failure to make adequate contributions to various employee benefit plans as required by PRC regulations may\nsubject us to penalties.”\nWe enter into standard labor and confidentiality agreements with our employees. We believe that we maintain a good working relationship with\nour employees, and we have not experienced any major labor disputes.\nInsurance\nWe provide social security insurance including pension insurance, unemployment insurance, work-related injury insurance and medical insurance\nfor our employees. We do not maintain business interruption insurance or general third-party liability insurance, nor do we maintain product liability\ninsurance or key-man insurance. We consider our insurance coverage to be sufficient for our business operations in China.\nLegal Proceedings\nWe are currently not a party to any material legal or administrative proceedings. We may from time to time be subject to various legal or\nadministrative claims and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Litigation or any other legal or administrative proceeding, regardless of\nthe outcome, is likely to result in substantial cost and diversion of our resources, including our management’s time and attention.\n31\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nEffective July 2022, the Company no longer has any business operations in China. It maintains a small office of about 200 square meters for the\nadministrative and accounting staff, which is part of a larger office for a third party which bears the rental. The Company does not bear its share of the\nrental for the space it occupies. The third party pays a rental of about $9,200 on a two-year lease, expiring in February 2024. The office address is Room\n1202, Block B, Jiahui Center, 6 Jiqing Li, Chaoyangmenwai Street, Chaoyang District, Beijing.\nThe main subsidiary of the Company, ABit USA, Inc is constructing a mining center in its acquired land in Duff, near the city of LaFollette in the State of\nTennessee in the United States which was purchased in April 2023 for $1.2 million. Construction is expected to be completed in August 2023 and will\ninclude the office of its USA subsidiary.\nITEM 4A. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone\nITEM 5. OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS\nThe Company is now on a much stronger footing than any time in the past. Stockholders’ equity as of December 31, 2022 is now in excess of $23 million,\nnearly a 4-fold increase from the previous year. The year began with a strong promise as new stockholders pumped $40 million as new working capital as\nthe Company sought to ship mining equipment from China. Unfortunately, as the year unfolded, bitcoin prices fell from the $40,000 level at the beginning\nof the year to a low of about $15,000 towards the end of the year. Interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve and geo-political tensions, not excluding the\nUkraine war, hastened the collapse of bitcoin prices as the outlook remained grim throughout the year.\nOur mining operation which began in earnest in Buffalo in late February, followed by another operation in Columbus, Georgia became increasing\nunprofitable with sharp fluctuations in electricity prices. Mining operations discontinued in both locations by the end of May. The Company felt it\nnecessary to cease operations and reviewed its mining equipment, resulting in an impairment adjustment to the tune of $11.9 million as a one-time charge.\nEfforts began to intensify for a more favorable site and eventually, we acquired a piece of property in Eastern Tennessee. The directors of the Company\nremained optimistic about the longer-term future of the bitcoin business and sought to capitalize on the dim outlook of the industry towards December to\nacquire 1,140 units of the latest supercomputing servers at most competitive prices. With these additions and other equipment, including switchgear and\ntransformers, the Company began construction of a new mining center in April of 2023 with a completion by August by which time, the first new units of\nequipment will have arrived and the Company can look forward to a renewed start.\nThe optimism seemed to be well=founded as bitcoin prices have somewhat recovered from the lows of 2022.\nIn July 2022, the Company divested its entire interest in Moxian (Hong Kong) Limited, the holding company of a group of companies in the People’s\nRepublic of China and Malaysia. which have ceased active operations since June 2018. It meant that the Company no longer has a business footprint in\nChina and is now in a position to consider other commercial opportunities in the United States and the rest of the world. With the continued support of a\nnew group of investors, there is every hope that 2023 fiscal year will mark a significant milestone for the Company.\nBecause of the relative inactivity, there is little meaning in comparing with the financials of the previous year. The Company operated on sundry jobs in its\nBeijing subsidiary, maintained a central pool of staff and did not segregate costs between that of direct jobs or back-office supporting staff.\nITEM 6.

These authorities are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly on a\nretroactive basis.\nThis discussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to any particular holder of our securities based on such\nholder’s individual circumstances. In particular, this discussion considers only holders that own and hold our securities as capital assets within the meaning\nof Section 1221 of the Code, and does not address the alternative minimum tax. In addition, this discussion does not address the U.S. federal income tax\nconsequences to holders that are subject to special rules, including:\n● financial institutions or financial services entities;\n● broker-dealers;\n● persons that are subject to the mark-to-market accounting rules under Section 475 of the Code;\n● tax-exempt entities;\n● governments or agencies or instrumentalities thereof;\n● insurance companies;\n● regulated investment companies;\n● real estate investment trusts;\n● certain expatriates or former long-term residents of the United States;\n42\n● persons that actually or constructively own 5% or more of our public shares;\n● persons that acquired our securities pursuant to the exercise of employee options, in connection with employee incentive plans or otherwise as\ncompensation;\n● persons that hold our securities as part of a straddle, constructive sale, hedging, conversion or other integrated transaction;\n● persons whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;\n● controlled foreign corporations; or passive foreign investment companies.\nThis discussion does not address any aspect of U.S. federal non-income tax laws, such as gift or estate tax laws, state, local or non-U.S. tax laws or, except\nas discussed herein, any tax reporting obligations applicable to a holder of our securities. Additionally, this discussion does not consider the tax treatment of\npartnerships or other pass-through entities or persons who hold our securities through such entities. If a partnership (or other entity classified as a\npartnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is the beneficial owner of our securities, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in the\npartnership will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. This discussion also assumes that any distributions made\n(or deemed made) by us on our securities and any consideration received (or deemed received) by a holder in consideration for the sale or other disposition\nof our securities will be in U.S. dollars.\nWe have not sought, and will not seek a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) or an opinion of counsel as to any U.S. federal income tax\nconsequence described herein. The IRS may disagree with the description herein, and its determination may be upheld by a court. Moreover, there can be\nno assurance that future legislation, regulations, administrative rulings or court decisions will not adversely affect the accuracy of the statements in this\ndiscussion.\nTHIS DISCUSSION OF THE MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE ACQUISITION, OWNERSHIP AND\nDISPOSITION OF OUR SECURITIES IS NOT TAX ADVICE. EACH HOLDER OF OUR SECURITIES IS URGED TO CONSULT ITS OWN TAX\nADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO THE PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES TO SUCH HOLDER OF THE ACQUISITION, OWNERSHIP AND\nDISPOSITION OF OUR SECURITIES, INCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF ANY STATE, LOCAL, AND NON-U.S. TAX LAWS,\nAS WELL AS U.S. FEDERAL TAX LAWS AND ANY APPLICABLE TAX TREATIES.\nU.S. Holders\nTaxation of Cash Distributions\nSubject to the passive foreign investment company (“PFIC”) rules discussed below, a U.S. Holder generally will be required to include in gross income as\nordinary income the amount of any cash dividend paid on our shares. A cash distribution on such shares generally will be treated as a dividend for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes to the extent paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined under U.S. federal income tax\nprinciples). Such dividend generally will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction generally allowed to domestic corporations in respect of\ndividends received from other domestic corporations. The portion of such distribution, if any, in excess of such earnings and profits generally will\nconstitute a return of capital that will be applied against and reduce (but not below zero) the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in such shares. Any remaining\nexcess will be treated as gain from the sale or other taxable disposition of such shares and will be treated as described under “— Taxation on the\nDisposition of Securities” below.\nWith respect to non-corporate U.S. Holders, dividends on our shares may be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the lower applicable long-term capital\ngains tax rate (see “— Taxation on the Disposition of Securities” below) provided that (1) such shares are readily tradable on an established securities\nmarket in the United States, (2) we are not a PFIC, as discussed below, for either the taxable year in which the dividend was paid or the preceding taxable\nyear, and (3) certain holding period requirements are met. Under published IRS authority, our shares are considered for purposes of clause (1) above to be\nreadily tradable on an established securities market in the United States only if they are listed on certain exchanges, which presently include the NASDAQ\nCapital Market. Although our ordinary shares and warrants are currently listed and traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market, we cannot guarantee that our\nsecurities will continue to be listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the availability of the\nlower rate for any cash dividends paid with respect to our securities.\n43\nPossible Constructive Distributions with Respect to Redeemable Warrants\nThe terms of each redeemable warrant provide for an adjustment to the number of ordinary shares for which the redeemable warrant may be exercised in\ncertain events. An adjustment that has the effect of preventing dilution generally is not taxable. However, the U.S. Holders of the redeemable warrants\nwould be treated as receiving a constructive distribution from us if, for example, the adjustment increases the redeemable warrant holders’ proportionate\ninterest in our assets or earnings and profits (e.g., through an increase in the number of ordinary shares that would be obtained upon exercise) as a result of\na distribution of cash to the holders of our shares, which is taxable to the U.S. Holders of such shares as described under “Taxation of Cash Distributions”\nabove. Such constructive distribution would be subject to tax as described under that section in the same manner as if the U.S. Holders of the redeemable\nwarrants received a cash distribution from us equal to the fair market value of such increased interest.\nTaxation on the Disposition of Securities\nUpon a sale or other taxable disposition of our securities (which, in general, would include a distribution in connection with our liquidation or a redemption\nof redeemable warrants), and subject to the PFIC rules discussed below, a U.S. Holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to\nthe difference between the amount realized and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the securities. See “— Exercise or Lapse of Redeemable Warrants”\nbelow for a discussion regarding a U.S. Holder’s basis in the ordinary share acquired pursuant to the exercise of a warrant.\nThe regular U.S. federal income tax rate on capital gains recognized by U.S. Holders generally is the same as the regular U.S. federal income tax rate on\nordinary income, except that long-term capital gains recognized by non-corporate U.S. Holders generally are subject to U.S. federal income tax at reduced\nrates of tax. Capital gain or loss will constitute long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the securities exceeds one year. The\ndeductibility of capital losses is subject to various limitations.\nAdditional Taxes\nU.S. Holders that are individuals, estates or trusts and whose income exceeds certain thresholds generally will be subject to a 3.8% Medicare contribution\ntax on unearned income, including, without limitation, dividends on, and gains from the sale or other taxable disposition of, our securities, subject to certain\nlimitations and exceptions. Under recently issued regulations, in the absence of a special election, such unearned income generally would not include\nincome inclusions under the qualified electing fund, or QEF rules discussed below under “— Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules,” but would\ninclude distributions of earnings and profits from a QEF. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect, if any, of such tax on their\nownership and disposition of our securities.\nExercise or Lapse of Redeemable Warrants\nSubject to the PFIC rules discussed below, a U.S. Holder generally will not recognize gain or loss upon the acquisition of ordinary shares on the exercise of\nredeemable warrants for cash. Ordinary shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of redeemable warrants for cash will have a tax basis equal to the U.S.\nHolder’s tax basis in the redeemable warrants, increased by the amount paid to exercise the redeemable warrants. The holding period of such ordinary\nshares should begin on the day after the date of exercise of the redeemable warrants. If redeemable warrants are allowed to lapse unexercised, a U.S.\nHolder generally will recognize a capital loss equal to such holder’s adjusted tax basis in the redeemable warrants.\nThe tax consequences of a cashless exercise of redeemable warrants are not clear under current tax law. A cashless exercise may be tax-free, either because\nit is not a realization event (i.e., not a transaction in which gain or loss is realized) or because the transaction is treated as a recapitalization for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes. In either tax-free situation, a U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the ordinary shares received would equal the U.S. Holder’s basis in the\nredeemable warrants. If the cashless exercise were treated as not being a realization event, the U.S. Holder’s holding period in the ordinary shares could be\ntreated as commencing on the date following the date of exercise of the redeemable warrants. If the cashless exercise were treated as a recapitalization, the\nholding period of the ordinary shares received would include the holding period of the redeemable warrants.\n44\nIt is also possible that a cashless exercise could be treated as a taxable exchange in which gain or loss is recognized. In such event, a U.S. Holder could be\ndeemed to have surrendered a number of redeemable warrants with a fair market value equal to the exercise price for the number of redeemable warrants\ndeemed exercised. For this purpose, the number of redeemable warrants deemed exercised would be equal to the number of ordinary shares issued pursuant\nto the cashless exercise of the redeemable warrants. In this situation, the U.S. Holder would recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the\ndifference between the fair market value of the redeemable warrants deemed surrendered to pay the exercise price and the U.S. Holder’s tax basis in such\nredeemable warrants deemed surrendered. Such gain or loss would be long-term or short-term depending on the U.S. Holder’s holding period in the\nredeemable warrants. In this case, a U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the ordinary shares received would equal the sum of the fair market value of the redeemable\nwarrants deemed surrendered to pay the exercise price and the U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the redeemable warrants deemed exercised, and a U.S. Holder’s\nholding period for the ordinary shares should commence on the date following the date of exercise of the redeemable warrants. There also may be\nalternative characterizations of any such taxable exchange that would result in similar tax consequences, except that a U.S. Holder’s gain or loss would be\nshort-term.\nDue to the absence of authority on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a cashless exercise of redeemable warrants it is unclear which, if any, of the\nalternative tax consequences and holding periods described above would be adopted by the IRS or a court of law. Accordingly, U.S. Holders should consult\ntheir tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of a cashless exercise of redeemable warrants.\nPassive Foreign Investment Company Rules\nA foreign (i.e., non-U.S.) corporation will be a PFIC if at least 75% of its gross income in a taxable year of the foreign corporation, including its pro rata\nshare of the gross income of any corporation in which it is considered to own at least 25% of the shares by value, is passive income. Alternatively, a foreign\ncorporation will be a PFIC if at least 50% of its assets in a taxable year of the foreign corporation, ordinarily determined based on fair market value and\naveraged quarterly over the year, including its pro rata share of the assets of any corporation in which it is considered to own at least 25% of the shares by\nvalue, are held for the production of, or produce, passive income. Passive income generally includes dividends, interest, rents and royalties (other than\ncertain rents or royalties derived from the active conduct of a trade or business) and gains from the disposition of passive assets.\nBased on the composition of our assets and the nature of the Company’s income and subsidiaries’ income for our taxable year ended December 31, 2021,\nwe do not expect to be treated as a PFIC for such year and we do not expect to be one for our taxable year ending December 31, 2022 or become one in the\nforeseeable future. Nevertheless, the application of the PFIC rules is subject to ambiguity in several respects and, in addition, we must make a separate\ndetermination each year as to whether we are a PFIC (after the close of each taxable year). Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will not be a PFIC\nfor the current or any other taxable year. Moreover, although we do not believe we would be treated as a PFIC, we have not engaged any U.S. tax advisers\nto determine our PFIC status. In addition, if a U.S. Holder owned our ordinary shares at any time prior to our acquisition of Elite, such U.S. Holder may be\nconsidered to own stock of a PFIC by virtue of the fact that we may have been a PFIC during the period prior to our acquisition of Elite, unless such U.S.\nHolder made either a valid and timely QEF election or a valid and timely mark-to-market election, in each case as described below.\nIf we are determined to be a PFIC for any taxable year (or portion thereof) that is included in the holding period of a U.S. Holder of our shares or\nredeemable warrants and, in the case of our shares, the U.S. Holder did not make either a timely qualified electing fund (“QEF”) election for our first\ntaxable year as a PFIC in which the U.S. Holder held (or was deemed to hold) such shares, a QEF election along with a purging election, or a mark-to-\nmarket election, each as described below, such holder generally will be subject to special rules for regular U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to:\n● any gain recognized by the U.S. Holder on the sale or other disposition of its shares or redeemable warrants; and\n● any “excess distribution” made to the U.S. Holder (generally, any distributions to such U.S. Holder during a taxable year of the U.S. Holder that\nare greater than 125% of the average annual distributions received by such U.S. Holder in respect of the shares or warrants during the three\npreceding taxable years of such U.S. Holder or, if shorter, such U.S. Holder’s holding period for the shares or warrants).\n45\nUnder these rules,\n● the U.S. Holder’s gain or excess distribution will be allocated ratably over the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the shares or redeemable warrants;\n● the amount allocated to the U.S. Holder’s taxable year in which the U.S. Holder recognized the gain or received the excess distribution, or to the\nperiod in the U.S. Holder’s holding period before the first day of our first taxable year in which we are a PFIC, will be taxed as ordinary income;\n● the amount allocated to other taxable years (or portions thereof) of the U.S. Holder and included in its holding period will be taxed at the highest\ntax rate in effect for that year and applicable to the U.S. Holder; and\n● the interest charge generally applicable to underpayments of tax will be imposed in respect of the tax attributable to each such other taxable year\nof the U.S. Holder.\nIn general, if we are determined to be a PFIC, a U.S. Holder may avoid the PFIC tax consequences described above in respect to our shares by making a\ntimely QEF election (or a QEF election along with a purging election, as described below). Pursuant to the QEF election, a U.S. Holder will be required to\ninclude in income its pro rata share of our net capital gains (as long-term capital gain) and other earnings and profits (as ordinary income), on a current\nbasis, in each case whether or not distributed, in the taxable year of the U.S. Holder in which or with which our taxable year ends. A U.S. Holder may make\na separate election to defer the payment of taxes on undistributed income inclusions under the QEF rules, but if deferred, any such taxes will be subject to\nan interest charge.\nA U.S. Holder may not make a QEF election with respect to its redeemable warrants. As a result, if a U.S. Holder sells or otherwise disposes of a\nredeemable warrant (other than upon exercise of the redeemable warrant), any gain recognized generally will be subject to the special tax and interest\ncharge rules treating the gain as an excess distribution, as described above, if we were a PFIC at any time during the period the U.S. Holder held the\nredeemable warrants. If a U.S. Holder that exercises such redeemable warrants properly makes a QEF election with respect to the newly acquired ordinary\nshares (or has previously made a QEF election with respect to our shares), the QEF election will apply to the newly acquired ordinary shares, but the\nadverse tax consequences relating to PFIC shares, adjusted to take into account the current income inclusions resulting from the QEF election, will\ncontinue to apply with respect to such newly acquired ordinary shares (which generally will be deemed to have a holding period for purposes of the PFIC\nrules that includes the period the U.S. Holder held the redeemable warrants), unless the U.S. Holder makes a purging election with respect to such shares.\nThe purging election creates a deemed sale of such shares at their fair market value. The gain recognized by the purging election will be subject to the\nspecial tax and interest charge rules treating the gain as an excess distribution, as described above. As a result of the purging election, the U.S. Holder will\nincrease the adjusted tax basis in its ordinary shares acquired upon the exercise of the redeemable warrants by the gain recognized and will also have a new\nholding period in such ordinary shares for purposes of the PFIC rules.\nThe QEF election is made on a shareholder-by-shareholder basis and, once made, can be revoked only with the consent of the IRS. A U.S. Holder generally\nmakes a QEF election by attaching a completed IRS Form 8621 (Information Return by a Shareholder of a Passive Foreign Investment Company or\nQualified Electing Fund), including the information provided in a PFIC annual information statement, to a timely filed U.S. federal income tax return for\nthe taxable year to which the election relates. Retroactive QEF elections generally may be made only by filing a protective statement with such return and if\ncertain other conditions are met or with the consent of the IRS.\nIn order to comply with the requirements of a QEF election, a U.S. Holder must receive certain information from us. Upon request from a U.S. Holder, we\nwill endeavor to provide to the U.S. Holder no later than 90 days after the request such information as the IRS may require, including a PFIC annual\ninformation statement, in order to enable the U.S. Holder to make and maintain a QEF election. However, there is no assurance that we will have timely\nknowledge of our status as a PFIC in the future or of the required information to be provided.\n46\nIf a U.S. Holder has made a QEF election with respect to our shares and the special tax and interest charge rules do not apply to such shares (because of a\ntimely QEF election for our first taxable year as a PFIC in which the U.S. Holder holds (or is deemed to hold) such shares or a QEF election, along with a\npurge of the PFIC taint pursuant to a purging election, as described above), any gain recognized on the sale or other taxable disposition of our shares\ngenerally will be taxable as capital gain and no interest charge will be imposed. As discussed above, for regular U.S. federal income tax purposes, U.S.\nHolders of a QEF are currently taxed on their pro rata shares of the QEF’s earnings and profits, whether or not distributed. In such case, a subsequent\ndistribution of such earnings and profits that were previously included in income generally should not be taxable as a dividend to such U.S. Holders. The\nadjusted tax basis of a U.S. Holder’s shares in a QEF will be increased by amounts that are included in income, and decreased by amounts distributed but\nnot taxed as dividends, under the above rules. Similar basis adjustments apply to property if by reason of holding such property the U.S. Holder is treated\nunder the applicable attribution rules as owning shares in a QEF.\nAlthough a determination as to our PFIC status will be made annually, the initial determination that we are a PFIC generally will apply for subsequent years\nto a U.S. Holder who held shares or redeemable warrants while we were a PFIC, whether or not we meet the test for PFIC status in those subsequent years,\nunless such U.S. Holder made a purging election as described below. A U.S. Holder who makes the QEF election discussed above for our first taxable year\nas a PFIC in which the U.S. Holder holds (or is deemed to hold) our shares, however, will not be subject to the PFIC tax and interest charge rules discussed\nabove in respect to such shares. In addition, such U.S. Holder will not be subject to the QEF inclusion regime with respect to such shares for any of our\ntaxable years that end within or with a taxable year of the U.S. Holder and in which we are not a PFIC. On the other hand, if the QEF election is not\neffective for each of our taxable years in which we are a PFIC and during which the U.S. Holder holds (or is deemed to hold) our shares, the PFIC rules\ndiscussed above will continue to apply to such shares unless the holder files on a timely filed U.S. income tax return (including extensions) a QEF election\nand a purging election to recognize under the rules of Section 1291 of the Code any gain that the U.S. Holder would otherwise recognize if the U.S. Holder\nhad sold our shares for their fair market value on the “qualification date.” The qualification date is the first day of our tax year in which we qualify as a\nQEF with respect to such U.S. Holder. The purging election can only be made if such U.S. Holder held our ordinary shares on the qualification date. The\ngain recognized by the purging election will be subject to the special tax and interest charge rules treating the gain as an excess distribution, as described\nabove. As a result of the purging election, the U.S. Holder will increase the adjusted tax basis in its ordinary shares by the amount of the gain recognized\nand will also have a new holding period in the shares for purposes of the PFIC rules.\nIf a U.S. Holder did not make a timely “mark-to-market” election (as described above), and if we were a PFIC at any time during the period such U.S.\nHolder held our ordinary shares, then such ordinary shares will continue to be treated as stock of a PFIC with respect to such U.S. Holder even if we cease\nto be a PFIC in a future year, unless such U.S. Holder makes a “purging election” for the year we cease to be a PFIC. A “purging election” creates a deemed\nsale of such ordinary shares at their fair market value on the last day of the last year in which we are treated as a PFIC. The gain recognized by the purging\nelection will be subject to the special tax and interest charge rules treating the gain as an excess distribution, as described above. As a result of the purging\nelection, such U.S. Holder will have a new tax basis (equal to the fair market value of the ordinary shares on the last day of the last year in which we are\ntreated as a PFIC) and tax holding period (which new holding period will begin the day after such last day) in such ordinary shares.\nAs an alternative to the QEF election, if a U.S. Holder, at the close of its taxable year, owns shares in a PFIC that are treated as marketable stock, the U.S.\nHolder may make a mark-to-market election with respect to such shares for such taxable year. If the U.S. Holder makes a valid mark-to-market election for\nthe first taxable year of the U.S. Holder in which the U.S. Holder holds (or is deemed to hold) our shares and for which we are determined to be a PFIC,\nsuch holder generally will not be subject to the PFIC rules described above in respect to its shares. Instead, in general, the U.S. Holder will include as\nordinary income each year the excess, if any, of the fair market value of its shares at the end of its taxable year over the adjusted tax basis in its shares. The\nU.S. Holder also will be allowed to take an ordinary loss in respect of the excess, if any, of the adjusted tax basis of its shares over the fair market value of\nits shares at the end of its taxable year (but only to the extent of the net amount of previously included income as a result of the mark-to-market election).\nThe U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in its shares will be adjusted to reflect any such income or loss amounts, and any further gain recognized on a sale or\nother taxable disposition of the shares will be treated as ordinary income. Currently, a mark-to-market election may not be made with respect to our\nredeemable warrants.\n47\nThe mark-to-market election is available only for stock that is regularly traded on a national securities exchange that is registered with the Securities and\nExchange Commission, including the NASDAQ Capital Market, or on a foreign exchange or market that the IRS determines has rules sufficient to ensure\nthat the market price represents a legitimate and sound fair market value. Although our ordinary shares are listed and traded on the NASDAQ Capital\nMarket, we cannot guarantee that our shares will continue to be listed and traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market. U.S. Holders should consult their own\ntax advisors regarding the availability and tax consequences of a mark-to-market election in respect to our shares under their particular circumstances.\nIf we are a PFIC and, at any time, have a foreign subsidiary that is classified as a PFIC, a U.S. Holder generally would be deemed to own a portion of the\nshares of such lower-tier PFIC, and generally could incur liability for the deferred tax and interest charge described above if we receive a distribution from,\nor dispose of all or part of our interest in, or the U.S. Holder otherwise were deemed to have disposed of an interest in, the lower-tier PFIC. Upon request,\nwe will endeavor to cause any lower-tier PFIC to provide to a U.S. Holder no later than 90 days after the request the information that may be required to\nmake or maintain a QEF election with respect to the lower-tier PFIC. However, there is no assurance that we will have timely knowledge of the status of\nany such lower-tier PFIC, and we do not plan to make annual determinations or otherwise notify U.S. Holders of the PFIC status of any such lower-tier\nPFIC. There also is no assurance that we will be able to cause the lower-tier PFIC to provide the required information. U.S. Holders are urged to consult\ntheir own tax advisors regarding the tax issues raised by lower-tier PFICs.\nA U.S. Holder that owns (or is deemed to own) shares in a PFIC during any taxable year of the U.S. Holder may have to file an IRS Form 8621 (whether or\nnot a QEF election or mark-to-market election is or has been made) with such U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax return and provide such other\ninformation as may be required by the U.S. Treasury Department.\nThe rules dealing with PFICs and with the QEF and mark-to-market elections are very complex and are affected by various factors in addition to those\ndescribed above. Accordingly, U.S. Holders of our shares and redeemable warrants should consult their own tax advisors concerning the application of the\nPFIC rules to our shares and redeemable warrants under their particular circumstances.\nNon-U.S. Holders\nDividends (including constructive dividends) paid or deemed paid to a Non-U.S. Holder in respect to our securities generally will not be subject to U.S.\nfederal income tax, unless the dividends are effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business within the United States (and,\nif required by an applicable income tax treaty, are attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base that such holder maintains or maintained in the\nUnited States).\nIn addition, a Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain attributable to a sale or other taxable disposition of our\nsecurities unless such gain is effectively connected with its conduct of a trade or business in the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax\ntreaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base that such holder maintains or maintained in the United States) or the Non-U.S. Holder is an\nindividual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of sale or other disposition and certain other conditions are met (in\nwhich case, such gain from U.S. sources generally is subject to U.S. federal income tax at a 30% rate or a lower applicable tax treaty rate).\nDividends and gains that are effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the United States (and, if required by an\napplicable income tax treaty, are attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base that such holder maintains or maintained in the United States)\ngenerally will be subject to regular U.S. federal income tax at the same regular U.S. federal income tax rates applicable to a comparable U.S. Holder and, in\nthe case of a Non-U.S. Holder that is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, may also be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a 30%\nrate or a lower applicable tax treaty rate.\nThe U.S. federal income tax treatment of a Non-U.S. Holder’s exercise of redeemable warrants, or the lapse of redeemable warrants held by a Non-U.S.\nHolder, generally will correspond to the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the exercise or lapse of redeemable warrants by a U.S. Holder, as described\nunder “U.S. Holders — Exercise or Lapse of Redeemable Warrants” above.\n48\nBackup Withholding and Information Reporting\nIn general, information reporting for U.S. federal income tax purposes should apply to distributions made on our securities within the United States to a\nU.S. Holder (other than an exempt recipient) and to the proceeds from sales and other dispositions of our securities by a U.S. Holder (other than an exempt\nrecipient) to or through a U.S. office of a broker. Payments made (and sales and other dispositions effected at an office) outside the United States will be\nsubject to information reporting in limited circumstances. In addition, certain information concerning a U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in its securities and\nadjustments to that tax basis and whether any gain or loss with respect to such securities is long-term or short-term also may be required to be reported to\nthe IRS, and certain holders may be required to file an IRS Form 8938 (Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets) to report their interest in our\nsecurities.\nMoreover, backup withholding of U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 28% generally will apply to dividends paid on our securities to a U.S. Holder (other\nthan an exempt recipient) and the proceeds from sales and other dispositions of shares or warrants by a U.S. Holder (other than an exempt recipient), in\neach case who\n● fails to provide an accurate taxpayer identification number;\n● is notified by the IRS that backup withholding is required; or\n● in certain circumstances, fails to comply with applicable certification requirements.\nA Non-U.S. Holder generally may eliminate the requirement for information reporting and backup withholding by providing certification of its foreign\nstatus, under penalties of perjury, on a duly executed applicable IRS Form W-8 or by otherwise establishing an exemption. Backup withholding is not an\nadditional tax. Rather, the amount of any backup withholding will be allowed as a credit against a U.S. Holder’s or a Non-U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal\nincome tax liability and may entitle such holder to a refund, provided that certain required information is timely furnished to the IRS. Holders are urged to\nconsult their own tax advisors regarding the application of backup withholding and the availability of and procedures for obtaining an exemption from\nbackup withholding in their particular circumstances.\nF.

Subsidiary Information\nNot applicable.\n49\nITEM 11. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe deposit any surplus funds with Chinese banks earning daily interest. We do not invest in any instruments for trading purposes. Our operations generally\nare not directly sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates and we currently do not have any long-term debt outstanding. Management monitors the banks’\nprime rates in conjunction with our cash requirements to determine the appropriate level of debt balances relative to other sources of funds. We have not\nentered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to interest rate risk.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nThe reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, but the Group has a subsidiary in China primarily involved in the administration and accounting functions of the\nGroup. Its operating expenses are denominated in RMB and its annual expenditure is in the region of RMB 2 million. There is exposure to the fluctuations\nin the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the RMB but its impact on our results is considered minimal given the current level of expenditure.\nThe value of RMB against the U.S. dollar and other currencies is affected by, among other things, changes in China’s political and economic conditions.\nSince July 2005, RMB has not been pegged to the U.S. dollar. Although the People’s Bank of China regularly intervenes in the foreign exchange market to\nprevent significant short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate, RMB may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the U.S. dollar in the\nmedium to long term. Moreover, it is possible that in the future, PRC authorities may lift restrictions on fluctuations in RMB exchange rate and lessen\nintervention in the foreign exchange market.\nInflation\nInflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results. Although we do not believe\nthat inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse\neffect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues if the selling\nprices of our products do not increase with these increased costs.\nITEM 12.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of December 31, 2022 our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls\nand procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the year covered by this report. Disclosure controls\nand procedure include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the\nreports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management as appropriate to allow timely\ndecisions regarding required disclosure. Our Management is responsible for monitoring the process pursuant to which information is gathered and\nanalyzing such information to determine the extent to which such information requires disclosure, in the reports filed with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission.\nBased on such evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that as of December 31, 2022, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were\nineffective due to the Company’s lacks of formal documented controls and procedures applicable to all officers and directors to disclose the required\ninformation under the Exchange Act.\nWe have appointed outside independent directors, established board committees, strengthened the financial personnel and introduced written policies and\nprocedures.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting\nis defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act. It is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s\nprincipal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company’s board of directors, management and other personnel. The objective is to\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance\nwith accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that:\n● Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the\ncompany;\n● Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made\nonly in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and\n● Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets\nthat could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore,\neven those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.\nBecause of the inherent limitations of internal control, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the\ninternal controls over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible\nto design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.\n51\nAs December 31, 2022 management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal\ncontrol over financial reporting established in by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission’s 2013 Internal Control\nIntegrated Framework and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. Based on that evaluation, they concluded that, during the period covered by this\nreport, such internal controls and procedures were not effective to detect the inappropriate application of US GAAP rules. This was primarily due to\ndeficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls. These\ndeficiencies may be considered to be material weaknesses.\nIdentified Material Weakness\nA material weakness in internal control over financial reporting is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a\nremote likelihood that a material misstatement of the financial statements will not be prevented or detected.\nManagement identified the following material weaknesses during its assessment of internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022:\n(1) A lack of understanding of the requirements of NASDAQ, made worse by a poor or no command of the English language\n(2) Mining records were not kept to the required standard and were not updated due to a lack of understanding of the various monitoring links and\nplatforms. Reconciliation of differences were not satisfactorily completed\n(3) There was no fixed ledger showing all the relevant details of the assets of the Company.\n(4) Past consolidation adjustments were not fully explained and there was too much reliance on memorandum records and reconciliations.\nAs a result of the material weaknesses described above, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by COSO (2013 framework).\nHowever, management does not believe that any of our annual or interim financial statements issued to date contain a material misstatement as a result of\nthe aforementioned weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement’s Remediation Initiatives\nTo mediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies, we have introduced the following measures:\n(1) Continue to educate senior management on the continuing listing requirements of NASDAQ\n(2) Design and monitor controls over financial reporting, including the documentation of various checks and balances to monitor and reconcile\ndifferences in mining revenue.\n(3) A Fixed Asset Register is now maintained to improve documentation and physical custody of the Company’s assets.\n(4) There is now a proper record of all consolidation adjustments with supporting journals and records\nChanges in internal controls over financial reporting\nExcept as described above, there have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this\nReport that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.\nITEM 16.

CHANGE IN REGISTRANT’S CERTIFYING ACCOUNTANT\nEffective June 30, 2022, the Registrant has appointed Audit Alliance LLP (“Audit Alliance”) as its independent registered public accounting firm\nfor the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 and accepted the resignation of the Registrant’s previous independent auditor, Centurion ZD & Co.\n(“Centurion”), effective on the same date. Audit Alliance is headquartered in Singapore and will be subject to the inspections by the Public Company\nAccounting Oversight Board of the United States. The appointment of Audit Alliance was made after careful consideration and evaluation by the Registrant\nand has been approved by the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors of the Registrant.\nDuring the Registrant’s two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 and September 30, 2020, through the resignation of\nCenturion on June 30, 2022, there were no disagreements between the Registrant or its predecessor, Moxian, Inc., and Centurion on any matter of\naccounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of\nCenturion, would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in connection with its report on the Registrant’s or its\npredecessor’s consolidated financial statements for such periods. In addition, Centurion’s reports on the financial statements as of and for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020 and September 30, 2020 did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to\nuncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 and September 30, 2020 through the\nresignation of Centurion on June 30, 2022, there were no “reportable events” as that term is defined in Item 16F(a)(1)(v) of Form 20-F.\nDuring the two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 and September 30, 2020 and any subsequent interim period prior to\nengaging Audit Alliance, neither the Registrant nor anyone on its behalf consulted Audit Alliance regarding either (i) the application of accounting\nprinciples to any proposed or completed transaction, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Registrant’s financial statements, and neither\na written report nor oral advice was provided to the Registrant that Audit Alliance concluded was an important factor considered by the Registrant in\nreaching a decision as to any accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement (as defined in\nItem 16F(a)(1)(iv) of Form 20-F and the related instructions to Item 16F of Form 20-F) or a reportable event.\nITEM 16G.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the\nfinancial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial\nstatements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB)\nand are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations\nof the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor\nwere we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of\ninternal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and\nperforming procedures that respond to those risks.

The assessment of\nloss allowance requires significant judgement. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with\nforming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The recoverable amount is determined based on the cash-generating-unit (CGU) to\nwhich the asset belongs. For each reporting period, management reviews the recoverable amount using discounted cash flows and determine if impairment\nis required. The assessment of the impairment requires significant judgement.

The management of the Company has estimated an allowance accrued for CECL of $1,181,916 for the year\nended December 31, 2021, on accounts receivables, based on the credit risk of the respective receivables. The allowance amount has been measured as the\ndifference of the asset’s carrying amount and the estimates of present value of future cash flows based on the historical experience, current conditions, and\nreasonable and supportable forecasts.\nWe have identified allowance for CECL on accounts receivable as a critical audit matter due to the involvement of subjective judgment and management\nestimates in evaluating the CECL of these receivable items, and the significance to the Company’s consolidated financial position.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements. Our audit procedures to respond the risk of error in the allowance for CECL included (i) obtaining an understanding and assessing\nmanagement’s method for developing the allowance for doubtful accounts (credit losses); (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the model, by reviewing the\ncalculation schedules prepared by the management; (iii) testing the accuracy of management’s basic input in calculating CECL including aging report,\nhistorical write-offs and recoveries, on a sample basis; (iv) independently evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions and judgments made by\nmanagement to estimate the allowance for credit loss, including the Company’s assessment on significant factors, and the basis of estimated loss rates\napplied with reference to historical default rates and forward-looking information; (v) sending confirmations to debtors to confirm the accuracy of the basic\ninformation and terms of the loan receivables; (vi) performing credit review with both individual and corporation borrowers of significant loan receivables,\nto assess the borrowers’ capability and willing to repay the debt; and (vii) evaluating the competence, capabilities and objectivity of the professionals\nengaged by the Company.\n/s/ Centurion ZD CPA & Co\nCenturion ZD CPA & Co.\nHong Kong\nMay 13, 2022\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2018\nF-2\nMOXIAN (BVI) INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nAs of\nDecember 31, December 31,\nNote 2022 2021\nASSETS\nProperty, equipment and vehicles 4 $ 12,553,408 $ -\nDigital assets 7,087,747 5,000,000\nCurrent Assets\nCash and cash equivalents 2,505,286 2,507,404\nAccount receivable -

Organization and nature of operations\nThe Company was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands (BVI) on May 18, 2021. On August 17, 2021, the Company completed a redomicile merger\nwith its predecessor company, Moxian, Inc, wherein it acquired all the assets, liabilities, rights, obligations and operations of the latter and its subsidiaries,\nthrough an exchange of an identical number of shares.\nOn December 28, 2021 in a Special Meeting of shareholders, the Company approved the issue of up to 20 million new ordinary shares of the Company, at a\nprice of $2.50 per share to certain non-US based accredited investors. On February 11, 2022 the Company completed this private placement and issued 16\nmillion new shares, raising $40 million, which it would use in bitcoin mining in order to diversify its business operations. Of the issue proceeds, $29.8\nmillion was used to purchase and ship relevant equipment from China and the balance deployed as working capital.\nOn March 5, 2022 a number of machines were installed and operational at a site near Buffalo in New York State, USA. The bulk of the equipment was\nshipped to Columbus in the State of Georgia and mining commenced in late May. However, due to poor prices for bitcoin and high electricity charges,\nmining operations ceased temporarily at both sides by June 2022 whilst efforts intensified in the search for a more cost-effective site.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the activities of the Company and each of the following entities:\nName of entity Background Ownership\nAbit Hong Kong Limited (formerly known as Investment Holding 100% owned by Moxian (BVI) Inc\nWoodland Corporation Limited)\nAbit USA, Inc. Bitcoin Mining 100% owned by Abit Hong Kong Limited\nBeijing Bitmatrix Technology Co. Ltd In-house Support Services 100% owned by Abit Hong Kong Limited\n2. Summary of principal accounting policies\nBasis of presentation and consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in\nthe United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and include all the subsidiaries of the Group. The financial year-end of the Company is December 31. The\nconsolidated results are presented as of the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. All intercompany transactions and balances have been\neliminated in the consolidation.\nFair value of financial instruments\nThe Company follows the provisions of ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.” ASC 820 clarifies the definition of fair value, prescribes\nmethods for measuring fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:\nLevel 1-Observable inputs such as unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date.\nLevel 2-Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and\nliabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market\ndata.\nLevel 3-Inputs are unobservable inputs that reflect management’s assumptions based on the best available information.\nThe carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, prepayments, deposits and other receivables, accruals and other payables, loans from related parties and\nunrelated party approximate their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments.\nF-7\nMOXIAN (BVI) INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n2. Summary of principal accounting policies (continued)\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the accompanying consolidated\nfinancial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates required to be made by\nmanagement include but not limited to, useful lives of property and equipment, provision for doubtful accounts, intangible assets valuation, inventory\nvaluation, value added recoverable valuation and deferred tax assets valuation. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash includes cash on hand and demand deposits in accounts maintained with commercial banks. The Company considers all highly liquid investment\ninstruments with an original maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.\nThe Company considers all short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and have original maturities of three\nmonths or less to be cash equivalents.\nPrepayments, deposits and other receivables\nPrepayments and deposits represent amounts advanced to suppliers. The suppliers usually require advance payments or deposits when the Company makes\npurchase or orders service and the prepayments and deposits will be utilized to offset the Company’s future payments. Other receivables mainly consist of\nvarious cash advances to employees for business needs. These amounts are unsecured, non-interest bearing and generally short-term in nature.\nAllowances are recorded when utilization and collection of amounts due are in doubt. Delinquent prepayments, deposits and other receivables are written-\noff after management has determined that the likelihood of utilization or collection is not probable and known bad debts are written off against the\nallowances when identified.\nProperty, Equipment and Vehicles, net\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Significant additions or improvements extending useful lives\nof assets are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line\nmethod over the estimated useful lives as follows:\nElectronic and mining equipment 3-6 years\nFurniture and fixtures 3-6 years\nLeasehold improvements Shorter of estimated useful life or term of lease\nVehicles 3 years\nIntangible assets, net\nIntangible assets, comprising Intellectual property rights (“IP rights”) and software, which are separable from property and equipment, are stated at cost\nless accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of 3- 10 years.\nF-8\nMOXIAN (BVI) INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nThe Company classifies its long-lived assets into: (i) computer and office equipment; (ii) furniture and fixtures, (iii) leasehold improvements, and (iv)\nfinite-lived intangible assets.\nLong-lived assets held and used by the Company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value\nof such assets may not be fully recoverable. It is possible that these assets could become impaired as a result of technology, economy or other industry\nchanges. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group to be tested for possible impairment, the Company first compares undiscounted cash\nflows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset or asset group is not\nrecoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Fair value is\ndetermined through various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models, relief from royalty income approach, quoted market values and\nthird-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary.\nThe Company makes various assumptions and estimates regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair values of the\nrespective assets. The assumptions and estimates used to determine future values and remaining useful lives of long-lived assets are complex and\nsubjective. They can be affected by various factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as the\nCompany’s business strategy and its forecasts for specific market expansion.\nDigital assets\nDigital assets (including USDC) are included in current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Digital assets purchased are recorded at\ncost and digital assets awarded to the Company through its mining activities are accounted for in connection with the Company’s revenue recognition\npolicy disclosed below.\nDigital assets held are accounted for as intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized but\nassessed for impairment annually, or more frequently, when events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that it is more likely than not that the\nindefinite-lived asset is impaired. Impairment exists when the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, which is measured using the quoted price of the\ndigital assets at the time its fair value is being measured. In testing for impairment, the Company has the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to\ndetermine whether it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. If it is determined that it is not more likely than not that an impairment exists, a\nquantitative impairment test is not necessary. If the Company concludes otherwise, it is required to perform a quantitative impairment test. To the extent an\nimpairment loss is recognized, the loss establishes the new cost basis of the asset. Subsequent reversal of impairment losses is not permitted.\nPurchases of digital assets by the Company, if any, will be included within investing activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows,\nwhile digital assets awarded to the Company through its mining activities are included within operating activities on the accompanying consolidated\nstatements of cash flows. The sales of digital assets are included within investing activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows and\nany realized gains or losses from such sales are included in “realized gain (loss) on exchange of digital assets” in the consolidated statements of operations\nand comprehensive income (loss). The Company accounts for its gains or losses in accordance with the first-in first-out method of accounting.\nF-9\nMOXIAN (BVI) INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nRevenue recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”).\nThe Company has entered into digital asset mining pools by executing contracts with mining pool operators to provide computing power to the mining\npool. The Company’s enforceable right to compensation begins only when, and lasts as long as, the Company provides computing power to the mining pool\noperator and is created as power is provided over time. The only consideration due to the Company relates to the provision of computing power. The\ncontracts are terminable at any time by and at no cost to the Company, and by the pool operator under certain conditions specified in the contract. Providing\ncomputing power in digital asset transaction verification services is an output of the Company’s ordinary activities. Providing such computing power is the\nonly performance obligation in the Company’s contracts with mining pool operators.\nThe transaction consideration the Company receives, if any, is noncash consideration in the form of bitcoin. Changes in the fair value of the noncash\nconsideration due to form of the consideration (changes in the market price of Bitcoin) are not included in the transaction price and therefore, are not\nincluded in revenue. Certain mining pool operators charge fees to cover the costs of maintaining the pool and are deducted from amounts we may otherwise\nearn and are treated as a reduction to the consideration received. Fees fluctuate and historically have been no more than approximately 2% per reward\nearned, on average.\nIn exchange for providing computing power, the Company is entitled to either:\na Full-Pay-Per-Share pay out of bitcoin based on a contractual formula, which primarily calculates the hash rate provided by the Company to the mining\npool as a percentage of total network hash rate, and other inputs. The Company is entitled to consideration even if a block is not successfully placed by the\nmining pool operator. The contract is in effect until terminated by either party.\nThe consideration is all variable. Because it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue will not occur and the Company is able to calculate\nthe payout based on the contractual formula, noncash revenue is estimated and recognized based on the spot price of Bitcoin determined using the\nCompany’s primary trading platform for bitcoin at the inception of each contract, whichis determined to be daily. Noncash consideration is measured at fair\nvalue at contract inception. Fair value of the crypto asset consideration is determined using the quoted price on the Company’s primary trading platform for\nbitcoin at the beginning of the contract period at the single bitcoin level (one bitcoin). This amount is estimated and recognized in revenue upon inception,\nwhich is when hash rate is provided.\nOr:\na fractional share of the fixed Bitcoin award the mining pool operator receives (less digital asset transaction fees to the mining pool operator which are\nimmaterial and are recorded as a deduction from revenue) for successfully adding a block to the blockchain based on a proportion of the Company’s\n“scoring hash rate” to the pool’s “scoring hash rate” where the scoring hash rate as defined by the pool is the exponential moving average of the hash power\ncontributed by the Company or by all pool members combined. The Company’s fractional share of the bitcoin reward is based on the proportion of\ncomputing power the Company contributed to the mining pool operator to the total computing power contributed by all mining pool participants in solving\nthe current algorithm.\nIncome taxes\nThe Company utilizes ASC Topic 740 (“ASC 740”) “Income taxes”, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected\nfuture tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred income taxes\nare recognized for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at\neach period end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.\nValuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nASC 740 “Income taxes” clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. This interpretation requires that an entity recognizes in the financial\nstatements the impact of a tax position, if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the\nposition. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or\nmeasurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company has elected to classify interest and penalties related to\nunrecognized tax benefits, if and when required, as part of income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company evaluate the\nlevel of authority for each uncertain tax position (including the potential application of interest and penalties) based on the technical merits, and measure\nthe unrecognized benefits associated with the tax positions. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company did not have any unrecognized\ntax benefits. The Company does not anticipate any significant increase to its liability for unrecognized tax benefit within the next 12 months.\nF-10\nMOXIAN (BVI) INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nForeign currency transactions and translation\nThe reporting currency of the Company is United States Dollars (the “USD”).\nFor financial reporting purposes, the financial statements of the foreign-incorporated subsidiaries are prepared using their respective functional currencies,\nand then translated into the reporting currency, USD so to be consolidated with the Company’s. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies\nother than the reporting currency are translated into the reporting currency at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses\nare translated using average rates prevailing during the reporting period. Adjustments resulting from the translation are recorded as a separate component of\naccumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ deficiency. Translation losses are recognized in the statements of operations and comprehensive\nloss.\nThe exchange rates applied are as follows:\nDecember 31, December 31,\nBalance sheet items, except for equity accounts 2022 2021\nRMB:USD 6.8979 6.3559\nHKD:USD 7.7990 7.7992\nItems in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss, and statements cash flows:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2022 2021\nRMB:USD 6.8979 6.4525\nHKD:USD 7.7959 7.7727\nEarnings per share\nBasic gain per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period while the effects of potential common\nshares outstanding during the period are included in diluted earnings per share.\nFASB Accounting Standard Codification Topic 260 (“ASC 260”), “Earnings Per Share,” requires that employee equity share options, non-vested shares and\nsimilar equity instruments granted to employees be treated as potential common shares in computing diluted earnings per share. Diluted earnings per share\nshould be based on the actual number of options or shares granted and not yet forfeited, unless doing so would be anti-dilutive. The Company uses the\n“treasury stock” method for equity instruments granted in share-based payment transactions provided in ASC 260 to determine diluted earnings per share.\nAntidilutive securities represent potentially dilutive securities which are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings or loss per share as their impact\nwas antidilutive.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Company continually assesses any new accounting pronouncements to determine their applicability. When it is determined that a new accounting\npronouncement affects the Company’s financial reporting, the Company undertakes a study to determine the consequences of the change to its consolidated\nfinancial statements and assures that there are proper controls in place to ascertain that the Company’s consolidated financial statements properly reflect the\nchange.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement\nof Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which was codified with its subsequent amendments as Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 326,\nFinancial Instruments – Credit Losses (“ASC 326”). ASC 326 seeks to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the\nexpected credit losses on financial instruments, including trade receivables, and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each\nreporting date. The amendments require an entity to replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in other GAAP with a methodology that reflects\ncurrent expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. The\nupdated guidance is effective for the Company for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022, and early adoption is permitted. In\nconnection with the Company’s acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company adopted this standard on January 1,2021 and the\nadoption did not have a material impact on the financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (“ASU 2019-12”), which is\nintended to simplify various aspects related to accounting for income taxes. ASU 2019-12 removes certain exceptions to the general principles in ASC\nTopic 740 and also clarifies and amends existing guidance to improve consistent application. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods\nwithin those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2020 and\nthe adoption did not have a material impact on the financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn May 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-04, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt-Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50),Compensation-\nStock Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40), (“ASU 2021-04”).This ASU reduces\ndiversity in an issuer’s accounting for modifications or exchanges of freestanding equity-classified written call options (for example, warrants) that remain\nequity classified after modification or exchange. This ASU provides guidance for a modification or an exchange of a freestanding equity-classified written\ncall option that is not within the scope of another Topic. It specifically addresses: (1) how an entity should treat a modification of the terms or conditions or\nan exchange of a freestanding equity-classified written call option that remains equity classified after modification or exchange; (2) how an entity should\nmeasure the effect of a modification or an exchange of a freestanding equity-classified written call option that remains equity classified after modification\nor exchange; and (3) how an entity should recognize the effect of a modification or an exchange of a freestanding equity-classified written call option that\nremains equity classified after modification or exchange. This ASU will be effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. An\nentity should apply the amendments prospectively to modifications or exchanges occurring on or after the effective date of the amendments. Early adoption\nis permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The adoption of ASU 2021-04 on January 1, 2022 did not have a material impact on the Company’s\nfinancial statements.\nThe Company’s management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, authoritative guidance, if currently adopted, would have\na material impact on the Company’s financial statement presentation or disclosures.\nF-11\nMOXIAN (BVI) INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n3.

Divestment of a subsidiary\nIn July 2022, the Company divested its entire interest in Moxian (Hong Kong) Limited, a holding company with interests in several wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries in Shenzhen, Beijing, Shanghai and Malaysia as well as a variable entity in Shenzhen for a consideration of HK$1,000. The wholly-owned\nsubsidiary companies as well as the variable interest entity had been largely dormant since September 2018. The directors consider this divestment to be in\nthe best interests of the Company as it has decided to pursue other business opportunities which are based outside the People’s Republic of China. The\ndivested company and its subsidiary companies have had many years of losses since their inception and have gradually ceased business operations because\nof a lack of working capital, little or no market penetration and high competitive pressure.\nThe gains on this divestment is stated after accounting for the interest in Moxian (Hong Kong) which is the funding vehicle through which advances had\nbeen made for the working capital requirements of the subsidiaries and the variable interest entity, less the consolidation of past losses in its financial\nstatements. In a related development, the Company also wrote off its carrying value in its entire interest in Moxian CN Group China Limited, the holding\ncompany of Moxian (Hong Kong) Limited as there was no longer any purpose to retain the company.\nDetails of the transaction:\nGain on divestment of the interest in Moxian (Hong Kong) Limited $ 406,938\nWrite-off of the cost of investment in Moxian CN China Limited (1,000,001)\n8. Income taxes\nThe Company and its subsidiaries file separate income tax returns.\nThe United States of America\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”) was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code.\nChanges include, but are not limited to, a U.S. corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the\ntransition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed\nrepatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017. As the Company has a September 30 fiscal year-end, the lower corporate income tax\nrate will be phased in, resulting in a U.S. statutory federal rate of approximately 24.5% for our fiscal year ending September 30, 2018, and 21% for\nsubsequent fiscal years. Accordingly, we have to remeasure our deferred tax assets on net operating loss carryforward in the U.S. at the lower enacted\ncooperated tax rate of 21%. However, this re-measurement has no effect on the Company’s income tax expenses as the Company has provided a 100%\nvaluation allowance on its deferred tax assets previously.\nAdditionally, the Tax Act imposes a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of historical earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and future foreign earnings\nare subject to U.S. taxation. The change in rate has caused us to remeasure all U.S. deferred income tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences and\nnet operating loss (NOL) carryforwards and recorded a one-time income tax payable in 8 years.\nABit USA, Inc was incorporated by statutory conversion in the State of Delaware on April 28, 2022. It was previously known as Watercool Asset\nManagement LLC.\nBritish Virgin Islands\nMoxian BVI is incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. Under the current laws of the British Virgin Islands, Moxian BVI is not subject to tax on income\nor capital gains. In addition, upon payments of dividends by Moxian BVI, no British Virgin Islands withholding tax is imposed.\nHong Kong\nABit Hong Kong is incorporated in the Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong where the profits tax rate is 16.5%. It has not commenced business\noperations and did earn any income that was derived in Hong Kong for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.\nPRC\nEffective from January 1, 2008, the PRC’s statutory income tax rate is 25%. The Company’s sole PRC subsidiary, Beijing Bitmatrix Technology Co. Ltd.\nhas not operated any business since inception but provides administrative and accounting services to the Group.\n9. Commitments and contingencies\nOperating Lease\nCurrently, the Company has no property under an operating lease.\nAs noted in Note 5, the Company has an irrevocable order for some equipment which it has already paid a deposit equivalent to about 50% of the cost. The\ntotal cost of the purchase order is $5,272,500 and the balance, net of purchase credits, will be progressively paid upon delivery by December 2023.\n10. Subsequent events\n(a) In April 2023, the Company signed an agreement to acquire a piece of property in Duff, near La Follette in the State of Tennessee for a\nconsideration of $1.2 million. It subsequently awarded a construction management agreement for $1.6 million for the construction of a mining\ncenter which is scheduled for completion in August 2023. Other relevant equipment, including transformers and switchgear, have been acquired\nand a supply contract with the local utility board is under negotiation as of the date of this report.\n(b) The Company has negotiated to take up a joint-venture in bitcoin mining in Kazakhstan where its initial investment will be less than $0.5 million.\nF-13\nExhibit 2.2\nDescription of Securities\nRegistered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\nAs of December 31, 2022, Moxian (BVI) Inc (“Moxian BVI,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our”) had one class of securities registered\npursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as follows:\nTitle of each class Symbol Name of each exchange on which registered\nOrdinary shares, par value $0.001 per share MOXC Nasdaq Capital Market\nOrdinary Shares\nUnder our memorandum and articles of association, as amended, the Company is authorized to issue a maximum of 200,000,000 shares,\ncomprising: (i) 150,000,000 ordinary shares of par value US$0.001 each and (ii) 50,000,000 preferred shares of par value US$0.00101 each. As of\nDecember 31, 2022, a total of 35,554,677 ordinary shares were issued and outstanding and 5,000,000 preferred shares issued and outstanding. The ordinary\nshares are registered for trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the trading symbol “MOXC.”\nCapitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings given to them in the annual report on Form 20-F.\nThis Exhibit sets forth a description of our ordinary shares and certain provisions of our memorandum and articles of association which are\nsummaries and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, which\nwas previously filed as Exhibit 99.1 to the Company’s current report on Form 6-K on December 6, 2021 (referred to hereafter as our “Memorandum and\nArticles”).\nDividend Distributions\nThe holders of our ordinary shares are entitled to such dividends as may be declared by our board of directors subject to the BVI Business\nCompanies Act. The holders of our preferred shares have no right to share in any dividend paid by the Company and no right to share in the distribution of\nthe surplus assets of the Company on its liquidation.\nVoting rights\nAny action required or permitted to be taken by the shareholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of the shareholders\nentitled to vote on such action and may be effected by a resolution in writing. At each shareholder’s meeting, each shareholder who is present in person or\nby proxy (or, in the case of a shareholder being a corporation, by its duly authorized representative) will be entitled to one vote for each ordinary share\nwhich such shareholder holds and be entitled to three votes for each preferred share which such shareholder holds on all matters subject to vote at each\nshareholders’ meeting of the Company.\nElection of directors\nDelaware law permits cumulative voting for the election of directors only if expressly authorized in the certificate of incorporation. The laws of\nthe British Virgin Islands, however, do not specifically prohibit or restrict the creation of cumulative voting rights for the election of our directors.\nCumulative voting is not a concept that is accepted as a common practice in the British Virgin Islands, and we have made no provisions in our\nmemorandum and articles of association to allow cumulative voting for elections of directors.\nMeetings\nWe must provide written notice of all meetings of shareholders, stating the time, place and, in the case of a special meeting of shareholders, the\npurpose or purposes thereof, at least 7 days before the date of the proposed meeting to those persons whose names appear as shareholders in the register of\nmembers on the date of the notice and are entitled to vote at the meeting. Our board of directors shall call a special meeting upon the written request of\nshareholders holding at least 30% of our outstanding voting shares. In addition, our board of directors may call a special meeting of shareholders on its own\nmotion. A meeting of shareholders held in contravention of the requirement to give notice is valid if shareholders holding at least 90 percent of the total\nvoting rights on all the matters to be considered at the meeting have waived notice of the meeting and, for this purpose, the presence of a shareholder at the\nmeeting shall constitute waiver in relation to all the shares which that shareholder holds.\nThe management of us is entrusted to our board of directors, who will make corporate decisions by board resolution. Our directors are free to meet\nat such times and in such manner and places within or outside the BVI as the directors determine to be necessary or desirable. A 3 days’ notice of a meeting\nof directors must be given. At any meeting of directors, a quorum will be present if half of the total number of directors is present, unless there are only 2\ndirectors in which case the quorum is 2. If a quorum is not present, the meeting will be dissolved. If a quorum is present, votes of half of present directors\nare required to pass a resolution of directors.\nAs few as one third of our outstanding shares may be sufficient to hold a shareholder meeting. Although our memorandum and articles of\nassociation require that holders of at least one-third of our outstanding shares appear in person or by proxy to hold a shareholder meeting, to the extent we\nfail to have quorum on this initial meeting date, we can reschedule the meeting for the next business day or later, at which second meeting the holders of\none third or more of our outstanding shares will constitute a quorum. As mentioned, at the initial date set for any meeting of shareholders, a quorum will be\npresent if there are shareholders present in person or by proxy representing not less than one-third of the issued Ordinary Shares entitled to vote on the\nresolutions to be considered at the meeting. A quorum may comprise a single shareholder or proxy and then such person may pass a resolution of\nshareholders and a certificate signed by such person accompanied where such person be a proxy by a copy of the proxy instrument shall constitute a valid\nresolution of shareholder. If within two hours from the time appointed for the meeting a quorum is not present, the meeting, if convened upon the\nrequisition of shareholders, shall be dissolved; in any other case it shall stand adjourned to the next business day in the jurisdiction in which the meeting\nwas to have been held at the same time and place or to such other time and place as the directors may determine, and if at the adjourned meeting there are\npresent within one hour from the time appointed for the meeting in person or by proxy not less than one third of the votes of the shares or each class or\nseries of shares entitle to vote on the matter to be considered by the meeting, those present shall constitute a quorum but otherwise the meeting shall be\ndissolved. No business may be transacted at any general meeting unless a quorum is present at the commencement of business. If present, the chair of our\nboard of directors shall be the chair presiding at any meeting of the shareholders.\nA corporation that is a shareholder shall be deemed for the purpose of our memorandum and articles of association to be present in person if\nrepresented by its duly authorized representative. This duly authorized representative shall be entitled to exercise the same powers on behalf of the\ncorporation which he represents as that corporation could exercise if it were our individual shareholder.\nProtection of minority shareholders\nWe would normally expect British Virgin Islands courts to follow English case law precedents, which permit a minority shareholder to commence\na representative action, or derivative actions in our name, to challenge (1) an act which is ultra vires or illegal, (2) an act which constitutes a fraud against\nthe minority by parties in control of us, (3) the act complained of constitutes an infringement of individual rights of shareholders, such as the right to vote\nand pre-emptive rights and (4) an irregularity in the passing of a resolution which requires a special or extraordinary majority of the shareholders.\nPre-emptive rights\nThere are no pre-emptive rights applicable to the issue by us of new Ordinary Shares under either British Virgin Islands law or our memorandum\nand articles of association.\nTransfer of ordinary shares\nSubject to the restrictions in our memorandum and articles of association and applicable securities laws, any of our shareholders may transfer all\nor any of his or her ordinary shares by written instrument of transfer signed by the transferor and containing the name and address of the transferee. Our\nboard of directors may resolve by resolution to refuse or delay the registration of the transfer of any common share. If our board of directors resolves to\nrefuse or delay any transfer, it shall specify the reasons for such refusal in the resolution. Our directors may not resolve or refuse or delay the transfer of a\ncommon share unless: (a) the person transferring the shares has failed to pay any amount due in respect of any of those shares; or (b) such refusal or delay\nis deemed necessary or advisable in our view or that of our legal counsel in order to avoid violation of, or in order to ensure compliance with, any\napplicable, corporate, securities and other laws and regulations.\nLiquidation\nIf we are wound up and the assets available for distribution among our shareholders are more than sufficient to repay all amounts paid to us on\naccount of the issue of shares immediately prior to the winding up, the excess shall be distributable pari passu among those shareholders in proportion to\nthe amount paid up immediately prior to the winding up on the shares held by them, respectively. If we are wound up and the assets available for\ndistribution among the shareholders as such are insufficient to repay the whole of the amounts paid to us on account of the issue of shares, those assets shall\nbe distributed so that, to the greatest extent possible, the losses shall be borne by the shareholders in proportion to the amounts paid up immediately prior to\nthe winding up on the shares held by them, respectively. If we are wound up, the liquidator appointed by us may, in accordance with the BVI Business\nCompanies Act, divide among our shareholders in specie or kind the whole or any part of our assets (whether they shall consist of property of the same\nkind or not) and may, for such purpose, set such value as the liquidator deems fair upon any property to be divided and may determine how such division\nshall be carried out as between the shareholders or different classes of shareholders.\nCalls on ordinary shares and forfeiture of ordinary shares\nOur board of directors may from time to time make calls upon shareholders for any amounts unpaid on their ordinary shares in a notice served to\nsuch shareholders at least 14 days prior to the specified time of payment. The ordinary shares that have been called upon and remain unpaid are subject to\nforfeiture.\nRedemption of ordinary shares\nSubject to the provisions of the BVI Business Companies Act, we may issue shares on terms that are subject to redemption, at our option or at the\noption of the holders, on such terms and in such manner as may be determined by our memorandum and articles of association and subject to any\napplicable requirements imposed from time to time by, the BVI Business Companies Act, the SEC, The NASDAQ Capital Market, or by any recognized\nstock exchange on which our securities are listed.\nModifications of rights\nAll or any of the special rights attached to any class of shares may, subject to the provisions of the BVI Business Companies Act, be amended only\npursuant to a resolution passed at a meeting by a majority of the votes cast by those entitled to vote at a meeting of the holders of the shares of that class.\nChanges in the number of shares we are authorized to issue and those in issue\nWe may from time to time by resolution of our board of directors:\n● amend our memorandum of association to increase or decrease the maximum number of shares we are authorized to issue;\n● subject to our memorandum, divide our authorized and issued shares into a larger number of shares; and\n● subject to our memorandum, combine our authorized and issued shares into a smaller number of shares.\nUntraceable shareholders\nWe are entitled to sell any shares of a shareholder who is untraceable, provided that:\n● all checks or warrants in respect of dividends of these shares, not being less than three in number, for any sums payable in cash to the holder of\nsuch shares have remained uncashed for a period of twelve years prior to the publication of the notice and during the three months referred to in\nthe third bullet point below;\n● we have not during that time received any indication of the whereabouts or existence of the shareholder or person entitled to these shares by death,\nbankruptcy or operation of law; and\n● we have caused a notice to be published in newspapers in the manner stipulated by our memorandum and articles of association, giving notice of\nour intention to sell these shares, and a period of three months has elapsed since such notice.\n● The net proceeds of any such sale shall belong to us, and when we receive these net proceeds we shall become indebted to the former shareholder\nfor an amount equal to the net proceeds.\nInspection of books and records\nUnder British Virgin Islands Law, holders of our ordinary shares are entitled, upon giving written notice to us, to inspect (i) our memorandum and\narticles of association, (ii) the register of members, (iii) the register of directors and (iv) minutes of meetings and resolutions of members, and to make\ncopies and take extracts from the documents and records. However, our directors can refuse access if they are satisfied that to allow such access would be\ncontrary to our interests. See “Where You Can Find Additional Information.”\nRights of non-resident or foreign shareholders\nThere are no limitations imposed by our memorandum and articles of association on the rights of non-resident or foreign shareholders to hold or\nexercise voting rights on our shares. In addition, there are no provisions in our memorandum and articles of association governing the ownership threshold\nabove which shareholder ownership must be disclosed.\nIssuance of additional ordinary shares\nOur memorandum and articles of association authorizes our board of directors to issue additional ordinary shares from authorized but unissued\nshares, to the extent available, from time to time as our board of directors shall determine.\nDifferences in Corporate Law\nThe BVI Business Companies Act and the laws of the British Virgin Islands affecting British Virgin Islands companies like us and our\nshareholders differ from laws applicable to U.S. corporations and their shareholders. Set forth below is a summary of the material differences between the\nprovisions of the laws of the British Virgin Islands applicable to us and the laws applicable to companies incorporated in the United States and their\nshareholders.\nMergers and similar arrangements\nUnder the laws of the British Virgin Islands, two or more companies may merge or consolidate in accordance with Section 170 of the BVI\nBusiness Companies Act. A merger means the merging of two or more constituent companies into one of the constituent companies and a consolidation\nmeans the uniting of two or more constituent companies into a new company. In order to merge or consolidate, the directors of each constituent company\nmust approve a written plan of merger or consolidation, which must be authorized by a resolution of shareholders.\nWhile a director may vote on the plan of merger or consolidation even if he has a financial interest in the plan, the interested director must disclose\nthe interest to all other directors of the company promptly upon becoming aware of the fact that he is interested in a transaction entered into or to be entered\ninto by the company.\nA transaction entered into by our company in respect of which a director is interested (including a merger or consolidation) is voidable by us\nunless the director’s interest was (a) disclosed to the board prior to the transaction or (b) the transaction is (i) between the director and the company and (ii)\nthe transaction is in the ordinary course of the company’s business and on usual terms and conditions.\nNotwithstanding the above, a transaction entered into by the company is not voidable if the material facts of the interest are known to the\nshareholders and they approve or ratify it or the company received fair value for the transaction.\nShareholders not otherwise entitled to vote on the merger or consolidation may still acquire the right to vote if the plan of merger or consolidation\ncontains any provision which, if proposed as an amendment to the memorandum or articles of association, would entitle them to vote as a class or series on\nthe proposed amendment. In any event, all shareholders must be given a copy of the plan of merger or consolidation irrespective of whether they are\nentitled to vote at the meeting to approve the plan of merger or consolidation.\nThe shareholders of the constituent companies are not required to receive shares of the surviving or consolidated company but may receive debt\nobligations or other securities of the surviving or consolidated company, other assets, or a combination thereof. Further, some or all of the shares of a class\nor series may be converted into a kind of asset while the other shares of the same class or series may receive a different kind of asset. As such, not all the\nshares of a class or series must receive the same kind of consideration.\nAfter the plan of merger or consolidation has been approved by the directors and authorized by a resolution of the shareholders, articles of merger\nor consolidation are executed by each company and filed with the Registrar of Corporate Affairs in the British Virgin Islands.\nA shareholder may dissent from a mandatory redemption of his shares, an arrangement (if permitted by the court), a merger (unless the\nshareholder was a shareholder of the surviving company prior to the merger and continues to hold the same or similar shares after the merger) or a\nconsolidation. A shareholder properly exercising his dissent rights is entitled to a cash payment equal to the fair value of his shares.\nA shareholder dissenting from a merger or consolidation must object in writing to the merger or consolidation before the vote by the shareholders\non the merger or consolidation, unless notice of the meeting was not given to the shareholder. If the merger or consolidation is approved by the\nshareholders, the company must give notice of this fact to each shareholder within 20 days who gave written objection. These shareholders then have 20\ndays to give to the company their written election in the form specified by the BVI Business Companies Act to dissent from the merger or consolidation,\nprovided that in the case of a merger, the 20 days starts when the plan of merger is delivered to the shareholder.\nUpon giving notice of his election to dissent, a shareholder ceases to have any shareholder rights except the right to be paid the fair value of his\nshares. As such, the merger or consolidation may proceed in the ordinary course notwithstanding his dissent.\nWithin seven days of the later of the delivery of the notice of election to dissent and the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the company\nmust make a written offer to each dissenting shareholder to purchase his shares at a specified price per share that the company determines to be the fair\nvalue of the shares. The company and the shareholder then have 30 days to agree upon the price. If the company and a shareholder fail to agree on the price\nwithin the 30 days, then the company and the shareholder shall, within 20 days immediately following the expiration of the 30-day period, each designate\nan appraiser and these two appraisers shall designate a third appraiser. These three appraisers shall fix the fair value of the shares as of the close of business\non the day prior to the shareholders’ approval of the transaction without taking into account any change in value as a result of the transaction.\nShareholders’ suits\nThere are both statutory and common law remedies available to our shareholders as a matter of British Virgin Islands law. These are summarized\nbelow:\nPrejudiced members\nA shareholder who considers that the affairs of the company have been, are being, or are likely to be, conducted in a manner that is, or any act or\nacts of the company have been, or are, likely to be oppressive, unfairly discriminatory or unfairly prejudicial to him in that capacity, can apply to the court\nunder Section 184I of the BVI Business Companies Act, inter alia, for an order that his shares be acquired, that he be provided compensation, that the Court\nregulate the future conduct of the company, or that any decision of the company which contravenes the BVI Business Companies Act or our memorandum\nand articles of association be set aside.\nDerivative actions\nSection 184C of the BVI Business Companies Act provides that a shareholder of a company may, with the leave of the Court, bring an action in\nthe name of the company to redress any wrong done to it.\nJust and equitable winding up\nIn addition to the statutory remedies outlined above, shareholders can also petition for the winding up of a company on the grounds that it is just\nand equitable for the court to so order. Save in exceptional circumstances, this remedy is only available where the company has been operated as a quasi\npartnership and trust and confidence between the partners has broken down.\nIndemnification of directors and executive officers and limitation of liability\nBritish Virgin Islands law does not limit the extent to which a company’s articles of association may provide for indemnification of officers and\ndirectors, except to the extent any provision providing indemnification may be held by the British Virgin Islands courts to be contrary to public policy, such\nas to provide indemnification against civil fraud or the consequences of committing a crime.\nUnder our memorandum and articles of association, we indemnify against all expenses, including legal fees, and against all judgments, fines and\namounts paid in settlement and reasonably incurred in connection with legal, administrative or investigative proceedings for any person who:\n● is or was a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed proceedings, whether civil, criminal, administrative or\ninvestigative, by reason of the fact that the person is or was our director; or\n● is or was, at our request, serving as a director or officer of, or in any other capacity is or was acting for, another body corporate or a partnership, joint\nventure, trust or other enterprise.\nThese indemnities only apply if the person acted honestly and in good faith with a view to our best interests and, in the case of criminal\nproceedings, the person had no reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. This standard of conduct is generally the same as permitted\nunder the Delaware General Corporation Law for a Delaware corporation.\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers or persons controlling us under\nthe foregoing provisions, we have been advised that in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities\nAct and is therefore unenforceable.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our memorandum and articles of association\nSome provisions of our memorandum and articles of association may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or\nmanagement that shareholders may consider favorable, including provisions that provide for a staggered board of directors and prevent shareholders from\ntaking an action by written consent in lieu of a meeting. However, under British Virgin Islands law, our directors may only exercise the rights and powers\ngranted to them under our memorandum and articles of association, as amended and restated from time to time, as they believe in good faith to be in the\nbest interests of our company.\nDirectors’ fiduciary duties\nUnder Delaware corporate law, a director of a Delaware corporation has a fiduciary duty to the corporation and its shareholders. This duty has two\ncomponents: the duty of care and the duty of loyalty. The duty of care requires that a director act in good faith, with the care that an ordinarily prudent\nperson would exercise under similar circumstances. Under this duty, a director must inform himself of, and disclose to shareholders, all material\ninformation reasonably available regarding a transaction that is material to the company. The duty of loyalty requires that a director act in a manner he\nreasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation. He must not use his corporate position for personal gain or advantage. This duty prohibits\nself-dealing by a director and mandates that the best interest of the corporation and its shareholders take precedence over any interest possessed by a\ndirector, officer or controlling shareholder and not shared by the shareholders generally. In general, actions of a director are presumed to have been made\non an informed basis, in good faith and in the honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the corporation. However, this presumption may\nbe rebutted by evidence of a breach of one of the fiduciary duties. Should such evidence be presented concerning a transaction by a director, a director must\nprove the procedural fairness of the transaction and that the transaction was of fair value to the corporation.\nUnder British Virgin Islands law, our directors owe the company certain statutory and fiduciary duties including, among others, a duty to act\nhonestly, in good faith, for a proper purpose and with a view to what the directors believe to be in the best interests of the company. Our directors are also\nrequired, when exercising powers or performing duties as a director, to exercise the care, diligence and skill that a reasonable director would exercise in\ncomparable circumstances, taking into account without limitation, the nature of the company, the nature of the decision and the position of the director and\nthe nature of the responsibilities undertaken. In the exercise of their powers, our directors must ensure neither they nor the company acts in a manner which\ncontravenes the BVI Business Companies Act or our memorandum and articles of association, as amended and re-stated from time to time. A shareholder\nhas the right to seek damages for breaches of duties owed to us by our directors.\nShareholder action by written consent\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, a corporation may eliminate the right of shareholders to act by written consent by amendment to its\ncertificate of incorporation. British Virgin Islands law provides that shareholders may approve corporate matters by way of a written resolution without a\nmeeting signed by or on behalf of shareholders sufficient to constitute the requisite majority of shareholders who would have been entitled to vote on such\nmatter at a general meeting; provided that if the consent is less than unanimous, notice must be given to all non-consenting shareholders. Our memorandum\nand articles of association permit shareholders to act by written consent.\nShareholder proposals\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, a shareholder has the right to put any proposal before the annual meeting of shareholders, provided\nit complies with the notice provisions in the governing documents. A special meeting may be called by the board of directors or any other person authorized\nto do so in the governing documents, but shareholders may be precluded from calling special meetings. British Virgin Islands law and our memorandum\nand articles of association allow our shareholders holding not less than 30% of the votes of the outstanding voting shares to requisition a shareholders’\nmeeting. We are not obliged by law to call shareholders’ annual general meetings, but our memorandum and articles of association do permit the directors\nto call such a meeting. The location of any shareholders’ meeting can be determined by the board of directors and can be held anywhere in the world.\nCumulative voting\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, cumulative voting for elections of directors is not permitted unless the corporation’s certificate of\nincorporation specifically provides for it. Cumulative voting potentially facilitates the representation of minority shareholders on a board of directors since\nit permits the minority shareholder to cast all the votes to which the shareholder is entitled on a single director, which increases the shareholder’s voting\npower with respect to electing such director. As permitted under British Virgin Islands law, our memorandum and articles of association do not provide for\ncumulative voting. As a result, our shareholders are not afforded any less protections or rights on this issue than shareholders of a Delaware corporation.\nRemoval of directors\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, a director of a corporation with a classified board may be removed only for cause with the approval\nof a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote, unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. Under our memorandum and articles of\nassociation, directors can be removed from office, with cause, by a resolution of shareholders or by a resolution of directors passed at a meeting of directors\ncalled for the purpose of removing the director or for purposes including the removal of the director.\nTransactions with interested shareholders\nThe Delaware General Corporation Law contains a business combination statute applicable to Delaware public corporations whereby, unless the\ncorporation has specifically elected not to be governed by such statute by amendment to its certificate of incorporation, it is prohibited from engaging in\ncertain business combinations with an “interested shareholder” for three years following the date that such person becomes an interested shareholder. An\ninterested shareholder generally is a person or group who or which owns or owned 15% or more of the target’s outstanding voting shares within the past\nthree years. This has the effect of limiting the ability of a potential acquirer to make a two-tiered bid for the target in which all shareholders would not be\ntreated equally. The statute does not apply if, among other things, prior to the date on which such shareholder becomes an interested shareholder, the board\nof directors approves either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the person becoming an interested shareholder. This encourages\nany potential acquirer of a Delaware public corporation to negotiate the terms of any acquisition transaction with the target’s board of directors. British\nVirgin Islands law has no comparable statute.\nDissolution; Winding Up\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, unless the board of directors approves the proposal to dissolve, dissolution must be approved by\nshareholders holding 100% of the total voting power of the corporation. Only if the dissolution is initiated by the board of directors may it be approved by a\nsimple majority of the corporation’s outstanding shares. Delaware law allows a Delaware corporation to include in its certificate of incorporation a\nsupermajority voting requirement in connection with dissolutions initiated by the board. Under the BVI Business Companies Act and our memorandum and\narticles of association, we may appoint a voluntary liquidator by a resolution of the shareholders or by resolution of directors.\nVariation of rights of shares\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, a corporation may vary the rights of a class of shares with the approval of a majority of the\noutstanding shares of such class, unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. Under our memorandum and articles of association, if at any\ntime our shares are divided into different classes of shares, the rights attached to any class may only be varied, whether or not our company is in\nliquidation, with the consent in writing of or by a resolution passed at a meeting by the holders of not less than 50 percent of the issued shares in that class.\nAmendment of governing documents\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, a corporation’s governing documents may be amended with the approval of a majority of the\noutstanding shares entitled to vote, unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. As permitted by British Virgin Islands law, our memorandum\nand articles of association may be amended by a resolution of shareholders and, subject to certain exceptions, by a resolution of directors. Any amendment\nis effective from the date it is registered at the Registry of Corporate Affairs in the British Virgin Islands.\nExhibit 8.1\nSUBSIDIARIES OF THE REGISTRANT\nSubsidiary Jurisdiction of incorporation\nABit Hong Kong Limited (formerly known as Woodland Corporation Limited) Hong Kong SAR, People’s Republic of\nChina\nABit USA, Inc.

We agree with the statements\nconcerning our Firm contained therein.\nVery truly yours,\n/s/Centurion ZD & Co.\nHong Kong\nAttachment\nATTACHMENT - CHANGE IN REGISTRANT’S CERTIFYING ACCOUNTANT\nEffective June 30, 2022, the Registrant has appointed Audit Alliance LLP (“Audit Alliance”) as its independent registered public accounting firm\nfor the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 and accepted the resignation of the Registrant’s previous independent auditor, Centurion ZD & Co.\n(“Centurion”), effective on the same date. Audit Alliance is headquartered in Singapore and will be subject to the inspections by the Public Company\nAccounting Oversight Board of the United States. The appointment of Audit Alliance was made after careful consideration and evaluation by the Registrant\nand has been approved by the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors of the Registrant.\nDuring the Registrant’s two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 and September 30, 2020, through the resignation of\nCenturion on June 30, 2022, there were no disagreements between the Registrant or its predecessor, Moxian, Inc., and Centurion on any matter of\naccounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of\nCenturion, would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in connection with its report on the Registrant’s or its\npredecessor’s consolidated financial statements for such periods. In addition, Centurion’s reports on the financial statements as of and for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020 and September 30, 2020 did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to\nuncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 and September 30, 2020 through the\nresignation of Centurion on June 30, 2022, there were no “reportable events” as that term is defined in Item 16F(a)(1)(v) of Form 20-F.\nDuring the two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 and September 30, 2020 and any subsequent interim period prior to\nengaging Audit Alliance, neither the Registrant nor anyone on its behalf consulted Audit Alliance regarding either (i) the application of accounting\nprinciples to any proposed or completed transaction, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Registrant’s financial statements, and neither\na written report nor oral advice was provided to the Registrant that Audit Alliance concluded was an important factor considered by the Registrant in\nreaching a decision as to any accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement (as defined in\nItem 16F(a)(1)(iv) of Form 20-F and the related instructions to Item 16F of Form 20-F) or a reportable event."
