Management also believes these non-GAAP financial\nmeasures help investors and analysts better understand our actual results compared to our guidance on a\nnon-GAAP basis. SJW Group uses adjusted net income and/or adjusted diluted EPS as the primary\nperformance measurements when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our outlook and\nresults. Adjusted net income and Adjusted diluted EPS are also used internally to measure performance.\nHowever, these non-GAAP financial measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by\nother companies, even when the same or similarly titled terms are used to identify such measures, limiting\ntheir usefulness for comparative purposes. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures should be\nconsidered as a supplement to the financial information prepared on a GAAP basis rather than an alternative\nto the respective GAAP financial measures.\n41\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n2024 Earnings Guidance\nEstimated Diluted EPS Guidance on a GAAP Basis $ 2.65 to 2.75\nAdjustments:\nLoss on sale of real estate investments, net of tax 0.02 0.02\nExpense for merger and acquisition activities 0.01 0.01\nAdjusted EPS Guidance (non-GAAP) $ 2.68 to 2.78\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nReported GAAP Net Income $ 38,652 36,222 $ 71,047 66,038\nAdjustments:\nLoss (gain) on sale of real estate investments1 60 — 969 (1,473)\nExpense for merger and acquisition activities2 361 — 361 —\nTax effect of above adjustment3 (120) — (411) 412\nAdjusted Net Income (non-GAAP) $ 38,953 36,222 $ 71,966 64,977\nReported GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share $ 1.17 1.13 $ 2.18 2.09\nAdjustments:\nLoss (gain) on sale of real estate investments, net of tax — — 0.02 (0.03)\nExpense for merger and acquisition activities, net of tax 0.01 — 0.01 —\nAdjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share (non-GAAP) $ 1.18 1.13 $ 2.21 2.06\n1Included in the \"Other, net\" line on the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\n2Included in the \"Administrative and general\" line on the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\n3The tax effect on all adjustments is calculated at the applicable statutory rate.\n42\nKey Statistics by State\nAs of December 31, 2023 California Connecticut1 Maine2 Texas\nCapital Structure and Authorized ROE\nAuthorized capital structure (debt/equity) 45% / 55% 47% / 53% 50% / 50% 42% / 58%3\nAuthorized ROE 9.31%3 9.00% 9.70% 10.88%2\nRate Base\nAuthorized rate base (in millions) $1,114 $620 $135 $433\nEstimated rate base at year-end (in millions) 5 $1,136 $731 $172 $1073\nConnections\nWater connections 232,400 107,700 33,800 28,000\nWastewater connections 0 3,000 0 950\nTotal Connections 232,400 110,700 33,800 28,950\n1 Effective July 1, 2024, Connecticut Water’s authorized ROE is 9.3% on a 47%/53% debt/equity capital structure with an authorized rate base of $702M.\n2Authorized capital structure and ROE for Maine Water’s largest division, the Biddeford and Saco (B-S) division.
