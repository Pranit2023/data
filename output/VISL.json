Olive, NJ — November 14, 2024 —** [**Vislink Technologies, Inc.**](https://www.vislink.com/)**(“Vislink” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: VISL**), a global technology leader in the capture, delivery, and management of high-quality, live video and associated data in the media and entertainment, public safety, and defense markets, today reported results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * **Revenue** for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was $24.4 million, an increase of 26% over the prior year period. Revenue in the third quarter was $7.1 million compared to $7.2 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n  * **Gross margin** was 51% in the third quarter, down from 54% in the prior year period.\n  * **Net loss** was $(3.0) million, or $(1.22) per share in the third quarter, compared to $(2.0) million, or $(0.83) per share, in the prior year period.\n  * **Cash and short-term investments** were $9.2 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $11.5 million at June 30, 2024. Working capital was $27.1 million at the end of the third quarter compared to $31.8 million at June 30, 2024. The Company expects to realize improvements in working capital performance due to insights from the implementation of an ERP system that came online in the third quarter.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 and Recent Operational Highlights**\n\n  * ** _Increased adoption of Vislink’s aircraft-based AeroLink transceiver by federal, regional, and municipal public safety organizations_****.** AeroLink is the central component of the Company’s downlink systems and enables the delivery of exceptional video quality, secure and uninterrupted connectivity, and broad operating ranges.\n  * **_Initial deployment of Vislink’s new Q-Link airborne control system with a U.S. public safety organization, laying the foundation for Vislink’s Air-to-Anywhere™ platform_**. This system enables secure, real-time, air-to-ground live video streaming, enhancing situational awareness.\n  * **_Received an initial $340,000 order with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security_**.\n  * **_Deployed a new ERP system to streamline and integrate core business processes, improving overall efficiency_****.** The system enables improved decision-making through real-time data access, reduced operational costs, and increased agility in responding to market changes.\n  * **_Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, Vislink implemented a restructuring plan to streamline operations and reduce costs_****.** The actions will include the closure and relocation of certain manufacturing activities to consolidate manufacturing capacity and optimize staffing levels to align with the Company’s long-term objectives.\n  * **_Appointed Joseph Lipowski as Chief Technology Officer_****.** Joe brings extensive industry experience with high-growth companies in RF systems, software development, and communications hardware. He will lead the product development team and spearhead the Company’s next-generation platform for radio-agnostic crewed and uncrewed aerial command, control, and video systems – a critical part of Vislink’s long-term strategy.\n  * **_Introduced the 5G DragonFly V, the Company’s miniaturized HEVC 5G transmitter_****.** DragonFly V is designed to deliver real-time, high-quality video from Point-of-View (PoV) cameras, drones, and body-worn devices, delivering unprecedented first-person perspectives from live events and public safety.\n  * **_Launched a new corporate brand identity and website to drive global growth and strengthen market leadership_****.** The enhanced digital presence with improved SEO is designed to create additional sales opportunities by offering Vislink customers an intuitive, user-friendly platform for discovering and evaluating the Company’s solutions.\n\n\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n“We are pleased to report that our year-to-date revenue has increased over 26% compared to the same period in the prior year,” stated Mickey Miller, CEO of Vislink. “The results recorded in the third quarter alone reflected a decline in revenues caused by unusually high seasonal softness in the Live Production sector. Further, while we experienced robust 26% growth in the MilGov market, it was lower than our anticipated growth due to extended sales cycles with customers in the Middle East. However, we continue to observe a number of favorable signs this quarter that point to promising growth opportunities ahead. We now have numerous product evaluations taking place in the field as local, national, and international law enforcement and defense agencies seek to maintain a strategic edge in ensuring public safety. Our airborne video downlink systems, featuring the AeroLink transceiver and Air-to-Anywhere™ solution, remain the gold standard for robust, reliable, and efficient surveillance and emergency response solutions. We anticipate closing on many of these opportunities and expect to realize significant revenue from this sector moving forward.”\n\n“The Live Production market continues to present growth opportunities for our solutions. There has been considerable interest in our miniature DragonFly V transmitter. DragonFly V is designed to deliver real-time, high-quality video from Point-of-View (PoV) cameras, drones, and body-worn devices. The increasing demand for high performance combined with compact form factors in video transmission is driving interest in our broad range of solutions that address quality, immediacy, and flexibility, which are key requirements of broadcast media organizations. We expect to maintain targeted R&D investments in our product lines, with both incremental and major upgrades, to extend our competitive edge in the market.”\n\n“In the third quarter, we launched a new ERP system to unify and optimize our core operations, driving efficiency across the organization. The system has enabled us to identify significant costs that we believe can be removed from the business. Although we are pleased with our year-to-date revenue growth, we are responding proactively to near-term softness by consolidating operations while strategically positioning ourselves for continued growth in the MilGov sector. As part of this effort, we initiated a restructuring project that consolidates our manufacturing facilities into one location and streamlines our organization to better support our target markets. We expect the restructuring initiative to achieve over $6 million in annualized cost savings beginning in Q4 2024. We are also committed to continuously identifying further opportunities for cost reduction.”\n\n“Looking forward, we remain firmly committed to our three-year plan; however, the timeline for achieving our growth and profitability expectations may be extended due to current market dynamics. We have addressed our cost base to accommodate that extended period. We are confident that ongoing strong demand for our proven solutions, the transition toward MilGov markets and high-margin service revenue, and our unwavering focus on cost management position us well for executing our plans and attaining future sustainable and profitable growth.”\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nManagement will host a conference call today, November 14, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\nVislink management will host the presentation, followed by a question-and-answer period.\n\n**Toll-Free Number:** 1-833-953-2432\n\n**International Number:** 1-412-317-5761\n\n**Webcast:** Click [here](https://event.choruscall.com/mediaframe/webcast.html?webcastid=wOFeheRq) to register\n\nPlease register online approximately 15 minutes before the start time (although you may register, dial in, or access the webcast anytime during the call).\n\nThe conference call will be broadcast live [here](https://event.choruscall.com/mediaframe/webcast.html?webcastid=wOFeheRq) and available for replay via the Investor Relations section of Vislink’s [website](https://www.vislink.com/investors/).\n\nA replay of the conference call will be available after 11:30 a.m. Eastern Time on the same day through November 28, 2024.\n\n**Toll-Free Replay Number:** 1-877-344-7529\n\n**International Replay Number:** 1-412-317-0088\n\n**Replay ID:** 4856930\n\n** _Non-GAAP Financial Measure: EBITDA_**\n\n _To supplement our financial results presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), we are presenting EBITDA in this earnings release and the related earnings conference call. EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that is not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP and is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. We define EBITDA as our net income (loss), excluding the impact of depreciation and amortization expense and interest income and tax). We have presented EBITDA because it is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our operating performance, establish budgets, and develop operational goals for managing our business. In particular, we believe that excluding the impact of these expenses in calculating EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core operating performance._ _A reconciliation of non-GAAP EBITDA to GAAP net loss appears in the financial tables accompanying this press release, as set forth below._\n\n**_Note on Forward-looking Statements_**\n\n _Certain statements in this press release are forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties for purposes of the safe harbor provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Olive, NJ — August 14, 2024 —** [**Vislink Technologies, Inc.**](https://www.vislink.com/)**(“Vislink” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: VISL**), a global technology leader in the capture, delivery, and management of high-quality, live video and associated data in the media and entertainment, public safety, and defense markets, today reported results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * **Revenue** increased 73% to $8.7 million, up from $5.0 million in the prior year period. The revenue increase resulted from strong growth in sales to both MilGov and Live Production customers.\n  * **Gross margin** increased to 56%, up from 53% in the prior year period. The year-over-year improvement in gross margin reflects greater operating efficiency and a higher mix of new products. Gross margin performance was slightly offset by delayed revenue recognition of higher margin services revenue due to longer customer integration and installation cycles with large MilGov customers.\n  * **Net loss** improved to $(2.3) million, or $(0.93) per share, from $(3.0) million, or $(1.27) per share, in the prior year period. This improvement is largely attributed to increased revenue and improved gross margins when compared to the prior period.\n  * **Cash and short-term investments** were $11.5 million at June 30, 2024, compared to $14.2 million at March 31, 2024. Longer acceptance timeframes for new products delivered to MilGov customers caused a greater proportion of working capital to be concentrated in customer accounts. Working capital was $29.0 million at the end of the second quarter compared to $31.8 million at December 31, 2023. The Company expects to continue enhancing working capital performance by optimizing inventory management and accelerating customer acceptance of new products.\n\n\n\n**Second Quarter 2024 and Recent Operational Highlights**\n\n  * ** _Delivered initial shipments for significant orders with MilGov customers, including U.S. Customs and Border Protection._** These orders demonstrate Vislink’s ability to convert Broadcast Microwave Services, LLC (“BMS”) customers and meet the stringent technical requirements of MilGov clients, including installation and integration with airborne assets.\n  * **_Grew weighted sales pipeline to $51 million, reflecting strong demand across all markets._**\n  * **_Strengthened MilGov market position by securing NATO Stock Numbers for its AVDS products_** , facilitating streamlined procurement and distribution within NATO member countries. This milestone raises Vislink’s credibility and market access in the defense sector and augments Vislink’s achieving approved supplier status from three global aerospace OEMs earlier in the year.\n  * **_Service/software revenue was 8% of total revenue for 2024_** with a continued focus on leveraging the infrastructure platform to drive recurring revenues through the LinkMatrix platform.\n  * **_Accelerated expansion into the large and growing Drone Command and Control (Drone C2) market_** , increasing its R&D investment, driven by high customer interest in the rapidly growing Drone C2 market, focusing on manned and unmanned applications. The Company continues demonstrating its ability to leverage its current IP portfolio and adapt its technology to support emerging use cases.\n  * **_Appointed Donnie Gilliam as Vice President of Operations to enhance operational efficiency and drive successful customer outcomes._**\n\n\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n“Vislink’s second quarter results show our continuing progress, highlighting the effectiveness of our strategic initiatives and the continued execution of our growth plans,” stated Mickey Miller, CEO of Vislink. “We achieved a 73% increase in revenue, reaching $8.7 million, driven by continued advancement in both the MilGov and Live Broadcast markets. Our weighted sales pipeline grew to $51 million, reflecting strong customer optimism for our refreshed product portfolio. Recent shipments to U.S. Customs and Border Protection and other MilGov End Users and OEMs demonstrate our ability to seamlessly integrate existing AVDS products with assets acquired from BMS to expand our customer base and capabilities.\n\n“As we progress through the second half of the year, we are driving innovation by increasing our investment in R&D in multiple areas. Our developments in AVDS and unmanned and manned drone systems demonstrate how we are strengthening our position in aerial and terrestrial solutions. These efforts are expected to improve our market position and ability to capitalize on the growing demand for Unmanned Control, Command, and Payload solutions. Recent significant orders and market penetration underscore our momentum and expanding impact in this exciting, high-growth market.\n\n“With the upcoming launch of our upgraded and unified ERP system this fall, we anticipate further improvements in supply chain efficiency and operational performance. These improvements will support our ongoing efforts to enhance gross margins and reduce operating costs. While we continue to target cash flow neutrality by the end of 2024, timing may vary as we strategically prioritize incremental R&D investments that meet customer needs in high-growth markets. Our goal is to develop differentiated IP that can be leveraged for a high return on investment. We expect to offset the additional R&D investment through operational improvements that will allow us to achieve positive cash flow in 2025.”\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nManagement will host a conference call today, August 14, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss its financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\nVislink management will host the presentation, followed by a question-and-answer period.\n\n**Toll-Free Number:** 1-833-953-2432 **International Number:** 1-412-317-5761 **Webcast:**[Click here to register ](https://event.choruscall.com/mediaframe/webcast.html?webcastid=5bYklVd2)\n\nPlease register online at least 10 minutes before the start time (although you may register, dial in, or access the webcast anytime during the call).

The increase in revenue resulted from a jump in sales to military and government customers.\n  * **Gross margin** increased to 59%, up from 54% in the prior year period.

This growth has been bolstered by enhanced sales opportunities following the acquisition of BMS assets and increased governmental investment due to recent geopolitical events.\n\n“We are carrying this momentum into the second quarter as we continue to roll out newer products such as Cliq, LiveLink, and DragonFly V. These products fulfill needs across our target markets and facilitate opportunities to increase our software and services revenue, which grew to 16% of total revenue in the first quarter. This strategic shift is steering our revenue mix towards more predictable, higher-margin streams. Our strengthened sales channels and go-to-market strategies have resulted in the largest weighted sales pipeline since the pandemic, valued at $48 million entering the second quarter. In addition, we are extending our reach in the Drone Command and Control (Drone C2) area, another developing use case for our current solutions, as we engage in encouraging discussions with key industry leaders.\n\n“We are on track to achieve cash flow neutrality by the end of 2024 and aim to be cash flow positive in 2025. Our operations are continually evolving as we actively identify areas for further operational enhancements and cost-saving measures. These ongoing improvements are crucial as we work to drive further revenue growth and enhance profitability.”\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nManagement will host a conference call today, May 15, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024.\n\nVislink management will host the presentation, followed by a question-and-answer period.\n\n**Toll-Free Number:** 1-833-953-2432\n\n**International Number:** 1-412-317-5761\n\n**Webcast:**[Click here to register](https://event.choruscall.com/mediaframe/webcast.html?webcastid=fwDQ1xJJ)\n\nPlease register online at least 10 minutes before the start time (although you may register, dial in, or access the webcast anytime during the call).

Olive, NJ — April 1, 2024 —** [**Vislink Technologies, Inc.**](https://www.vislink.com/)**(“Vislink” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: VISL**), a global technology leader in the capture, delivery, and management of high-quality, live video and associated data in the media and entertainment, public safety, and defense markets, today reported results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. The Company will file the Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission by April 16, 2024.\n\n**Fourth Quarter 2023 and Recent Operational Highlights**\n\n  * ** _Acquired and integrated assets of Broadcast Microwave Services (BMS)._** The accretive, strategic move has begun to bear fruit. It provides additional valuable opportunities to introduce and promote the Company’s best-in-class AVDS (Aerial Video Downlink Systems) solutions into BMS’s extensive customer network, which includes U.S. Federal agencies, global OEMs, and large governments in EMEA.\n  * **_Launched Air-to-Anywhere™ within its AVDS platform_** , enabling high-resolution, ultralow-latency real-time video distribution and management to any device, anywhere. This advancement will include the Company’s roadmap initiatives to leverage AI for enhanced analytics, and is expected to pave new avenues to develop recurring revenue via in-depth data insights.\n  * **_Solidified its presence in the expanding drone command and control market,_** a high-growth area with the opportunity to leverage the Company’s proprietary hardware infrastructure and Air-to-Anywhere software solution platform. Revenue from this nascent market is expected to grow 75% in 2024.\n  * **_Increased Software and Services revenue to more than 10% of sales in 2023_**.\n  * **_Achieved over $2 million in AVDS orders from North America’s public safety sector._**\n  * **_Secured a $1 million AVDS order with a leading air force in the EMEA region._**\n  * **_Achieved highest post-pandemic backlog._**\n  * **_Appointed Bill Sweeney as the new Managing Director of its Military and Government (“MilGov”) business_** , adding valuable MilGov industry experience to the Company’s leadership team. Mr. Sweeney’s expertise in fostering strong domestic and international client relationships will enhance Vislink’s integration of existing services with BMS’s capabilities.\n  * **_Partnered with Zoom Communications, India’s premier outside broadcast (OB) service provider, for ultralow-latency 4K wireless camera systems,_** highlighting the first ultralow-latency systems to be deployed in India.\n\n\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n“2023 marked a pivotal year for Vislink, as we laid the groundwork for accelerated revenue growth and cash flow neutrality in 2024,” said Vislink CEO Mickey Miller. “During the year, we significantly advanced our presence in the expanding AVDS market, as evidenced by a 75% year-over-year revenue growth in the MilGov space. In September, we finalized the strategic acquisition of BMS assets, marking a significant step forward in expanding our reach within the MilGov market, especially in EMEA. This move has quickly demonstrated its value, as evidenced by a substantial order we’ve recently secured in the region. BMS’s customer base complements our AVDS solutions perfectly, significantly broadening our market reach and growth potential in the coming years. Additionally, the launch of Air-to-Anywhere™ in our AVDS platform, which integrates AI for advanced analytics, has opened new avenues for developing recurring revenue by offering in-depth data insights to customers. This milestone is part of a broader success story, as we also saw our high-margin software and services revenue climb above 10% of total revenue in 2023, exceeding our goal set at the beginning of the year.\n\n“In parallel, Vislink has undergone a significant transformation over the past two years, streamlining our operations to enhance efficiency and profitability. We’ve consolidated and outsourced manufacturing, simplified our product lineup, and improved the coordination between our sales and manufacturing teams. These steps have not only improved our operating efficiency and flexibility, leading to profitability improvements in 2023, but they also set us on a path to positive cash flow. Our accelerated MilGov sales, combined with increasing software and services sales and operating leverage, are expected to drive robust growth, aiming to be cash flow positive in 2025.\n\n“Vislink entered 2024 in a strong position, with a $48 million weighted sales pipeline. As we move into the second quarter, we have our highest backlog since the pandemic, giving us ample opportunity for growth in 2024. Our operational improvements have set the stage for us to capitalize on these opportunities, complemented by a notable increase in year-over-year bookings at the start of the year. We are actively driving software and services sales, and our latest innovations (AeroLink, Aero5, LiveLink, and LinkMatrix) are receiving positive market response. With these efforts and innovations, we believe Vislink is well-prepared for a strong year of growth.”\n\n**Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results**\n\n  * Revenue increased to $8.1 million, compared to $7.4 million in the prior year period.\n  * Gross margin increased to 46%, up from 33% in the prior year period. The improvement in gross margin was due to the greater contribution of MilGov revenue and software and services to total revenue, partially offset by one-time manufacturing charges related to new products.\n  * Net loss attributable to common shareholders totaled $(2.4) million, or $(0.99) per share, an improvement compared to $(5.5) million, or $(2.36) per share, in the prior year period.\n\n\n\n**Full Year 2023 Financial Results**\n\n  * Revenue was $27.5 million, compared to $28.1 million in 2022. The change in revenue was a result of product line streamlining efforts, which started in 2022, and the discontinuation of lower-margin, sub-scale product lines.\n  * Gross margin increased to 51%, up from 46% in 2022. The increase was due to the greater contribution of software and services to total revenue.\n  * Net loss attributable to common shareholders totaled $(9.1) million, or $(3.83) per share, an improvement compared to $(13.5) million, or $(5.81) per share, in 2022.\n  * EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) totaled $(9.0) million, an improvement compared to $(12.0) million in 2022.\n  * Cash and short-term investments were $14.2 million at December 31, 2023, compared to $18.2 million at the end of the third quarter. The increased use of cash observed in the fourth quarter of 2023 can be primarily attributed to higher receivables and inventory levels, reflecting the longer customer acceptance cycles for new products and strategic positioning for future growth. In 2024, the Company expects to improve working capital performance by optimizing inventory management and accelerating customer acceptance of new products.\n\n\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nManagement will host a conference call today, April 1, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nVislink management will host the presentation, followed by a question-and-answer period.\n\n**Toll-Free Number:** 1-833-953-2432 **International Number:** 1-412-317-5761 **Webcast:**[Click here to register](https://event.choruscall.com/mediaframe/webcast.html?webcastid=7NeNQNow)\n\nPlease register online at least 10 minutes before the start time (although you may register, dial in, or access the webcast anytime during the call).

EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that is not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP and is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. We define EBITDA as our net income (loss), excluding the impact of depreciation and amortization expense and interest income and tax). We have presented EBITDA because it is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our operating performance, establish budgets, and develop operational goals for managing our business. In particular, we believe that excluding the impact of these expenses in calculating EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core operating performance._ _A reconciliation of non-GAAP EBITDA to GAAP net loss appears in the financial tables accompanying this press release as set forth below._\n\n**_Note on Forward-looking Statements_** _Certain statements in this press release are forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties for purposes of the safe harbor provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Olive, NJ — November 14, 2024 —** [**Vislink Technologies, Inc.**](https://www.vislink.com/)**(“Vislink” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: VISL**), a global technology leader in the capture, delivery, and management of high-quality, live video and associated data in the media and entertainment, public safety, and defense markets, today reported results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * **Revenue** for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was $24.4 million, an increase of 26% over the prior year period. Revenue in the third quarter was $7.1 million compared to $7.2 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n  * **Gross margin** was 51% in the third quarter, down from 54% in the prior year period.\n  * **Net loss** was $(3.0) million, or $(1.22) per share in the third quarter, compared to $(2.0) million, or $(0.83) per share, in the prior year period.\n  * **Cash and short-term investments** were $9.2 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $11.5 million at June 30, 2024. Working capital was $27.1 million at the end of the third quarter compared to $31.8 million at June 30, 2024. The Company expects to realize improvements in working capital performance due to insights from the implementation of an ERP system that came online in the third quarter.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 and Recent Operational Highlights**\n\n  * ** _Increased adoption of Vislink’s aircraft-based AeroLink transceiver by federal, regional, and municipal public safety organizations_****.** AeroLink is the central component of the Company’s downlink systems and enables the delivery of exceptional video quality, secure and uninterrupted connectivity, and broad operating ranges.\n  * **_Initial deployment of Vislink’s new Q-Link airborne control system with a U.S. public safety organization, laying the foundation for Vislink’s Air-to-Anywhere™ platform_**. This system enables secure, real-time, air-to-ground live video streaming, enhancing situational awareness.\n  * **_Received an initial $340,000 order with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security_**.\n  * **_Deployed a new ERP system to streamline and integrate core business processes, improving overall efficiency_****.** The system enables improved decision-making through real-time data access, reduced operational costs, and increased agility in responding to market changes.\n  * **_Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, Vislink implemented a restructuring plan to streamline operations and reduce costs_****.** The actions will include the closure and relocation of certain manufacturing activities to consolidate manufacturing capacity and optimize staffing levels to align with the Company’s long-term objectives.\n  * **_Appointed Joseph Lipowski as Chief Technology Officer_****.** Joe brings extensive industry experience with high-growth companies in RF systems, software development, and communications hardware. He will lead the product development team and spearhead the Company’s next-generation platform for radio-agnostic crewed and uncrewed aerial command, control, and video systems – a critical part of Vislink’s long-term strategy.\n  * **_Introduced the 5G DragonFly V, the Company’s miniaturized HEVC 5G transmitter_****.** DragonFly V is designed to deliver real-time, high-quality video from Point-of-View (PoV) cameras, drones, and body-worn devices, delivering unprecedented first-person perspectives from live events and public safety.\n  * **_Launched a new corporate brand identity and website to drive global growth and strengthen market leadership_****.** The enhanced digital presence with improved SEO is designed to create additional sales opportunities by offering Vislink customers an intuitive, user-friendly platform for discovering and evaluating the Company’s solutions.\n\n\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n“We are pleased to report that our year-to-date revenue has increased over 26% compared to the same period in the prior year,” stated Mickey Miller, CEO of Vislink. “The results recorded in the third quarter alone reflected a decline in revenues caused by unusually high seasonal softness in the Live Production sector. Further, while we experienced robust 26% growth in the MilGov market, it was lower than our anticipated growth due to extended sales cycles with customers in the Middle East. However, we continue to observe a number of favorable signs this quarter that point to promising growth opportunities ahead. We now have numerous product evaluations taking place in the field as local, national, and international law enforcement and defense agencies seek to maintain a strategic edge in ensuring public safety. Our airborne video downlink systems, featuring the AeroLink transceiver and Air-to-Anywhere™ solution, remain the gold standard for robust, reliable, and efficient surveillance and emergency response solutions. We anticipate closing on many of these opportunities and expect to realize significant revenue from this sector moving forward.”\n\n“The Live Production market continues to present growth opportunities for our solutions. There has been considerable interest in our miniature DragonFly V transmitter. DragonFly V is designed to deliver real-time, high-quality video from Point-of-View (PoV) cameras, drones, and body-worn devices. The increasing demand for high performance combined with compact form factors in video transmission is driving interest in our broad range of solutions that address quality, immediacy, and flexibility, which are key requirements of broadcast media organizations. We expect to maintain targeted R&D investments in our product lines, with both incremental and major upgrades, to extend our competitive edge in the market.”\n\n“In the third quarter, we launched a new ERP system to unify and optimize our core operations, driving efficiency across the organization. The system has enabled us to identify significant costs that we believe can be removed from the business. Although we are pleased with our year-to-date revenue growth, we are responding proactively to near-term softness by consolidating operations while strategically positioning ourselves for continued growth in the MilGov sector. As part of this effort, we initiated a restructuring project that consolidates our manufacturing facilities into one location and streamlines our organization to better support our target markets. We expect the restructuring initiative to achieve over $6 million in annualized cost savings beginning in Q4 2024. We are also committed to continuously identifying further opportunities for cost reduction.”\n\n“Looking forward, we remain firmly committed to our three-year plan; however, the timeline for achieving our growth and profitability expectations may be extended due to current market dynamics. We have addressed our cost base to accommodate that extended period. We are confident that ongoing strong demand for our proven solutions, the transition toward MilGov markets and high-margin service revenue, and our unwavering focus on cost management position us well for executing our plans and attaining future sustainable and profitable growth.”\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nManagement will host a conference call today, November 14, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\nVislink management will host the presentation, followed by a question-and-answer period.\n\n**Toll-Free Number:** 1-833-953-2432\n\n**International Number:** 1-412-317-5761\n\n**Webcast:** Click [here](https://event.choruscall.com/mediaframe/webcast.html?webcastid=wOFeheRq) to register\n\nPlease register online approximately 15 minutes before the start time (although you may register, dial in, or access the webcast anytime during the call).\n\nThe conference call will be broadcast live [here](https://event.choruscall.com/mediaframe/webcast.html?webcastid=wOFeheRq) and available for replay via the Investor Relations section of Vislink’s [website](https://www.vislink.com/investors/).\n\nA replay of the conference call will be available after 11:30 a.m. Eastern Time on the same day through November 28, 2024.\n\n**Toll-Free Replay Number:** 1-877-344-7529\n\n**International Replay Number:** 1-412-317-0088\n\n**Replay ID:** 4856930\n\n** _Non-GAAP Financial Measure: EBITDA_**\n\n _To supplement our financial results presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), we are presenting EBITDA in this earnings release and the related earnings conference call. EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that is not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP and is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. We define EBITDA as our net income (loss), excluding the impact of depreciation and amortization expense and interest income and tax). We have presented EBITDA because it is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our operating performance, establish budgets, and develop operational goals for managing our business. In particular, we believe that excluding the impact of these expenses in calculating EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core operating performance._ _A reconciliation of non-GAAP EBITDA to GAAP net loss appears in the financial tables accompanying this press release, as set forth below._\n\n**_Note on Forward-looking Statements_**\n\n _Certain statements in this press release are forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties for purposes of the safe harbor provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
