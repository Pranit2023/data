(Nasdaq: SHPH) (“Shuttle Pharma”), a discovery and development stage specialty pharmaceutical company focused on improving outcomes for cancer patients treated with radiation therapy (RT), announced today first patient enrollment and dosing at the UVA Cancer Center in its Phase 2 Clinical Trial of Ropidoxuridine for the treatment of patients with glioblastoma. UVA is one of six cancer centers conducting the clinical trials. Shuttle Pharma previously announced the dosing of patients at Miami Cancer Institute, part of Baptist Health South Florida.\n\nThe Phase 2 trial will consist initially of 40 patients randomized into two different doses (20 @ 1,200 mg/day and 20 @ 960 mg/day) to determine an optimal dose. Once the Company determines the optimal dose, it will then add an additional 14 patients to the trial at the optimal dose allowing for the achievement of statistical significance with the end point being that of survival as compared to historical controls. The Phase 2 clinical trial will be conducted on the most aggressive brain tumors out there – IDH wild-type, methylation negative glioblastoma patients. This cohort of patients currently only have radiation as the standard of care, with more than half of the patients surviving for less than 12 months after diagnosis.\n\nRopidoxuridine (IPdR) is Shuttle Pharma’s lead candidate radiation sensitizer for use in combination with RT to treat brain tumors (glioblastoma), a deadly malignancy of the brain with no known cure. Shuttle Pharma previously received Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA, providing potential marketing exclusivity upon first FDA approval for treatment of the disease.\n\nIn addition to UVA Cancer Center, the Phase 2 trial is currently being conducted at Georgetown University Medical Center, John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center, Allegheny Health Network (AHN) Cancer Institute, and Miami Cancer Institute, part of Baptist Health South Florida.\n\n“I am pleased with the progress being made to advance our Phase 2 trial of Ropidoxuridine for the treatment of patients with glioblastoma with the addition of the first patient being dosed at UVA Cancer Center. This is the second trial location announced to have treated patients,” commented Shuttle Pharma’s Chairman and CEO, Anatoly Dritschilo, M.D. “We have strategically aligned the trial with nationally recognized cancer centers across a variety of regions to treat patients with IDH wild-type, methylation negative glioblastoma, the target of the clinical trial. I look forward to the continued advancement of the trial as we look to leverage radiation sensitizers to increase cancer cure rates, prolong patient survival and improve quality of life for patients suffering from glioblastoma.”\n\nAn estimated 800,000 patients in the US are treated with radiation therapy for their cancers yearly. According to the American Cancer Society and the American Society of Radiation Oncologists, about 50% are treated for curative purposes and the balance for therapeutic care. The market opportunity for radiation sensitizers lies with the 400,000 patients treated for curative purposes, with this number expected to grow by more than 22% over the next five years.\n\nMore information about the Phase 2 study (NCT06359379) can be found at [www.clinicaltrials.gov](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=OuUSXJ9-c-QQ09fC2vPS1c-cizEZlMqBDwQjKeAvP_NgBSXdjks533ehZyV17wDrUxDK_pf3VqX4hcX0eOWgqz54ZHk6TR02PYxizejz0x0=).\n\n**_About Shuttle Pharmaceuticals_**\n\nFounded in 2012 by faculty members of the Georgetown University Medical Center, Shuttle Pharma is a discovery and development stage specialty pharmaceutical company focused on improving the outcomes for cancer patients treated with radiation therapy (RT). Our mission is to improve the lives of cancer patients by developing therapies that are designed to maximize the effectiveness of RT while limiting the side effects of radiation in cancer treatment.

(Nasdaq: SHPH) (“Shuttle Pharma” or the “Company”), a discovery and development stage specialty pharmaceutical company focused on improving outcomes for cancer patients treated with radiation therapy (RT), today provided a corporate update in connection with the filing of its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\nShuttle Pharma’s recent highlights include the following:\n\n  * Successfully dosed first three patients in the Phase 2 clinical trial of Ropidoxuridine for the treatment of patients with brain tumors (glioblastoma). Ropidoxuridine is Shuttle Pharma’s lead candidate radiation sensitizer for use in combination with RT to treat glioblastoma, a deadly malignancy of the brain with no known cure. Additional patients are currently undergoing screening for enrollment in the trial.\n  * Finalized agreements with all six of the planned site enrollment locations which will be administering the Phase 2 clinical trial following the Company’s entry into agreements with Georgetown University Medical Center and UNC Medical Center. The Company previously entered agreements with the UVA Cancer Center, John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center, Allegheny Health Network (AHN) Cancer Institute, and Miami Cancer Institute, part of Baptist Health South Florida.\n  * Paid off the entirety of the outstanding balance due under Shuttle Pharma’s Senior Secured Convertible Note issued on January 11, 2023. The initial balance of the Note was $4.3 million and was originally repayable over a 26-month period ending March 11, 2025.\n  * Completed a $4.5 million public offering priced At-The-Market under Nasdaq rules. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering to fund IND-enabling and Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials of product candidates, including payments that will be made to the clinical research organization supporting the Phase 2 clinical trial for Ropidoxuridine, and for working capital and general corporate purposes.\n  * The Company also closed on a convertible note and warrant offering, receiving a total of $790,000 in gross proceeds, including $237,500 invested by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Anatoly Dritschilo.\n  * Cash balance as of October 31, 2024 was $4.1 million.\n\n\n\n“We made tremendous progress over the past few months to advance our Phase 2 clinical trial of Ropidoxuridine for the treatment of patients with glioblastoma, with the first three patients dosed in October 2024,” stated Shuttle Pharma’s Chairman and CEO, Anatoly Dritschilo, M.D. “The initial patient dosing followed the successful engagement of all six of the planned clinical trial site locations, each of which are nationally recognized cancer centers that are most likely to treat IDH wild-type, methylation negative glioblastoma patients – the target of the clinical trial. The initiation of the Phase 2 trial is a significant milestone for both Shuttle Pharma and the thousands of patients with brain tumors who currently lack effective therapies.”\n\n“Beyond these critical clinical developments, we also made progress in improving our balance sheet and funding the Phase 2 clinical trial. I want to thank all of the investors who have committed to helping us advance our mission to leverage radiation sensitizers to increase cancer cure rates, prolong patient survival and improve quality of life for patients suffering from glioblastoma,” Dr. Dritschilo concluded.\n\n**_About the Phase 2 Clinical Trial_**\n\nThe Phase 2 clinical trial has begun enrolling patients with the most aggressive brain tumors out there – IDH wild-type, methylation negative glioblastoma. Presently, radiation is the only approved standard of care for this particular group of patients, with more than half of the patients surviving for less than 12 months after diagnosis. Shuttle Pharma’s Phase 2 clinical trial will initially consist of 40 patients randomized into two different doses (20 @ 1,200 mg/day and 20 @ 960 mg/day) to determine an optimal dose. Once the Company determines the optimal dose, it will then add an additional 14 patients on the optimal dosage allowing for the achievement of statistical significance with the end point being that of survival as compared to historical controls. The Company expects the trial to be completed over a period of 18 to 24 months.\n\nAn estimated 800,000 patients in the US are treated with radiation therapy for their cancers yearly. According to the American Cancer Society and the American Society of Radiation Oncologists, about 50% are treated for curative purposes and the balance for therapeutic care. The market opportunity for radiation sensitizers lies with the 400,000 patients treated for curative purposes, with this number expected to grow by more than 22% over the next five years.\n\nMore information about Shuttle Pharma’s Phase 2 study (NCT06359379) can be found at [_www.clinicaltrials.gov_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=kEQPorG0bfWL45DbMILVVsSEVfBOao1V6_A8Qz9kRclzBS7VPP_dNWLtyOLbhWkwF3FeH-zxnoDkqjV0PdezbZQxM4c44H3tUr_O36EDMe0=).\n\n**_About Shuttle Pharmaceuticals_**\n\nFounded in 2012 by faculty members of the Georgetown University Medical Center, Shuttle Pharma is a discovery and development stage specialty pharmaceutical company focused on improving the outcomes for cancer patients treated with radiation therapy (RT).

Our mission is to improve the lives of cancer patients by developing therapies that are designed to maximize the effectiveness of RT while limiting the side effects of radiation in cancer treatment.
