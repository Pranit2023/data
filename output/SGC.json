EBITDA margin is defined as EBITDA divided by net sales. The Company believes EBITDA is an important measure of operating performance because it allows management, investors and others to evaluate and compare the Company’s core operating results from period to period by removing (i) the impact of the Company’s capital structure (interest expense from outstanding debt), (ii) tax consequences and (iii) asset base (depreciation and amortization). The Company uses EBITDA internally to monitor operating results and to evaluate the performance of its business. In addition, the compensation committee has used EBITDA in evaluating certain components of executive compensation, including performance-based annual incentive programs. EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income, cash flows from operating activities or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. The items excluded to calculate EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing the Company’s results of operations. The presentation of the Company’s EBITDA may change from time to time, including as a result of changed business conditions, new accounting pronouncements or otherwise. If the presentation changes, the Company undertakes to disclose any change between periods and the reasons underlying that change. The Company’s EBITDA may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure of another company because other entities may not calculate EBITDA in the same manner.\n\nSUPERIOR GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC.

EBITDA margin is defined as EBITDA divided by net sales. The Company believes EBITDA is an important measure of operating performance because it allows management, investors and others to evaluate and compare the Company’s core operating results from period to period by removing (i) the impact of the Company’s capital structure (interest expense from outstanding debt), (ii) tax consequences and (iii) asset base (depreciation and amortization). The Company uses EBITDA internally to monitor operating results and to evaluate the performance of its business. In addition, the compensation committee has used EBITDA in evaluating certain components of executive compensation, including performance-based annual incentive programs. EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income, cash flows from operating activities or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. The items excluded to calculate EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing the Company’s results of operations. The presentation of the Company’s EBITDA may change from time to time, including as a result of changed business conditions, new accounting pronouncements or otherwise. If the presentation changes, the Company undertakes to disclose any change between periods and the reasons underlying that change. The Company’s EBITDA may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure of another company because other entities may not calculate EBITDA in the same manner.\n\nSUPERIOR GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC.

These reclassifications\nhave no effect on previously reported results of operations.\n9\nTable of Contents\nWritten Put Options\nDuring the second quarter of 2022, the Company entered into written put options with a former employee that, if exercised by the former employee, required the Company to\nrepurchase up to 207,970 shares of its common stock at fair market value (as defined in the agreement), subject to certain limitations. The original fair value of the written put\noptions upon entering into the agreement was $3.6 million. The written put options were liabilities under ASC 480, \"Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity” because the options\nembody obligations to repurchase the Company’s shares by paying cash. As of December 31, 2023, the fair value of the written put options were $1.8 million. The fair value of the\nwritten put options was based directly on the Company’s stock price and were included in other current liabilities in our balance sheets. The written put options expire after\ntwenty-four months and contain certain quarterly maximums. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the remaining unexpired options of 132,924 expired resulting in a\n$2.4 million reduction in other current liabilities with an offset to additional paid-in capital. Unrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair value of the written put options\nwere included within selling and administrative expenses in our statements of comprehensive income.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nWe consider the applicability and impact of all Accounting Standard Updates (\"ASUs”). ASUs not listed below were assessed and determined to not be applicable.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, \"Segment Reporting (Topic 280)—Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\". The ASU requires that an entity\ndisclose significant segment expenses impacting profit and loss that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\"). The update is required to be applied\nretrospectively to prior periods presented, based on the significant segment expense categories identified and disclosed in the period of adoption. The amendments in this ASU are\nrequired to be adopted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. We\nwill adopt the disclosure requirements of ASU 2023-07 in our December 31, 2024 annual financial statements. The adoption of the ASU will only impact our disclosures, which will\nbe made on a retrospective basis, with no impacts on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. The Company’s adoption of this standard is not expected to have\na material impact on its financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740)—Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\". The ASU requires that an entity disclose specific\ncategories in the effective tax rate reconciliation as well as provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. Further, the ASU requires certain\ndisclosures of state versus federal income tax expense and taxes paid. The amendments in this ASU are required to be adopted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024,\nwhich for the Company is the calendar year beginning January 1, 2025. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued. The amendments\nshould be applied on a prospective basis although retrospective application is permitted. The adoption of this guidance will not affect the Company’s consolidated results of\noperations, financial position or cash flows and the Company is currently evaluating the effect the guidance will have on its disclosures.\nNOTE 2 – Inventories:\nInventories consisted of the following amounts (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nFinished goods $ 67,416 $ 72,370\nWork in process 1,462 671\nRaw materials 24,893 25,026\nInventories $ 93,771 $ 98,067\n10\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 3 – Long-Term Debt:\nDebt consisted of the following (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nCredit Facilities:\nRevolving credit facility due August 2027 $ 19,000 $ 25,000\nTerm loan due August 2027 66,094 69,375\n85,094 94,375\nLess:\nPayments due within one year included in current liabilities 5,625 4,688\nDebt issuance costs 714 898\nLong-term debt less current maturities $ 78,755 $ 88,789\nOn August 23, 2022, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (the \"Credit Agreement”) among the Company, the domestic subsidiaries of the Company, as guarantors, the\nlenders party thereto (the \"Lenders”), and PNC Bank, National Association, as administrative agent for the Lenders (the \"Administrative Agent”), pursuant to which the Lenders\nare providing the Company senior secured credit facilities maturing in August 2027 consisting of a revolving credit facility in the aggregate maximum principal amount of $125.0\nmillion and a term loan in the original aggregate principal amount of $75.0 million (collectively, the \"Credit Facilities”), and the ability to request incremental revolving credit or term\nloan facilities in an aggregate amount of up to an additional $75.0 million, subject to obtaining additional lender commitments and satisfying certain other conditions.\nObligations outstanding under the Credit Facilities accrue interest at a variable rate equal to the secured overnight financing rate (\"SOFR\") plus an adjustment between 0.10% and\n0.25% (depending on the applicable interest period) plus a margin between 1.0% and 2.0% (depending on the Company’s net leverage ratio). The weighted average interest rate on\nour outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facilities was 6.0% as of September 30, 2024. During the term of the revolving credit facility, the Company will pay a commitment fee\non the unused portion of the revolving credit facility equal to between 0.125% and 0.250% (depending on the Company’s net leverage ratio). The available balance under the\nrevolving credit facility is reduced by outstanding letters of credit. As of September 30, 2024, there were no outstanding letters of credit under the revolving credit facility.\nContractual principal payments for the term loan are as follows: remainder of 2024 - $1.4 million; 2025 - $5.6 million; 2026 - $6.6 million and 2027 - $52.5 million. The term loan does\nnot contain pre-payment penalties.\nThe Credit Facilities are secured by substantially all of the operating assets of the Company, and the Company’s obligations under the Credit Facilities are guaranteed by all of its\ndomestic subsidiaries. The Company’s obligations under the Credit Facilities are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default as defined in the Credit\nAgreement. The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default and negative covenants, including but not limited to those governing indebtedness, liens, fundamental\nchanges, investments, restricted payments (including dividends and related distributions), liquidations, mergers, consolidations or acquisitions, affiliate transactions and sales of\nassets or subsidiaries. The Credit Agreement also requires the Company to comply with a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.25 to 1.0 and a net leverage ratio not to exceed 4.0\nto 1.0. The Company’s net leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) is generally calculated as the ratio of (a) indebtedness minus unrestricted cash to (b) consolidated\nEBITDA for the four most recently ended fiscal quarters. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with these ratios.\n11\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 4 – Net Sales:\nFor our Branded Products and Healthcare Apparel segments, revenue is primarily generated from the sale of finished products to customers. Revenues for our Branded Products\nand Healthcare Apparel segments are recognized when the performance obligations under the contract terms are satisfied. For certain contracts with customers in which the\nCompany has an enforceable right to payment for goods with no alternative use, revenue is recognized over time upon receipt of finished goods into inventory. Revenue for goods\nthat do have an alternative use or that the customer is not obligated to purchase under the terms of a contract is generally recognized when the goods are transferred to the\ncustomer. The Company includes shipping and handling fees billable to customers in net sales. Shipping and handling activities that occur after the transfer of promised goods are\naccrued as control is transferred to the customer rather than being treated as a separate performance obligation.\nFor our Contact Centers segment, revenue is generated from providing our customers with contact center services. Revenue for our Contact Centers segment is recognized as\nservices are delivered.\nRevenue is measured at the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the goods or services. Variable consideration for estimated returns, allowances and other\nprice variances is recorded based upon historical experience and current allowance programs. Contract terms may involve variable consideration clauses such as sales discounts\nand customer rebates, and revenue is adjusted accordingly for these provisions. Estimated amounts are included in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a\nsignificant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. The promised amount of\nconsideration in a contract is not adjusted for the effects of a significant financing component when we expect, at contract inception, that the period between our transfer of a\npromised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that product or service will be one year or less. Sales taxes are excluded from the measurement of a\nperformance obligation’s transaction price. Sales commissions are expensed as incurred when we expect that the amortization period of such costs will be one year or less.\nFor further information regarding our net sales disaggregated by reportable segment see Note 9.\nContract Assets and Contract Liabilities\nThe following table provides information about accounts receivable, contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nAccounts receivable $ 98,822 $ 103,494\nCurrent contract assets 50,326 48,715\nCurrent contract liabilities 2,845 5,346\nContract assets relate to goods produced without an alternative use for which the Company has an enforceable right to payment but which has not yet been invoiced to the\ncustomer. The majority of the amounts included in contract assets on December 31, 2023 were transferred to accounts receivable during the nine months ended September 30,\n2024. Contract liabilities relate to payments received in advance of the Company completing its performance under a contract. Contract liabilities are included in other current\nliabilities in our balance sheets. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, $4.9 million of revenue was recognized from the contract liabilities balance as of December 31,\n2023.\n12\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 5 – Contingencies:\nThe purchase price to acquire substantially all of the assets of Sutter’s Mill Specialties, Inc. (\"Sutter’s Mill”) in December 2021 included contingent consideration based on varying\nlevels of Sutter’s Mill’s EBITDA in each measurement period from 2022 to 2024. In July 2023, management agreed to settle the remaining contingent consideration obligation\nassociated with this acquisition for $0.5 million, which was paid in the first quarter of 2024. The purchase price to acquire substantially all of the assets of Guardian Products, Inc.\n(\"Guardian”) in May 2022 included contingent consideration based on varying levels of Guardian’s EBITDA in each measurement period through April 2025. The estimated fair\nvalue of Guardian acquisition-related contingent consideration payable as of September 30, 2024 was $0.7 million, all of which is expected to be paid in the third quarter of 2025. In\nthe third quarter of 2024, $1.0 million was paid for the 2023 measurement period. The total estimated undiscounted remaining payment related to this contingent consideration\npayable is between $0.9 million and $1.0 million. The Company will continue to evaluate the Guardian liability for remeasurement at the end of each reporting period and any\nchanges will be recorded in the Company’s statements of comprehensive income. The carrying amount of the liability may fluctuate significantly and actual amounts paid may be\ndifferent from the estimated value of the liability.\nThe Company is involved in various legal actions and claims arising from the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate outcome of these matters is\nnot expected to have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows, or financial position.\nNOTE 6 – Share-Based Compensation:\nShare-based compensation expense is recorded in selling and administrative expense in the statements of comprehensive income.

Stock options are also granted to\noutside members of the Board of Directors of the Company. The Company determines the fair value of stock options and SARs at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes\nvaluation model.\nAll stock options and SARs vest between one and three years after the grant date. Employee awards expire five years after the grant date, and those issued to directors expire ten\nyears after the grant date. The Company issues new shares upon the exercise of stock options and SARs. Stock options, as well as SARs granted in tandem with stock options, are\nsubject to accelerated vesting under certain circumstances as outlined in the 2013 Incentive Stock and Awards Plan (the \"2013 Plan”) or 2022 Equity Incentive and Awards Plan\n(the \"2022 Plan”), as applicable.\n13\nTable of Contents\nA summary of stock option transactions during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 follows:\nWeighted Average Aggregate\nNo. of Weighted Average Remaining Life Intrinsic Value\nShares Exercise Price (in years) (in thousands)\nOutstanding, January 1, 2024 953,176 $ 14.73 2.80 $ 1,718\nGranted(1) 183,800 14.38\nExercised (122,395) 10.71\nLapsed or cancelled (199,984) 16.49\nOutstanding, September 30, 2024 814,597 14.82 3.26 2,165\nExercisable, September 30, 2024 341,469 18.59 2.22 494\n(1) The weighted average grant date fair value of stock options granted was $4.27 per share.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had $0.8 million in unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options to be recognized over the remaining weighted\naverage vesting period of 1.0 year.\nA summary of stock-settled SARs transactions during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 follows:\nWeighted Average Aggregate\nNo. of Weighted Average Remaining Life Intrinsic Value\nShares Exercise Price (in years) (in thousands)\nOutstanding, January 1, 2024 292,508 $ 14.35 2.07 $ 506\nGranted(1) 79,128 13.84\nExercised (17,920) 8.48\nLapsed or cancelled (81,770) 19.23\nOutstanding, September 30, 2024 271,946 13.12 2.34 832\nExercisable, September 30, 2024 137,742 13.37 0.79 479\n(1) The weighted average grant date fair value of SARs granted was $3.80 per share.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had $0.3 million in unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested SARs to be recognized over the remaining weighted average\nvesting period of 1.0 year.\nRestricted Stock\nThe Company has granted shares of restricted stock to directors and certain employees, which vest at a specified future date, generally after three years, over five years or when\ncertain conditions are met.

The\nservice-based awards vest after the service period is met, which is generally three to five years. Expense for these grants is based on the fair value on the date of the grant and is\nbeing recognized on a straight-line basis over the respective service period. The performance-based awards generally vest after five years if the performance and service targets are\nmet. The Company evaluates the performance conditions associated with these grants each reporting period to determine the expected number of shares to be issued. Expense for\ngrants of performance shares is recognized on a straight-line basis over the respective service period based on the grant date fair value and expected number of shares to be\nissued. The awards are subject to accelerated vesting on a pro rata basis under certain circumstances as outlined in the 2013 Plan or 2022 Plan, as applicable, except in those\ncircumstances in which award agreements or change in control agreements specify full vesting.\nOn May 1, 2024, the Compensation Committee approved the Company entering into a grant of 125,000 and 75,000 performance shares to Michael Benstock, Chief Executive Officer\nand Michael Koempel, Chief Financial Officer, respectively, under the 2022 Equity Incentive and Awards Plan.

At the end of each interim period, the\nCompany makes its best estimate of the annual expected effective tax rate and applies that rate to its ordinary year-to-date income or loss. The tax expense or benefit related to\nsignificant, unusual, or extraordinary items that will be separately reported or reported net of their related tax effect are individually computed and recognized in the interim period in\nwhich those items occur.\nThe computation of the annual expected effective tax rate at each interim period requires certain estimates and assumptions including, but not limited to, the expected operating\nincome for the year and permanent and temporary differences. The accounting estimates used to compute the provision for income taxes may change as new events occur,\nadditional information is obtained or the tax environment changes.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a provision for income taxes of $1.2 million, which represents an effective tax rate of 17.8%. For the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a provision for income taxes of $1.9 million, which represents an effective tax rate of 16.1%. The income tax provision and\nthe effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily impacted by the variability in the mix of earnings across the Company’s foreign and\ndomestic operations, subject to various statutory tax rates in those jurisdictions.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded a provision for income taxes of $0.2 million, which represents an effective tax rate of 4.9%. For the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded a provision for income taxes of $0.4 million, which represents an effective tax rate of 6.8%. The income tax\nprovision and the effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily impacted by the variability in the mix of earnings across the Company’s\nforeign and domestic operations subject to various statutory tax rates in those jurisdictions.\nNOTE 8 – Net Income Per Share:\nThe Company’s basic net income per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted net income per\nshare includes the effect of the Company’s outstanding stock options, stock appreciation rights, nonvested shares of restricted stock and nonvested performance shares, if the\ninclusion of these items is dilutive.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of basic and diluted net income per share for the periods presented:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet income used in the computation of basic and diluted net income per share (in thousands) $ 5,403 $ 3,114 $ 9,915 $ 5,215\nWeighted average shares outstanding - basic 16,107,549 15,992,792 16,118,885 15,954,264\nDilutive common stock equivalents 436,441 162,563 470,029 178,568\nWeighted average shares outstanding - diluted 16,543,990 16,155,355 16,588,914 16,132,832\nNet income per share:\nBasic $ 0.34 $ 0.19 $ 0.62 $ 0.33\nDiluted $ 0.33 $ 0.19 $ 0.60 $ 0.32\nAwards to purchase 309,778 and 1,198,603 shares of common stock with weighted average exercise prices of $21.44 and $15.32 per share were outstanding during the three months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted net income per share because the awards’ exercise prices were greater than\nthe average market price of the common shares.\nAwards to purchase 335,071 and 1,158,819 shares of common stock with weighted average exercise prices of $21.40 and $15.84 per share were outstanding during the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted net income per share because the awards’ exercise prices were greater than\nthe average market price of the common shares.\n16\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 9 – Operating Segment Information:\nThe Company manages and reports the following segments:\nBranded Products segment: Primarily through our signature marketing brands BAMKO® and HPI®, we produce and sell customized merchandising solutions, promotional\nproducts and branded uniform programs.

Such costs\nare recognized as selling and administrative expenses in the Branded Products and Healthcare Apparel segments. Income and expenses related to corporate functions that are not\nspecifically attributable to an individual reportable segment are presented within Other in the tables below.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, our chief operating decision maker began to evaluate the performance of our segments using Segment EBITDA instead of income before income\ntaxes. The Company has modified its presentation of segment performance to be consistent with this change, including prior periods presented for consistent and comparable\npresentation.

(together with its subsidiaries, the \"Company,” \"Superior,” \"we,” \"our,” or \"us”) is comprised of three reportable business segments: (1)\nBranded Products, (2) Healthcare Apparel and (3) Contact Centers.\nBranded Products\nIn our Branded Products segment, we produce and sell customized merchandising solutions, promotional products and branded uniform programs to our customers. As a strategic\nbranding partner, we offer our customers customized branding solutions and strategies that generate favorable brand impressions, bolster customer retention and enhance\nemployee engagement. Our products are sold to customers in a wide range of industries, including retail chain, food service, entertainment, technology, transportation and other\nindustries. Sales volumes in this segment are impacted by a number of factors, including marketing programs of our customers and turnover of our customers’ employees, often\ntimes driven by the opening and closing of locations. From a long-term perspective, we believe that synergies within this segment will create opportunities to cross-sell products to\nnew and existing customers.\nHealthcare Apparel\nIn our Healthcare Apparel segment, we manufacture (through third parties or in our own facilities) and sell a wide range of healthcare apparel, such as scrubs, lab coats, protective\napparel and patient apparel. We sell our brands of healthcare service apparel to healthcare laundries, dealers, distributors, retailers and consumers primarily in the United States.\nFrom a long-term perspective, we expect that demand for our signature marketing brands, including Fashion Seal Healthcare® and Wink® (within CID Resources), will continue to\nprovide opportunities for growth and increased market share.\nContact Centers\nIn our Contact Centers segment (also known as \"The Office Gurus”), which operates in El Salvador, Belize, Jamaica, Dominican Republic, and the United States, we\nprovide outsourced, nearshore business process outsourcing, contact and call-center support services to North American customers. These services are also provided internally\nto the Company’s other two operating segments. The Office Gurus has become an award-winning business process outsourcer offering inbound and outbound voice, email, text,\nchat and social media support. The nearshore call-center market has grown as businesses look to reduce operating costs while maintaining high-quality customer support.\nNearshore operators are able to provide comparable service to their U.S. counterparts at a fraction of the price. With an environment and career path designed to attract and\nmaintain top talent across all sites, we believe The Office Gurus is positioned well to continue growing this business.\n19\nTable of Contents\nGlobal Economic and Political Conditions\nEconomic and political events over the past several years have altered the landscape in which we and other U.S. companies operate in a variety of ways. World events, including\nthe Russian invasion of Ukraine and the resulting economic sanctions have impacted the global economy, including by exacerbating inflationary and other pressures. The ongoing\nconflict in the Middle East could continue to affect oil prices and have other negative effects on the global economy. Civil unrest in countries where we manufacture products,\nsuch as Haiti, may result in our facilities incurring damage or destruction that interrupts our manufacturing processes and adversely affects our reputation and our relationships\nwith our customers. While inflation and interest rates decreased in 2024, the effects of the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, further fluctuations in inflationary conditions and\ninterest rates, additional sanctions or retaliatory measures related to the Russia-Ukraine crisis or other situations, including deteriorating or prolonged diplomatic tension between\nthe United States and China, could further negatively affect U.S. and international commerce and exacerbate or prolong the period of high energy prices.\nProlonged or recurring disruptions or instability in the United States and global economies, and how the world reacts to those disruptions or instability, could have long-term\nimpacts on our business. These business impacts could negatively affect us in a number of ways, including, but not limited to, reduced demand for our core products and services,\nreductions to our revenue and profitability, costs associated with complying with new or amended laws and regulations affecting our business, declines in our stock price, reduced\navailability and less favorable terms of future borrowings, valuation of our pension obligations, reduced credit-worthiness of our customers, and potential impairment of the\ncarrying value of indefinite-lived intangible assets.\n20\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023\nFor the Three Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nNet sales:\nBranded Products $ 92,547 $ 83,512 $ 9,035 10.8%\nHealthcare Apparel 33,025 29,649 3,376 11.4%\nContact Centers 25,038 24,121 917 3.8%\nNet intersegment eliminations (920) (1,156) 236 (20.4%)\nConsolidated net sales 149,690 136,126 13,564 10.0%\nGross margin:\nBranded Products 33,510 28,924 4,586 15.9%\nHealthcare Apparel 13,809 11,484 2,325 20.2%\nContact Centers 13,742 13,397 345 2.6%\nNet intersegment eliminations (515) (607) 92 (15.2%)\nConsolidated gross margin 60,546 53,198 7,348 13.8%\nSelling and administrative expenses:\nBranded Products 24,223 23,418 805 3.4%\nHealthcare Apparel 11,240 9,493 1,747 18.4%\nContact Centers 11,482 10,224 1,258 12.3%\nIntersegment Eliminations (515) (607) 92 (15.2%)\nOther 5,785 4,718 1,067 22.6%\nConsolidated selling and administrative expenses 52,215 47,246 4,969 10.5%\nOther periodic pension cost 189 214 (25) (11.7%)\nInterest expense 1,569 2,464 (895) (36.3%)\nIncome before income tax expense 6,573 3,274 3,299 100.8%\nIncome tax expense 1,170 160 1,010 631.3%\nNet income 5,403 3,114 2,289 73.5%\nEBITDA $ 11,654 $ 9,253 $ 2,401 25.9%\n21\nTable of Contents\nNet Income\nThe Company generated net income of $5.4 million and $3.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in net income during the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to an increase in net sales and gross margins at our Branded\nProducts and Healthcare Apparel segments, a decrease in interest expense, partially offset by an increase in selling and administrative expenses across all three of our reportable\nsegments.\nEBITDA\nEBITDA was $11.7 million and $9.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. EBITDA increase was primarily due to increased net sales and\ngross margins at our Branded Products and Healthcare Apparel segments, partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses across all of our reportable\nsegments. For a reconciliation of EBITDA to net income, its most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, please read \"Non-\nGAAP Financial Measure” below.\nNet Sales\nNet sales for the Company increased 10.0%, or $13.6 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.

The increase\nwas primarily due to expansion of business within existing accounts and new client wins.\nHealthcare Apparel net sales increased 11.4%, or $3.4 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The\nincrease was primarily due to higher online sales from both our wholesale customers and our direct-to-consumer website, as well as, the timing of wholesale orders as compared to\nlast year.\nContact Centers net sales increased 3.8% or $0.9 million, before intersegment eliminations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023.

The gross margin rate\nincrease was driven by the Branded Products and Healthcare Apparel segments.\nGross margin rate for our Branded Products segment was 36.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 34.6% for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The\ngross margin rate increased as compared to the prior year period primarily driven by sourcing mix resulting in lower product costs and pricing increases to existing customers.\nGross margin rate for our Healthcare Apparel segment was 41.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 38.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The\ngross margin rate increased as compared to the prior year period primarily due to costs of goods favorability associated with our Haiti manufacturing facility during the current\nperiod.\nGross margin rate for our Contact Centers segment was 54.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 55.5% for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The rate\ndecrease was primarily due to increased employee related costs of our agents.\nSelling and Administrative Expenses\nAs a percentage of net sales, total selling and administrative expenses was 34.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 34.7% for the three months ended September\n30, 2023. The rate increase was primarily driven by increases in employee related costs, third-party professional services and expenditures related to marketing and advertising\nactivities.\nAs a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses for our Branded Products segment was 26.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 28.0% for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2023. The rate decrease was primarily driven by expense leverage from an increase in net sales as compared to the prior period, partially offset by\nincreases in sales commissions and employee related costs.\nAs a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses for our Healthcare Apparel segment was 34.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 32.0% for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2023. The rate increased as compared to the prior year period as a result of increases in marketing and advertising activities along with employee\nrelated costs, which were partially offset by expense leverage from an increase in net sales.\nAs a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses for our Contact Centers segment was 45.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 42.4% for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2023. The rate increased as compared to the prior year period driven by an increase in the provision for bad debts and an increase in employee\nrelated costs.\nSelling and administrative expenses for our Other segment, which represents unallocated Corporate costs, increased by $1.1 million, primarily driven by an increase in employee\nrelated costs and third party professional services.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased to $1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $2.5 million for three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was due to a\n$36.2 million decrease in our weighted average outstanding borrowings along with a decrease in the weighted average interest rate on those borrowings from 7.4% for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023 to 6.3% for the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense increased to $1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate\nwas 17.8% and 4.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Income tax expense and the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30,\n2024 and September 30, 2023 was primarily impacted by the variability in the mix of earnings across the Company’s foreign and domestic operations, subject to various statutory tax\nrates in those jurisdictions. The effective tax rate may vary from quarter to quarter due to discrete, unusual or non-recurring items, the resolution of income tax audits, changes in\ntax laws, the tax impact from employee share-based payments, or other items.\n23\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nFor the Nine Months Ended September\n30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nNet sales:\nBranded Products $ 260,911 $ 244,955 $ 15,956 6.5%\nHealthcare Apparel 88,854 85,875 2,979 3.5%\nContact Centers 73,422 68,935 4,487 6.5%\nNet intersegment eliminations (2,919) (3,704) 785 (21.2%)\nConsolidated net sales 420,268 396,061 24,207 6.1%\nGross margin:\nBranded Products 93,377 80,463 12,914 16.0%\nHealthcare Apparel 35,519 32,003 3,516 11.0%\nContact Centers 39,347 37,390 1,957 5.2%\nNet intersegment eliminations (1,625) (1,954) 329 (16.8%)\nConsolidated gross margin 166,618 147,902 18,716 12.7%\nSelling and administrative expenses:\nBranded Products 70,486 63,833 6,653 10.4%\nHealthcare Apparel 30,931 28,461 2,470 8.7%\nContact Centers 32,436 29,502 2,934 9.9%\nIntersegment Eliminations (1,625) (1,954) 329 (16.8%)\nOther 17,111 14,165 2,946 20.8%\nConsolidated selling and administrative expenses 149,339 134,007 15,332 11.4%\nOther periodic pension cost 567 642 (75) (11.7%)\nInterest expense 4,897 7,658 (2,761) (36.1%)\nIncome before income tax expense 11,815 5,595 6,220 111.2%\nIncome tax expense 1,900 380 1,520 400.0%\nNet income 9,915 5,215 4,700 90.1%\nEBITDA $ 26,844 $ 23,584 $ 3,260 13.8%\n24\nNet Income\nThe Company generated net income of $9.9 million and $5.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The Company’s balance sheet generally provides the ability to pursue acquisitions, invest in new product lines and technologies and invest in additional working capital as\nnecessary.\nThe Company’s primary source of liquidity has been its net income and the use of credit facilities and term loans as described further below. In the future, the Company may\ncontinue to use credit facilities and other secured and unsecured borrowings as a source of liquidity. The Company may also begin relying on the issuance of equity or debt\nsecurities. There can be no assurance that any such financings would be available to us on reasonable terms. Any future issuances of equity securities or securities convertible\ninto or exercisable for equity securities may be dilutive to our shareholders. Additionally, the cost of the Company’s future sources of liquidity may differ from the costs of the\nCompany’s sources of liquidity to date.\nWorking Capital Needs\nWe utilize working capital to fund the operations of our business and have certain related contractual obligations, including commitments under site leases and other non-\ncancelable contracts.\nOne of our largest cash requirements is for the purchase of inventory. Superior carries inventories of both raw materials and finished products, the practice of which requires\nsubstantial working capital, which we believe to be common in the industry.\nMaterial Short-Term Plans for Cash\nFor the next twelve months, our primary capital requirements are to maintain our operations, meet contractual obligations, fund capital expenditures, pay dividends and for other\ngeneral corporate purposes. Management currently believes that the combination of our current cash level, cash flows provided by operating activities and availability under the\nrevolving credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy the above requirements for the next twelve months.\nMaterial Long-Term Plans for Cash\nBeyond the next twelve months, our principal demand for funds will be for maintenance of our core business, to satisfy long term contractual obligations and the continuation of\nthe Company’s ongoing capital expenditure program designed to improve the effectiveness and capabilities of our facilities and technology. The Company at all times evaluates its\ncapital expenditure program in light of prevailing economic conditions. The Company’s material contractual obligations include outstanding debt, operating leases, long-term\npension liability and non-qualified deferred compensation plan liabilities in Other Liabilities. Management currently believes that the combination of our current cash level, cash\nflows provided by operating activities and availability under the revolving credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy the above requirements.\n27\nCash Flows\nOur cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the statements of cash flows, are summarized in the following table (in thousands):\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nNet cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ 24,497 $ 59,388\nInvesting activities (2,911) (4,023)\nFinancing activities (22,400) (55,455)\nEffect of exchange rates on cash (709) 97\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (1,523) $ 7\nOperating Activities. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to cash outflows for inventories, contract assets, accounts payable and other current liabilities, accounts receivable and prepaid\nexpenses and other current assets, partially offset by an increase in net income. Working capital cash changes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily\nincluded decreases of $16.0 million in inventories, $7.9 million in contract assets, $6.4 million in accounts payable and other current liabilities, $5.8 million in accounts receivable and\n$4.8 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets, partially offset by an increase of $4.7 million in net income.\nInvesting Activities. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30,\n2023 was attributable to a decrease of $1.1 million in capital expenditures.\nCapital expenditures by reportable segment are as follows:\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nCapital Expenditures:\nBranded Products $ 714 $ 2,093\nHealthcare Apparel 986 641\nContact Centers 1,124 1,221\nOther 87 68\nConsolidated capital Expenditures 2,911 4,023\nFinancing Activities. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30,\n2023 was primarily attributable to a decrease of $38.5 million in net repayments of debt and cash paid to acquire shares of the Company's common stock as part of the new\nrepurchase program.\n28\nTable of Contents\nDebt Activity\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had $9.3 million of net debt payments, consisting of $31.0 million in borrowings net of $40.3 million of payments. For\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company had $47.8 million of net debt payments, consisting of $4.0 million in borrowings net of $51.8 million of payments. Both the\ndebt payments and borrowings during 2024 and 2023 primarily related to the utilization of our revolving credit facility in the normal course of business.\nPlease refer to Note 5 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements located in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional details on our\noutstanding long-term debt, which disclosure is incorporate herein by reference.\nDividends and Share Repurchase Program\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company paid cash dividends of $7.0 million and $6.9 million, respectively. The Company anticipates that it will\ncontinue to pay dividends in the future as financial conditions permit.\nOn August 9, 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase plan. Under the plan, the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $10 million of its\ncommon stock over a period of one year ending in August 2025. This plan replaces the May 2, 2019 plan, as amended, which authorized the repurchase of up to 750,000 shares.\n92,549 shares had been repurchased under the May 2, 2019 plan as of August 9, 2024. No further shares will be repurchased under that plan. The new stock repurchase plan allows\nthe Company to purchase common stock from time to time through, among other ways, open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block purchases, and/or\npursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, subject to applicable securities laws and other legal requirements and relevant factors. The number of shares purchased and the timing of\nany purchases will depend upon a number of factors, including the price and availability of the Company’s stock and general market conditions. The stock repurchase plan may be\nmodified, suspended or terminated at any time, without prior notice. Shares repurchased may be reissued later in connection with employee benefit plans and other general\ncorporate purposes. Shares purchased under the common stock repurchase plan are constructively retired and returned to unissued status. See Part II-Other Information, Item\n2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.\n29\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nSee Part II, Item 7, \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\" in our Annual Report\non Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measure\nEBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as net income excluding interest expense, income tax expense and depreciation and amortization expense. The\nCompany believes EBITDA is an important measure of operating performance because it allows management, investors and others to evaluate and compare the Company’s core\noperating results from period to period by removing (i) the impact of the Company’s capital structure (interest expense from outstanding debt), (ii) tax consequences and (iii) asset\nbase (depreciation and amortization). The Company uses EBITDA internally to monitor operating results and to evaluate the performance of its business. In addition, the\ncompensation committee has used EBITDA in evaluating certain components of executive compensation, including performance-based annual incentive programs.\nEBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income, cash flows from operating\nactivities or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. The items excluded to calculate EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing the\nCompany’s results of operations. The presentation of the Company’s EBITDA may change from time to time, including as a result of changed business conditions, new\naccounting pronouncements or otherwise. If the presentation changes, the Company undertakes to disclose any change between periods and the reasons underlying that change.\nThe Company’s EBITDA may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure of another company because other entities may not calculate EBITDA in the same manner.\nThe following table reconciles net income to EBITDA (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet income $ 5,403 $ 3,114 $ 9,915 $ 5,215\nInterest expense 1,569 2,464 4,897 7,658\nIncome tax expense 1,170 160 1,900 380\nDepreciation and amortization 3,252 3,515 9,872 10,331\nImpairment Charge 260 - 260 -\nEBITDA $ 11,654 $ 9,253 $ 26,844 $ 23,584\n30\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements\nCertain matters discussed in this Form 10-Q are \"forward-looking statements” intended to qualify for the safe harbors from liability established by the Private Securities\nLitigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements can generally be identified by use of the words \"may,” \"will,” \"should,” \"could,” \"expect,” \"anticipate,”\n\"estimate,” \"believe,” \"intend,” \"project,” \"potential,” or \"plan” or the negative of these words or other variations on these words or comparable terminology. Forward-\nlooking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may include, without limitation: (1) projections of revenue, income, and other items relating to our financial\nposition and results of operations, including short term and long term plans for cash, (2) statements of our plans, objectives, strategies, goals and intentions, (3) statements\nregarding the capabilities, capacities, market position and expected development of our business operations and (4) statements of expected industry and general economic\ntrends.\nSuch forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may materially adversely affect the anticipated results. Such risks and uncertainties\ninclude, but are not limited to, the following: the impact of competition; uncertainties related to supply disruptions, inflationary environment (including with respect to the\ncost of finished goods and raw materials and shipping costs), employment levels (including labor shortages) and general economic and political conditions in the areas of the\nworld in which the Company operates or from which it sources its supplies or the areas of the United States of America (\"U.S.” or \"United States”) in which the Company’s\ncustomers are located; changes in the healthcare, retail chain, food service, transportation and other industries where uniforms and service apparel are worn; our ability to\nidentify suitable acquisition targets, discover liabilities associated with such businesses during the diligence process, successfully integrate any acquired businesses, or\nsuccessfully manage our expanding operations; the price and availability of raw materials; attracting and retaining senior management and key personnel; the effect of the\nCompany’s previously disclosed material weakness in internal control over financial reporting; the Company’s ability to successfully remediate its material weakness in\ninternal control over financial reporting and to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting; and other factors described in the Company’s filings with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission, including those described in the \"Risk Factors” section herein and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Shareholders, potential investors and other readers are urged to\nconsider these factors carefully in evaluating the forward-looking statements made herein and are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.\nThe forward-looking statements made herein are only made as of the date of this Form 10-Q and we disclaim any obligation to publicly update such forward-looking\nstatements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances, except as may be required by law.\nITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are subject to market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates on our debt. Interest on our Credit Facilities is based upon the secured overnight financing rate\n(\"SOFR”). As SOFR is a relatively new reference rate with a limited history, there may or may not be more volatility than with other reference rates such as LIBOR, which may result\nin increased borrowing costs for the Company. A hypothetical increase in the SOFR of 100 basis points as of January 1, 2024 would have resulted in approximately $0.7 million in\nadditional pre-tax interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For further information regarding our debt instruments, see Note 3 to the Financial Statements.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nSales to customers outside of the United States are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which may negatively impact gross margin realized on our sales.\nLess than 5% of our sales contracts are denominated in foreign currencies. We cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results. In certain cases, we\nmay enter into foreign currency cash flow hedges to reduce the variability of cash flows associated with our sales and expenses denominated in foreign currency. There can be no\nassurance that our strategies will adequately protect our operating results from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations.\n31\nTable of Contents\nFinancial results of our foreign subsidiaries in the Branded Products segment are denominated in their local currencies, which include the Hong Kong dollar, the Chinese renminbi,\nthe British pound, the Indian rupee, the Brazilian real, Colombian peso and the Canadian dollar. These operations may also have net assets and liabilities not denominated in their\nfunctional currency, which exposes us to changes in foreign currency exchange rates that impact income. Excluding intercompany payables and receivables considered to be long-\nterm investments, changes in exchange rates for assets and liabilities not denominated in their functional currency are reported as foreign currency transaction gains (losses)\nwithin selling and administrative expenses in our statements of comprehensive income. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, foreign currency losses were\nnot significant. We also have exposure to foreign currency exchange risk from the translation of foreign subsidiaries from the local currency into the U.S. dollar. Comprehensive\nincome during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 included a foreign currency translation adjustment loss of $1.2 million and a foreign currency translation\nadjustment gain of $0.2 million, respectively.\nITEM 4. Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Company conducted an evaluation, under supervision and with the participation of the Company’s principal executive officer, Michael Benstock, and the Company’s principal\nfinancial officer, Michael Koempel, of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act)\nas of the end of the period covered by this report (the \"Evaluation Date”). Based on such evaluation, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer\nconcluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of the material weakness in the Company’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting described below and as previously disclosed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023.\nA material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material\nmisstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nAs of December 31, 2022, management identified a material weakness relating to segregation of duties, change management and user access within certain proprietary information\ntechnology systems of the Contact Centers segment. The Company determined that management’s review controls over these areas are not designed effectively to detect a\nmaterial misstatement related to the completeness, accuracy, and presentation of the financial statements. This material weakness continues to exist as of September 30, 2024.\nNotwithstanding the identified material weakness, management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have determined, based on the procedures\nwe have performed, that the consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q present fairly, in all material respects, our financial condition, results\nof operations and cash flows at September 30, 2024 and for the periods presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nOngoing Remediation Efforts with Respect to the Material Weakness\nThe Company’s management, under the oversight of the Audit Committee, has taken the following actions to remediate the material weakness relating to certain proprietary\ninformation technology systems of the Contact Centers segment identified as of December 31, 2022: (i) deployed enhanced change management software and reassessed approval\nauthority levels in order to better manage access and program changes within our proprietary system; (ii) implemented processes and controls to better identify and manage\nsegregation of duties; and (iii) designed and implemented additional enhanced review and monitoring controls.\nWhile the Company was able to test the design effectiveness of the enhanced controls, the material weakness will not be considered remediated until the enhanced controls\noperate for a sufficient period of time, and management has concluded, through testing, that the related controls are effective. Therefore, the material weakness continued to\nexist as of September 30, 2024. The Company will monitor the effectiveness of its remediation plan and will refine its remediation plan as appropriate.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nExcept as discussed above under \"Ongoing Remediation Efforts with Respect to the Material Weakness,” there were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial\nreporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial\nreporting.\n32\nTable of Contents\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1. Legal Proceedings\nWe are a party to certain lawsuits in the ordinary course of business. We do not believe that these proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect\non our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nWe are exposed to certain risks and uncertainties that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results. Except as set forth below,\nthere have been no material changes to the Risk Factors described in Part I, Item 1A-Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nOur manufacturing facilities and warehouses in Haiti are at risk of damage or disruptions from civil unrest and other occurrences.\nOur Healthcare Apparel segment relies on our manufacturing facilities and warehouses in Haiti for the manufacturing and storage of finished goods. Our manufacturing facilities\nand warehouses may be damaged or our ability to use or access them may be disrupted as a result of civil unrest or other occurrences in Haiti. Such events may interfere with our\nmanufacturing processes, information systems, telecommunication services, and product delivery for sustained periods and may also may make it difficult or impossible for\nemployees to reach our business locations. Damage or destruction that interrupts our manufacturing facilities could adversely affect our reputation, our relationships with our\ncustomers, our leadership team’s ability to administer and supervise our business, and cause us to incur substantial additional expenditures to repair or replace damaged\nequipment or facilities or commence alternate production locations. While we currently have commercial liability insurance, our insurance coverage may not be\nsufficient. Prolonged disruption of our manufacturing processes in Haiti also may entitle some of our customers to amend or terminate their contracts with us. Worsening\nconditions in Haiti may also result in the displacement of native Haitians looking for refuge in neighboring Dominican Republic which may result in the closure of roads and port\naccess which may limit or restrict our normal and recurring business in Haiti. Any of the above factors may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition.\n33\nTable of Contents\nITEM 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nThere were no unregistered sales of equity securities during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that were not previously reported in a current report on Form 8-K.\nThe table below sets forth information with respect to purchases made by or on behalf of Superior Group of Companies, Inc. or any \"affiliated purchaser” (as defined in Rule 10b-\n18(a)(3) under the Exchange Act) of our common stock during the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nTotal Number of\nShares\nPurchased as Approximate Dollar\nPart of Publicly Value of Shares that\nTotal Number of Announced May Yet Be\nShares Average Price Plans or Purchased Under the\nPeriod Purchased Paid per Share Programs Plans or Programs (1)\nJuly 1, 2024 to July 31, 2024 - $ - -\nAugust 1, 2024 to August 31, 2024 263,231 13.67 263,231\nSeptember 1, 2024 to September 30, 2024 188,555 14.57 188,555\nTotal 451,786 $14.05 451,786\n(1) On August 9, 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase plan. Under the plan, the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $10 million of\nits common stock over a period of one year ending in August 2025. The stock repurchase plan allows the Company to purchase common stock from time to time through,\namong other ways, open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block purchases, and/or pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, subject to applicable securities\nlaws and other legal requirements and relevant factors. The number of shares purchased and the timing of any purchases will depend upon a number of factors, including\nthe price and availability of the Company’s stock and general market conditions.\nUnder our Credit Agreement, if an event of default exists, we may not make distributions to our shareholders. The Credit Agreement also contains other restrictions. See Part II,\nItem 7, \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity & Capital Resources\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023.” The Company is in full compliance with all terms, conditions and covenants of such agreement.\nITEM 3.

Benstock: Chief Executive Officer & Director, Superior Group of Cos., Inc.\nMichael Koempel: Chief Financial Officer, Superior Group of Cos., Inc.\nOTHER PARTICIPANTS\nKevin Mark Steinke: Analyst, Barrington Research Associates, Inc.\nJames Sidoti: Analyst, Sidoti & Co. LLC\nKeegan Cox, DA Davidson\nDavid P. Marsh, Analyst, Singular Research\nOperator: Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the Superior Group of Companies Third Quarter 2024\nConference Call. With us today are Michael Benstock, Chief Executive Officer, and Mike Koempel, Chief\nFinancial Officer. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.\nThis call may contain forward-looking statements regarding the company's plans, initiatives and\nstrategies and the anticipated financial performance of the company, including, but not limited to, sales\nand profitability. Such statements are based upon management's current expectations, projections,\nestimates and assumptions. Words such as expect, believe, anticipate, think, outlook, hope and\nvariations of such words and similar expressions identify such forward-looking statements. Forward-\nlooking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause future results to\ndiffer materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties\nare further disclosed in the company's periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission,\nincluding, but not limited to, the company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Quarterly\nReports on Form 10-Q. Shareholders, potential investors and other readers are urged to consider these\nfactors carefully in evaluating the forward-looking statements made herein and are cautioned not to\nplace undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. The company does not undertake to update\nthe forward-looking statements, except as required by law.\nAnd now, I'll turn the call over to Michael Benstock. Please go ahead.\nMichael L. Benstock: Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to today's call. I'm going to start\nwith third quarter financial highlights and then discuss our three business segments. After that, I'll hand\nit over to Mike, who'll walk us through a more detailed financial discussion as well as our outlook for the\nrest of the year. When Mike is done, we'll open the call for your questions.\nOur overall third quarter performance improved versus the second quarter as well as the year earlier\nquarter with top line growth and greater profitability. While we still sense some hesitancy on the part of\ncustomers, given the uncertainty that's existed all year round, inflation, interest rates, the presidential\nelection and geopolitical conflicts, we achieved the acceleration over the first half results that we spoke\nabout on our Q2 call. You might recall that we contemplated the benefit of the revenue shift into the\nthird quarter resulting from the second quarter supply chain issues. We continue to execute internally to\nmake the most of these still somewhat soft market conditions.\nOn a consolidated basis, we produced revenues of $150 million, up 10% versus the year ago period,\ndriven by double-digit growth in both Healthcare Apparel and Branded Products. We are proud to say\nthat these are the highest quarterly revenues ever achieved in our core products and services. The only\nother time we have ever slightly exceeded this was in Q2 2020, when our revenues were largely made\nup of PPE in response to the early stages of the pandemic.\nEBITDA of $11.7 million was up 26% from $9.3 million and our EBITDA margin expanded a full\npercentage point to 7.8%. Breaking this down further, our gross margin percentage climbed 130 basis\npoints over the prior year, and we were able to hold SG&A, as a percent of sales, almost flat at 34.9%,\nwhich includes the growth-oriented investments mentioned in prior quarters.\nPutting this all together, our third quarter diluted EPS rose to $0.33 from $0.19 a year earlier.\nOn top of all of this good news, we also continue to strengthen our financial foundation by generating\nanother quarter of positive operating cash flow, which allowed us to improve our already strong net\nleverage ratio. Going forward, our financial strength will allow us to continue our strategic investments\nto capitalize on the compelling growth opportunities within our three very attractive end markets.\nBefore turning to a discussion around our segments, I'll reiterate what I mentioned on prior calls. From a\nbig picture standpoint, Superior Group of Companies still has a very small but expanding share of three\nlarge growing and a highly fragmented end markets. We are intelligently investing in our people,\nservices, products and technology to continue to take more than our share of new customers with an\nemphasis, as always, on excellent retention of existing customers.\nNow let's shift to our business segments, starting with Healthcare Apparel. Our third quarter revenue\nwas up 11% versus the prior year quarter, benefiting from growth in our online channels, both\nwholesale and direct-to-consumer, despite continued soft market conditions in the wholesale channel of\nour business selling to Healthcare Apparel retail stores. Our third quarter revenue also benefited from\nthe timing of revenues as compared to last year, due, in part, to the supply chain issues in Q2 that we\nalready mentioned.\nThe increase in our gross margin percentage of more than 300 basis points was partially offset by an\nincrease in SG&A as a percentage of sales of 200 basis points. While the SG&A rate was at its best level\nso far in 2024, the rate did increase year-over-year, mostly due to sales and marketing investments to\ndrive awareness of the Wink brand and to support our online channels as well as continued investments\nin top talent. As a result, our EBITDA in our Healthcare Apparel segment of $3.8 million was up from the\nyear ago $3.1 million.\nLet's move on to our Branded Products segment, which also achieved revenue growth of 11% compared\nto last year. The revenue increase was mostly driven by increased volume with existing customers,\nincluding the revenue shift discussed earlier as well as the addition of many new customers.\nFor now, we're taking market share by adding new customers, which is helping to offset some legacy\ncustomers largely coming in with smaller orders and which we believe will further fuel our growth once\nthe environment improves. Overall, the business has played out as indicated on our prior call.\nSimilar to the second quarter, demand trends were reasonably solid, even though there's still a fair\namount of customer caution. In addition to the top line growth, during the quarter, our gross margin\nexpanded 160 basis points and we were also able to reduce SG&A as a percentage of sales by 180 basis\npoints. As a result, our EBITDA was up more than 50% over the prior year to $10.7 million and our\nEBITDA margin expanded more than 3 percentage points.\nNext up is Contact Centers, our highest margin segment, which had a 4% year-over-year sales increase,\ndriven by new customers, partially offset by lower sales from existing customers. Our investments in\ntalent and satellite offices to support future organic growth are reflected in our healthy win rate and\npipeline of new business, but are also currently affecting our gross margin and SG&A. As a result, our\nEBITDA was $3 million versus $4.1 million in the prior year period. Our longer term strategy for Contact\nCenters is to grow our customer count, catering to small and medium sized enterprises.\nIn addition to significantly launching and growing our sales team and increasing our marketing spend,\nwe're also deploying the very latest technology to benefit the customer experience, enhance our\nefficiencies and competitive edge and to profitably grow over time.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Mike who will take us through our third quarter results in detail and update\nyou on our full year outlook. Mike?\nMichael Koempel: Thank you, Michael, and thanks, everyone, for being on today's call. Starting with our\nhigh level consolidated results for the third quarter, we grew revenues 10% year-over-year, which was\nour strongest growth rate so far this year despite still soft market conditions.\nTaking a look at what drove this performance, Healthcare Apparel revenues were up 11% to $33 million\nand Branded Products revenues were up 11% to $93 million. As we expected, the timing of revenues\ndue in part to the supply chain delays we referenced last quarter benefited our third quarter results for\nthese two segments. Contact Centers also grew year-over-year with revenues up 4% to $25 million as\nnew customer growth was partially offset by lower revenues from existing customers.\nWe expanded margins and profitability during the quarter with our consolidated gross margin growing\n130 basis points over the prior year third quarter to 40.4%. Both Healthcare Apparel and Branded\nProducts saw stronger gross margins up 310 and 160 basis points, respectively, benefiting from cost of\ngoods favorability associated with healthcare production at our Haiti manufacturing facility during the\nquarter as well as favorable sourcing mix and pricing within Branded Products. Gross margin for Contact\nCenters was down 60 basis points, mainly due to wage increases for our agents.\nTurning to SG&A, versus the prior year, we were able to hold expenses almost flat as a percent of sales,\nup just 20 basis points to 34.9%. Our SG&A expenses were $52 million, up from $47 million a year\nearlier, primarily driven by increases in employee-related costs, commissions, marketing investments\nwithin Healthcare Apparel, professional fees and satellite office expansion and bad debt expense for\nContact Centers.\nMoving to the EBITDA line, our third quarter grew to $11.7 million, up from $9.3 million in the year ago\nquarter representing a full percentage point expansion in our EBIDTA margin as previously mentioned.\nOn a segment-by-segment basis, our Healthcare Apparel EBITDA margin expanded 110 basis points to\n11.4%, driven by higher gross margins, partially offset by investments in marketing and talent. The\nBranded Products EBITDA margin was up 330 basis points to 11.6%, benefiting from both expanded\ngross margins and operational leverage on the top line strength. However, Contact Centers, our smallest\nsegment, saw an EBITDA margin decline from 16.8% to 12.1%, driven by increased agent costs and the\naforementioned investments in talent to drive the pipeline for future growth.\nMoving further down our income statement, our third quarter interest expense was $1.6 million,\nimproved from $2.5 million in the prior year period, driven by a $36 million reduction in our weighted\naverage debt outstanding as well as a 110 basis point decrease in our weighted average interest rate.\nOur net income for the third quarter also improved to $5.4 million, up from $3.1 million in the third\nquarter of 2023. This equated to $0.33 per diluted share, up from $0.19 in the year ago period.\nShifting gears, our balance sheet remains solid. We ended September with cash and cash equivalents of\n$18 million compared to $20 million at the start of the year, while debt outstanding was $85 million at\nquarter end, improved from $94 million at year-end 2023. These results include $6.3 million in share\nrepurchases during the quarter, which I'll touch on in a moment.\nOur operating cash flow remains strong, having generated $24 million year-to-date and our net leverage\nratio for the third quarter was 1.6 times trailing 12-month covenant EBITDA, an improvement relative to\n2 times at the end of 2023 and 2.9 times a year earlier.\nRegarding our share repurchase plan announced on August 12, during the third quarter, we repurchased\napproximately 452,000 shares for $6.3 million, translating into an average price of $14.05 per share. We\nended the quarter with roughly $3.7 million remaining under our buyback authorization, and continue\nto view our shares as a compelling value.\nNow turning to our outlook. We're reaffirming our full year 2024 expectations, which reflects the\nacceleration over our first half results that we mentioned last quarter, largely driven by our strong third\nquarter results. Therefore, we continue to expect revenues in the range of $563 million to $570 million\nand full year earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.73 to $0.79.\nWith that operator, Michael and I would be happy to take questions, if you could please open the lines.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. And our first\nquestion comes from Kevin Steinke with Barrington Research. Please go ahead.\nKevin Mark Steinke: Good afternoon.\nMichael L. Benstock: Good afternoon, Kevin.\nKevin Mark Steinke: I wanted to start off by just asking about – you talked about last quarter, and\nobviously, today, just some supply chain delays and some of that revenue being pushed out from the\nsecond quarter into the second half of the year. Would you kind of characterize the benefit to the third\nquarter here from that pushed out revenue still – kind of, still in the few million dollars range?\nMichael Koempel: Hi, Kevin. Yeah. This is Mike. Yes, as I mentioned last quarter, we estimated that\nimpact to be about a few million dollars. And that, in fact, was the case all largely received here in the\nthird quarter.\nKevin Mark Steinke: Okay. And you mentioned still some customer hesitancy, although maybe some\nmodest improvement in sentiment. Maybe if you could just dig a little bit more into what you're hearing\nfrom your customers in terms of their outlooks and their spending plans and if things kind of started to\nimprove, now that we're post-election, or any other factors that you might want to touch on there?\nKevin Mark Steinke: Okay. And you mentioned still some customer hesitancy, although maybe some\nmodest improvement in sentiment. Maybe if you could just dig a little bit more into what you're hearing\nfrom your customers in terms of their outlooks and their spending plans and if things kind of started to\nimprove, now that we're post-election, or any other factors that you might want to touch on there?\nMichael L. Benstock: Okay. You have to take it by business segment. So I'll start off with the Branded\nProducts. And we're hearing much the same that we were hearing last quarter. Demand is edging up.\nWe had a very nice third quarter, obviously, in Branded Products, but still the uncertainty – I mean,\nhopefully, after last night and this morning, with certainty around at least the presidential election, that\nis one thing off the table that that will become more certain and stabilize things. But people are still\nmanaging their budgets very tightly. And there's always a few surprises in the fourth quarter. Sometimes\nvery good surprises. Like last year, we had a stupendous fourth quarter.\nSo there could be those kind of surprises. This year, again, in fourth quarter, in Branded Products, we're\ngoing up against some pretty tough numbers. But we – none of this is really an excuse for us not\nperforming. We're performing well right now. We should perform well in the future. As I said, yeah,\nwe're going up against tough numbers from last year. But as Mike said, we're keeping our guidance as is.\nWe're feeling very, very comfortable within the range of our guidance that we can hit those numbers.\nBut I say it over and over again, the markets huge and we have a lot of share we can take in the market,\nand we continue to do so and be very, very aggressive. And we don't manage the business from a\nquarter-to-quarter basis. We have a much more long-term view of the business. And we think that\nthere's going to be some real growth in our future with some of the great strategies that Jake and team\nand our Branded Products has put together.\nWhen you get to Healthcare Apparel, we're seeing all of the different channels that we sell in are doing\nquite well, except for brick and mortar. The trade accounts are definitely seeing a slowdown of traffic in\ntheir stores as things move to more digital. But we've seen soft consumer spending during this election\nseason in our consumer-facing business. And again, that's mostly in the retail distribution. They're\ncautiously optimistic.\nWe just went to a show last week where it's a retailer – it's called the URA. It's the Uniform Retailers\nAssociation Show where we were the bell of the ball. Everybody was really excited about all the\nnewness that we brought to the market with our new team. We were inundated with people walking\ninto our booth, while the rest of the show was pretty quiet.\nSo we believe that demand will return post-election. But on the – I know you're going to ask this\nquestion, if I don't answer it now and that's on the industrial laundry side of our business. We've really\nseen no discernible difference in that business. That business is going along just fine.\nNow on the – I don't think the Contact Centers is so much – it's not a buying and replenishment type of\nbusiness like the other businesses are, but we have seen slow decision-making. We said it before, our\npipeline is really robust. Our new sales team is, I think, is crushing it for being a young and – so they've\nonly been at it for now a few months, really most of this year. And I think they're making great progress.\nWe go through all the opportunities that they're putting on and prospects that they're bringing to the\ntable every single week. Our win rates are nice. We had a couple offsets to those win rates and then we\nhad some customers who scaled back considerably, as sometimes they do seasonally. And in some\ncases, and Mike spoke about an AR write-off, which he can speak to later on, but that was also a lost\ncustomer as well as an AR write-off.\nSo – but things are progressing in the right direction and I would hope the Fed certainly is going to make\na move soon on interest rates, already made one. The presidential election is behind us. I think there's a\nlot less noise in the future. I'm excited for next year and I think our budgets for next year will reflect our\noptimism.\nKevin Mark Steinke: Okay. Excellent. That's excellent insight. And you mentioned some slow decision-\nmaking in Contact Centers, but I think you had also referenced just some lower revenue from existing\ncustomers. I mean there's – again, I guess, is that just due to the overall hesitancy in the market\nenvironment, maybe, I don't know if some customers have taken out a few seats or maybe what's going\non there?\nMichael L. Benstock: I think it's a combination of a lot of things. One of the things we haven't spoken\nmuch about is we're constantly on the lookout for new geographies that are less expensive because\ncustomers, they are looking for more cost- effective solutions. For many, many years and still the\nnearshore that we provide is a very cost-effective solution, but we know that we might have to go\nfurther away than nearshore to find cost-effective solutions. And we're in the process of building up\nstrategies around that over the next year that we think will at least give us an alternative to customers\nwho might leave us because they found a cheaper environment somewhere. And there are less\nexpensive environments in India, South Africa, the Philippines and many other places in the world.\nSo we're in the exploration phase of that. We're not very far along. But I would imagine a year from\nnow, we'll be able to tell you a different story.\nMichael Koempel: And Kevin, this is Mike. I would just add. As it relates to existing customers, from\nquarter-to-quarter, we could see increases or decreases. I certainly wouldn't look at the lower revenue\nfrom existing customers this quarter as any sign of a trend. In fact, we had added seats for existing\ncustomers the first half of this year. So it's typical that there can be ebbs and flows in addition to,\nobviously, our focus on adding new customers going forward.\nKevin Mark Steinke: Okay. That's helpful. And just lastly, so with you maintaining the guidance range\nand the strong third quarter revenue, the top end of the revenue outlook implies revenue kind of flattish\nsequentially compared to the third quarter or down a bit as you move down the guidance range. I mean,\nI guess, would you attribute that to some of the factors you mentioned here, tough year ago comp and\njust, I guess, customer hesitancy, supply chain push forward into the third quarter, et cetera. Is that the\nway we should think about it?\nMichael Koempel: I think that's right, Kevin. Yeah. I think we certainly had some, I'd call it, tailwinds\nhere in the third quarter. You touched on the shifts that we benefited from out of the second quarter,\nwhich gave us, again, as Michael mentioned, I'll say, near record sales for the third quarter. So it would\nimply that we're in the fourth quarter going to be flat, flat to down sequentially, but, again, that's off a\ntough comparison given the strong quarter that we had. But as Michael said, still comfortable within the\nguidance range.\nKevin Mark Steinke: Okay. Thanks for all the insight. I'll turn it back over for now.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Jim Sidoti with Sidoti & Company. Please go ahead.\nJames Sidoti: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. It sounds like you were able to bring\nsome new sales folks on board in the quarter. How long does it typically take for them to start to\ncontribute?\nMichael L. Benstock: Yeah. What we were speaking of is new salespeople that we brought on for TRG.\nAnd so you got to keep in mind, Jim, that prior to – about a year ago, we didn't have a sales force at TRG.\nWe built that business without a sales force. We used brokers, we used referrals, our website, word of\nmouth and really, we've been very, very fortunate that we didn’t have a sales force.\nSo my answer to you is we don't know yet because we don't know – we know that we've had a\nsalesperson who started with us not very long ago, I think within six weeks, had signed up a new\ncustomer. That's not typical. But if they come to us from the industry, which is where we're trying to\nhire them, they typically come with some connections. We would hope to be able to turn some of their\nconnections into customers within a year, but they're prospecting the whole time they're with us, not\njust the people they know.\nWe've come up with some very good lead lists. We have pretty good recognition and a pretty good story\nto tell. The goal would be that they're paying for themselves very quickly within six months, but certainly\nwithin a year, they should be producing many times in revenue at least of what we're paying them.\nJames Sidoti: Great. And how would you describe your pricing power at this point? I know you put in a\nprice increase about a year ago. Is that stuck and do you think you can continue to raise prices? Could\nyour costs go up?\nMichael L. Benstock: It's an interesting question. For people who have never outsourced before, which\nhas been largely how we’ve built our business, our pricing is just fine because it's considerably less than\ntheir costs in the United States, sometimes as much as 60%, 70% lower than what they're paying in the\nUnited States on a per hour basis when they think of all the other overheads they have of having to\nrecruit people and pay bonuses and all the other things that they have to do as well as office space and\ncomputers, we provide all that. So ours is a flat rate that saves them a lot of money. So for them, it's like\nstars in their eyes they can save that kind of money.\nFor people who have outsourced for a long time in different countries and are looking at us as an\nalternative because they've been recommend – somebody has recommended us to them. That gets\nmore down to price, nailing down the right price, which is we want to be all things to all people, which is\nwhy I said earlier, we are going to find a lower cost solution in the future. And we feel like it would be a\ngreat advantage even to some of our customers who want a blended cost between a much lower cost\nand a nearshore.\nAnd so it's price sensitive. We're not without competition. We have a ton of competition out there. So\nwe've got to be very, very price conscious. Up till now, it hasn't been as much of an issue because it's\nbeen smaller customers who haven't outsourced. But you know, if we're going to grow this business\ndouble digits, which is our intention to get back to that again, you're talking about having to put on\nliterally – as you grow three, four years down the road, we'd have to be putting on 1,000 people a year.\nYou're not going to do that with 25 seat customers. So you've got to find a value proposition for larger\nfolks as well.\nJames Sidoti: All right. And then last one for me, it looks like you bought back about $6 million worth of\nshares in the stock – in the quarter. I think it was a $10 million buyback authorization. Do you expect to\ncomplete that in 2024?\nMichael Koempel: Yeah, Jim, so as of the close of business yesterday, we had about $2.6 million\nremaining under our $10 million authorization. So we obviously continue to believe that our stock is a\ngood value and we'll certainly manage the plan going forward and get into the market where we feel like\nthere are good opportunities and continue to buy against the authorization as we deem fit. And\nobviously, we continue discussions with the board in the context of our overall capital strategy to\ndetermine to what extent we may want to do more in the future. But again, that's ongoing dialogue that\nwe have with our board on a regular basis. But again, we'll continue to monitor the share price and\npurchase as we see fit under the current authorization.\nJames Sidoti: All right. Thank you. That's it from me.\nOperator: Question comes from Keegan Cox with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.\nKeegan Cox: Hi, Michael and Mike, how are you?\nMichael L. Benstock: Good. Thank you.\nMichael Koempel: Good thanks.\nKeegan Cox: I just had a question on the Branded Products segment. I was wondering if you were seeing\nany pockets of strength in that business. Are there any specific industries or macro factors impacting it?\nMichael L. Benstock: I think what I would say is, a year ago, we saw a big downturn in our tech\ncustomers buying and a lot of that has resumed now. So that's good news. And that's what was maybe\ndragging things down a year ago, even though in the fourth quarter, we had a great quarter last year.\nBut throughout the year, we were struggling a little bit.\nSo I think we're seeing a lot healthier customers out there today. There's still budgetary concerns. And\nit's amazing to me how many people – we've done more RFPs than we've ever done before. But literally,\nwe get to the finish line and – with some of these, and more so now than ever, they're coming back to\nus, and these are multimillion dollar bids coming back to us and saying, I ran this by my board and they\nasked me to defer it till next year. And that's very frustrating to take when they work on these things,\nbecause under normal circumstances, those things would have closed already and we probably would\nhave seen some of that revenue in fourth quarter and first quarter next year and even into second\nquarter on some of the more customized items. So it's kind of a mixed bag.\nMichael Koempel: And I would add, Keegan, much like we just explained in the second quarter, we're\ncontinuing to see more orders, smaller order size, which, again, as we mentioned before, we think, is\nactually an advantage to us because, obviously, we can work, especially with new customers, to grow\nthat share of wallet over time. So continuing to see that trend, but to Michael's point, not a particular\nweakness or concern in any one particular industry.\nKeegan Cox: Awesome. And then just a follow-up. You mentioned a little bit of sourcing favorability in\npricing in Healthcare Apparel and Branded Products. I just wonder if you could give a little more color on\nthat.\nMichael L. Benstock: Sure. I mean, in terms of pricing, it's an area, obviously, that we're always focused\non, and where we have opportunities to push for higher pricing, we certainly continue to do that. In the\nBranded Products space, we're – particularly in the promotional space where we're pricing order by\norder, it gives us that flexibility, again, to where we can take advantage of price where we have an\nopportunity.\nFrom a sourcing standpoint, we had some favorability in what I referred to as sourcing mix where for\nsome of our larger customers, we had higher margins based on the source of production in the quarter.\nSo kind of a combination of product and sourcing mix working together, which drove a higher margin for\nus here in the third quarter.\nKeegan Cox: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from David Marsh with Singular Research. Please go ahead.\nDavid Marsh: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Just, I guess, one quick housekeeping. I mean,\nin terms of the shipping delays that you guys had experienced in Q2, I mean, would you say that they're\ncompletely resolved at this point or are you still seeing a little bit of that?\nMichael L. Benstock: A good question. I'd say that we planned around a lot of them, that adding time to\nour lead times to make things happen so that they're less impactful to us. But no, we're seeing – I mean,\nI had our sourcing group from each of our businesses, the Branded Products and both our Healthcare,\ndo a write-up for me recently on all the different places where there are delays and there isn't a country\nin the world that – there's container shortages in Bangladesh and Pakistan. The Middle East conflict\nobviously is impacting Suez Canal traffic, residual delays from rerouting shipments to the West Coast\nthat were destined for the East Coast, because of the strike, they had to be rerouted.\nIt's a little bit – I mean, there's – I can name 8 or 10 other things that are impacting the logistics side. It's\nnot the factories. It's the logistics side. Even getting a container picked up in some of these countries is\nbecoming a very, very competitive environment and prices have gone up accordingly. We'll pay the\nprice. We've contemplated some of that in our pricing already, but we got to see what happens.\nThere also was a huge shift of people ordering in advance and trying to get product into this country\nprior to Trump sitting in the White House, which then it was if, now it's when. And so there was a lot of\npressure on a lot of factories as well as logistics companies to move product quickly and a lot was\nreserved, which has created delays.\nMichael Koempel: And Dave, like we mentioned in the last call, we obviously made adjustments to our\nplanning and our lead times when we began to see issues in the second quarter. So we wouldn't expect\nthose delays to create – have a significant impact on us in the near future.\nDavid Marsh: Just as a follow-on to that, I mean, your inventory is down a decent amount from the end\nof the prior year and it's kind of one of the lower numbers you've had in a while. Do you have – do you\nguys have the inventory to supply the orders if they come in and if they come kind of roaring back here\nin the fourth quarter?\nMichael Koempel: It's a great question. I'd say, overall, we do. With that said, of course, there's always, I\nwould say, pockets of inventory that we are chasing, that we have been chasing due to just changes in\ncertain customer demand for certain products. So, yeah, we are overall in a good position. And again,\njust the supply chain together with our planning team just working to plug some holes in select\nproducts. But again, overall, we feel comfortable that we've got the inventory to fuel the fourth quarter.\nAnd obviously, we're working toward our planning as we head into 2025 to make sure we're positioned\nappropriately as well.\nMichael L. Benstock: If we ran out of inventory in fourth quarter, it would mean we had the most\nincredible quarter imaginable. So I don't know if I should say I welcome that happening or not, but that\nis the truth.\nDavid Marsh: Yeah. Always be careful what you wish for. Then just lastly for me, just curious on – kind\nof on the acquisition landscape, if you will. You guys have not really done anything this year. It doesn't\nlook like, but I'm guessing there are some opportunities out there perhaps. Could you just talk about\nmaybe order of priority where you might try to pick up some assets if you can find some that are\nattractively priced?\nMichael L. Benstock: As we've said in the past, we don't speak about acquisitions before we do them,\nexcept to say we're always in talks with people. And obviously, with our leverage ratios, what they are\nright now, we got a lot of room to do pretty much whatever we want to do. And at least in the markets\nwe serve, there aren't a lot of larger competitors. It's mostly smaller competitors. So we kind of pick and\nchoose the size of the – and the nature of the acquisitions we want to do.\nWe are active I can tell you in both the Branded Products where we think there's just a ton of\nopportunity there, there always has been and there always will be, to do some roll-ups one, two, three,\nhowever, many we're able to do in the near future. And then, on call centers, we're also looking\nparticularly in areas that might give us a geography that would be very advantageous to us.\nDavid Marsh: Sounds good. Thanks, guys. Congrats on the quarter.\nMichael Koempel: Thank you.\nMichael L. Benstock: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from again Kevin Steinke with Barrington Research. Please go\nahead.\nKevin Mark Steinke: Hey. Thanks. I just wanted to sneak one more in here. So in your earnings release,\nyou mentioned ongoing growth-oriented investments, while at the same time, striving to further\noptimize efficiencies and margins. SG&A year-to-date has been up as a percentage of revenue, although,\nas you mentioned, it kind of flattened out here in the third quarter. Just trying to think about the\nbalance going forward. Do those growth investments continue at a similar pace to where they've been?\nAnd even if that continues, do you think you can get some SG&A expense leverage or does the pace of\ngrowth investment slow down here? Just trying to think about the SG&A line and potential leverage\nopportunity there as we go forward.\nMichael Koempel: Sure. I think for the balance of the year, Kevin, I think our SG&A rate will be pretty\nwell aligned with the year-to-date trend. And so I'd say here in the near term. I'd say, overall, I would\nnot expect significant increases in additional investments. In each one of our segments, we talk a lot\nabout talent, and in particular, investing in sales talent, Michael mentioned in our Contact Center\nbusiness, which obviously has been an incremental investment in this past year. We've been obviously\nmaking a lot more of a marketing investment now that we're in year two of our direct-to-consumer\nlaunch.\nSo I think we've made some bigger investments this year that we would expect to begin leveraging as\nwe go forward. And again, we recognize that these investments have put some pressure on our rate in\nthe shorter term, but we feel like we'll get leverage and get top line growth off of those investments as\nwe shift into 2025.\nKevin Mark Steinke: Okay. That sounds good. That's very helpful. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back\nover to Michael Benstock for any closing remarks.\nMichael L. Benstock: Thank you, everyone, for being with us today. We, of course, look forward to\nproviding our next update with full year results. Please reach out if you have any further questions.\nEnjoy the evening and thank you as always for your interest in SGC.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may\nnow disconnect."

Benstock\nThank you, operator, and welcome to our call. Today, I'll start with the financial highlights from our\nsecond quarter. Next, I'll cover how each of the three business segments performed, including a high-\nlevel discussion of some of our go-forward strategies. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to take us\nthrough a detailed financial discussion and our outlook for 2024, after which both Mike and I would be\nhappy to take your questions.\nLet's get started. We delivered profitable results in the second quarter. However, our results were not as\nstrong as we had originally forecasted due to softening market conditions as well as supply chain delays.\nWe expect to recover the revenue associated with the supply chain delays in the Branded Products and\nHealthcare Apparel segments in the third quarter. On that basis, we are maintaining our full year\noutlook.\nOn a consolidated basis, we generated revenues of $132 million, up 2% over the prior-year period. Our\nEBITDA of $5.6 million was down from $7.4 million a year earlier, with a margin of 4.2% compared to\n5.8%. Our continued growth in gross margin dollars and gross margin percentage were more than offset\nby higher SG&A as compared to last year. While our second quarter SG&A costs were down slightly from\nthe first quarter, our costs deleveraged on the lower-than-expected revenues. As a result, our second\nquarter diluted EPS was $0.04 as compared to $0.08 in the prior-year quarter.\nWe continue to drive solid operating cash flow during the second quarter, which with the balance sheet\nimprovements we made over the past year, enabled us to maintain a strong net leverage ratio.\nTherefore, we remain in a strong financial position to make strategic investments that will help us\ncapture additional market share over the long-term across our three very attractive end markets, while\nstanding ready for any highly compelling M&A opportunities.\nI mentioned last quarter that we were cautiously optimistic on the demand trends across our three\nbusiness segments. While first quarter demand was strong, we began to see a shift to slower customer\ndecisions to purchase during the back half of the second quarter as the uncertainty around inflation,\ninterest rates, the upcoming election and global geopolitics weigh on our customer sentiment. With that\nsaid, we remain focused on what we can control, which is positioning the company for long-term\ngrowth.\nI'll reiterate what I mentioned last quarter. Superior Group of Companies still has a very small but\ngrowing share of three large, attractive and growing end markets. We are driven to win more than our\nfair share of new customers, while maintaining impressive customer retention statistics through\nproviding a superior customer experience. We're optimistic on the future, given the enormous size of\nour target markets, and our own ability to capitalize through wise investment in our people, our\nproducts and technology.\nTurning to our business segments, I'll start with Healthcare Apparel. During the second quarter, our\nrevenue was down 5% due largely to continued softness in our store-based uniform wholesale business,\nand the timing of revenues as compared to last year due in part to temporary supply chain issues. These\nheadwinds were partially offset by continued strong growth in our digital business, both in our\nwholesale and direct-to-consumer channels. While the gross margin rate was up versus last year, the\nSG&A percentage increased at a higher rate, primarily driven by investments in marketing, to drive\nfurther awareness of the Wink brand and support for the early stages of our direct-to-consumer\nchannel. As a result, EBITDA was $1.3 million as compared to $1.9 million in the prior year quarter.\nDespite the second quarter sales decline in Healthcare Apparel, we believe our selling strategies in\nHealthcare Apparel, including last year's successful rebranding under the Wink trademark, and\nexpanding our direct-to-consumer efforts, will drive long-term growth. Over time, we see ourselves\ncapturing significant additional share of this large growing and resilient addressable market, expanding\nwell beyond the more than 2 million caregivers who already wear our brands to work every day.\nTurning to Branded Products. Our revenue was up 2% compared to the year-ago quarter, despite an\ninventory shift related to certain contract, uniform customers whose inventory was contemplated to be\non the shelf in June but instead arrived in the third quarter. As a result, the revenues from these\ncontract assets will be realized in the third quarter.\nInterestingly, the overall demand trajectory for BAMKO in particular, which is the largest portion of the\nsegment, is being driven by a significant increase in the number of customer orders, partially offset by\nsmaller order sizes and lower value products, reflecting a cautious buying pattern by our customers.\nHowever, the increased number of orders, including from new customers, results in capturing additional\nmarket share and therefore greater opportunity for growth when the headwinds normalize for\nexpanded revenue. The good news is that customers haven't stopped buying. They are, however, being\nmore prudent with their spend. The increase in gross margin dollars and rate was offset by higher SG&A,\nwhich was primarily driven by employee-related costs, including commissions on the higher gross\nmargins. As a result, the Branded Products EBITDA of $6.7 million was down slightly from $7 million a\nyear earlier.\nFrom a strategic standpoint, our game plan for Branded Products revolves around strong customer\nretention, growing their wallet share, driving greater RFP activity, increasing our sales rep recruiting. Our\nmarket share of less than 2% has ample room to expand in this $24 billion market.\nWrapping up our business segment discussion, Contact Centers grew revenues 9% year-over-year,\naccelerating slightly from last quarter's 7% revenue increase. Due to the attractive long-term growth\nopportunities, TOG continues to invest in advance in talent and satellite offices to support new and\nexisting customer growth, which puts pressure on both gross margin and SG&A , but only in the short-\nterm. As a result, our EBITDA performance was almost flat with the prior-year period at $3.2 million,\ndespite the stronger topline results. We're seeing solid demand for TOG's offering from both existing\nand new customers.\nAnd our strategy is to continue growing our pipeline and ultimately earning more business, while\nensuring that our offering is competitive and reflects the value we bring to our clients. We're also\ninvestigating and already using some of the latest technology to provide the highest quality customer\nexperience while at the same time employing additional technologies to enhance our efficiency and\ngrow margins over time.\nI'll now turn the call over to Mike to walk us through our second quarter financial results in greater\ndetail and to provide an update on our outlook for the full year. Mike?\nMichael Koempel\nThank you, Michael.\nDuring the second quarter, we grew our topline 2% over the prior-year period. This was our second\nconsecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. And while our second quarter revenue was somewhat\nlight versus our forecast, we're able to reiterate our full year revenue expectations, given our favorable\noutlook for the rest of the year.\nOur consolidated sales growth was driven by our Branded Products segment, which grew 2% to $81\nmillion and our Contact Centers segment, which grew 9% to $25 million. These increases were partially\noffset by a 5% sales decline in our Healthcare Apparel segment to $27 million for the quarter.\nIn terms of our profitability, our consolidated gross margin expanded 170 basis points over the prior\nyear, coming in at 38.5%. Both Branded Products and Healthcare Apparel continue to drive year-over-\nyear margin expansion with increases of 240 basis points and 120 basis points, respectively, driven by a\ncombination of improved supply chain costs and pricing. These gross margin rate increases were\npartially offset by a 140 basis point decline at our Contact Centers segment, driven by increases in\nemployee-related costs of our agents, included agent training in anticipation of new clients in the back\nhalf of the year.\nOur SG&A expenses were $48 million for the quarter, up from $43 million a year earlier, primarily driven\nby higher sales related compensation from growth in the Branded Products gross margin, higher\nmarketing and advertising expenses, increased third-party professional fees and increases in employee-\nrelated costs.\nOur EBITDA of $5.6 million was down from $7.4 million in the prior-year period. Looking at this by\nsegment, Branded Products EBITDA was down just slightly to $6.7 million, as stronger sales and a\nstronger gross margin were offset by higher SG&A expenses. Healthcare Apparel EBITDA came in at $1.3\nmillion, down from $1.9 million in the prior-year period, primarily due to the lower revenues and higher\nmarketing expenses this quarter. Contact Centers EBITDA was almost flat year-over-year at $3.2 million,\nas sales growth was offset by the combination of a lower gross margin rate and a higher SG&A rate,\nlargely reflecting investments in talent to support future sales growth.\nShifting gears, our interest expense for the second quarter was $1.5 million. That sequentially improved\nfrom $1.8 million in the first quarter this year and much improved from $2.6 million in the year-earlier\nquarter. The interest expense decrease from last year was primarily driven by a $53 million reduction in\nour weighted average debt outstanding, which I'll touch on in a moment\nIn terms of net income, we reported $600,000 for the second quarter or $0.04 per diluted share relative\nto $1.2 million or $0.08 per diluted share in a year-ago period.\nTurning to our balance sheet, which continued to improve,we ended the second quarter with cash and\ncash equivalents of $13 million, and we reduced our debt outstanding by another $12 million during the\nquarter. We've also generated $16 million in operating cash flow year-to-date, and our net leverage\nratio at the end of the second quarter was 1.7 times trailing 12-month covenant EBITDA, much improved\nrelative to 3.7 times a year earlier.\nI'll wrap up with our full year 2024 outlook, which is unchanged from what we provided on our last\nquarterly call. Specifically, we look for full year revenues to be in the range of $563 million to $570\nmillion, and a full year earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $0.73 to $0.79. These ranges call\nfor acceleration over our first half results, including the later timing of quarterly sales that were\noriginally expected during the second quarter as previously discussed.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. And operator, if you could please open the lines, Michael and I\nwould be happy to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The\nfirst question comes from Kevin Steinke with Barrington Research. Please go ahead.\nKevin Mark Steinke Thank you and good afternoon.\nMichael L. Benstock: Hi, Kevin.\nKevin Mark Steinke: I wanted to start off by asking about the supply chain delays. You mentioned\nHealthcare Apparel and Branded Products. And you've mentioned the delayed revenue being pushed to\nthe third quarter. Just trying to get a sense as to, if you could, size the revenue that was delayed, and\ntherefore how much the third quarter will benefit?\nMichael Koempel: Hi, Kevin. This is Mike. I'll take the question. What we started to see during the\nsecond quarter, was really a combination of certain suppliers reducing capacity, and then just an\nincrease in demand in getting product, particularly out of China. So, we started to see some delays in\nproduct that we were receiving. It impacted us on the finished goods side, which again did directly\nimpact the recognition of revenue. And then we also saw it in terms of delaying some of our fabric to\nour production facility in Haiti, which also did impact sales in the healthcare side as well. So, we really\nagain, we experienced those delays, which did create a shortfall in our expectations, to the tune of, I\nwould say, approximately a few million dollars for the quarter. And so, again, that's timing, some of\nwhich we began to recognize in the month of July, and we'll recognize throughout the third quarter\nprimarily.\nMichael L. Benstock: Yes, Kevin, some of those delays were precipitated by the fact that with the\nanticipation that there could be tariffs placed on a lot of products coming out of China in particular next\nyear, if Trump is were to be elected, a lot of people are trying to accelerate their shipments out of Asia.\nAnd that has placed a lot of demand on the backbone of the logistics companies to try to meet that\ndemand. So, that's certainly one of the reasons for the delay.\nKevin Mark Steinke: Okay. Great. That's helpful commentary. And with regard to the softer market\nconditions, you mentioned the slower customer decision-making. Does that apply primarily to Branded\nProducts? Is that kind of across the segments? And is that slower decision-making continued thus far as\nyou progressed into the third quarter?\nMichael L. Benstock: Good question. We had a leadership summit about a week and a half ago, and\nbrought all of our presidents together. And they all concurred that they had never seen slower decision-\nmaking on all of our customers' part. RFPs are going out. The responses to the RFPs are taking forever.\nSometimes we're being told that we've been awarded business, and it takes forever to get things\nthrough people's legal departments. Even after that happens, it takes – or it is taking our customers the\nlongest period of time to actually pull the trigger and give us purchase orders. And that is true in all of\nour businesses. I don't know what's causing that exactly, except an uneasiness on their part or mandates\nfrom their own companies to just slow their spending down or defer certain spending items. The\nspending will be there. It's just taking longer than ever.\nWe're even seeing it in our pipelines that our pipelines of business are larger than they've been in some\ntime. But part of the reason why they're larger than they've been for sometime is it's taking people\nlonger to make a decision. So that's just a fact of life. We're happy that our pipelines are dramatically\nlarger than have been in the past. When things do start to pop, we believe that that will result in us\ntaking additional market share.\nKevin Mark Steinke: Okay. Thank you. So you talked about increased marketing and advertising\nexpenses, I think, in relation to direct-to-consumer and healthcare, maybe some other areas. Could you\njust expand upon that? And, again, what the magnitude of that was? And if that will continue into the\nback half of the year?\nMichael Koempel: Hey, Kevin, this is Mike again. So, the predominant increase in marketing advertising\ncontinues to be in the Healthcare Apparel segment. As Michael mentioned in the prepared remarks,\nthat's still attributable to us rebranding and continuing to build the awareness of the Wink brand, which\nwe, I'd say, officially rebranded last year, as well as continuing to invest in the growth of direct-to-\nconsumer.\nObviously, these are heavier investments, in the early stages of that channel specifically, which, again,\nover time, we would expect to gain leverage as we build that customer base. So, that certainly is putting\npressure on healthcare in particular, especially in a quarter, as you can see, where sales are down. We\nexpect to gain more leverage on that as we move forward with our sales expectation in the back half of\nthe year.\nBut, again, we'll continue to have a meaningful investment. But again, we would expect to begin to gain\nsome leverage in return on that as we move into the back half of this year.\nKevin Mark Steinke: Okay. Yes, that's helpful commentary. Just lastly, I wanted to ask about the second\nhalf of the year. As you think about the outlook. Obviously, you talked about some of the revenue being\ndelayed due to supply chain issues, but that you expect that to come back. But I guess, does your\noutlook also assume kind of a typical seasonal ramp in revenue? Is that something you're seeing or\nexpecting in the business? And is that kind of factored into the outlook?\nMichael Koempel: That is what we're expecting, Kevin. I would say just add a little bit more to what\nMichael was saying, in terms of RFPs, and our Contact Center business, where the decision-making has\nbeen longer. You know the good news is that our pipeline is very strong, particularly with new\ncustomers. And so, with that timing of the decision-making, that would translate for them in a larger\nmagnitude of sales, in the back half of the year, Q4 in particular, than we might otherwise see just\nbecause of the timing. And again, that is factoring into the back half of the year.\nKevin Mark Steinke: Okay. Thank you for taking the questions. I'll turn it back over.\nOperator: The next question comes from Keegan Cox with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead\nKeegan Cox: Yes. How's it going?\nMichael Koempel: Hi, Keegan. Thank you\nKeegan Cox: I just wanted to ask and dig a little bit more on the higher SG&A. I got that it was from kind\nof early investment in your Contact Center business. But I was just wondering if you could talk about it a\nlittle more and why you're growing that out.\nMichael Koempel: Sure. The SG&A increase driven by a handful of factors. One being we did have an\nincrease in gross margin with our Branded Products business. And as we said before, we pay\ncommissions based on gross margin dollars. So as gross margin dollars rise, so will our commission\nexpense within Branded Products.\nI would say within our Branded Products space, as well as our Contact Centers, we are making some\ninvestments in talent to support what we believe to be obviously the future trend, growth trend of\nthose businesses. So building out what I would call a little bit more infrastructure.\nThirdly, with also within the Contact Center business, we have made some incremental investments in a\ncouple of what I would call satellite offices, obviously off of our current office format, which really helps\nus enable to access additional pools of talent, train, onboard faster. So again, we're making some of\nthose investments in the early stages here to support the growth of new customers coming on board.\nAnd then lastly, another meaningful part would be the marketing and advertising expense that I just\nreferenced with Kevin, which again is predominantly within our healthcare business.\nKeegan Cox: Awesome. And then to kind of just follow-up on that, you talked a little bit about supply\nchain delays, and I know you guys have facilities in the Caribbean like in Haiti and such. Have they been\nimpacted at all by the storms heading through there?\nMichael L. Benstock: They have not been impacted by the storms, thankfully. And the civil unrest in\nHaiti, which is the other side of what happens in Haiti that could impact, has not impacted us much at all\neither. We've really had no downtime in the past quarter as a result. So, we're in good shape there.\nKeegan Cox: Awesome. And then I think I just had one more kind of – you're talking, Michael, about the\npipeline of business kind of picking up in the back half of the year. And I just wanted to dig down into\nwhat segment that's in? Is it in the Contact Center? Just trying to make sure I got it right from it\nmanagement.\nMichael L. Benstock: Yes, that's in the Contact Center business where the pipeline of prospects is much\nhigher. And when I say prospects, I'm talking about people, who we’re having serious conversations with\nabout taking over their business, that they only make it to that list if that's the case. And then, of course\nthe second side of that is even when we're told that we've won, it's taking longer to close business. But\nbusiness is closing at a rate that we're very satisfied with.\nKeegan Cox: Awesome. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Jim Sidoti with Sidoti & Co. Please go ahead.\nJames Sidoti: Hi. Good afternoon. And thanks for taking the questions. So, I'm looking at the results for\nthe first half of the year and the results of the guidance. And it seems that you expect Q3 and Q4 to be\neven better than Q1 was. So what's giving you that confidence?\nMicheal Koempel: I would say a couple of things, Jim.\nOne is there is what I'll call some seasonality in terms of we know historically that Branded Products in\nparticular typically has a very strong third quarter leading into the fourth quarter.\nTwo, I would say that from a timing perspective, we talked a little bit about the supply chain delays,\nwhich will obviously benefit the back half of the year. Thirdly, I would say from a from a timing\nperspective, there are a couple of customers in the healthcare business where those sales took place in\nthe first half of last year are now coming in the back half of this year.\nKind of gets a little bit to what Michael was referring to in terms of the timing of decision-making. And\nthose sales are purchase orders. Those are sales ready to go.\nAnd then lastly, I would just again comment on what Michael and I touched on before. Just from a\nContact Center standpoint, just in terms of the timing and onboarding of new customers, which is\ncoming. Again, that put a little bit of pressure on SG&A expense for Contact Centers in the second\nquarter as we were training in advance of the back half of the year. But because of the timing of new\ncustomers, we expect that to drive improved sales trend in the back half for that segment as well.\nJames Sidoti: And historically, Q4 is even better than Q3. The fact that you're going to, I guess, do some\ncatch-up in Q3 this year, do you think that those two quarters will be a little more leveled off?\nMichael Koempel: They'd be a little bit more balanced, Jim, to your point. Yes.\nJames Sidoti: And then in terms of the hiring salespeople for Branded Products, are you finding that to\nbe any easier? Or is that still a challenge for you?\nMichael L. Benstock: It's never easy to wedge somebody away who's comfortable in their current\nenvironment. We've had more success in the last quarter than we've had in prior quarters. But we're\nsatisfied with it. We're getting return for our efforts, and looking at a lot of other ways, as well, to grow\nsales, other than hiring additional salespeople. If we can create some operational efficiency, that will\nmake the salesforce we have even more efficient. We're in the process of rolling some things out\ninternally, somewhat using some AI technology as well to do so. That will help our current salesforce\nachieve what we believe are better results for us as well.\nJames Sidoti: All right. And then last one for me. On the one area where you have made a lot of progress\nis your gross margin, up significantly from 2022 and 2023. Do you think that these levels are\nsustainable?\nMichael Koempel: We would expect, Jim, to maintain the margins where we've been. If you look back,\nhistorically, just to last year, you really started to see our margin rate go up in the third quarter of last\nyear. And we've continued that trend. So, I'd say we'd have margins in the back half more consistent\nwith last year only because, again, we start lapping the stronger margins that we started to accrue in the\nthird quarter.\nJames Sidoti: Okay. But it sounds like you think in the high 30s. That's a pretty sustainable number.\nMichael Koempel: Yes.\nJames Sidoti: All right. Thank you.\nMichael Koempel: Thanks Jim.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back\nover to Mr. Benstock for any closing remarks.\nMichael L. Benstock: Yes. Thank you, operator. I want to thank everyone for joining the call, for the\ngreat questions as well. We're excited about our company growth prospects, and everyone here at SGC\nis focused on strong execution. We look forward to updating you again on our next call. And please\ndon't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions before then. Enjoy the rest of your\nsummer. Thanks again for being with us today. And as always, thank you for your interest in SGC.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may\nnow disconnect"
