We have provided reconciliations below of adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\n\nWe have included adjusted EBITDA, herein, because it is a key measure used by our management and Board of Directors to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans, and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating adjusted EBITDA facilitates operating performance comparability across reporting periods by removing the effect of non-cash expenses and other expenses. Accordingly, we believe that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and Board of Directors.\n\nWe believe it is useful to exclude non-cash charges, such as share-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization from our adjusted EBITDA because the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations. We believe it is useful to exclude income tax provision and interest income (expense), as neither are components of our core business operations. We also believe that it is useful to exclude other expenses, including the investment banking fee related to the Vetster partnership, acquisition costs related to PetCareRx, employee severance and estimated state sales tax accrual as these items are not indicative of our ongoing operations. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as a financial measure, and these non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\n\n  * Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditures;\n  * Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect share-based compensation. Share-based compensation has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a material recurring expense in our business and an important part of our compensation strategy;\n  * Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest income (expense), net; or changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital;\n  * Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect transaction related costs and other items which are either not representative of our underlying operations or are incremental costs that result from an actual or planned transaction and include litigation matters, integration consulting fees, internal salaries and wages (to the extent the individuals are assigned full-time to integration and transformation activities) and certain costs related to integrating and converging IT systems;\n  * Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect certain non-operating expenses including the employee severance which reduces cash available to us;\n  * Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect certain expenses including the estimated state sales tax accrual which reduces cash available to us.\n  * Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces the measures usefulness as comparative measures.\n\n\n\nBecause of these and other limitations, adjusted EBITDA should only be considered as supplemental to, and alongside with other GAAP based financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net income, net margin, and our other GAAP results.\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure to adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods indicated:\n\n**Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures****PetMed Express, Inc.****(Unaudited)**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended**| **Increase (Decrease)**  \n**($ in thousands, except percentages)**| **September 30,****2024**| **September 30,****2023**| **$**| **%**  \n**Consolidated Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA:**  \nNet income| $| 2,326| $| 715| $| 1,611| 225| %  \nAdd (subtract):  \nStock-based Compensation| $| 573| $| 1,728| $| (1,155| )| (67| )%  \nIncome Taxes| $| (1,401| )| $| 565| $| (1,966| )| (348| )%  \nDepreciation and Amortization| $| 1,658| $| 1,713| $| (55| )| (3| )%  \nInterest (Income), Net(1)| $| (185| )| $| (151| )| $| (34| )| 23| %  \nAcquisition/Partnership Transactions and Other Items| $| –| $| 168| $| (168| )| (100| )%  \nEmployee Severance| $| 305| $| 15| $| 290| 1933| %  \nSales Tax (Income)| $| (1,178| )| $| (1,316| )| $| 138| (10| )%  \nAdjusted EBITDA| $| 2,098| $| 3,437| $| (1,339| )| (39| )%  \n  \n(1) Included in interest income, net is $0.4 million of interest expense related to the sales tax liability and $0.6 million of interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

We have provided reconciliations below of adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most\ndirectly comparable GAAP \u0000nancial measures.\nWe have included adjusted EBITDA, herein, because it is a key measure used by our management and Board of\nDirectors to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans, and make strategic decisions\nregarding the allocation of capital. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating adjusted EBITDA\nfacilitates operating performance comparability across reporting periods by removing the e\u0000ect of non-cash\nexpenses and other expenses. Accordingly, we believe that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to\ninvestors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our\nmanagement and Board of Directors.\nWe believe it is useful to exclude non-cash charges, such as share-based compensation expense, depreciation and\namortization from our adjusted EBITDA because the amount of such expenses in any speci\u0000c period may not\ndirectly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations. We believe it is useful to exclude\n5\nincome tax provision and interest income (expense), as neither are components of our core business operations.\nWe also believe that it is useful to exclude other expenses, including the investment banking fee related to the\nVetster partnership, acquisition costs related to PetCareRx, employee severance and estimated state sales tax\naccrual as these items are not indicative of our ongoing operations. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as a \u0000nancial\nmeasure, and these non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our\nresults as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nAlthough depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized\nmay have to be replaced in the future and adjusted EBITDA does not re\u0000ect capital expenditure requirements\nfor such replacements or for new capital expenditures;\nAdjusted EBITDA does not re\u0000ect share-based compensation. Share-based compensation has been, and will\ncontinue to be for the foreseeable future, a material recurring expense in our business and an important part\nof our compensation strategy;\nAdjusted EBITDA does not re\u0000ect interest income (expense), net; or changes in, or cash requirements for, our\nworking capital;\nAdjusted EBITDA does not re\u0000ect transaction related costs and other items which are either not\nrepresentative of our underlying operations or are incremental costs that result from an actual or planned\ntransaction and include litigation matters, integration consulting fees, internal salaries and wages (to the\nextent the individuals are assigned full-time to integration and transformation activities) and certain costs\nrelated to integrating and converging IT systems;\nAdjusted EBITDA does not re\u0000ect certain non-operating expenses including the employee severance which\nreduces cash available to us;\nAdjusted EBITDA does not re\u0000ect certain expenses including the estimated state sales tax accrual which\nreduces cash available to us.\nOther companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate adjusted EBITDA di\u0000erently, which\nreduces the measures usefulness as comparative measures.\nBecause of these and other limitations, adjusted EBITDA should only be considered as supplemental to, and\nalongside with other GAAP based \u0000nancial performance measures, including various cash \u0000ow metrics, net income,\nnet margin, and our other GAAP results.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure to\nadjusted EBITDA for each of the periods indicated:\n6\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\nPetMed Express, Inc.\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended Increase (Decrease)\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n($ in thousands, except percentages) 2024 2023 $ %\nConsolidated Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA:\nNet income $ 2,326 $ 715 $ 1,611 225%\nAdd (subtract):\nStock-based Compensation $ 573 $ 1,728 $ (1,155) (67)%\nIncome Taxes $ (1,401) $ 565 $ (1,966) (348)%\nDepreciation and Amortization $ 1,658 $ 1,713 $ (55) (3)%\nInterest (Income), Net(1) $ (185) $ (151) $ (34) 23%\nAcquisition/Partnership Transactions and Other Items $ – $ 168 $ (168) (100)%\nEmployee Severance $ 305 $ 15 $ 290 1933%\nSales Tax (Income) $ (1,178) $ (1,316) $ 138 (10)%\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 2,098 $ 3,437 $ (1,339) (39)%\n(1) Included in interest income, net is $0.4 million of interest expense related to the sales tax liability and $0.6\nmillion of interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nNote 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nOrganization\nPetMed Express, Inc. and subsidiaries, d/b/a PetMeds® (collectively, the “Company”), is a leading nationwide direct-to-consumer pet pharmacy and\nonline provider of prescription and non-prescription medications, food, supplements, supplies and vet services for dogs, cats, and horses. The Company\nmarkets and sells directly to consumers through its websites, toll-free numbers, and mobile application. The Company offers consumers an attractive alternative\nfor obtaining pet medications, foods, and supplies in terms of convenience, price, speed of delivery, and valued customer service.\nFounded in 1996, the Company’s executive headquarters offices are currently located in Delray Beach, Florida. The Company’s fiscal year end is\nMarch 31, and references herein to fiscal 2025 or fiscal 2024 refer to the Company's fiscal years ending March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nBasis of Presentation and Consolidation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and,\ntherefore, do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\") for complete\nfinancial statements. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments,\nconsisting of normal recurring accruals, necessary to present fairly the financial position of the Company at September 30, 2024, the Statements of Operations\nfor the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and Cash Flows for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The results of\noperations for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results expected for the fiscal year ending\nMarch 31, 2025. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in our 2024 Form\n10-K. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of PetMed Express, Inc. and its direct and indirect wholly owned\nsubsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited condensed\nconsolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from\nthose estimates.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe carrying amounts of the Company's cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term\nnature of these instruments.\nDeferred Revenue\nDeferred revenue is recorded when payments are received or due in advance of performing our service obligations and revenue is recognized over the\nservice period. Deferred revenue represents prepayments of PetPlus memberships with PetCareRx, Inc. (“PetCareRx”). The total deferred revenue as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024 for these memberships was $1.6 million and $2.6 million, respectively. Memberships provide discounted pricing, free\nstandard shipping, veterinary telehealth services and local Caremark Pharmacy prescription pickup. The membership fee is an annual charge and automatically\nrenews one year from the initial enrollment date. The Company generally recognizes the revenue ratably over the term of the membership.\nLong-lived Assets\nLong-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nRecoverability of assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the\nasset. Management determined that no impairment of long-lived assets existed as of September 30, 2024.\n5\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination. The Company is required to\nassess goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have\noccurred. The Company performs its annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year. The Company has concluded that it has one reporting\nunit and has assigned the entire balance of goodwill to this reporting unit. If the carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an\nimpairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.\nThe Company performed a goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2024 initially using a qualitative assessment. The Company considered its share\nprice decreases as well as the decrease in its quarterly sales from the three months ended June 30, 2024 to be indicative of a risk that the carrying amount of\ngoodwill may not be recoverable. Based on these and other qualitative factors, the Company determined a triggering event occurred that required an interim\ngoodwill impairment test. The Company performed a quantitative impairment test and valuation to identify the fair value of its reporting unit.\nBased on the quantitative assessment, the Company concluded that goodwill was not impaired because the estimated fair value of the reporting unit\nexceeded its carrying value by approximately $44.8 million. The Company estimated the fair value of its reporting unit using a combination of a discounted\ncash flow and public company market approach with a 70% and 30% weighting, respectively. A key assumption under the cash flow approach was a 30%\nweighted average cost of capital. A key assumption under the public company market approach was a 10% control premium.\nThe Company’s other indefinite-lived intangible assets are primarily made up of a trade name which was evaluated for impairment using a qualitative\nassessment and concluded it was not more likely than not that the other indefinite-lived assets were impaired as of September 30, 2024.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Company does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on\nthe Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Update 2023-07, \"Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to\nReportable Segment Disclosures\". This Update applies to all public entities that are required to report segment information in accordance with Topic 280. The\namendments in this Update revise reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The\namendments in this Update do not change how a public entity identifies its operating segments, aggregates those operating segments, or applies the quantitative\nthresholds to determine its reportable segments. The Update effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal\nyears beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Update should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the\nfinancial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this Update.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued Update 2023-09, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\". This Update applies to all\nentities that are subject to Topic 740. The amendments in this Update revise income tax disclosures primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes\npaid information as well as the effectiveness of certain other income tax disclosures. The Update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15,\n2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Update should be applied on a prospective basis, but retrospective application is permitted. The Company is currently\nevaluating the impact of adopting this Update.\nNote 2: Revenue Recognition\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 606 (\"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\"), the Company generates revenue by selling prescription and non-\nprescription pet medication products, pet food, supplements, supplies, membership fees, and veterinary services. Certain pet supplies offered on the Company’s\nwebsites are drop shipped to customers. The Company considers itself the principal in the arrangement because the Company controls the specified good\nbefore it is transferred to the customer. Revenue contracts contain one performance obligation, which is delivery of the product. Customer care and support is\ndeemed not to be a material right to the contract. The transaction price is adjusted at the date of sale for any applicable sales discounts and an estimate of\nproduct returns, which are based on historical patterns, however this is not considered a key judgment. Revenue is recognized when control transfers to the\ncustomer at the point in time at which the\n6\nshipment of the product occurs. This key judgment is determined as the shipping point, which represents the point in time when the Company has a present\nright to payment, title has transferred to the customer, and the customer has assumed the risks and rewards of ownership. Virtually all the Company’s sales are\npaid by credit cards and the Company usually receives the cash settlement in two to three banking days. Credit card sales minimize the accounts receivable\nbalances relative to sales.\nOutbound shipping and handling fees are an accounting policy election and are included in sales as the Company considers itself the principal in the\narrangement given its responsibility for supplier selection and discretion over pricing. Shipping costs associated with outbound freight after control over a\nproduct has transferred to a customer are an accounting policy election and are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of sales.\nMembership fees represent the amounts recognized from two membership models. The first is the PetPlus membership for PetCareRx customers, the\nsecond is a partner membership, which allows employees in-network to join PetPlus membership program through their employers. These memberships\nprovide discounted pricing, free standard shipping, veterinary telehealth services and local Caremark Pharmacy prescription pickup which represent a single\nstand-ready performance obligation to provide these benefits. The PetPlus membership fee is an upfront annual charge and automatically renews one year from\nthe initial enrollment date. The Company recognizes the revenue ratably over the term of the PetPlus membership which is generally one year. As shown in the\nfollowing table, under the PetPlus program, the Company recognized $1.2 million and $2.7 million of previously deferred annual membership fees in the three\nand six months ended September 30, 2024, and had $1.6 million of deferred revenue as of the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n(amounts in millions)\nDeferred revenue, March 31, 2024 $ 2.6\nDeferred memberships fees and others received 1.1\nDeferred membership fee revenue and others recognized (1.5)\nDeferred revenue, June 30, 2024 2.1\nDeferred memberships fees and others received 0.7\nDeferred membership fee revenue and others recognized (1.2)\nDeferred revenue, September 30, 2024 $ 1.6\nIn addition to annual membership fees earned under the PetPlus program, the Company also earns membership fees on a month-to-month basis under its\nPetCareRx partner membership program. For the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, membership fees earned under the partner program were\n$0.9 million and $1.8 million, respectively. For the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, membership fees earned under the partner program were\n$0.7 million and $1.3 million, respectively.\nThe Company has no material contract asset or liability balances at September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively.\nThe Company disaggregates sales in the following categories: reorder sales vs new order sales vs membership fees. The following table illustrates sales in\nthose categories:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Increase (Decrease)\nRevenue (in thousands) 2024 % 2023 % $ %\nReorder sales $ 50,052 84.0 % $ 58,017 81.7 % $ (7,965) (13.7)%\nNew order sales 7,449 12.5 % 10,558 14.9 % (3,109) (29.4)%\nMembership fees 2,069 3.5 % 2,424 3.4 % (355) (14.6)%\nTotal net sales $ 59,570 100.0 % $ 70,999 100.0 % $ (11,429) (16.1)%\n7\nSix Months Ended September 30, Increase (Decrease)\nRevenue (in thousands) 2024 % 2023 % $ %\nReorder sales $ 104,291 81.8 % $ 120,182 80.6 % $ (15,891) (13.2)%\nNew order sales 18,838 14.8 % 24,251 16.2 % (5,413) (22.3)%\nMembership fees 4,393 3.4 % 4,810 3.2 % (417) (8.7)%\nTotal net sales $ 127,522 100.0 % $ 149,243 100.0 % $ (21,721) (14.6)%\nThe Company changed the definition of a new order sale on July 1, 2024, to include sales from customers who have not previously ordered from the\nCompany over the past twelve months compared to the prior definition which was thirty-six months. The reorder and new order sales amounts for the three and\nsix months ended September 30, 2024, and the reorder and new order sales amounts for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023 reflect this new\ncustomer definition change.\nUnder the previous definition of a new customer, reorder and new order sales were $62.4 million and $6.2 million, respectively, for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. Under the previous definition of a new customer, reorder and new order sales were $130.4 million and $14.0 million, respectively, for the\nsix months ended September 30, 2023.\nNote 3: Net Income (Loss) Per Share\nIn accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 260 (“Earnings Per Share”) basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income available to\ncommon shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per common share includes the\ndilutive effect of potential restricted and performance stock and the effects of the potential conversion of preferred shares, calculated using the treasury stock\nmethod. Unvested restricted stock and convertible preferred shares issued by the Company represent the only dilutive effect reflected in the diluted weighted\naverage shares outstanding.\n8\nThe following is a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted net income (loss) per share computations for the periods\npresented (in thousands, except for share and per share amounts):\nSix Months Ended\nThree Months Ended September 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet income (loss) (numerator):\nNet income (loss) $ 2,326 $ 715 $ 6,080 $ (421)\nShares (denominator):\nWeighted average number of common shares outstanding\nused in basic computation 20,597,807 20,382,979 20,555,544 20,357,752\nCommon shares issuable upon vesting of restricted stock 330,885 387,351 374,492 —\nCommon shares issuable upon conversion of preferred\nshares 10,125 10,125 10,125 —\nShares used in diluted computation 20,938,817 20,780,455 20,940,161 20,357,752\nNet income (loss) per common share:\nBasic $ 0.11 $ 0.04 $ 0.30 $ (0.02)\nDiluted $ 0.11 $ 0.03 $ 0.29 $ (0.02)\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, 661,440 and 435,558 shares issuable upon vesting of restricted stock and zero and zero shares\nissuable upon conversion of preferred shares, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted net income (loss) per common share, as their\ninclusion would have had an anti-dilutive effect on diluted net income (loss) per common share.\nFor the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, 504,930 and 842,714 shares issuable upon vesting of restricted stock and zero and 10,125 shares\nissuable upon conversion of preferred shares, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted net income (loss) per common share, as their\ninclusion would have had an anti-dilutive effect on diluted net income (loss) per common share.\nNote 4: Stock-Based Compensation\nThe Company records compensation expense associated with restricted stock in accordance with ASC Topic 718 (“Compensation - Stock Compensation”).\nThe Company had 426,380 common shares issued under the 2016 Employee Equity Compensation Restricted Stock Plan (the “2016 Employee Plan”) (which\n2016 Employee Plan was succeeded by the 2022 Employee Plan in April 2023, and no further awards will be granted under the 2016 Employee Plan), 59,074\ncommon shares issued under the 2022 Employee Equity Compensation Plan (as amended) (the “2022 Employee Plan”), and 257,567 common shares issued\nunder the 2015 Outside Director Equity Compensation Plan (as amended) (the “2015 Director Plan”). At September 30, 2024, all shares were issued with\nservice-based vesting conditions with the exception of 2,000 performance stock units which vested on July 1, 2024. The Company records stock-based\ncompensation expense for these awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Company reverses stock-based compensation expense\npreviously recorded upon forfeiture of unvested awards except for the performance restricted shares with a market condition issued to the former Chief\nExecutive Officer (“CEO”) and performance stock units (“PSUs”) with a market condition issued to the former Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) as described\nin the following paragraphs. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense related to\nrestricted stock awards of $0.6 million and $1.7 million, respectively. For the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded a\n(reversal) and stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock awards of $(7.6) million and $3.5 million, respectively.\nIn June 2023, the Board of Directors amended and restated the 2015 Director Plan and the 2022 Employee Plan (collectively, the \"Plans\") to include the\nability to grant restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") and performance stock units\n9\n(\"PSUs\") under the Plans. The amendments and restatement of the Plans did not increase the maximum number of shares of common stock that could be\nawarded under the Plans. At September 30, 2024, the Company had 43,000 RSUs outstanding under the 2024 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2024 Omnibus\nPlan”), 290,000 RSUs outstanding under the 2024 Inducement Incentive Plan (the “2024 Inducement Plan”), 608,219 RSUs outstanding under the 2022\nEmployee Plan and 22,316 RSUs outstanding under the 2015 Director Plan.\nIn August 2021, the Company issued 90,000 shares of restricted stock and 510,000 performance restricted shares with a market condition to the\nCompany’s former CEO, in accordance with the former CEO’s employment agreement, under the 2016 Employee Plan. In April 2024, the Company and\nformer CEO entered into a Transition and Separation Agreement pursuant to which the Company cancelled the 510,000 performance restricted shares and\naccelerated vesting on 30,000 remaining unvested restricted shares which otherwise would not have vested. Cancellation of the 510,000 shares resulted in an\n$8.8 million reversal of compensation expense, partially offset by $0.1 million of compensation expense from the accelerated vesting of the 30,000 shares in\nthe six months ended September 30, 2024.\nOn April 29, 2024, the Company appointed a new CEO, and in conjunction with her new employment agreement, she received a grant of 483,092 RSUs\nunder the Company’s 2022 Employee Equity Compensation Plan for a number of RSUs equal to $2.0 million divided by the closing price of the Company’s\ncommon stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market on the date of grant, subject to a $4.00 minimum stock price. Such RSUs will vest in one-third increments on each\nof the first three anniversaries of the date of grant so long as the CEO continues to be employed by the Company on each vesting date, and such RSUs will\notherwise contain the standard provisions for RSU grants by the Company.\nIn August 2022, the Company issued 13,000 restricted shares and 3,000 performance restricted shares to the Company's former CFO, in accordance with\nthe CFO's employment agreement, under the 2016 Employee Plan. One-third of the restricted shares were scheduled to vest on each of the first three\nanniversaries of the date of grant, subject to the CFO’s continued employment with the Company through the applicable vesting date, with any unvested RSUs\nbeing forfeited upon the CFO ceasing to be an employee of the Company. The performance restricted shares were based on the attainment of performance\ncriteria equally weighted between adjusted EBITDA and revenue, and on June 8, 2023 the Company determined that the performance criteria were not attained\nover the applicable performance period and the performance restricted shares were cancelled.\nIn June 2023, the Company granted the Company's former CFO 11,750 RSUs under the 2022 Employee Plan, of which 3,750 RSUs were awarded in\nrecognition of the CFO’s contributions during fiscal year 2023 and the remaining 8,000 awarded as a part of the equity award cycle for fiscal year 2024. One-\nthird of the RSUs were scheduled to vest on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant, subject to the CFO’s continued employment with the\nCompany through the applicable vesting date, with any unvested RSUs being forfeited upon the former CFO ceasing to be an employee of the Company. Also\nin June 2023, the former CFO was awarded 8,000 PSUs with a market condition.\nOn May 16, 2024, the Company granted the former CFO 74,850 RSUs of which 14,970 would vest on June 30, 2024, 22,455 would vest August 31, 2024\nand 37,425 would vest on August 31, 2025. On May 31, 2024, the Company and CFO entered into a Transition and Separation Agreement pursuant to which\nthe former CFO agreed to leave the Company following a transition period. Upon the completion of the transition period and contingent on the former CFO’s\ncomplying with the terms of the Agreement, the Company accelerated the vesting of all unvested restricted shares and RSUs that were originally scheduled to\nvest on or before August 3, 2025. Under the Agreement, PSUs with a market condition were cancelled. Acceleration and cancellation of the former CFO’s\nrestricted shares, RSUs and PSUs resulted in net additional compensation expense of $0.2 million in the three months ended June 30, 2024.\nOn August 8, 2024, the Company adopted the 2024 Omnibus Plan pursuant to which the Company reserved 850,000 shares of common stock, par value\n$.001 per share, of the Company’s common stock for the issuance of equity awards granted.\nOn September 27, 2024, the Company adopted the 2024 Inducement Plan pursuant to which the Company reserved 350,000 shares of common stock, par\nvalue $.001 per share, of the Company’s common stock (subject to the adjustment provisions of the Inducement Plan) for the issuance of equity awards granted\nunder the Inducement Plan.\nOn September 27, 2024, the new CFO received a grant of 250,000 RSUs under the Company’s 2024 Inducement Plan for a number of RSUs equal to\n$1.0 million divided by the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market on the date of grant, subject to a $4.00 minimum stock\nprice. Such RSUs will vest in one-third increments on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant so long as the CFO continues to be employed by\nthe Company on each vesting date, and such RSUs will otherwise contain the standard provisions for RSU grants by the Company.\n10\nAll stock-based compensation expense is recognized as a payroll-related expense and it is included within the general and administrative expenses line\nitem within the Company’s unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, and the offset is included in the additional paid-in capital line item of\nthe Company’s unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nRestricted Stock Awards\nThe fair value assigned to restricted stock awards (“RSAs”) is the market price of the Company’s stock at the grant date. The vesting period ranges from\none to three years. Restricted stock award activity under the 2016 Employee Plan, 2022 Employee Plan, and 2015 Director Plan was as follows:\nWeighted-\n2015 Director 2016 Employee 2022 Employee Average Grant\nPlan Plan Plan Total Date Fair Value\nNon-vested restricted stock outstanding at March\n31, 2024 23,707 605,343 74,076 703,126 $ 19.39\nGranted and issued – – – – $ –\nVested (13,666) (59,256) (46,742) (119,664)$ 22.08\nForfeited – (530,880) (23,334) (554,214)$ 18.72\nBalance at September 30, 2024 10,041 15,207 4,000 29,248 $ 21.05\nAt September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were 29,248 and 725,529 RSAs subject to restriction and forfeiture outstanding, respectively. For the three months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense related to RSAs of $0.2 million and $1.6 million, respectively.\nFor the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded a (reversal) stock-based compensation expense related to RSAs of\n$(8.3) million and $3.4 million, respectively.\nRestricted Stock Units\nThe Company first granted RSUs in the year ended March 31, 2024. The fair value assigned to RSUs is the market price of the Company’s stock on the\ngrant date. The vesting period for employees and members of the Board of Directors generally ranges from one to three years. For the six months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, RSU activity under the Plans was as follows:\nWeighted-Average\nGrant Date\nRSUs Fair Value Per RSU\nBalance at March 31, 2024 85,080 $ 12.75\nGranted 995,258 $ 4.01\nVested and issued (66,739) $ 8.38\nForfeited (50,064) $ 6.50\nBalance at September 30, 2024 963,535 $ 4.35\nThe total grant-date fair value of RSUs granted during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $1.2 million and $0.9 million,\nrespectively. The total grant-date fair value of RSUs granted during the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $4.0 million and $1.1 million,\nrespectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense related to RSUs of $0.4\nmillion and $0.1 million, respectively. For the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense\nrelated to RSUs of $0.7 million and $0.1 million, respectively.\nPerformance Stock Units\nThe fair value assigned to PSUs is determined using the market price of the Company’s stock on the grant date for awards with a performance condition,\nand by using a Monte Carlo simulation for awards with a market condition. PSUs with a performance condition generally vest over one year. PSUs with a\nmarket condition generally vest over three years. Stock-based compensation expense associated with PSUs with a performance condition are re-assessed each\nreporting\n11\nperiod based upon the estimated performance attainment on the reporting date until the performance conditions are met. The ultimate number of shares of\ncommon stock that are issued to an employee is the result of the actual performance of the Company or individual at the end of the performance period\ncompared to the performance targets.\nPSU activity under the Plans was as follows:\nWeighted-Average\nGrant Date\nPSUs Fair Value Per PSU\nBalance at March 31, 2024 12,000 $ 10.48\nGranted – $ –\nVested and issued (2,000) $ 13.95\nForfeited (10,000) $ 9.79\nPerformance adjustment – $ –\nBalance at September 30, 2024 – $ –\nIn the six months ended September 30, 2024, 10,000 PSUs were forfeited. The total grant-date fair value of PSUs granted during the six months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023 was zero and $0.1 million, respectively. There were no PSU’s granted in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, related to PSUs of\nzero and $20 thousand, respectively. For the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense, net\nof forfeitures, related to PSUs of $(36) thousand and $24 thousand, respectively.\nNote 5: Fair Value\nThe Company carries cash and cash equivalents at fair value in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Fair value is defined as an exit\nprice, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As\nsuch, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a\nliability. ASC Topic 820 (“Fair Value Measurement”) establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation\nmethodologies in measuring fair value:\nLevel 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2 - Include other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity.\nThe fair value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair\nvalue. At September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, the Company had invested the majority of its $52.0 million and $55.3 million cash and cash equivalents\nbalance in money market funds which are classified within Level 1.\n12\nNote 6: Intangible and Other Assets, Net\nIntangible assets and other assets, net consisted of the following (in thousands):\nWeighted Average\nAccumulated Net Carrying Remaining Useful\nUseful Life Gross Value Amortization Value Life (Years)\nSeptember 30, 2024\nIntangible Assets\nToll-free telephone number Indefinite $ 375 $ – $ 375 Indefinite\nInternet domain names Indefinite 485 – 485 Indefinite\nTrade Names - PetCareRx Indefinite 2,600 – 2,600 Indefinite\nCustomer Relationships -PetCareRx 7 years 6,700 (1,436) 5,264 5.5 years\nDeveloped Technology - PetCareRx 3 years 3,000 (1,500) 1,500 1.5 years\n$ 13,160 $ (2,936) $ 10,224\nOther Assets\nInitial minority interest investment in Vetster N/A 5,300 – 5,300 N/A\nBalance September 30, 2024 $ 18,460 $ (2,936) $ 15,524\nMarch 31, 2024\nIntangible Assets\nToll-free telephone number Indefinite $ 375 $ – $ 375 Indefinite\nInternet domain names Indefinite 485 – 485 Indefinite\nTrade Names - PetCareRx Indefinite 2,600 2,600 Indefinite\nCustomer Relationships -PetCareRx 7 years 6,700 (957) $ 5,743 6 years\nDeveloped Technology - PetCareRx 3 years 3,000 (1,000) $ 2,000 2 years\n$ 13,160 $ (1,957) $ 11,203\nOther Assets\nInitial minority interest investment in Vetster N/A 5,300 – 5,300 N/A\nBalance March 31, 2024 $ 18,460 $ (1,957) $ 16,503\nAmortization expense for intangible assets was $0.5 million and $0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nAmortization expense for intangible assets was $1.0 million and $1.0 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The\nindefinite life intangibles are not being amortized and are subject to an annual review for impairment in accordance with the ASC Topic 350 (“Goodwill and\nOther Intangible Assets”).\nOn April 19, 2022, the Company engaged in a three-year partnership agreement with Vetster Inc. (“Vetster”), a Canadian veterinary telehealth company.\nThe Company also purchased a 5% minority interest in Vetster in the amount of $5.0 million and received warrants for additional equity in Vetster, which are\ntied to future performance milestones. Under the terms of the agreement, Vetster became the exclusive provider of telehealth and telemedicine services to the\nCompany. The minority interest investment is being valued on the cost basis and the investment will be evaluated periodically for any impairment. On October\n3, 2023, the Company purchased additional shares in Vetster in the amount of $0.3 million. This increases the minority interest investment to $5.3 million.\nFollowing this round, the Company’s minority ownership changed to approximately 4.8% of Vetster’s outstanding shares.\nNote 7: Commitments and Contingencies\nLegal Matters and Routine Proceedings\nOn April 18, 2024, Plaintiff Timothy Fitchett (“Plaintiff”) filed an action against the Company in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County,\nPennsylvania, on behalf of himself and purportedly on behalf of a class of others\n13\nsimilarly situated. Plaintiff alleges that the Company violated Pennsylvania’s Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law by representing “reg.”\nprices for products which the Company allegedly never charged for those products. On May 13, 2024, the Company removed the matter to the U.S. District\nCourt for the Western District of Pennsylvania in Pittsburgh. The company successfully opposed the Plaintiff's motion to remand the case back to the Court of\nCommon Pleas. On the face of the Complaint, Plaintiff is seeking damages for himself in the amount of the allegedly illusory discounts he allegedly believed\nhe was receiving when purchasing products from the Company or, in the alternative, a complete refund of amounts he paid to the Company, and he is also\nseeking a liability determination for members of the proposed class. The Company denies liability in this matter and intends to defend the action accordingly,\nand the Company cannot determine materiality or estimate a range of potential liability, if any, at this time if the Company were determined to be liable.\nThe Company may from time to time be involved in various other claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business, including claims related to\nproducts, product warranties, contracts, employment, intellectual property, consumer protection, pharmacy and other regulatory matters. The Company has\nsettled complaints that had been filed with various states’ pharmacy boards in the past. There can be no assurances made that other states will not attempt to\ntake similar actions against the Company in the future. The Company also intends to vigorously defend its trade or service marks. There can be no assurance\nthat the Company will be successful in protecting its trade or service marks. Legal costs related to the above matters are expensed as incurred. From time to\ntime, the Company may be involved in and subject to disputes and legal proceedings, as well as demands, claims and threatened litigation that arise in the\nordinary course of its business. These proceedings may include allegations involving business practices, infringement of intellectual property, employment or\nother matters. The ultimate outcome of any legal proceeding is often uncertain, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in any legal\nproceeding, and unfavorable outcomes could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. In accordance with ASC Topic 450-20\n(\"Loss Contingencies\"), the Company records a liability in its financial statements for these matters when a loss is known or considered probable and the\namount can be reasonably estimated. The Company reviews the status of each significant matter each accounting period as additional information is known and\nadjusts the loss provision when appropriate. If a matter is both probable to result in a liability and the amounts of loss can be reasonably estimated, the\nCompany estimates and discloses the possible loss or range of loss to the extent necessary to make the financial statements not misleading. If the loss is not\nprobable and cannot be reasonably estimated, a liability is not recorded in the Company’s financial statements. Gain contingencies are not recorded until they\nare realized. Legal costs related to any legal matters are expensed as incurred.\nNote 8: Changes in Shareholders’ Equity:\nChanges in Shareholders’ Equity for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 is summarized below (in thousands):\nAdditional\nPaid-In Retained\nCommon Stock Capital Earnings\nBeginning balance at March 31, 2024: $ 21 $ 25,146 $ 71,555\nStock based compensation (reversal) — (8,204) —\nDividends forfeited — — 1,250\nNet income — — 3,754\nEnding balance at June 30, 2024: $ 21 $ 16,942 $ 76,559\nStock based compensation expense — 573 —\nDividends forfeited — — 4\nNet income — — 2,326\nEnding balance at September 30, 2024: $ 21 $ 17,515 $ 78,889\n14\nChanges in Shareholders’ Equity for the three and six months ended ended September 30, 2023 is summarized below (in thousands):\nAdditional\nPaid-In Retained\nCommon Stock Capital Earnings\nBeginning balance at March 31, 2023: $ 21 $ 18,277 $ 91,659\nStock based compensation expense — 1,760 —\nDividends declared — — (6,346)\nNet loss — — (1,136)\nEnding balance at June 30, 2023: $ 21 $ 20,037 $ 84,177\nStock based compensation expense — 1,728 —\nDividends declared — — (6,308)\nNet income — — 715\nEnding balance at September 30, 2023: $ 21 $ 21,765 $ 78,584\nThere were no shares of common stock that were purchased or retired in the six months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023.\nNote 9: Income Taxes\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of approximately $1.4 million and an income tax\nprovision of approximately $0.6 million, respectively, and for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded an income tax\nbenefit of $0.4 million and an income tax provision of $0.3 million, respectively. The decrease in the income tax provision for the three and six months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 is related to the cancellation of the former CEO’s performance stock units resulting in additional $8.7 million of increased income during\nthe year. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately (151.5)%, compared to approximately 44.1% for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, and the effective tax rate for the six months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately (7.9)%, compared to\napproximately (184.5)% for the six months ended September 30, 2023 . The projected full-year effective tax rate used for purposes of the income tax provision\nfor the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 reflects the $1.8 million impact of a favorable permanent difference associated with the cancellation of\nthe former CEO’s performance restricted shares. No tax benefit was recorded for the original compensation expense due to expected limitation under Internal\nRevenue Code Section 162 (m) and therefore, there is no tax benefit to reverse upon cancellation of the stock. The impact of this favorable permanent\ndifference is partially offset by the impacts of stock compensation recognized for book and tax purposes.\nUnder Internal Revenue Code Section 382, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change”, the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change net operating\nloss and tax credit carryforwards to offset its post-change income and tax liabilities may be limited. Generally, an ownership change occurs when the equity\nownership of one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who owns at least 5% of a corporation’s stock increases its ownership by more than 50\npercentage points over their lowest ownership percentage in a testing period (typically three years). On April 3, 2023, 100% of the issued and outstanding stock\nof PetCareRx was acquired by the Company. The merger triggered an ownership change of PetCareRx within the meaning of Section 382.\nAs a result of the acquisition, the Company performed a Section 382 analysis to determine if the net operating losses carried forward would have a utilization\nlimitation. Any limitation could result in the expiration of a portion of the federal net operating loss carryforward before utilization, which would reduce the\nCompany's gross deferred tax assets. As of April 3, 2023, and prior to the acquisition, PetCareRx had approximately $96.0 million of net operating losses and\n$1.9 million of disallowed interest expense. The results of the Section 382 analysis determined the net operating losses and disallowed interest expense in total,\nwould be limited and reduced to approximately $14.5 million.\nNote 10: Related Party Transaction\nOn September 29, 2024 the Company entered into a master services agreement with Fabric, Inc ( “Fabric”), a privately-held company. Under this\nagreement, Fabric will provide services to the Company with a one-year term with auto-renewal unless either party provides notice at least 90 days in advance.\nPer the terms of the agreement, the Company will pay Fabric, $115,000 the first year and $100,000 for each potential year thereafter with potential changes in\nthe\n15\namounts paid based on actual usage of Fabric’s services. There was no amount owed by the Company to Fabric as of September 30, 2024. Sandra Campos,\nChief Executive Officer and President of the Company, is an investor in Fabric and serves on the Board of Directors of Fabric. This transaction was reviewed\nand approved by the Company’s Audit Committee of the Board of Directors in accordance with the Company’s related party transaction policy.\n16\nITEM 2.

We\nassume no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\nWhen used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise indicates, \"PetMed Express,\" \"PetMeds,\" \"PetMed,\"\n\"the Company,\" \"we,\" \"our,\" and \"us\" refers to PetMed Express, Inc. and its direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, taken as a whole.\nExecutive Summary\nPetMed Express, Inc. and subsidiaries, d/b/a PetMeds®, is a leading nationwide direct-to-consumer pet pharmacy and online provider of prescription and\nnon-prescription medications, foods, supplements, supplies and vet services for dogs, cats and horses.

Our sales\nconsist of products sold mainly to retail consumers. The average purchase was approximately $96 and $94 for the quarters ended September 30, 2024, and\nSeptember 30, 2023, respectively.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and the results of our operations contained herein are based upon our condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements and the data used to prepare them. Our condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of America. On an ongoing basis we re-evaluate our judgments and estimates including those related to\nproduct returns, bad debts, inventories, and income taxes. We base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience, knowledge of current conditions,\nand our beliefs of what could occur in the future considering available information. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions\nor conditions. Our estimates are guided by observing the following critical accounting policies.\nThere have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies as compared to the significant accounting policies described in our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K, filed on June 11, 2024, except as noted below:\n17\nLong-lived Assets\nLong-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nRecoverability of assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the\nasset. Management determined that no impairment of long-lived assets existed as of September 30, 2024.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination. The Company is required to\nassess goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have\noccurred. The Company performs its annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year. The Company has concluded that it has one reporting\nunit and has assigned the entire balance of goodwill to this reporting unit. If the carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an\nimpairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.\nThe Company performed a goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2024 initially using a qualitative assessment. The Company considered its share\nprice decreases as well as the decrease in its quarterly sales from the three months ended June 30, 2024 to be indicative of a risk that the carrying amount of\ngoodwill may not be recoverable. Based on these and other qualitative factors, the Company determined a triggering event occurred that required an interim\ngoodwill impairment test. The Company performed a quantitative impairment test and valuation to identify the fair value of its reporting unit.\nBased on the quantitative assessment, the Company concluded that goodwill was not impaired because the estimated fair value of the reporting unit\nexceeded its carrying value by approximately $44.8 million. The Company estimated the fair value of its reporting unit using a combination of a discounted\ncash flow and public company market approach with a 70% and 30% weighting, respectively. A key assumption under the cash flow approach was a 30%\nweighted average cost of capital. A key assumption under the public company market approach was a 10% control premium.\nThe Company’s other indefinite-lived intangible assets are primarily made up of a trade name which was evaluated for impairment using a qualitative\nassessment and concluded it was not more likely than not that the other indefinite-lived assets were impaired as of September 30, 2024.\nEconomic Conditions, Challenges, and Risk\nMacroeconomic factors, including inflation, increased interest rates, significant capital market and supply chain volatility, and global economic and\ngeopolitical developments, have direct and indirect impacts on our results of operations that are difficult to isolate and quantify. In addition, rising fuel, utility,\nand food costs, rising interest rates, and recessionary fears may impact customer demand and our ability to forecast consumer spending patterns. We also\nexpect the current macroeconomic environment and enterprise customer cost optimization efforts to impact our revenue growth rates. We expect some or all of\nthese factors to continue to impact our operations for the remainder of fiscal 2025.\n18\nResults of Operations\nThe following should be read in conjunction with our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes thereto included\nelsewhere herein. The following table sets forth, as a percentage of sales, certain operating data appearing in our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements\nof Income (Loss):\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nSales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 %\nCost of sales 70.9 71.7 72.3 71.5\nGross profit 29.1 28.3 27.7 28.5\nOperating expenses:\nGeneral and administrative 17.6 16.8 12.1 18.5\nAdvertising 7.7 7.8 9.1 8.6\nDepreciation and amortization 2.8 2.4 2.6 2.3\nTotal operating expenses 28.1 27.0 23.8 29.4\nIncome (loss) from operations 1.0 1.3 3.9 (0.9)\nTotal other income 0.6 0.6 0.5 0.7\nIncome (loss) before provision for income taxes 1.6 1.9 4.4 (0.2)\n(Benefit) provision for income taxes (2.4) 0.8 (0.3) 0.2\nNet income (loss) 4.0 % 1.1 % 4.8 % (0.4)%\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA\nTo provide investors and the market with additional information regarding our financial results, we have disclosed (see below) adjusted EBITDA, a non-\nGAAP financial measure that we calculate as net income excluding share-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, income tax provision,\ninterest income (expense), and other non-operational expenses. We have provided reconciliations below of net income to adjusted EBITDA, the most directly\ncomparable GAAP financial measures.\nWe have included adjusted EBITDA herein because it is a key measure used by our management and Board of Directors to evaluate our operating\nperformance, generate future operating plans, and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in\ncalculating adjusted EBITDA facilitates operating performance comparability across reporting periods by removing the effect of non-cash expenses and other\nexpenses. Accordingly, we believe that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating\nresults in the same manner as our management and Board of Directors.\nWe believe it is useful to exclude non-cash charges, such as net stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization from our adjusted\nEBITDA because the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations. We\nbelieve it is useful to exclude income tax provision and interest income (expense), as neither are components of our core business operations. We also believe\nthat it is useful\n19\nto exclude other non-operational expenses, including acquisition costs related to PetCareRx, employee severance and estimated state sales tax accruals and\nsettlements as these items are not indicative of our ongoing operations. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as a financial measure, and these non-GAAP\nmeasures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\n• Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future and\nadjusted EBITDA does not reflect capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditures;\n• Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect net share-based compensation. Share-based compensation has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future,\na material recurring expense in our business and an important part of our compensation strategy;\n• Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest income (expense), net; or changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital;\n• Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect transaction related costs and other items which are either not representative of our underlying operations or are\nincremental costs that result from an actual or planned transaction and include litigation matters, integration consulting fees, internal salaries and wages\n(to the extent the individuals are assigned full-time to integration and transformation activities) and certain costs related to integrating and converging IT\nsystems;\n• Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect certain non-operating expenses including the employee severance which reduces cash available to us;\n• Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect certain non operating expenses (income) including sales tax expense (income) relating to recording a liability for\nsales tax we did not collect from our customers.\n• Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces the measure’s usefulness as\ncomparative measures.\nBecause of these and other limitations, adjusted EBITDA should only be considered as supplemental to, and alongside with other GAAP based financial\nperformance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net income, net margin, and our other GAAP results.\n20\nThe following tables present a reconciliation of net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to adjusted EBITDA for each of the\nperiods indicated:\nThree Months Ended Increase (Decrease)\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n($ in thousands, except percentages) 2024 2023 $ %\nConsolidated Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA:\nNet income $ 2,326 $ 715 $ 1,611 225 %\nAdd (subtract):\nStock-based Compensation 573 1,728 (1,155) (67)%\nIncome Taxes (1,401) 565 (1,966) (348)%\nDepreciation and Amortization 1,658 1,713 (55) (3)%\nInterest (Income), Net (1) (185) (151) (34) 23 %\nAcquisition/Partnership Transactions and Other Items – 168 (168) (100)%\nEmployee Severance 305 15 290 1933 %\nSales Tax (Income) (1,178) (1,316) 138 (10)%\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 2,098 $ 3,437 $ (1,339) (39)%\n(1) Included in interest income, net is $0.4 million of interest expense related to the sales tax liability and $0.6 million of interest income for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024.

This compares to $0.8 million of interest expense related to the sales tax liability and $1.2 million of interest income for the\nsix months ended September 30, 2023.\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared With Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 and Six Months Ended September 30, 2024\nCompared With Six Months Ended September 30, 2023\nSales\nSales decreased by approximately $11.4 million, or 16.1%, to approximately $59.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to\napproximately $71.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Sales decreased by approximately $21.7 million, or 14.6%, to approximately $127.5\nmillion for the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately $149.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in\nsales for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 reflects broader macroeconomic factors partially offset by lower consumer promotional usage. The decrease in\nsales for the six months ended September 30, 2024 reflects both broader macroeconomic factors and higher consumer promotional usage.\nReorder sales decreased by approximately $8.0 million, or 13.7%, to approximately $50.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to\napproximately $58.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Reorder sales decreased by approximately $15.9 million, or 13.2%, to approximately\n$104.3 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately $120.2 million for the for six months ended September 30, 2023. The\ndecrease in reorder sales is primarily due to a decline in prescription medication sales.\nNew order sales decreased by approximately $3.1 million or 29.4%, to approximately $7.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to\n$10.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. New order sales decreased by approximately $5.4 million or 22.3%, to approximately $18.8 million\nfor the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $24.3 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease for the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 in new order sales is primarily due to a strategic reduction in media spend.\nWe acquired approximately 77,000 new customers for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to approximately 113,000 new customers for the\nquarter ended September 30, 2023. We acquired approximately 197,000 new\n22\ncustomers for the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to approximately 250,000 new customers for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The\nfollowing tables illustrates sales by various sales classifications:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Increase (Decrease)\nRevenue (In thousands) 2024 % 2023 % $ %\nReorder sales $ 50,052 84.0 % $ 58,017 81.7 % $ (7,965) (13.7)%\nNew order sales 7,449 12.5 % 10,558 14.9 % (3,109) (29.4)%\nMembership fees 2,069 3.5 % 2,424 3.4 % (355) (14.6)%\nTotal net sales $ 59,570 100.0 % $ 70,999 100.0 % $ (11,429) (16.1)%\nSix Months Ended September 30, Increase (Decrease)\nRevenue (In thousands) 2024 % 2023 % $ %\nReorder sales $ 104,291 81.8 % $ 120,182 80.6 % $ (15,891) (13.2)%\nNew order sales 18,838 14.8 % 24,251 16.2 % (5,413) (22.3)%\nMembership fees 4,393 3.4 % 4,810 3.2 % (417) (8.7)%\nTotal net sales $ 127,522 100.0 % $ 149,243 100.0 % $ (21,721) (14.6)%\nThe Company changed the definition of a new order sale on July 1, 2024, to include sales from customers who have not previously ordered from the\nCompany over the past twelve months compared to the prior definition which was thirty-six months. The reorder and new order sales amounts for the three and\nsix months ended September 30, 2024, and the reorder and new order sales amounts for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023 reflect this new\ndefinition.\nUnder the previous definition of a new customer, reorder and new order sales were $62.4 million and $6.2 million, respectively, for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. Under the previous definition of a new customer, reorder and new order sales were $130.4 million and $14.0 million, respectively, for the\nsix months ended September 30, 2023.\nAutoShip & Save subscription sales as a percentage of total sales was 53.3% of net sales for the most recent quarter ended September 30, 2024, up from\n51.0% of net sales for the same period last year.\nGoing forward, sales may be adversely affected due to increased competition and consumers giving more consideration to price. The changes in consumer\nbehavior due to macroeconomic factors makes future sales somewhat challenging to predict. No guarantees can be made that sales will grow in the future.\nCost of sales\nCost of sales decreased by approximately $8.7 million, or 17.0%, to approximately $42.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, from\napproximately $50.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Cost of sales decreased by approximately $14.4 million, or 13.5%, to approximately\n$92.2 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, from approximately $106.7 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. Cost of sales, as\na percentage of sales, was 70.9% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to 71.7% for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Cost of sales, as a\npercentage of sales, was 72.3% for the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 71.5% for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The cost of\nsales, as a percentage of sales, decreased for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to an\nincrease in vendor promotional activity in the most recent period. The cost of sales, as a percentage of sales, increased for the six months ended September 30,\n2024 compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to an increase in discount activity in the most recent period.\n23\nGross profit\nGross profit decreased by approximately $2.8 million, or 13.7%, to approximately $17.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, from\napproximately $20.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Gross profit decreased by approximately $7.3 million, or 17.2%, to approximately\n$35.3 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, from approximately $42.6 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023.The gross profit\ndecreases for the quarter and six months ended ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended and six months ended September 30, 2023 were\nprimarily due to lower sales. The gross margin percentage increased by approximately 0.8%, to approximately 29.1% for the quarter ended September 30,\n2024, from approximately 28.3% for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to favorable sales mix and lower discount activity in the most recent\nquarter.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by approximately $1.5 million, or 12.3%, to approximately $10.5 million for the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, from approximately $12.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decrease to general and administrative expenses for the\nquarter ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a $1.2 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense, which was primarily related to reduced\nstock compensation associated with an executive departure, a $0.3 million decrease in payroll, and a $0.4 million decrease in credit card processing fees. These\ndecreases were partially offset a $0.3 million increase in professional fees.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by approximately $12.3 million, or 44.5%, to approximately $15.4 million for the six months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, from approximately $27.7 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease to general and administrative expenses for\nthe six months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to an $11.1 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense, of which $8.7 million was\nfrom the stock compensation reversal associated with an executive departure, a $0.5 million decrease in credit card processing fees which were driven by lower\nsales, and a $0.6 million decrease in payroll.\nAdvertising expenses\nAdvertising expenses decreased by approximately $0.9 million, or 16.4%, to approximately $4.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, from\napproximately $5.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decrease for the quarter can be mainly attributed to lower gross media spend and by\nlower marketing funded by manufacturers. The advertising costs of acquiring a new customer, defined as total advertising costs divided by new customers\nacquired, was $60 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to $49 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase to customer acquisition\ncosts for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, was due to a less efficient variable marketing spend. The advertising cost of acquiring a new customer can be\nimpacted by the advertising environment, the effectiveness of our advertising creative, spending, and price competition. Historically, the advertising\nenvironment fluctuates due to supply and demand. A more favorable advertising environment may positively impact future sales, whereas a less favorable\nadvertising environment may negatively impact future sales. As a percentage of sales, advertising expense was 7.7% and 7.8% for the quarters ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The advertising percentage may fluctuate quarter to quarter due to seasonality and advertising availability.\nAdvertising expenses decreased by approximately $1.2 million, or 9.2%, to approximately $11.6 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024,\nfrom approximately $12.8 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease can be mainly attributed to lower gross media spend partially\noffset by lower marketing funded by manufacturers. The advertising costs of acquiring a new customer, defined as total advertising costs divided by new\ncustomers acquired, was $59 for the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $51 for the six months ended September 30, 2023. As a percentage of\nsales, advertising expense was 9.1% and 8.6% for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $1.7 million and $1.7 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively.\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $3.4 million and $3.4 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively.\nOther income\nOther income remained unchanged for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Other income decreased to approximately $0.7 million for the six\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 compared to approximately $1.1 million for the\n24\nsix months ended September 30, 2023.The decrease to other income for the quarter was due to slightly lower invested balances, and a one time payment\nreceived in prior year. Interest income may decrease in the future based on several factors, including utilization of our cash balances on future investments or\npartnerships, or on our operating activities. Additionally, interest income could increase or decrease if the current interest rate environment changes.\nProvision for income taxes\nFor the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of approximately $1.4 million and a tax provision of\napproximately $0.6 million, respectively. For the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of\napproximately $0.4 million and a tax provision of approximately $0.3 million, respectively. The decrease in the tax provision for the three and six months\nended September 30, 2024 is related to the cancellation of the former CEO’s performance stock units resulting in additional $8.7 million of income during the\nquarter.(cid:0)(cid:3)The effective tax rate for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was approximately (151.5)%, compared to approximately 44.1% for the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2023.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents currently on hand and expected cash flows from future operations will be sufficient to continue operations\nfor at least the next twelve months. We continue to monitor, evaluate, and manage our operating plans, forecasts, and liquidity considering the most recent\ndevelopments driven by macroeconomic conditions, such as supply chain challenges, inflation, rising interest rates, and geopolitical events. We proactively\nseek opportunities to improve the efficiency of our operations, take steps to realize internal cost savings, including aligning our staffing needs, creating a more\nvariable cost structure to better support our current and expected future levels of operations and process streamlining.\nCurrent Sources of Liquidity\nOur working capital at September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024 was $21.9 million and $21.5 million, respectively. The $0.5 million increase in working\ncapital was attributable to the $22.9 million decrease in current assets, primarily inventory and prepaid expenses, which were offset by the $23.3 million\ndecrease in current liabilities, primarily accounts payable. Net cash used in operating activities was $1.1 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024,\ncompared to cash used in operating activities of $0.2 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The inventory decline was attributable to the\nCompany’s SKU rationalization strategy to reduce the amount of inventory on hand. The $0.9 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities is due\nto the $6.5 million increase in net income reduced by $11.5 million of non-cash operating adjustments and offset by the $4.1 million increase in current\nliabilities net of current assets excluding cash. Net cash used in investing activities was $1.9 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to\n$38.0 million used in investing activities for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The change in net cash used in investing activities is primarily related\nto the PetCareRx acquisition and an additional investment in Vetster in the prior year. Net cash used in financing activities was $0.2 million and $12.4 million\nfor the six months ended September 30, 2024 and the six months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, due to the payment of an aggregate $0.60 per share\ndividend for the six months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe board reviews and discusses the capital allocation needs of the Company on a quarterly basis and as part of that review on October 26, 2023, our\nBoard of Directors elected to suspend the quarterly dividend indefinitely. This move was intended to focus use of the Company’s existing cash flow on growth\ninitiatives and other, higher return initiatives. The declaration and payment of future dividends is discretionary and will be subject to a determination by the\nBoard of Directors.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had $1.2 million in outstanding lease commitments assumed in the PetCareRx acquisition for the leases on two buildings.\nOther than the foregoing leases, we are not currently bound by any material long-term or short-term commitments for the purchase or lease of capital\nexpenditures. Any material amounts expended for capital expenditures would be the result of an increase in the capacity needed to adequately provide for any\nfuture increase in our business. To date we have paid for any needed additions to our capital equipment infrastructure from working capital funds and anticipate\nthis being the case in the future. Our primary source of working capital is cash from operations. We presently have no alternative sources of working capital\nand have no commitments.\n25\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.\nMarket risk generally represents the risk that losses may occur in the value of financial instruments as a result of movements in interest rates, foreign\ncurrency exchange rates, and commodity prices. Our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable. The\nbook values of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable are considered to be representative of fair value because of the short maturity of\nthese instruments. Interest rates affect our return on excess cash and cash equivalents. At September 30, 2024, we had $52.0 million in cash and cash\nequivalents, and the majority of our cash and cash equivalents generate interest income based on prevailing interest rates. A significant change in interest rates\nwould impact the amount of interest income generated from our excess cash and cash equivalents. It would also impact the market value of our cash and cash\nequivalents. Our cash and cash equivalents are subject to market risk, primarily interest rate and credit risk. Our cash and cash equivalents are managed by a\nlimited number of outside professional managers within investment guidelines set by our Board of Directors. Such guidelines include security type, credit\nquality, and maturity, and are intended to limit market risk by maintaining cash in federally-insured bank deposit accounts and restricting cash equivalents to\nhighly-liquid investments with maturities of three months or less. We do not hold any derivative financial instruments that could expose us to significant\nmarket risk. At September 30, 2024, we had no debt obligations.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and\noperation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a‑15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) as of September 30,\n2024, the end of the period covered by this report (the \"Evaluation Date\"). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer\nconcluded as of the Evaluation Date, that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024, due to material weaknesses\ndescribed below.\nMaterial Weaknesses\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility\nthat a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nAs identified in our 2024 Form 10-K, we identified the following material weaknesses:\n1. A material weakness in the design of our controls over the review of appropriate application of GAAP relating to our sales tax liability as well as an\nadditional tax error relating the misapplication of Internal Revenue Code Section162(m) which limits the deductibility of executive compensation in\nour consolidated financial statements. We also identified a material weakness in the design of our controls over accurate valuation of our deferred tax\nasset and goodwill relating to our acquisition of PetCareRx .\n2. A material weakness in internal controls relating to our information technology general controls (“ITGCs”) in the areas of user access, change\nmanagement, and service organizations over information technology (“IT”) systems that support the Company’s financial reporting processes. This\nmaterial weakness may impact revenue and other business process controls and automated controls reliant upon these ITGCs. We believe these control\ndeficiencies have been influenced by insufficient documentation to support management's procedures. The individual deficiencies identified to\npreventative and detective controls resulted in an aggregate material weakness related to ITGCs. This material weakness did not result in any\nidentified misstatements to the financial statements or any change in previously released financial results.\nManagement is taking steps to remediate these material weaknesses (see “Remediation of Material Weaknesses” for details).\nRemediation of Material Weaknesses\nIn response to the material weakness due to the tax calculations, we have developed and are in the process of implementing a remediation plan. The key\nelements of the plan include:\n26\n1. Enhancing the oversight and review of tax-related accounting estimates and calculations to ensure they are complete and accurate.\n2. Providing additional training to personnel involved in tax accounting and financial reporting to enhance their understanding of the relevant accounting\nstandards and requirements.\n3. Enhancing the documentation of tax positions and related accounting judgments to ensure they are adequately supported and can withstand external\nscrutiny.\nWhile our remediation plan related to the material weakness in internal controls relating to our information technology general controls (“ITGCs”) may\nevolve and expand, management has been implementing and continues to implement measures designed to ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the\nmaterial weakness are remediated such that these controls are designed, implemented, and operating effectively. The remediation actions include: (i)\ndeveloping and maintaining documentation underlying ITGCs; (ii) implementing an IT management review, bringing in new management and revising the\ntesting plan to monitor ITGCs with a specific focus on systems supporting our financial reporting processes; and (iii) enhanced quarterly reporting on the\nremediation measures to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nThe material weaknesses will be addressed once our remediation plan is fully developed and implemented. We will need to allow the updated controls to\noperate for an adequate period of time, after which we will conduct thorough testing to ensure the new and improved controls are operating effectively. We are\nactively working on implementing our remediation plan. Once this is in place, we will continue to test and monitor the new and improved controls to ensure\nthey are operating as intended. It's possible that we may find additional steps, including adding more resources, are needed to fully address the material\nweaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. This could require more time for evaluation and implementation. Additionally, we might make\nadjustments to the remediation efforts as we proceed.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOther than as described above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that\nhave materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed\nand operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design and disclosure controls and procedures\nmust reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgement in evaluating the benefits of possible controls\nand procedures relative to the their cost.\n27\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1.

The following terms shall have the following meanings for purposes of these Third and Amended\nRestated Bylaws of the Corporation (the “Bylaws”):\n“Corporation” means PetMed Express, Inc., a Florida corporation.\n“Act” means the Florida Business Corporation Act, as it may be amended from time to time, or any successor\nlegislation thereto.\n“Deliver” or “delivery” means any method of delivery used in conventional commercial practice, including delivery\nby hand, mail, commercial delivery and electronic transmission.\n“Electronic transmission” or “electronically transmitted” means any process of communication not directly involving\nthe physical transfer of paper that is suitable for the retention, retrieval and reproduction of information by the recipient. For\npurposes of proxy voting, the term includes, but is not limited to, facsimile transmission, telegrams, cablegrams, telephone\ntransmissions and transmissions through the Internet.\n“Notice” means written notice and includes, but is not limited to, notice by electronic transmission. Notice shall be\neffective if given by a single written notice to shareholders who share an address, to the extent permitted by the Act.\n“Principal Office” means the executive office (within or without the State of Florida) where the Corporation’s\nprincipal executive offices are located.\nARTICLE 2\nOffices\nSection 2.1 Principal and Business Offices. The Corporation may have such principal and other business offices, either\nwithin or without the State of Florida, as the Board of Directors may designate or as the business of the Corporation may require\nfrom time to time.\nSection 2.2 Registered Office.

The business office of the registered\nagent of the Corporation shall be identical to such registered office.\n4872-2926-5138.9\nARTICLE 3\nShareholders\nSection 3.1 Annual Meeting. The annual meeting of shareholders shall be held on a date and at a time and place designated\nby the Board of Directors, for the purpose of electing directors and for the transaction of such other business as may properly come\nbefore the meeting. The Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, determine that the annual meeting of shareholders shall not be\nheld at any place, but may instead be held solely by means of remote communication as provided under Section 607.0701 of the Act.\nSection 3.2 Special Meetings.\n(a) Call by Directors or President. Special meetings of shareholders, for any purpose or purposes, may be called by\nthe Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board, the Lead Director (if any) or the President.\n(b) Call by Shareholders. The Corporation shall call a special meeting of shareholders in the event that the holders\nowning shares representing not less than ten percent (10%) of all of the votes entitled to be cast on any issue proposed to be\nconsidered at the proposed special meeting sign, date, and deliver to the Secretary one or more written demands for the meeting\ndescribing one or more purposes for which it is to be held, provide the information required to be submitted by a Proposing\nShareholder pursuant to Section 3.15(b) and/or Section 3.15(c), as applicable, of these Bylaws, and comply with the other\nprocedures and requirements contained or referenced in Section 3.15, including, without limitation, Section 3.15(d), and elsewhere\nin these Bylaws. For purposes of this Section 3.2(b), the calculation of the number of shares of the Company’s common stock owned\nby a shareholder for purposes of determining such shareholder’s eligibility to request a special meeting shall be determined in the\nsame manner used to determine the share ownership of an Eligible Holder as set forth in Section 3.18(c)(iv) of these Bylaws. If, at\nany time after receipt by the Secretary of the Corporation of a proper request for a special meeting of shareholders, there are no\nlonger valid requests from shareholders holding in the aggregate at least the requisite number of shares entitling the shareholders to\nrequest the calling of a special meeting, whether because of revoked requests or otherwise, the Board of Directors, in its discretion,\nmay cancel the special meeting (or, if the special meeting has not yet been called, may direct the Chairman of the Board of Directors\nor the Secretary of the Corporation not to call such a meeting). The Corporation shall give notice of a special meeting within sixty\ndays after the date that any valid demand by shareholders pursuant to these Bylaws is delivered to the Corporation.\nSection 3.3 Place of Special Meeting. The Board of Directors may designate any place, either within or without the State of\nFlorida, as the place of meeting for any special meeting of shareholders. The Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion,\ndetermine that the meeting shall not be held at any place, but may instead be held solely by means of remote communication as\nprovided under Section 607.0702 of the Act. If no designation is made, the place of meeting shall be the Principal Office.\n2\n4872-2926-5138.9\nSection 3.4 Notice of Meeting.\n(a) Content and Delivery.\n(i) Notice of the place, if any, date, time, and means of remote communication, if any, of each annual and\nspecial shareholders’ meeting shall be given by the Corporation not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before date of\nthe meeting. Notices of special meetings shall also specify the purpose or purposes for which the meeting has been\ncalled. Unless otherwise required by the Act or the Corporation’s Articles of Incorporation (the “Articles of\nIncorporation”):\n(A) Notice of a shareholders’ meeting need be given only to shareholders entitled to vote at the\nmeeting; and\n(B) Notices of annual meetings need not specify the purpose or purposes for which the meeting has\nbeen called.\n(ii) Notices to shareholders must be in writing and may be communicated in person, by electronic means (in\na manner authorized by the shareholder), or by mail or other method of delivery, in each case, by or at the direction of\nthe President, the Secretary, or the officer or persons calling the meeting. If mailed, the notice shall be effective when\ndeposited in the United States mail addressed to the shareholder at the shareholder’s address as it appears in the\nCorporation’s shareholder records, with postage thereon prepaid.\n(b) Notice of Adjourned Meetings. If an annual or special meeting of shareholders is adjourned to a different date,\ntime, or place, the Corporation shall not be required to give notice of the new date, time, or place if the new date, time, or place is\nannounced at the meeting before adjournment; provided, however, that if a new record date for an adjourned meeting is or must be\nfixed, the Corporation shall give notice of the adjourned meeting to persons who are shareholders as of the new record date who are\nentitled to notice of the meeting.\n(c) No Notice Under Certain Circumstances. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 3.4, no notice of a\nmeeting of shareholders need be given to a shareholder if: (1) an annual report and proxy statement for two consecutive annual\nmeetings of shareholders, or (2) all, and at least two, checks in payment of dividends or interest on securities during a twelve-month\nperiod have been sent by first-class, United States mail, addressed to the shareholder at his or her address as it appears on the share\ntransfer books of the Corporation, and returned undeliverable. The obligation of the Corporation to give notice of a shareholders’\nmeeting to any such shareholder shall be reinstated once the Corporation has received a new address for such shareholder for entry\non its share transfer books.\nSection 3.5 Waiver of Notice.\n(a) Written Waiver. A shareholder may waive any notice required by the Act or these Bylaws before or after the date\nand time stated for the meeting in the notice. The waiver\n3\n4872-2926-5138.9\nshall be in writing and signed by the shareholder entitled to the notice, and be delivered to the Corporation for inclusion in the\nminutes or filing with the corporate records. Neither the business to be transacted at nor the purpose of any regular or special\nmeeting of shareholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice.\n(b) Waiver by Attendance. A shareholder’s attendance at a meeting, in person or by proxy, waives objection to all of\nthe following: (1) lack of notice or defective notice of the meeting, unless the shareholder at the beginning of the meeting objects to\nholding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting; and (2) consideration of a particular matter at the meeting that is not\nwithin the purpose or purposes described in the meeting notice, unless the shareholder objects to considering the matter when it is\npresented.\nSection 3.6 Fixing of Record Date.\n(a) General. The Board of Directors may fix in advance a date as the record date for the purpose of determining\nshareholders entitled to notice of a shareholders’ meeting, entitled to vote, or take any other action. In no event may a record date\nfixed by the Board of Directors be a date preceding the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted or a date\nmore than seventy days before the date of meeting or action requiring a determination of shareholders.\n(b) Special Meeting. The record date for determining shareholders entitled to demand a special meeting shall be the\nclose of business on the date the first shareholder delivers his or her demand to the Corporation.\n(c) Shareholder Action by Written Consent. The record date for determining shareholders entitled to take action\nwithout a meeting shall be determined in accordance with Section 3.16 of these Bylaws.\n(d) Absence of Board Determination for Shareholders’ Meeting. If the Board of Directors does not determine the\nrecord date for determining shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at an annual or special shareholders’ meeting, such record\ndate shall be the close of business on the day before the first notice with respect thereto is delivered to shareholders.\n(e) Adjourned Meeting. A record date for determining shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a shareholders’\nmeeting is effective for any adjournment of the meeting unless the Board of Directors fixes a new record date, which it must do if\nthe meeting is adjourned to a date more than 120 days after the date fixed for the original meeting.\nSection 3.7 Shareholders’ List for Meetings.\n(a) Preparation and Availability. After a record date for a meeting of shareholders has been fixed, the Corporation\nshall prepare an alphabetical list of the names of all of the shareholders entitled to notice of the meeting (and, if the Board of\nDirectors fixes a different record date to determine the shareholders entitled to vote at the meeting, an alphabetical list of the names\nof all shareholders entitled to vote at the meeting). The list shall be arranged by\n4\n4872-2926-5138.9\nclass or series of shares, if any, and show the address of and number of shares held by each shareholder. Such list shall be available\nfor inspection by any shareholder for a period of ten days prior to the meeting or such shorter time as exists between the record date\nand the meeting date, and continuing through the meeting, at the Principal Office, at a place identified in the meeting notice in the\ncity where the meeting will be held, or at the office of the Corporation’s transfer agent or registrar, if any. A shareholder or his or her\nagent or attorney may, on written demand, inspect the list, subject to the requirements of the Act, during regular business hours and\nat his or her expense, during the period that it is available for inspection pursuant to this Section 3.7. The Corporation shall make the\nshareholders’ list available at the meeting and any shareholder or his or her agent or attorney may inspect the list at any time during\nthe meeting or any adjournment thereof.\n(b) Prima Facie Evidence. The shareholders’ list is prima facie evidence of the identity of shareholders entitled to\nexamine the shareholders’ list or to vote at a meeting of shareholders.\n(c) Failure to Comply. If the requirements of this Section 3.7 have not been substantially complied with, or if the\nCorporation refuses to allow a shareholder or his or her agent or attorney to inspect the shareholders’ list before or at the meeting, on\nthe demand of any shareholder, in person or by proxy, who failed to get such access, the meeting shall be adjourned until such\nrequirements are complied with.\n(d) Validity of Action Not Affected. Refusal or failure to prepare or make available the shareholders’ list shall not\naffect the validity of any action taken at a meeting of shareholders.\nSection 3.8 Conduct of Meetings by Remote Communication. The Board of Directors may adopt guidelines and procedures\nfor shareholders and proxy holders not physically present at an annual or special meeting of shareholders to participate in the\nmeeting, be deemed Present in Person (as defined below), vote, communicate and read or hear the proceedings of the meeting\nsubstantially concurrently with such proceedings, all by means of remote communication. The Board of Directors may adopt\nprocedures and guidelines for the conduct of an annual or special meeting solely by means of remote communication rather than\nholding the meeting at a designated place.\nSection 3.9 Quorum.\n(a) What Constitutes a Quorum. Shares entitled to vote as a separate voting group may take action on a matter at a\nmeeting only if a quorum of those shares exists with respect to that matter. If the Corporation has only one class of stock\noutstanding, such class shall constitute a separate voting group for purposes of this Section 3.9. Except as otherwise provided in the\nAct, a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter shall constitute a quorum of the voting group for action on that matter.\nAfter a quorum has been established at a shareholders’ meeting, the subsequent withdrawal of shareholders, so as to reduce the\nnumber of shares entitled to vote at the meeting below the number required for a quorum, shall not affect the validity of any action\ntaken at the meeting or any adjournment thereof.\n5\n4872-2926-5138.9\n(b) Presence of Shares. Once a share is represented for any purpose at a meeting, other than for the purpose of\nobjecting to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting, it is considered present for purposes of determining whether\na quorum exists for the remainder of the meeting and for any adjournment of that meeting unless a new record date is or must be set\nfor the adjourned meeting.\n(c) Adjournment in Absence of Quorum. Where a quorum is not present, the holders of a majority of the shares\nrepresented and who would be entitled to vote at the meeting if a quorum were present may adjourn such meeting from time to time.\nSection 3.10 Voting Entitlement of Shares.\n(a) Unless the Articles of Incorporation or the Act provide otherwise, each outstanding share, regardless of class, is\nentitled to one vote on each matter submitted to a vote at a meeting of shareholders. Only shares are entitled to vote.\n(b) The shares of the Corporation are not entitled to vote if they are owned, directly or indirectly, by a second\ncorporation, domestic or foreign, and the first corporation owns, directly or indirectly, a majority of shares entitled to vote for\ndirectors of the second corporation.\n(c) This Section 3.10 does not limit the power of the Corporation to vote any shares, including its own shares, held\nby it in a fiduciary capacity.\n(d) Redeemable shares are not entitled to vote on any matter, and shall not be deemed to be outstanding, after notice\nof redemption is mailed to the holders thereof and a sum sufficient to redeem such shares has been deposited with a bank, trust\ncompany, or other financial institution upon an irrevocable obligation to pay the holders the redemption price upon surrender of the\nshares.\n(e) Shares standing in the name of another corporation, domestic or foreign, may be voted by such officer, agent, or\nproxy as the bylaws of the corporate shareholder may prescribe or, in the absence of any applicable provision, by such person as the\nBoard of Directors of the corporate shareholder may designate. In the absence of any such designation or in case of conflicting\ndesignation by the corporate shareholder, the chairman of the board, the president, any vice president, the secretary, and the treasurer\nof the corporate shareholder, in that order, shall be presumed to be fully authorized to vote such shares.\n(f) Shares held by an administrator, executor, guardian, personal representative, or conservator may be voted by him\nor her, either in person or by proxy, without a transfer of such shares into his or her name. Shares standing in the name of a trustee\nmay be voted by him or her, either in person or by proxy, but no trustee shall be entitled to vote shares held by him or her without a\ntransfer of such shares into his name or the name of his or her nominee.\n6\n4872-2926-5138.9\n(g) Shares held by or under the control of a receiver, a trustee in bankruptcy proceedings, or an assignee for the\nbenefit of creditors may be voted by him or her without the transfer thereof into his or her name.\n(h) If a share or shares stand of record in the names of two or more persons, whether fiduciaries, members of a\npartnership, joint tenants, tenants in common, tenants by the entirety, or otherwise, or if two or more persons have the same fiduciary\nrelationship respecting the same shares, unless the secretary of the Corporation is given notice to the contrary and is furnished with a\ncopy of the instrument or order appointing them or creating the relationship wherein it is so provided, then acts with respect to\nvoting have the following effect:\n(i) If only one votes, in person or in proxy, his or her act binds all;\n(ii) If more than one vote, in person or by proxy, the act of the majority so voting binds all;\n(iii) If more than one vote, in person or by proxy, but the vote is evenly split on any particular matter, each\nfaction is entitled to vote the share or shares in question proportionally;\n(iv) If the instrument or order so filed shows that any such tenancy is held in unequal interest, a majority or a\nvote evenly split for purposes of this subsection shall be a majority or a vote evenly split in interest;\n(v) The principles of this subsection shall apply, insofar as possible, to execution of proxies, waivers,\nconsents, or objections and for the purpose of ascertaining the presence of a quorum;\n(vi) Subject to Section 3.10(i), nothing herein contained shall prevent trustees or other fiduciaries holding\nshares registered in the name of a nominee from causing such shares to be voted by such nominee as the trustee or\nother fiduciary may direct. Such nominee may vote shares as directed by a trustee or their fiduciary without the\nnecessity of transferring the shares to the name of the trustee or other fiduciary.\n(i) The Corporation may establish a procedure by which the beneficial owner of shares that are registered in the\nname of a nominee is recognized by the Corporation as the shareholder. The extent of this recognition may be determined in the\nprocedure. The procedure may set forth (a) the types of nominees to which it applies; (b) the rights or privileges that the Corporation\nrecognizes in a beneficial owner; (c) the manner in which the procedure is selected by the nominee; (d) the information that must be\nprovided when the procedure is selected; (e) the period for which selection of the procedure is effective; and (f) other aspects of the\nrights and duties created.\n7\n4872-2926-5138.9\nSection 3.11 Vote Required.\n(a) Matters Other Than Election of Directors. If a quorum exists, except in the case of the election of directors,\naction on a matter shall be approved if the votes cast favoring the action exceed the votes cast opposing the action, unless the Act or\nthe Articles of Incorporation require a greater number of affirmative votes.\n(b) Election of Directors.\n(i) Each shareholder who is entitled to vote at an election of directors has the right to vote the number of\nshares owned by him or her for as many persons as there are directors to be elected.

If one or more vacancies for any reason occurs on the Board\nof Directors after the Final Nomination Date but before the date of the annual meeting and the Board of Directors\nresolves to reduce the size of the Board of Directors in connection with the occurrence of the vacancy or vacancies,\nthen the Maximum Number shall be calculated based on the number of directors in office as so reduced.\n(ii) Any Nominating Holder submitting more than one Nominee pursuant to this Section 3.18 for an annual\nmeeting shall rank such Nominees based on the order in which the Nominating Holder desires such Nominees to be\nselected for inclusion in the Corporation’s proxy statement for such annual meeting if the number of Nominees\npursuant to this Section 3.18 exceeds the Maximum Number. If the number of Nominees pursuant to this Section 3.18\nfor any annual meeting exceeds the Maximum Number, then the highest ranking Nominee who meets the\nrequirements of this Section 3.18 from each Nominating Holder will be selected for inclusion in the Corporation’s\nproxy statement until the Maximum Number is reached, going in order of the amount (largest to smallest) of the\nshares of common stock of the Corporation disclosed as owned in each Nominating Shareholder’s Nomination\nNotice.\n(iii) If, after the Final Nomination Date, (A) the Corporation is notified, or the Board of Directors or its\ndesignee, acting in good faith, determines, that (1) a Nominating Shareholder has failed to satisfy or to continue to\nsatisfy the eligibility requirements described in Section 3.18(c), (2) any of the\n25\n4872-2926-5138.9\nrepresentations and warranties made in the Nomination Notice cease to be true and accurate in all material respects\n(or omit a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading) or (3) any material violation or\nbreach occurs of the obligations, agreements, representations or warranties of the Nominating Shareholder or the\nNominee under this Section 3.18, (B) a Nominating Shareholder or any qualified representative thereof does not\nappear at the annual meeting to present any nomination submitted pursuant to this Section 3.18, or the Nominating\nShareholder withdraws its nomination, or (C) a Nominee becomes ineligible for inclusion in the Corporation’s proxy\nstatement pursuant to this Section 3.18 or dies, becomes disabled or is otherwise disqualified from being nominated\nfor election or serving as a director of the Corporation or is unwilling or unable to serve as a director of the\nCorporation, in each case as determined by the Board of Directors or its designee, acting in good faith, whether\nbefore or after the Corporation’s definitive proxy statement for such annual meeting is made available to\nshareholders, then the nomination of the Nominating Shareholder or such Nominee, as the case may be, shall be\ndisregarded and no vote on such Nominee will occur (notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have\nbeen received by the Corporation), the Nominating Shareholder may not cure in any way any defect preventing the\nnomination of the Nominee, and the Corporation (1) may omit from its proxy statement and any ballot or form of\nproxy the disregarded Nominee and any information concerning such Nominee (including a Nominating\nShareholder’s statement in support), any other Nominee that the Corporation had determined not to include in its\nproxy statement and proxy card for such annual meeting and any successor or replacement nominee proposed by the\nNominating Shareholder or by any other Nominating Shareholder and (2) may otherwise communicate to its\nshareholders, including without limitation by amending or supplementing its proxy statement or ballot or form of\nproxy, that the Nominee will not be included as a Nominee in the proxy statement or on any ballot or form of proxy\nand will not be voted on at the annual meeting.\n(c) Eligibility of Nominating Shareholder.\n(i) An “Eligible Holder” is a person who has either (A) been a record holder of the shares of the\nCorporation’s common stock used to satisfy the eligibility requirements in this Section 3.18(c) continuously for the\nthree-year period specified in Section 3.18(c)(ii) or (B) provides to the Secretary of the Corporation, within the time\nperiod referred to in Section 3.18(c), evidence of continuous ownership of such shares for such three-year period from\none or more securities intermediaries in a form and in substance that the Board of Directors or its designee, acting in\ngood faith, determines would be deemed acceptable for purposes of a shareholder proposal under Rule 14a-8(b)(2)\nunder the Exchange Act (or any successor rule).\n(ii) An Eligible Holder or group of up to 20 Eligible Holders may submit a nomination in accordance with\nthis Section 3.18 only if the person or\n26\n4872-2926-5138.9\ngroup (in the aggregate) has continuously owned at least the Minimum Number (as defined below) of shares of the\nCorporation’s common stock throughout the three-year period preceding and including the date of submission of the\nNomination Notice and continues to own at least the Minimum Number through the date of the annual meeting. A\ngroup of funds under common management and investment control shall be treated as one Eligible Holder for\npurposes of such limitation if such Eligible Holder shall provide together with the Nomination Notice documentation\nreasonably satisfactory to the Corporation that demonstrates that the funds are under common management and\ninvestment control. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of a nomination by a group of Eligible Holders, any and\nall requirements and obligations applicable to an individual Eligible Holder that are set forth in this Section 3.18,\nincluding the minimum holding period, shall apply to each member of such group; provided, however, that the\nMinimum Number shall apply to the ownership of the group in the aggregate, and a breach of any obligation,\nagreement, representation or warranty under this Section 3.18 by any member of a group shall be deemed a breach by\nthe Nominating Shareholder.

An Eligible Holder “owns” shares held in the name of a\nnominee or other intermediary so long as the Eligible Holder retains the right to instruct how the shares are voted\nwith respect to the election of directors and possesses the full economic interest in the shares. An Eligible Holder’s\nownership of shares shall be deemed to continue during any period in which the Eligible Holder has delegated any\nvoting power by means of a proxy, power of attorney or other similar instrument or arrangement that is revocable at\nany time by the Eligible Holder. An Eligible Holder’s ownership of shares shall be deemed to continue during any\nperiod in which the Eligible Holder has loaned such shares provided that the Eligible Holder has the power to recall\nsuch loaned shares on five business days’ notice, recalls such loaned shares upon being notified by the Corporation\nthat any of the Eligible Holder’s Nominees will be included in the Corporation’s proxy statement and proxy card for\nthe annual meeting (subject to the provisions of this Section 3.18) and holds such shares through the date of the\nannual meeting. The terms “owned,” “owning,” “ownership” and other variations of the word “own” shall have\ncorrelative meanings. Whether outstanding shares of the Corporation are “owned” for these purposes shall be\ndetermined by the Board of Directors.\n(v) No person shall be permitted to be in more than one group constituting a Nominating Shareholder, and if\nany person appears as a member of more than one group, then such person shall be deemed to be a member of the\ngroup that has the largest amount of shares of common stock of the Corporation disclosed as owned in the\nNomination Notice.\n(d) Nomination Notice. To nominate a Nominee for purposes of this Section 3.18, the Nominating Shareholder must\nhave given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary.
