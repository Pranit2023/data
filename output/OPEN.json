(Nasdaq: OPEN), a leading e-commerce platform for residential real estate transactions, today reported financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2024. Opendoor’s third quarter 2024 financial results and management commentary can be accessed through the Company’s shareholder letter on the “Quarterly Reports” page of Opendoor’s investor relations website at [https://investor.opendoor.com/financials-filings/quarterly-reports](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=oa4uOG9hN7w_PlNQ6pBYoxuD486ipurf0-XJdxFMt_b5LDfEuaWto8hoqipnYnNJjVy01zdV-zYV0WUShPK9yx39DNvanLEpYz9rI0EukrL5GbqJmQYyjyuy28gODm-sJtldjvtBwuEXlq7ADXDOnCj9zdq46E1AB2I2kEY6vmMHk0F47y4wEeZ8wlBad4u8H5aU1HahD1EldyM0c7TDpQ==).\n\n“Opendoor’s third quarter acquisition volumes, revenue, Contribution Profit, and Adjusted EBITDA all exceeded our guidance, notwithstanding persistent housing market headwinds. In August, many anticipated that interest rate cuts would bring buyers and sellers back to the market. However, mortgage rates remain stubbornly high and the housing market continues to be challenged by high delistings, low clearance, and strained affordability,” said Carrie Wheeler, CEO of Opendoor.\n\nWheeler continued, “We are focused on what we can control, operating our business as efficiently as possible, and streamlining our cost structure while managing risk. The combination of the actions we took in the second half of this year will result in annualized savings of approximately $85 million as we enter 2025. With a simplified organization and ongoing enhancements in our core products, we are well-positioned to rescale the business as conditions improve.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Key Highlights**\n\n  * Revenue of $1.4 billion, up 41% versus 3Q23 and down (9)% versus 2Q24; with 3,615 total homes sold, up 35% versus 3Q23 and down (11)% versus 2Q24\n  * Gross profit of $105 million, versus $96 million in 3Q23 and $129 million in 2Q24; Gross Margin of 7.6%, versus 9.8% in 3Q23 and 8.5% in 2Q24\n  * Net loss of $(78) million, versus $(106) million in 3Q23 and $(92) million in 2Q24\n  * Inventory balance of $2.1 billion, representing 6,288 homes, up 64% versus 3Q23 and down (4)% versus 2Q24\n  * Purchased 3,504 homes, up 12% versus 3Q23 and down (27)% versus 2Q24\n  * Ended the quarter with 1,006 homes under contract for purchase, down (39)% versus 3Q23 and down (44)% versus 2Q24\n\n\n\n _Non-GAAP Key Highlights*_\n\n  * Contribution Profit of $52 million, versus $43 million in 3Q23 and $95 million in 2Q24; Contribution Margin of 3.8%, versus 4.4% in 3Q23 and 6.3% in 2Q24\n  * Adjusted EBITDA of $(38) million, versus $(49) million in 3Q23 and $(5) million in 2Q24; Adjusted EBITDA Margin of (2.8)%, versus (5.0)% in 3Q23 and (0.3)% in 2Q24\n  * Adjusted Net Loss of $(70) million, versus $(75) million in 3Q23 and $(31) million in 2Q24 \n\n\n\n*See “— _Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures_ ” below for further details and a reconciliation of such non-GAAP measures to their nearest comparable GAAP measures.\n\n**Fourth Quarter 2024 Financial Outlook**\n\n  * 4Q24 revenue guidance of $925 million to $975 million\n  * 4Q24 Contribution Profit1 guidance of $15 million to $25 million\n  * 4Q24 Adjusted EBITDA1 guidance of $(70) million to $(60) million\n\n\n\n** _Conference Call and Webcast Details_**\n\nOpendoor will host a conference call to discuss its financial results on November 7, 2024, at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time.

Forward-looking statements are predictions, projections and other statements about future events that are based on current expectations and assumptions and, as a result, are subject to risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to differ materially from those in such forward-looking statements. The factors that could cause or contribute to actual future events to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in this press release include but are not limited to: the current and future health and stability of the economy, financial conditions and residential housing market, including any extended downturn or slowdown; changes in general economic and financial conditions (including federal monetary policy, interest rates, inflation, actual or anticipated recession, home price fluctuations, and housing inventory), as well as the probability of such changes occurring, that may impact demand for our products and services, lower our profitability or reduce our access to future financings; actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and results of operations; changes in projected operational and financial results; our real estate assets and increased competition in the U.S. residential real estate industry; our ability to operate and grow our core business products, including the ability to obtain sufficient financing and resell purchased homes; investment of resources to pursue strategies and develop new products and services that may not prove effective or that are not attractive to customers and/or partners or that do not allow us to compete successfully; our ability to acquire and resell homes profitably; our ability to grow market share in our existing markets or any new markets we may enter; our ability to manage our growth effectively; our ability to expeditiously sell and appropriately price our inventory; our ability to access sources of capital, including debt financing and securitization funding to finance our real estate inventories and other sources of capital to finance operations and growth; our ability to maintain and enhance our products and brand, and to attract customers; our ability to manage, develop and refine our digital platform, including our automated pricing and valuation technology; our ability to comply with multiple listing service rules and requirements to access and use listing data, and to maintain or establish relationships with listings and data providers; our ability to obtain or maintain licenses and permits to support our current and future business operations; acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, capital-raising activities or other corporate transactions or commitments by us or our competitors; actual or anticipated changes in technology, products, markets or services by us or our competitors; our ability to protect our brand and intellectual property; our success in retaining or recruiting, or changes required in, our officers, key employees and/or directors; the impact of the regulatory environment within our industry and complexities with compliance related to such environment; any future impact of pandemics or epidemics, including any future resurgences of COVID-19 and its variants, or other public health crises on our ability to operate, demand for our products and services, or general economic conditions; changes in laws or government regulation affecting our business; and the impact of pending or future litigation or regulatory actions. The foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive. You should carefully consider the foregoing factors and the other risks and uncertainties described under the caption “Risk Factors” in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on February 15, 2024, as updated by our periodic reports and other filings with the SEC. These filings identify and address other important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made.

The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures including Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss), Contribution Profit (Loss), Adjusted Net Loss, Adjusted EBITDA, and any such non-GAAP financial measures expressed as a Margin, are useful to investors as supplemental operational measurements to evaluate the Company’s financial performance.\n\nThe non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the Company’s reported GAAP results because they may include or exclude certain items as compared to similar GAAP-based measures, and such measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of the Company’s recurring operating results.\n\n_Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss) and Contribution Profit (Loss)_\n\nTo provide investors with additional information regarding our margins and return on inventory acquired, we have included Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss) and Contribution Profit (Loss), which are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss) and Contribution Profit (Loss) are useful financial measures for investors as they are supplemental measures used by management in evaluating unit level economics and our operating performance. Each of these measures is intended to present the economics related to homes sold during a given period. We do so by including revenue generated from homes sold (and adjacent services) in the period and only the expenses that are directly attributable to such home sales, even if such expenses were recognized in prior periods, and excluding expenses related to homes that remain in inventory as of the end of the period. Contribution Profit (Loss) provides investors a measure to assess Opendoor’s ability to generate returns on homes sold during a reporting period after considering home purchase costs, renovation and repair costs, holding costs and selling costs.\n\nAdjusted Gross Profit (Loss) and Contribution Profit (Loss) are supplemental measures of our operating performance and have limitations as analytical tools. For example, these measures include costs that were recorded in prior periods under GAAP and exclude, in connection with homes held in inventory at the end of the period, costs required to be recorded under GAAP in the same period. Accordingly, these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. We include a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, which is gross profit.\n\n_Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss) / Margin_\n\nWe calculate Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss) as gross profit under GAAP adjusted for (1) inventory valuation adjustment in the current period, and (2) inventory valuation adjustment in prior periods. Inventory valuation adjustment in the current period is calculated by adding back the inventory valuation adjustments recorded during the period on homes that remain in inventory at period end. Inventory valuation adjustment in prior periods is calculated by subtracting the inventory valuation adjustments recorded in prior periods on homes sold in the current period. Adjusted Gross Margin is Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss) as a percentage of revenue.\n\nWe view this metric as an important measure of business performance as it captures gross margin performance isolated to homes sold in a given period and provides comparability across reporting periods. Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss) helps management assess home pricing, service fees and renovation performance for a specific resale cohort.\n\n_Contribution Profit (Loss) / Margin_\n\nWe calculate Contribution Profit (Loss) as Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss), minus certain costs incurred on homes sold during the current period including: (1) holding costs incurred in the current period, (2) holding costs incurred in prior periods, and (3) direct selling costs. The composition of our holding costs is described in the footnotes to the reconciliation table below. Contribution Margin is Contribution Profit (Loss) as a percentage of revenue.\n\nWe view this metric as an important measure of business performance as it captures the unit level performance isolated to homes sold in a given period and provides comparability across reporting periods. Contribution Profit (Loss) helps management assess inflows and outflows directly associated with a specific resale cohort.\n\n**OPENDOOR TECHNOLOGIES INC.****RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP MEASURES**(In millions, except percentages, and homes sold)(Unaudited)\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of our Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss) and Contribution Profit (Loss) to our gross profit, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure, for the periods indicated:\n\n**​**| **Three Months Ended**| **Nine Months Ended****September 30,**  \n---|---|---  \n**(in millions, except percentages and homes sold, or as noted)**| **September 30,****2024**| **June 30,****2024**| **March 31,****2024**| **December 31,****2023**| **September 30,****2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \n**Revenue (GAAP)**| **$**| **1,377**| **$**| **1,511**| **$**| **1,181**| **$**| **870**| **$**| **980**| **$**| **4,069**| **$**| **6,076**  \n**Gross profit (GAAP)**| **$**| **105**| **​**| **$**| **129**| **$**| **114**| **$**| **72**| **$**| **96**| **$**| **348**| **$**| **415**  \n _Gross Margin_|  7.6| %| ​| 8.5| %| 9.7| %| 8.3| %| 9.8| %| 8.6| %| 6.8| %  \nAdjustments:| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nInventory valuation adjustment – Current Period(1)(2)| 10| ​| 34| 7| 11| 17| 33| 24  \nInventory valuation adjustment – Prior Periods(1)(3)| (16| )| ​| (9| )| (17| )| (17| )| (29| )| (24| )| (450| )  \n**Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss)**| **$**| **99**| **​**| **$**| **154**| **$**| **104**| **$**| **66**| **$**| **84**| **$**| **357**| **$**| **(11**| **)**  \n_Adjusted Gross Margin_|  7.2| %| ​| 10.2| %| 8.8| %| 7.6| %| 8.6| %| 8.8| %| (0.2| )| %  \nAdjustments:| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nDirect selling costs(4)| (32| )| ​| (43| )| (34| )| (26| )| (28| )| (109| )| (171| )  \nHolding costs on sales – Current Period(5)(6)| (6| )| ​| (5| )| (5| )| (3| )| (4| )| (30| )| (41| )  \nHolding costs on sales – Prior Periods(5)(7)| (9| )| ​| (11| )| (8| )| (7| )| (9| )| (14| )| (65| )  \n**Contribution Profit (Loss)**| **$**| **52**| **$**| **95**| **$**| **57**| **$**| **30**| **$**| **43**| **$**| **204**| **$**| **(288**| **)**  \nHomes sold in period| 3,615| 4,078| 3,078| 2,364| 2,687| 10,771| 16,344  \n**Contribution Profit (Loss) per Home Sold**(in thousands)| **$**| **14**| **$**| **23**| **$**| **19**| **$**| **13**| **$**| **16**| **$**| **19**| **$**| **(18**| **)**  \n_Contribution Margin_|  3.8| %| ​| 6.3| %| 4.8| %| 3.4| %| 4.4| %| 5.0| %| (4.7| )| %  \n  \n________________\n\n(1)| ​Inventory valuation adjustment includes adjustments to record real estate inventory at the lower of its carrying amount or its net realizable value.  \n---|---  \n(2)| Inventory valuation adjustment — Current Period is the inventory valuation adjustments recorded during the period presented associated with homes that remain in inventory at period end.  \n(3)| Inventory valuation adjustment — Prior Periods is the inventory valuation adjustments recorded in prior periods associated with homes that sold in the period presented.  \n(4)| Represents selling costs incurred related to homes sold in the relevant period.

These measures are also commonly used by investors and analysts to compare the underlying performance of companies in our industry. We believe these measures provide investors with meaningful period over period comparisons of our underlying performance, adjusted for certain charges that are non-cash, not directly related to our revenue-generating operations, not aligned to related revenue, or not reflective of ongoing operating results that vary in frequency and amount.\n\nAdjusted Net Loss and Adjusted EBITDA are supplemental measures of our operating performance and have important limitations. For example, these measures exclude the impact of certain costs required to be recorded under GAAP. These measures also include inventory valuation adjustments that were recorded in prior periods under GAAP and exclude, in connection with homes held in inventory at the end of the period, inventory valuation adjustments required to be recorded under GAAP in the same period. These measures could differ substantially from similarly titled measures presented by other companies in our industry or companies in other industries. Accordingly, these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. We include a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, which is net loss.\n\n_Adjusted Net Loss_\n\nWe calculate Adjusted Net Loss as GAAP net loss adjusted to exclude non-cash expenses of stock-based compensation, equity securities fair value adjustment, and intangibles amortization expense. It excludes expenses that are not directly related to our revenue-generating operations such as restructuring. It excludes loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt as these expenses or gains were incurred as a result of decisions made by management to repay portions of our outstanding credit facilities and the 0.25% convertible senior notes due in 2026 (the \"2026 Notes\") early; these expenses are not reflective of ongoing operating results and vary in frequency and amount. Adjusted Net Loss also aligns the timing of inventory valuation adjustments recorded under GAAP to the period in which the related revenue is recorded in order to improve the comparability of this measure to our non-GAAP financial measures of unit economics, as described above. Our calculation of Adjusted Net Loss does not currently include the tax effects of the non-GAAP adjustments because our taxes and such tax effects have not been material to date.\n\n_Adjusted EBITDA / Margin_\n\nWe calculated Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted Net Loss adjusted for depreciation and amortization, property financing and other interest expense, interest income, and income tax expense. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental performance measure that our management uses to assess our operating performance and the operating leverage in our business. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue.\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of our Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted EBITDA to our net loss, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure, for the periods indicated:\n\n​| **Three Months Ended**| **Nine Months Ended****September 30,**  \n---|---|---  \n**(in millions, except percentages)**| **September 30,****2024**| **June 30,****2024**| **March 31,****2024**| **December 31,****2023**| **September 30,****2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \n**Revenue (GAAP)**| **$**| **1,377**| **$**| **1,511**| **$**| **1,181**| **$**| **870**| **$**| **980**| **$**| **4,069**| **$**| **6,076**  \n**Net loss (GAAP)**| **$**| **(78**| **)**| **​**| **$**| **(92**| **)**| **$**| **(109**| **)**| **$**| **(91**| **)**| **$**| **(106**| **)**| **$**| **(279**| **)**| **$**| **(184**| **)**  \nAdjustments:| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nStock-based compensation| 25| ​| 33| 33| 32| 31| 91| 94  \nEquity securities fair value adjustment(1)| 3| 2| 2| (3| )| 11| 7| 4  \nIntangibles amortization expense(2)| 1| ​| 1| 2| 2| 2| 4| 5  \nInventory valuation adjustment – Current Period(3)(4)| 10| ​| 34| 7| 11| 17| 33| 24  \nInventory valuation adjustment — Prior Periods(3)(5)| (16| )| ​| (9| )| (17| )| (17| )| (29| )| (24| )| (450| )  \nRestructuring(6)| —| ​| —| —| 4| —| —| 10  \nLoss (gain) on extinguishment of debt| —| 1| —| (34| )| —| 1| (182| )  \nOther(7)| (15| )| ​| (1| )| 2| (1| )| (1| )| (14| )| (2| )  \n**Adjusted Net Loss**| **$**| **(70**| **)**| **​**| **$**| **(31**| **)**| **$**| **(80**| **)**| **$**| **(97**| **)**| **$**| **(75**| **)**| **$**| **(181**| **)**| **$**| **(681**| **)**  \nAdjustments:  \nDepreciation and amortization, excluding amortization of intangibles| 10| ​| 7| 11| 15| 9| 28| 30  \nProperty financing(8)| 30| ​| 26| 32| 32| 38| 88| 142  \nOther interest expense(9)| 4| ​| 4| 5| 5| 9| 13| 32  \nInterest income(10)| (12| )| ​| (12| )| (18| )| (24| )| (30| )| (42| )| (82| )  \nIncome tax expense| —| ​| 1| —| —| —| 1| 1  \n**Adjusted EBITDA**| **$**| **(38**| **)**| **​**| **$**| **(5**| **)**| **$**| **(50**| **)**| **$**| **(69**| **)**| **$**| **(49**| **)**| **$**| **(93**| **)**| **$**| **(558**| **)**  \n_Adjusted EBITDA Margin_| (2.8| )| %| ​| (0.3| )| %| (4.2| )| %| (7.9| )| %| (5.0| )| %| (2.3| )| %| (9.2| )| %  \n  \n________________\n\n(1)| Represents the gains and losses on certain financial instruments, which are marked to fair value at the end of each period.  \n---|---  \n(2)| Represents amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets.

(Nasdaq: OPEN), a leading e-commerce platform for residential real estate transactions, today reported financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2024. Opendoor’s third quarter 2024 financial results and management commentary can be accessed through the Company’s shareholder letter on the “Quarterly Reports” page of Opendoor’s investor relations website at [https://investor.opendoor.com/financials-filings/quarterly-reports](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=oa4uOG9hN7w_PlNQ6pBYoxuD486ipurf0-XJdxFMt_b5LDfEuaWto8hoqipnYnNJjVy01zdV-zYV0WUShPK9yx39DNvanLEpYz9rI0EukrL5GbqJmQYyjyuy28gODm-sJtldjvtBwuEXlq7ADXDOnCj9zdq46E1AB2I2kEY6vmMHk0F47y4wEeZ8wlBad4u8H5aU1HahD1EldyM0c7TDpQ==).\n\n“Opendoor’s third quarter acquisition volumes, revenue, Contribution Profit, and Adjusted EBITDA all exceeded our guidance, notwithstanding persistent housing market headwinds. In August, many anticipated that interest rate cuts would bring buyers and sellers back to the market. However, mortgage rates remain stubbornly high and the housing market continues to be challenged by high delistings, low clearance, and strained affordability,” said Carrie Wheeler, CEO of Opendoor.\n\nWheeler continued, “We are focused on what we can control, operating our business as efficiently as possible, and streamlining our cost structure while managing risk. The combination of the actions we took in the second half of this year will result in annualized savings of approximately $85 million as we enter 2025. With a simplified organization and ongoing enhancements in our core products, we are well-positioned to rescale the business as conditions improve.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Key Highlights**\n\n  * Revenue of $1.4 billion, up 41% versus 3Q23 and down (9)% versus 2Q24; with 3,615 total homes sold, up 35% versus 3Q23 and down (11)% versus 2Q24\n  * Gross profit of $105 million, versus $96 million in 3Q23 and $129 million in 2Q24; Gross Margin of 7.6%, versus 9.8% in 3Q23 and 8.5% in 2Q24\n  * Net loss of $(78) million, versus $(106) million in 3Q23 and $(92) million in 2Q24\n  * Inventory balance of $2.1 billion, representing 6,288 homes, up 64% versus 3Q23 and down (4)% versus 2Q24\n  * Purchased 3,504 homes, up 12% versus 3Q23 and down (27)% versus 2Q24\n  * Ended the quarter with 1,006 homes under contract for purchase, down (39)% versus 3Q23 and down (44)% versus 2Q24\n\n\n\n _Non-GAAP Key Highlights*_\n\n  * Contribution Profit of $52 million, versus $43 million in 3Q23 and $95 million in 2Q24; Contribution Margin of 3.8%, versus 4.4% in 3Q23 and 6.3% in 2Q24\n  * Adjusted EBITDA of $(38) million, versus $(49) million in 3Q23 and $(5) million in 2Q24; Adjusted EBITDA Margin of (2.8)%, versus (5.0)% in 3Q23 and (0.3)% in 2Q24\n  * Adjusted Net Loss of $(70) million, versus $(75) million in 3Q23 and $(31) million in 2Q24 \n\n\n\n*See “— _Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures_ ” below for further details and a reconciliation of such non-GAAP measures to their nearest comparable GAAP measures.\n\n**Fourth Quarter 2024 Financial Outlook**\n\n  * 4Q24 revenue guidance of $925 million to $975 million\n  * 4Q24 Contribution Profit1 guidance of $15 million to $25 million\n  * 4Q24 Adjusted EBITDA1 guidance of $(70) million to $(60) million\n\n\n\n** _Conference Call and Webcast Details_**\n\nOpendoor will host a conference call to discuss its financial results on November 7, 2024, at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time.

The absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are predictions, projections and other statements about future events that are based on current expectations and assumptions and, as a result, are subject to risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to differ materially from those in such forward-looking statements. The factors that could cause or contribute to actual future events to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in this press release include but are not limited to: the current and future health and stability of the economy, financial conditions and residential housing market, including any extended downturn or slowdown; changes in general economic and financial conditions (including federal monetary policy, interest rates, inflation, actual or anticipated recession, home price fluctuations, and housing inventory), as well as the probability of such changes occurring, that may impact demand for our products and services, lower our profitability or reduce our access to future financings; actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and results of operations; changes in projected operational and financial results; our real estate assets and increased competition in the U.S. residential real estate industry; our ability to operate and grow our core business products, including the ability to obtain sufficient financing and resell purchased homes; investment of resources to pursue strategies and develop new products and services that may not prove effective or that are not attractive to customers and/or partners or that do not allow us to compete successfully; our ability to acquire and resell homes profitably; our ability to grow market share in our existing markets or any new markets we may enter; our ability to manage our growth effectively; our ability to expeditiously sell and appropriately price our inventory; our ability to access sources of capital, including debt financing and securitization funding to finance our real estate inventories and other sources of capital to finance operations and growth; our ability to maintain and enhance our products and brand, and to attract customers; our ability to manage, develop and refine our digital platform, including our automated pricing and valuation technology; our ability to comply with multiple listing service rules and requirements to access and use listing data, and to maintain or establish relationships with listings and data providers; our ability to obtain or maintain licenses and permits to support our current and future business operations; acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, capital-raising activities or other corporate transactions or commitments by us or our competitors; actual or anticipated changes in technology, products, markets or services by us or our competitors; our ability to protect our brand and intellectual property; our success in retaining or recruiting, or changes required in, our officers, key employees and/or directors; the impact of the regulatory environment within our industry and complexities with compliance related to such environment; any future impact of pandemics or epidemics, including any future resurgences of COVID-19 and its variants, or other public health crises on our ability to operate, demand for our products and services, or general economic conditions; changes in laws or government regulation affecting our business; and the impact of pending or future litigation or regulatory actions. The foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive. You should carefully consider the foregoing factors and the other risks and uncertainties described under the caption “Risk Factors” in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on February 15, 2024, as updated by our periodic reports and other filings with the SEC. These filings identify and address other important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.

The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures including Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss), Contribution Profit (Loss), Adjusted Net Loss, Adjusted EBITDA, and any such non-GAAP financial measures expressed as a Margin, are useful to investors as supplemental operational measurements to evaluate the Company’s financial performance.\n\nThe non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the Company’s reported GAAP results because they may include or exclude certain items as compared to similar GAAP-based measures, and such measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of the Company’s recurring operating results.\n\n_Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss) and Contribution Profit (Loss)_\n\nTo provide investors with additional information regarding our margins and return on inventory acquired, we have included Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss) and Contribution Profit (Loss), which are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss) and Contribution Profit (Loss) are useful financial measures for investors as they are supplemental measures used by management in evaluating unit level economics and our operating performance. Each of these measures is intended to present the economics related to homes sold during a given period. We do so by including revenue generated from homes sold (and adjacent services) in the period and only the expenses that are directly attributable to such home sales, even if such expenses were recognized in prior periods, and excluding expenses related to homes that remain in inventory as of the end of the period. Contribution Profit (Loss) provides investors a measure to assess Opendoor’s ability to generate returns on homes sold during a reporting period after considering home purchase costs, renovation and repair costs, holding costs and selling costs.\n\nAdjusted Gross Profit (Loss) and Contribution Profit (Loss) are supplemental measures of our operating performance and have limitations as analytical tools. For example, these measures include costs that were recorded in prior periods under GAAP and exclude, in connection with homes held in inventory at the end of the period, costs required to be recorded under GAAP in the same period. Accordingly, these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. We include a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, which is gross profit.\n\n_Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss) / Margin_\n\nWe calculate Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss) as gross profit under GAAP adjusted for (1) inventory valuation adjustment in the current period, and (2) inventory valuation adjustment in prior periods. Inventory valuation adjustment in the current period is calculated by adding back the inventory valuation adjustments recorded during the period on homes that remain in inventory at period end. Inventory valuation adjustment in prior periods is calculated by subtracting the inventory valuation adjustments recorded in prior periods on homes sold in the current period. Adjusted Gross Margin is Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss) as a percentage of revenue.\n\nWe view this metric as an important measure of business performance as it captures gross margin performance isolated to homes sold in a given period and provides comparability across reporting periods. Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss) helps management assess home pricing, service fees and renovation performance for a specific resale cohort.\n\n_Contribution Profit (Loss) / Margin_\n\nWe calculate Contribution Profit (Loss) as Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss), minus certain costs incurred on homes sold during the current period including: (1) holding costs incurred in the current period, (2) holding costs incurred in prior periods, and (3) direct selling costs. The composition of our holding costs is described in the footnotes to the reconciliation table below. Contribution Margin is Contribution Profit (Loss) as a percentage of revenue.\n\nWe view this metric as an important measure of business performance as it captures the unit level performance isolated to homes sold in a given period and provides comparability across reporting periods. Contribution Profit (Loss) helps management assess inflows and outflows directly associated with a specific resale cohort.\n\n**OPENDOOR TECHNOLOGIES INC.****RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP MEASURES**(In millions, except percentages, and homes sold)(Unaudited)\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of our Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss) and Contribution Profit (Loss) to our gross profit, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure, for the periods indicated:\n\n**​**| **Three Months Ended**| **Nine Months Ended****September 30,**  \n---|---|---  \n**(in millions, except percentages and homes sold, or as noted)**| **September 30,****2024**| **June 30,****2024**| **March 31,****2024**| **December 31,****2023**| **September 30,****2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \n**Revenue (GAAP)**| **$**| **1,377**| **$**| **1,511**| **$**| **1,181**| **$**| **870**| **$**| **980**| **$**| **4,069**| **$**| **6,076**  \n**Gross profit (GAAP)**| **$**| **105**| **​**| **$**| **129**| **$**| **114**| **$**| **72**| **$**| **96**| **$**| **348**| **$**| **415**  \n _Gross Margin_|  7.6| %| ​| 8.5| %| 9.7| %| 8.3| %| 9.8| %| 8.6| %| 6.8| %  \nAdjustments:| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nInventory valuation adjustment – Current Period(1)(2)| 10| ​| 34| 7| 11| 17| 33| 24  \nInventory valuation adjustment – Prior Periods(1)(3)| (16| )| ​| (9| )| (17| )| (17| )| (29| )| (24| )| (450| )  \n**Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss)**| **$**| **99**| **​**| **$**| **154**| **$**| **104**| **$**| **66**| **$**| **84**| **$**| **357**| **$**| **(11**| **)**  \n_Adjusted Gross Margin_|  7.2| %| ​| 10.2| %| 8.8| %| 7.6| %| 8.6| %| 8.8| %| (0.2| )| %  \nAdjustments:| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nDirect selling costs(4)| (32| )| ​| (43| )| (34| )| (26| )| (28| )| (109| )| (171| )  \nHolding costs on sales – Current Period(5)(6)| (6| )| ​| (5| )| (5| )| (3| )| (4| )| (30| )| (41| )  \nHolding costs on sales – Prior Periods(5)(7)| (9| )| ​| (11| )| (8| )| (7| )| (9| )| (14| )| (65| )  \n**Contribution Profit (Loss)**| **$**| **52**| **$**| **95**| **$**| **57**| **$**| **30**| **$**| **43**| **$**| **204**| **$**| **(288**| **)**  \nHomes sold in period| 3,615| 4,078| 3,078| 2,364| 2,687| 10,771| 16,344  \n**Contribution Profit (Loss) per Home Sold**(in thousands)| **$**| **14**| **$**| **23**| **$**| **19**| **$**| **13**| **$**| **16**| **$**| **19**| **$**| **(18**| **)**  \n_Contribution Margin_|  3.8| %| ​| 6.3| %| 4.8| %| 3.4| %| 4.4| %| 5.0| %| (4.7| )| %  \n  \n________________\n\n(1)| ​Inventory valuation adjustment includes adjustments to record real estate inventory at the lower of its carrying amount or its net realizable value.  \n---|---  \n(2)| Inventory valuation adjustment — Current Period is the inventory valuation adjustments recorded during the period presented associated with homes that remain in inventory at period end.  \n(3)| Inventory valuation adjustment — Prior Periods is the inventory valuation adjustments recorded in prior periods associated with homes that sold in the period presented.  \n(4)| Represents selling costs incurred related to homes sold in the relevant period.

These measures are also commonly used by investors and analysts to compare the underlying performance of companies in our industry. We believe these measures provide investors with meaningful period over period comparisons of our underlying performance, adjusted for certain charges that are non-cash, not directly related to our revenue-generating operations, not aligned to related revenue, or not reflective of ongoing operating results that vary in frequency and amount.\n\nAdjusted Net Loss and Adjusted EBITDA are supplemental measures of our operating performance and have important limitations. For example, these measures exclude the impact of certain costs required to be recorded under GAAP. These measures also include inventory valuation adjustments that were recorded in prior periods under GAAP and exclude, in connection with homes held in inventory at the end of the period, inventory valuation adjustments required to be recorded under GAAP in the same period. These measures could differ substantially from similarly titled measures presented by other companies in our industry or companies in other industries. Accordingly, these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. We include a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, which is net loss.\n\n_Adjusted Net Loss_\n\nWe calculate Adjusted Net Loss as GAAP net loss adjusted to exclude non-cash expenses of stock-based compensation, equity securities fair value adjustment, and intangibles amortization expense. It excludes expenses that are not directly related to our revenue-generating operations such as restructuring. It excludes loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt as these expenses or gains were incurred as a result of decisions made by management to repay portions of our outstanding credit facilities and the 0.25% convertible senior notes due in 2026 (the \"2026 Notes\") early; these expenses are not reflective of ongoing operating results and vary in frequency and amount. Adjusted Net Loss also aligns the timing of inventory valuation adjustments recorded under GAAP to the period in which the related revenue is recorded in order to improve the comparability of this measure to our non-GAAP financial measures of unit economics, as described above. Our calculation of Adjusted Net Loss does not currently include the tax effects of the non-GAAP adjustments because our taxes and such tax effects have not been material to date.\n\n_Adjusted EBITDA / Margin_\n\nWe calculated Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted Net Loss adjusted for depreciation and amortization, property financing and other interest expense, interest income, and income tax expense. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental performance measure that our management uses to assess our operating performance and the operating leverage in our business. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue.\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of our Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted EBITDA to our net loss, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure, for the periods indicated:\n\n​| **Three Months Ended**| **Nine Months Ended****September 30,**  \n---|---|---  \n**(in millions, except percentages)**| **September 30,****2024**| **June 30,****2024**| **March 31,****2024**| **December 31,****2023**| **September 30,****2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \n**Revenue (GAAP)**| **$**| **1,377**| **$**| **1,511**| **$**| **1,181**| **$**| **870**| **$**| **980**| **$**| **4,069**| **$**| **6,076**  \n**Net loss (GAAP)**| **$**| **(78**| **)**| **​**| **$**| **(92**| **)**| **$**| **(109**| **)**| **$**| **(91**| **)**| **$**| **(106**| **)**| **$**| **(279**| **)**| **$**| **(184**| **)**  \nAdjustments:| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nStock-based compensation| 25| ​| 33| 33| 32| 31| 91| 94  \nEquity securities fair value adjustment(1)| 3| 2| 2| (3| )| 11| 7| 4  \nIntangibles amortization expense(2)| 1| ​| 1| 2| 2| 2| 4| 5  \nInventory valuation adjustment – Current Period(3)(4)| 10| ​| 34| 7| 11| 17| 33| 24  \nInventory valuation adjustment — Prior Periods(3)(5)| (16| )| ​| (9| )| (17| )| (17| )| (29| )| (24| )| (450| )  \nRestructuring(6)| —| ​| —| —| 4| —| —| 10  \nLoss (gain) on extinguishment of debt| —| 1| —| (34| )| —| 1| (182| )  \nOther(7)| (15| )| ​| (1| )| 2| (1| )| (1| )| (14| )| (2| )  \n**Adjusted Net Loss**| **$**| **(70**| **)**| **​**| **$**| **(31**| **)**| **$**| **(80**| **)**| **$**| **(97**| **)**| **$**| **(75**| **)**| **$**| **(181**| **)**| **$**| **(681**| **)**  \nAdjustments:  \nDepreciation and amortization, excluding amortization of intangibles| 10| ​| 7| 11| 15| 9| 28| 30  \nProperty financing(8)| 30| ​| 26| 32| 32| 38| 88| 142  \nOther interest expense(9)| 4| ​| 4| 5| 5| 9| 13| 32  \nInterest income(10)| (12| )| ​| (12| )| (18| )| (24| )| (30| )| (42| )| (82| )  \nIncome tax expense| —| ​| 1| —| —| —| 1| 1  \n**Adjusted EBITDA**| **$**| **(38**| **)**| **​**| **$**| **(5**| **)**| **$**| **(50**| **)**| **$**| **(69**| **)**| **$**| **(49**| **)**| **$**| **(93**| **)**| **$**| **(558**| **)**  \n_Adjusted EBITDA Margin_| (2.8| )| %| ​| (0.3| )| %| (4.2| )| %| (7.9| )| %| (5.0| )| %| (2.3| )| %| (9.2| )| %  \n  \n________________\n\n(1)| Represents the gains and losses on certain financial instruments, which are marked to fair value at the end of each period.  \n---|---  \n(2)| Represents amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets.
