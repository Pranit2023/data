(NASDAQ: PBYI), a biopharmaceutical company, announced the initiation of its ALISertib in CAncer (ALISCA™-Breast1) Phase II trial (PUMA-ALI-1201; NCT06369285) of alisertib in combination with endocrine therapy for the treatment of patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-negative) recurrent or metastatic breast cancer who have been previously treated with CDK 4/6 inhibitors and received at least two prior lines of endocrine therapy in the recurrent or metastatic setting. The ALISCA™-Breast1 trial will enroll up to 150 patients who will be randomized (1:1:1) to receive alisertib dosed at either 30 mg, 40 mg or 50 mg twice daily on days 1-3, 8-10 and 15-17 in a 28-day cycle in combination with the endocrine therapy of the investigator’s choice. Patients must provide blood and tissue specimens so that biomarkers can be analyzed. \n\nThe primary objective of the trial is to determine the optimal alisertib dose in combination with selected endocrine therapy. The primary endpoints of the trial include objective response rate, duration of response, disease control rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival. As a secondary endpoint, Puma will evaluate each of these efficacy endpoints within biomarker subgroups in order to determine whether any biomarker subgroup correlates with response. Puma will perform its biomarker analysis of the ALISCA™-Breast1 trial in parallel with the execution of the clinical trial. Puma plans to perform an initial interim analysis for the evaluation of safety and efficacy. \n\nBased upon the outcomes of the trial, Puma anticipates meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to explore the potential for an approval pathway for alisertib in HER2-negative, HR+ metastatic breast cancer. Once the optimal alisertib dose is identified, Puma plans to engage with global regulatory agencies regarding the design of a pivotal (Phase III) trial, which it anticipates will be a randomized trial of alisertib plus investigator’s choice endocrine therapy versus placebo plus investigator’s choice endocrine therapy in patients with HER2-negative, HR+ metastatic breast cancer. \n\n“Additional therapies are needed for patients with HER2-negative, HR+ metastatic breast cancer whose disease progresses on CDK4/6 inhibitors in the first-line setting,” said Joyce A. O’Shaughnessy, M.D., the Celebrating Women Chair in Breast Cancer Research at Baylor University Medical Center, Texas Oncology, Sarah Cannon Research Institute in Dallas, Texas. “The results from the TBCRC 041 trial indicated that alisertib has impressive clinical activity in the setting of endocrine therapy and CDK4/6 inhibitor-resistant metastatic breast cancer, with good tolerability. I look forward to the further evaluation of alisertib in the ALISCA™-Breast1 trial to definitively determine the clinical impact of this treatment.” \n\nAlan H. Auerbach, Chief Executive Officer, President and Founder of Puma, stated, “We are excited to initiate this Phase II trial and to move forward with the development of alisertib in HER2-negative HR+ metastatic breast cancer. We believe that the data from the previous trial of alisertib monotherapy (published in Lancet Oncology) as well as the TBCRC 041 trial (published in JAMA Oncology), which tested alisertib alone and with fulvestrant, and the randomized trial of alisertib plus paclitaxel versus paclitaxel alone (published in JAMA Network Open) have demonstrated that alisertib is active in patients with HER2-negative, HR+ metastatic breast cancer and in biomarker focused subgroups. We look forward to enrollment in the ALISCA™-Breast1 trial and anticipate that we should have initial data from this trial in 2025.” \n\n**About Puma Biotechnology**\n\nPuma Biotechnology, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company with a focus on the development and commercialization of innovative products to enhance cancer care.

(NASDAQ: PBYI), a biopharmaceutical company, announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. Unless otherwise stated, all comparisons are for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. \n\nProduct revenue, net consists entirely of sales revenue from NERLYNX®, Puma’s first commercial product. Product revenue, net in the third quarter of 2024 was $56.1 million, compared to $51.6 million in the third quarter of 2023. Product revenue, net in the first nine months of 2024 was $140.8 million, compared to $149.9 million in the first nine months of 2023. \n\nBased on accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), Puma reported net income of $20.3 million, or $0.41 per basic and diluted share, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to a net income of $5.8 million, or $0.12 per basic and diluted share, for the third quarter of 2023. Net income for the first nine months of 2024 was $11.0 million, or $0.23 per basic share and $0.22 per diluted share, compared to net income of $9.3 million, or $0.20 per basic and diluted share, for the first nine months of 2023. \n\nNon-GAAP adjusted net income was $22.4 million, or $0.46 per basic share and $0.45 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $8.3 million, or $0.18 per basic share and $0.17 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP adjusted net income for the first nine months of 2024 was $17.5 million, or $0.36 per basic and diluted share, compared to non-GAAP adjusted net income of $17.1 million, or $0.36 per basic and diluted share, for the first nine months of 2023. Non-GAAP adjusted net income excludes stock-based compensation expenses. For a reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income and GAAP net income per share to non-GAAP adjusted net income per share, please see the financial tables at the end of this news release. \n\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the third quarter of 2024 was $11.0 million, compared to $10.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. Net cash provided by operating activities for the first nine months of 2024 was $23.3 million, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $16.6 million in the first nine months of 2023. On September 30, 2024, Puma had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $97 million, compared to cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of approximately $96 million at December 31, 2023. \n\n“We are pleased to announce both positive net income and positive operating cash flow for the third quarter of 2024,” said Alan H. Auerbach, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President of Puma. “In addition to our focus on the commercialization of NERLYNX, we are also continuing to make progress with the clinical development of alisertib for patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer and patients with chemotherapy-naïve HER2-negative, hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer.” \n\nMr. Auerbach added, “We anticipate the following key milestones over the next 12 months: (i) initiation of ALI-1201/ALISCA™-Breast1, a Phase II trial of alisertib in combination with endocrine treatment in patients with chemotherapy-naïve HER2-negative, hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer (Q4 2024); (ii) presentation of interim data from ALI-4201/ALISCA™-Lung1, a Phase II clinical trial of alisertib monotherapy for the treatment of patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer (2025); and (iii) presentation of interim data from ALISCA™-Breast1, a Phase II trial of alisertib in combination with endocrine treatment in patients with chemotherapy-naïve HER2-negative, hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer (2025).” \n\n**Revenue**\n\nTotal revenue consists of product revenue, net from sales of NERLYNX, Puma’s first commercial product and royalty revenue. For the third quarter of 2024, total revenue was $80.5 million, of which $56.1 million was product revenue, net and $24.4 million was royalty revenue. This compares to total revenue of $56.1 million in the third quarter of 2023, of which $51.6 million was product revenue, net and $4.5 million was royalty revenue. For the first nine months of 2024, total revenue was $171.4 million, of which $140.8 million was product revenue, net and $30.6 million was royalty revenue. This compares to total revenue of $163.5 million for the first nine months of 2023, of which $149.9 million was product revenue, net, and $13.6 million was royalty revenue. \n\n**Operating Costs and Expenses**\n\nTotal operating costs and expenses were $58.4 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $47.5 million for the third quarter of 2023. Operating costs and expenses in the first nine months of 2024 were $153.8 million, compared to $145.7 million in the first nine months of 2023. \n\n**Cost of Sales**\n\nCost of sales was $29.1 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $13.3 million for the third quarter of 2023. Cost of sales was $50.5 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared to $38.4 million for the first nine months of 2023. The increase was primarily due to royalty expense related to the timing of sales made in China by our sub-licensee and an increase in units shipped to China. \n\n**Selling, General and Administrative Expenses**\n\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $16.8 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $22.8 million for the third quarter of 2023. SG&A expenses for the first nine months of 2024 were $63.5 million, compared to $69.7 million for the first nine months of 2023. The $6.2 million decrease in SG&A expenses for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 resulted from a decrease in payroll and related costs of approximately $2.4 million, primarily due to lower headcount, partially offset by annual salary increases; and a decrease in professional fees and expenses of approximately $1.2 million, primarily due to decreases of approximately $3.2 million in marketing expenses and $0.4 million in insurance and other expenses. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of approximately $2.3 million in legal fees; a decrease in stock-based compensation expense of approximately $1.1 million, primarily due to lower headcount; a decrease in provision for credit loss of $0.6 million, due to a customer payment on an overdue receivable; and a decrease in loss on impairment of asset expense of approximately $0.6 million in connection with our decision to sublease a portion of our office space in 2023. \n\n**Research and Development Expenses**\n\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses were $12.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $11.4 million for the third quarter of 2023. R&D expenses for the first nine months of 2024 were $39.8 million, compared to $37.6 million for the first nine months of 2023. The $2.2 million year-over-year increase in R&D expenses resulted primarily from an increase in clinical trial expenses of approximately $1.8 million, primarily due to the procurement of alisertib drug product and increased alisertib study activity, partially offset by fewer clinical milestones being achieved, and an increase in internal R&D expenses of approximately $0.8 million, primarily due to one-time payroll and severance related expenses. \n\n**Total Other Income (Expenses)**\n\nTotal other expenses were $1.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $2.6 million for the third quarter of 2023. Total other expenses of $5.7 million for the first nine months of 2024 were down from $8.0 million for the first nine months of 2023 due primarily to an increase in interest income. \n\n**Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Financial Outlook**\n\n**Fourth Quarter 2024** |  **Full Year 2024 (previous)** |  **Full Year 2024** **(new)**  \n---|---|---  \n**Net Product Revenue** |  **$46** – **$48 million** |  **$183** – **$190 million** |  **$187** – **$190 million**  \n**Royalty Revenue** |  **$3.5** – **$5 million** |  **$30** – **$34 million** |  **$34** – **$36 million**  \n**License Revenue** |  **$1** – **$2 million** |  **$1** – **$2 million** |  **$1** – **$2 million**  \n**Net Income** |  **$4** – **$6 million** |  **$12** – **$15 million** |  **$15** – **$17 million**  \n**Gross to Net Adjustment** |  **21%** – **22%** |  **21%** – **22%** |  **20.5%** – **21.5%**  \n  \n**Conference Call**\n\nPuma Biotechnology will host a conference call to report its third quarter 2024 financial results and provide an update on Puma’s business and outlook at 1:30 p.m. PST/4:30 p.m. EST on Thursday, November 7, 2024.

Neratinib, oral was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2017 for the extended adjuvant treatment of adult patients with early stage HER2-overexpressed/amplified breast cancer, following adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy, and is marketed in the United States as NERLYNX® (neratinib) tablets. In February 2020, NERLYNX was also approved by the FDA in combination with capecitabine for the treatment of adult patients with advanced or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens in the metastatic setting. NERLYNX was granted marketing authorization by the European Commission in 2018 for the extended adjuvant treatment of adult patients with early stage hormone receptor-positive HER2-overexpressed/amplified breast cancer and who are less than one year from completion of prior adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy. NERLYNX® is a registered trademark of Puma Biotechnology, Inc. \n\nIn September 2022, Puma entered into an exclusive license agreement for the development and commercialization of the anti-cancer drug alisertib, a selective, small molecule, orally administered inhibitor of aurora kinase A. Initially, Puma intends to focus the development of alisertib on the treatment of small cell lung cancer and breast cancer. In February 2024, Puma initiated ALISCA™-Lung 1, a Phase II clinical trial of alisertib monotherapy for the treatment of patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer. \n\nFurther information about Puma Biotechnology may be found at [https://www.pumabiotechnology.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pumabiotechnology.com&esheet=54148486&newsitemid=20241107443147&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pumabiotechnology.com&index=2&md5=9883d5b6b26d427e2b037c21a6be89ab). \n\n**INDICATIONS**\n\n  * NERLYNX® (neratinib) tablets, for oral use, is a kinase inhibitor indicated: \n  * As a single agent, for the extended adjuvant treatment of adult patients with early stage HER2-positive breast cancer, to follow adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy. \n  * In combination with capecitabine, for the treatment of adult patients with advanced or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, who have received two or more prior anti-HER2 based regimens in the metastatic setting. \n\n\n\n**Important Safety Information Regarding NERLYNX® (neratinib) U.S. Indication**\n\n**CONTRAINDICATIONS: None**\n\n**WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS:**\n\nDiarrhea: Manage diarrhea through either NERLYNX dose escalation or loperamide prophylaxis.

The following table presents Puma’s net income and net income per share calculated in accordance with GAAP and as adjusted to remove the impact of stock-based compensation expense. For the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, stock-based compensation represented approximately 7.0% and 6.3% of total selling, general and administrative expense and research and development expense, respectively, and 7.4% and 7.3% for the same periods in 2023. Puma’s management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to enhance understanding of Puma’s financial performance, are more indicative of its operational performance, and facilitate a better comparison among fiscal periods. These non-GAAP financial measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for GAAP reporting measures. \n\n**PUMA BIOTECHNOLOGY, INC.

(NASDAQ: PBYI), a biopharmaceutical company, announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. Unless otherwise stated, all comparisons are for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. \n\nProduct revenue, net consists entirely of sales revenue from NERLYNX®, Puma’s first commercial product. Product revenue, net in the third quarter of 2024 was $56.1 million, compared to $51.6 million in the third quarter of 2023. Product revenue, net in the first nine months of 2024 was $140.8 million, compared to $149.9 million in the first nine months of 2023. \n\nBased on accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), Puma reported net income of $20.3 million, or $0.41 per basic and diluted share, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to a net income of $5.8 million, or $0.12 per basic and diluted share, for the third quarter of 2023. Net income for the first nine months of 2024 was $11.0 million, or $0.23 per basic share and $0.22 per diluted share, compared to net income of $9.3 million, or $0.20 per basic and diluted share, for the first nine months of 2023. \n\nNon-GAAP adjusted net income was $22.4 million, or $0.46 per basic share and $0.45 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $8.3 million, or $0.18 per basic share and $0.17 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP adjusted net income for the first nine months of 2024 was $17.5 million, or $0.36 per basic and diluted share, compared to non-GAAP adjusted net income of $17.1 million, or $0.36 per basic and diluted share, for the first nine months of 2023. Non-GAAP adjusted net income excludes stock-based compensation expenses. For a reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income and GAAP net income per share to non-GAAP adjusted net income per share, please see the financial tables at the end of this news release. \n\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the third quarter of 2024 was $11.0 million, compared to $10.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. Net cash provided by operating activities for the first nine months of 2024 was $23.3 million, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $16.6 million in the first nine months of 2023. On September 30, 2024, Puma had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $97 million, compared to cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of approximately $96 million at December 31, 2023. \n\n“We are pleased to announce both positive net income and positive operating cash flow for the third quarter of 2024,” said Alan H. Auerbach, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President of Puma. “In addition to our focus on the commercialization of NERLYNX, we are also continuing to make progress with the clinical development of alisertib for patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer and patients with chemotherapy-naïve HER2-negative, hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer.” \n\nMr. Auerbach added, “We anticipate the following key milestones over the next 12 months: (i) initiation of ALI-1201/ALISCA™-Breast1, a Phase II trial of alisertib in combination with endocrine treatment in patients with chemotherapy-naïve HER2-negative, hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer (Q4 2024); (ii) presentation of interim data from ALI-4201/ALISCA™-Lung1, a Phase II clinical trial of alisertib monotherapy for the treatment of patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer (2025); and (iii) presentation of interim data from ALISCA™-Breast1, a Phase II trial of alisertib in combination with endocrine treatment in patients with chemotherapy-naïve HER2-negative, hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer (2025).” \n\n**Revenue**\n\nTotal revenue consists of product revenue, net from sales of NERLYNX, Puma’s first commercial product and royalty revenue. For the third quarter of 2024, total revenue was $80.5 million, of which $56.1 million was product revenue, net and $24.4 million was royalty revenue. This compares to total revenue of $56.1 million in the third quarter of 2023, of which $51.6 million was product revenue, net and $4.5 million was royalty revenue. For the first nine months of 2024, total revenue was $171.4 million, of which $140.8 million was product revenue, net and $30.6 million was royalty revenue. This compares to total revenue of $163.5 million for the first nine months of 2023, of which $149.9 million was product revenue, net, and $13.6 million was royalty revenue. \n\n**Operating Costs and Expenses**\n\nTotal operating costs and expenses were $58.4 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $47.5 million for the third quarter of 2023. Operating costs and expenses in the first nine months of 2024 were $153.8 million, compared to $145.7 million in the first nine months of 2023. \n\n**Cost of Sales**\n\nCost of sales was $29.1 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $13.3 million for the third quarter of 2023. Cost of sales was $50.5 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared to $38.4 million for the first nine months of 2023. The increase was primarily due to royalty expense related to the timing of sales made in China by our sub-licensee and an increase in units shipped to China. \n\n**Selling, General and Administrative Expenses**\n\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $16.8 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $22.8 million for the third quarter of 2023. SG&A expenses for the first nine months of 2024 were $63.5 million, compared to $69.7 million for the first nine months of 2023. The $6.2 million decrease in SG&A expenses for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 resulted from a decrease in payroll and related costs of approximately $2.4 million, primarily due to lower headcount, partially offset by annual salary increases; and a decrease in professional fees and expenses of approximately $1.2 million, primarily due to decreases of approximately $3.2 million in marketing expenses and $0.4 million in insurance and other expenses. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of approximately $2.3 million in legal fees; a decrease in stock-based compensation expense of approximately $1.1 million, primarily due to lower headcount; a decrease in provision for credit loss of $0.6 million, due to a customer payment on an overdue receivable; and a decrease in loss on impairment of asset expense of approximately $0.6 million in connection with our decision to sublease a portion of our office space in 2023. \n\n**Research and Development Expenses**\n\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses were $12.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $11.4 million for the third quarter of 2023. R&D expenses for the first nine months of 2024 were $39.8 million, compared to $37.6 million for the first nine months of 2023. The $2.2 million year-over-year increase in R&D expenses resulted primarily from an increase in clinical trial expenses of approximately $1.8 million, primarily due to the procurement of alisertib drug product and increased alisertib study activity, partially offset by fewer clinical milestones being achieved, and an increase in internal R&D expenses of approximately $0.8 million, primarily due to one-time payroll and severance related expenses. \n\n**Total Other Income (Expenses)**\n\nTotal other expenses were $1.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $2.6 million for the third quarter of 2023. Total other expenses of $5.7 million for the first nine months of 2024 were down from $8.0 million for the first nine months of 2023 due primarily to an increase in interest income. \n\n**Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Financial Outlook**\n\n**Fourth Quarter 2024** |  **Full Year 2024 (previous)** |  **Full Year 2024** **(new)**  \n---|---|---  \n**Net Product Revenue** |  **$46** – **$48 million** |  **$183** – **$190 million** |  **$187** – **$190 million**  \n**Royalty Revenue** |  **$3.5** – **$5 million** |  **$30** – **$34 million** |  **$34** – **$36 million**  \n**License Revenue** |  **$1** – **$2 million** |  **$1** – **$2 million** |  **$1** – **$2 million**  \n**Net Income** |  **$4** – **$6 million** |  **$12** – **$15 million** |  **$15** – **$17 million**  \n**Gross to Net Adjustment** |  **21%** – **22%** |  **21%** – **22%** |  **20.5%** – **21.5%**  \n  \n**Conference Call**\n\nPuma Biotechnology will host a conference call to report its third quarter 2024 financial results and provide an update on Puma’s business and outlook at 1:30 p.m. PST/4:30 p.m. EST on Thursday, November 7, 2024.

Puma in-licensed the global development and commercialization rights to PB272 (neratinib, oral) in 2011. Neratinib, oral was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2017 for the extended adjuvant treatment of adult patients with early stage HER2-overexpressed/amplified breast cancer, following adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy, and is marketed in the United States as NERLYNX® (neratinib) tablets. In February 2020, NERLYNX was also approved by the FDA in combination with capecitabine for the treatment of adult patients with advanced or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens in the metastatic setting. NERLYNX was granted marketing authorization by the European Commission in 2018 for the extended adjuvant treatment of adult patients with early stage hormone receptor-positive HER2-overexpressed/amplified breast cancer and who are less than one year from completion of prior adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy. NERLYNX® is a registered trademark of Puma Biotechnology, Inc. \n\nIn September 2022, Puma entered into an exclusive license agreement for the development and commercialization of the anti-cancer drug alisertib, a selective, small molecule, orally administered inhibitor of aurora kinase A. Initially, Puma intends to focus the development of alisertib on the treatment of small cell lung cancer and breast cancer. In February 2024, Puma initiated ALISCA™-Lung 1, a Phase II clinical trial of alisertib monotherapy for the treatment of patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer. \n\nFurther information about Puma Biotechnology may be found at [https://www.pumabiotechnology.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pumabiotechnology.com&esheet=54148486&newsitemid=20241107443147&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pumabiotechnology.com&index=2&md5=9883d5b6b26d427e2b037c21a6be89ab). \n\n**INDICATIONS**\n\n  * NERLYNX® (neratinib) tablets, for oral use, is a kinase inhibitor indicated: \n  * As a single agent, for the extended adjuvant treatment of adult patients with early stage HER2-positive breast cancer, to follow adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy. \n  * In combination with capecitabine, for the treatment of adult patients with advanced or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, who have received two or more prior anti-HER2 based regimens in the metastatic setting. \n\n\n\n**Important Safety Information Regarding NERLYNX® (neratinib) U.S. Indication**\n\n**CONTRAINDICATIONS: None**\n\n**WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS:**\n\nDiarrhea: Manage diarrhea through either NERLYNX dose escalation or loperamide prophylaxis.

The following table presents Puma’s net income and net income per share calculated in accordance with GAAP and as adjusted to remove the impact of stock-based compensation expense. For the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, stock-based compensation represented approximately 7.0% and 6.3% of total selling, general and administrative expense and research and development expense, respectively, and 7.4% and 7.3% for the same periods in 2023.

Any statements about our expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions, future\nevents or performance are not historical facts and may be forward looking. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about:\n• the commercialization of NERLYNX® (neratinib) tablets (“NERLYNX”);\n• the development of our drug candidates, including when we expect to undertake, initiate and complete clinical trials of our drug candidates;\n• the anticipated timing of regulatory filings;\n• the regulatory approval of our drug candidates;\n• our use of clinical research organizations and other contractors;\n• our ability to find collaborative partners for research, development and commercialization of potential products;\n• efforts of our sub-licensees to obtain regulatory approval and commercialize NERLYNX in areas outside the United States;\n• our ability to market any of our products;\n• our expectations regarding our costs and expenses;\n• our anticipated capital requirements and estimates regarding our needs for additional financing;\n• our ability to compete against other companies and research institutions;\n• our ability to secure adequate protection for our intellectual property;\n• our intention and ability to vigorously defend against any litigation to which we are or may become party;\n• our ability to in-license additional drugs;\n• our ability to attract and retain key personnel; and\n• our ability to obtain adequate financing on favorable terms or at all.\nThese statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “plan,” “project,” “continuing,”\n“ongoing,” “expect,” “believe,” “intend” and similar words or phrases. Accordingly, these statements involve estimates, assumptions and uncertainties that\ncould cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in them.

AND SUBSIDIARY\nNOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1—Business and Basis of Presentation:\nBusiness and Liquidity:\nPuma Biotechnology, Inc., (the “Company”) is a biopharmaceutical company based in Los Angeles, California that develops and commercializes\ninnovative products to enhance cancer care and improve treatment outcomes for patients. The Company is currently commercializing NERLYNX®, an oral\nversion of neratinib (“NERLYNX”), for the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. Additionally, in 2022, the Company in-licensed and became responsible\nfor the global development and commercialization of, alisertib. Alisertib is a selective, small molecule inhibitor of aurora kinase A that is designed to disrupt\nmitosis leading to apoptosis of rapidly proliferating tumor cells dependent on aurora kinase. The Company believes alisertib has potential application in the\ntreatment of a range of different cancer types, including hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, triple-negative breast cancer and small cell lung cancer.\nThe Company has one subsidiary, Puma Biotechnology, B.V., a Netherlands company. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the\nCompany and its wholly owned subsidiary. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\nThe Company has incurred significant operating losses since its inception. While the Company has previously reported net income, we cannot assure\nthat we will continue to do so and will need to continue to generate significant revenue to sustain operations and successfully commercialize\nneratinib. In 2017, the Company received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approval for its first product, NERLYNX® (neratinib), formerly known\nas PB272 (neratinib, oral), for the extended adjuvant treatment of adult patients with early stage HER2-overexpressed/amplified breast cancer following\nadjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy. Following FDA approval in July 2017, NERLYNX became available by prescription in the United States, and the\nCompany commenced commercialization.\nIn February 2020, NERLYNX was also approved by the FDA in combination with capecitabine for the treatment of adult patients with advanced or\nmetastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens in the metastatic setting.\nIn 2018, the European Commission (“EC”) granted marketing authorization for NERLYNX in the EU for the extended adjuvant treatment of adult\npatients with early stage hormone receptor positive HER2-overexpressed/amplified breast cancer and who are less than one year from the completion of prior\nadjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy.\nThe Company is required to make substantial payments to Pfizer upon the achievement of certain milestones and has contractual obligations for clinical\ntrial contracts.\nThe Company has entered into other exclusive sub-license agreements with various parties to pursue regulatory approval, if necessary, and\ncommercialize NERLYNX, if approved, in many regions outside the United States, including Europe (excluding Russia and Ukraine), Australia, Canada,\nChina, Southeast Asia, Israel, South Korea, and various countries and territories in Central America, South America, Africa and the Middle East. The Company\nplans to continue to pursue commercialization of NERLYNX in other countries outside the United States, if approved.\nIn September 2022, the Company entered into an exclusive license agreement with a subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (“Takeda”)\nto license the worldwide research and development and commercial rights to alisertib, a selective, small-molecule, orally administered inhibitor of aurora\nkinase A.\nThe Company has reported net income of approximately $11.0 million and cash provided by operations of approximately $23.3 million for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024. The Company’s commercialization, research and development or marketing efforts may require funding in addition to the\ncash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling approximately $96.7 million at September 30, 2024.\nThe Company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024 and proceeds that will become\navailable to the Company through product sales and sub-license payments are sufficient to satisfy its operating cash needs, including amounts due under the\nCompany’s Note Purchase Agreement with Athyrium Opportunities IV Co-Invest 1 LP (“Athyrium”) (see Note 9—Debt), for at least one year after the filing of\nthe Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q in which these financial statements are included. The Company continues to remain dependent on its ability to obtain\nsufficient funding to sustain operations and continue to successfully commercialize neratinib in the United States. While the Company has been successful in\nraising capital in the past, there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so in the future. The Company’s ability to obtain funding may be adversely\nimpacted by uncertain market and economic conditions, including the Company’s success in commercializing neratinib and unfavorable decisions of regulatory\nauthorities or adverse clinical trial results. The outcome of these matters cannot be predicted at this time. Additionally, the terms of the Company’s Note\nPurchase Agreement place restrictions on the Company’s ability to operate the business and on the Company’s financial flexibility, and the Company may be\nunable to achieve the revenue necessary to satisfy the minimum revenue and cash balance covenants as specified in the agreement.\nSince its inception through September 30, 2024, the Company’s financing has primarily consisted of proceeds from product, royalty and license revenue,\npublic offerings of its common stock, private equity placements, and various debt instruments.\nIn the opinion of management, the included disclosures are adequate, and the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements\ncontain all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of our consolidated financial position as of September 30, 2024. Such adjustments are of a normal and\nrecurring nature. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 was derived from audited annual financial statements but does not\ncontain all of the footnote disclosures from the audited annual financial statements. The condensed consolidated results of operations for the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the consolidated results of operations that may be expected for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024.\nNote 2—Significant Accounting Policies:\nThe significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of these unaudited consolidated financial statements are as follows:\nPrinciples of Consolidation:\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary. All intercompany balances and transactions\nhave been eliminated in consolidation.\n7\nTable of Contents\nSegment Reporting:\nManagement has determined that the Company operates in one business segment, which is the development and commercialization of innovative\nproducts to enhance cancer care.\nUse of Estimates:\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) in the United States,\nrequires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities\nat the date of the balance sheet, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the period presented. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those\nestimates.\nSignificant estimates include estimates for variable consideration for which reserves were established. These estimates are included in the calculation of\nnet revenues and include trade discounts and allowances, product returns, provider chargebacks and discounts, government rebates, payor rebates, and other\nincentives, such as voluntary patient assistance, and other allowances that are offered within contracts between the Company and its customers, payors, and\nother indirect customers relating to the Company’s sale of its products.\nNet Income per Share of Common Stock:\nBasic net income per share of common stock is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of\nshares of common stock outstanding during the periods presented, as required by Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”), ASC 260, Earnings per Share.\nFor purposes of calculating diluted net income per share of common stock, the denominator includes both the weighted-average number of shares of common\nstock outstanding and the number of dilutive common stock equivalents, such as stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and warrants. A common stock\nequivalent is not included in the denominator when calculating diluted earnings per common share if the effect of such common stock equivalent would be\nanti-dilutive.\nOur potentially dilutive securities include potential common shares related to our stock options and RSUs granted in connection with the Puma\nBiotechnology, Inc. 2011 Incentive Award Plan and the Puma Biotechnology, Inc. 2017 Employment Inducement Incentive Award Plan. Diluted earnings per\nshare (“Diluted EPS”) considers the impact of potentially dilutive securities except in periods in which there is a loss because the inclusion of the potential\ncommon shares would have an anti-dilutive effect. Diluted EPS excludes the impact of potential common shares related to our stock options in periods in\nwhich the option exercise price is greater than the average market price of our common stock for the period. The following potentially dilutive outstanding\ncommon stock equivalents for the respective periods were excluded from diluted net income per share because of their anti-dilutive effect:\nFor the Three Months Ended For the Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nOptions outstanding 3,850,575 4,211,389 3,850,575 4,211,389\nWarrant outstanding 2,116,250 2,116,250 2,116,250 2,116,250\nUnvested restricted stock units 751,139 1,087,224 751,139 1,111,286\nTotals 6,717,964 7,414,863 6,717,964 7,438,925\nThe 2,116,250 shares underlying the warrant will not have an impact on our diluted net income per share until the average market price of our common\nstock exceeds the exercise price of $16 per share (see Note 10—Stockholders’ Equity).\nA reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted net income per share of common stock computations is as follows (in\nthousands, except share and per share amounts):\nFor the Three Months Ended For the Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNumerator:\nNet income $ 20,317 $ 5,796 $ 10,973 $ 9,323\nDenominator:\nWeighted average common stock outstanding for basic net\nincome per share 49,008,464 47,520,338 48,498,579 46,977,127\nNet effect of dilutive common stock equivalents 164,897 298,896 526,524 420,082\nWeighted average common stock outstanding for diluted net\nincome per share 49,173,361 47,819,234 49,025,103 47,397,209\nNet income per share of common stock\nBasic $ 0.41 $ 0.12 $ 0.23 $ 0.20\nDiluted $ 0.41 $ 0.12 $ 0.22 $ 0.20\nRevenue Recognition:\nUnder ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”), the Company recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of the\npromised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The\nCompany had no contracts with customers until the FDA approved NERLYNX on July 17, 2017. Subsequent to receiving FDA approval, the Company entered\ninto a limited number of arrangements with specialty pharmacies and specialty distributors in the United States to distribute NERLYNX. These arrangements\nare the Company’s initial contracts with customers. The Company has determined that these sales channels with customers are similar.\n8\nTable of Contents\nProduct Revenue, Net:\nThe Company sells NERLYNX to a limited number of specialty pharmacies and specialty distributors in the United States. These customers\nsubsequently resell the Company’s products to patients and certain medical centers or hospitals. In addition to distribution agreements with these customers, the\nCompany enters into arrangements with health care providers and payors that provide for government mandated and/or privately negotiated rebates,\nchargebacks and discounts with respect to the purchase of the Company’s products.\nThe Company recognizes revenue on product sales when the specialty pharmacy or specialty distributor, as applicable, obtains control of the Company’s\nproduct, which occurs at a point in time (upon delivery). Product revenue is recorded net of applicable reserves for variable consideration, including discounts\nand allowances. The Company’s payment terms range between 10 and 68 days.\nProduct revenue also consists of product sales under sub-license agreements to our sub-licensees, who then sell into their respective international\nterritories.\nShipping and handling costs for product shipments occur prior to the customer obtaining control of the goods and are recorded in cost of sales.\nIf taxes should be collected from customers relating to product sales and remitted to governmental authorities, they will be excluded from revenue. The\nCompany expenses incremental costs of obtaining a contract when incurred if the expected amortization period of the asset that the Company would have\nrecognized is one year or less. However, no such costs were incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nReserves for Variable Consideration:\nRevenue from product sales is recorded at the net sales price (transaction price), which includes estimates of variable consideration for which reserves\nare established. Components of variable consideration include trade discounts and allowances, product returns, provider chargebacks and discounts,\ngovernment rebates, payor rebates, and other incentives, such as voluntary patient assistance, and other allowances that are offered within contracts between the\nCompany and its customers, payors, and other indirect customers relating to the Company’s sale of its products. These reserves, as detailed below, are based on\nthe related sales, and are classified as reductions of accounts receivable, net when the right of offset exists in accordance with Accounting Standards Update\n(“ASU”) ASU 2013-1, Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Clarifying the Scope of Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities, or as a current liability. These\nestimates take into consideration a range of possible outcomes that are probability-weighted in accordance with the expected value method in ASC 606 for\nrelevant factors such as current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data, and forecasted customer buying\nand payment patterns. Overall, these reserves reflect the Company’s best estimates of the amount of consideration to which it is entitled based on the terms of\nthe respective underlying contracts.\nThe amount of variable consideration that is included in the transaction price may be constrained and is included in the net sales price only to the extent\nthat it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized under the contract will not occur in a future period. The\nCompany’s analyses also contemplated application of the constraint in accordance with the guidance, under which it determined a significant reversal of\nrevenue would not be probable to occur in a future period for the estimates detailed below as of September 30, 2024, and, therefore, the transaction price was\nnot reduced further during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may differ from the Company’s\nestimates. If actual results in the future vary from the Company’s estimates, the Company will adjust these estimates, which would affect net product revenue\nand earnings in the period such variances become known.\nTrade Discounts and Allowances:\nThe Company generally provides customers with discounts, which include incentive fees that are explicitly stated in the Company’s contracts and are\nrecorded as a reduction of revenue in the period the related product revenue is recognized. The reserve for discounts is established in the same period that the\nrelated revenue is recognized, together with reductions to accounts receivable, net on the consolidated balance sheets. In addition, the Company compensates\nits customers for sales order management, data, and distribution services. The Company has determined such services received to date are not distinct from the\nCompany’s sale of products to its customers and, therefore, these payments have been recorded as a reduction of revenue within the condensed consolidated\nstatements of operations.\nProduct Returns:\nConsistent with industry practice, the Company offers the specialty pharmacies and specialty distributors that are its customers limited product return\nrights for damaged and expiring product, provided it is within a specified period around the product expiration date as set forth in the applicable individual\ndistribution agreement. The Company estimates the amount of its product sales that may be returned by its customers and records this estimate as a reduction of\nproduct revenue, net in the period the related product revenue is recognized, as well as a reduction to accounts receivable, net on the consolidated balance\nsheets. The Company currently estimates product returns using its own sales information, including its visibility into the inventory remaining in the distribution\nchannel. The Company has an insignificant amount of returns to date and believes that returns of its products will continue to be minimal.\nProvider Chargebacks and Discounts:\nChargebacks for fees and discounts to providers represent the estimated obligations resulting from contractual commitments to sell products to qualified\nhealthcare providers at prices lower than the list prices charged to its customers who directly purchase the product from the Company. Customers charge the\nCompany for the difference between what they pay for the product and the ultimate selling price to the qualified healthcare providers. The reserve for\nchargebacks is established in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue, net and a reduction to accounts\nreceivable, net on the consolidated balance sheets. Chargeback amounts are generally determined at the time of resale to the qualified healthcare provider by\ncustomers, and the Company generally issues credits for such amounts within a few weeks of the customer’s notification to the Company of the resale.\nChargebacks consist of credits the Company expects to issue for units that remain in the distribution channel at each reporting period-end that the Company\nexpects will be sold to qualified healthcare providers and chargebacks that customers have claimed, but for which the Company has not yet issued a payment.\n9\nTable of Contents\nGovernment Rebates:\nThe Company is subject to discount obligations under state Medicaid programs and Medicare. These reserves are recorded in the same period the related\nrevenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue, net and the establishment of a current liability, which is included in accrued expenses on the\ncondensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s liability for these rebates consists of invoices received for claims from prior quarters that have not been\npaid or for which an invoice has not yet been received, estimates of claims for the current quarter, and estimates of future claims that will be made for product\nthat has been recognized as revenue, but which remains in the distribution channel at the end of each reporting period.\nPayor Rebates:\nThe Company contracts with certain private payor organizations, primarily insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers, for the payment of\nrebates with respect to utilization of its products. The Company estimates these rebates and records such estimates in the same period the related revenue is\nrecognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue, net and the establishment of a current liability, which is included in accrued expenses on the\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nOther Incentives:\nOther incentives the Company offers include voluntary patient assistance programs, such as the co-pay assistance program, which are intended to\nprovide financial assistance to qualified commercially insured patients with prescription drug co-payments required by payors. The calculation of the accrual\nfor co-pay assistance is based on an estimate of claims and the cost per claim that the Company expects to receive associated with product that has been\nrecognized as revenue but remains in the distribution channel at the end of each reporting period. The adjustments are recorded in the same period the related\nrevenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a current liability, which is included as a component of accrued\nexpenses on the consolidated balance sheets.\nLicense Revenue:\nThe Company also recognizes license revenue under certain of the Company’s sub-license agreements that are within the scope of ASC 606. The terms\nof these agreements may contain multiple performance obligations, which may include licenses and research and development activities. The Company\nevaluates these agreements under ASC 606 to determine the distinct performance obligations. Non-refundable, upfront fees that are not contingent on any\nfuture performance and require no consequential continuing involvement by the Company, are recognized as revenue when the license term commences and\nthe licensed data, technology or product is delivered. The Company defers recognition of non-refundable upfront license fees if the performance obligations are\nnot satisfied.\nPrior to recognizing revenue, the Company makes estimates of the transaction price, including variable consideration that is subject to a constraint.\nAmounts of variable consideration are included in the transaction price to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative\nrevenue recognized will not occur and when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved.\nIf there are multiple distinct performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation based on its\nrelative standalone selling price. The standalone selling price is generally determined based on the prices charged to customers or using expected cost-plus\nmargin. Revenue is recognized by measuring the progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligations using an input measure.\nSince 2018, the Company has entered into sub-license agreements with certain sub-licensees in territories outside of the United States. These sub-\nlicensing agreements grant certain intellectual property rights and set forth various obligations with respect to actions such as development, pursuit and\nmaintenance of regulatory approvals, commercialization and supply of NERLYNX in the sub-licensees’ respective territories.\nLicense fees under the sub-license agreements include one-time upfront payments when each sub-license agreement was executed and potential\nadditional one-time milestone payments due to the Company upon successful completion of certain performance obligations, such as achieving regulatory\napprovals or sales target thresholds, and potential double-digit royalties on sales of the licensed product, calculated as a percentage of net sales of the licensed\nproduct throughout each sub-licensee’s respective territory.\nAs of September 30, 2024 the total potential milestone payments that would be due to the Company upon achievement of all respective performance\nobligations under the sub-license agreements is approximately $579.8 million. At this time, the Company cannot estimate if or when these milestone-related\nperformance obligations might be achieved.\nIn September 2024, the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee approved a change in existing post approval requirements for overall results\nand a reduction in sample size for the Pierre Fabre NERLYFE post-marketing study in Europe. As of September 30, 2024, there is a post-marketing liability of\n$5.0 million, and the final costs of the study are being assessed. Any adjustment to the liability will be recorded as license revenue as the original $9.0 million\nestimate in study costs were recorded as a reduction to license revenue.\nRoyalty Revenue:\nFor sub-license agreements that are within the scope of ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue when the related sales occur in accordance with the\nsales-based royalty exception under ASC 606-10-55-65.\nRoyalty revenue consists of consideration earned related to international sales of NERLYNX made by the Company’s sub-licensees in their respective\nterritories. The Company recognizes royalty revenue when the performance obligations have been satisfied. Royalty revenue was $24.4 million\nand $30.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and $4.5 million and $13.5 million for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2023, respectively.\nRoyalty Expenses:\nRoyalties incurred in connection with the Company’s license agreement with Pfizer, as disclosed in Note 12—Commitments and Contingencies, are\nexpensed to cost of sales as revenue from product sales is recognized.\n10\nTable of Contents\nResearch and Development Expenses:\nResearch and development expenses (“R&D expenses”) are charged to operations as incurred. The major components of R&D expenses include clinical\nmanufacturing costs, clinical trial expenses, consulting and other third-party costs, salaries and employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, supplies\nand materials, and allocations of various overhead costs. Clinical trial expenses include, but are not limited to, investigator fees, site costs, comparator drug\ncosts, and clinical research organization (“CRO”) costs. In the normal course of business, the Company contracts with third parties to perform various clinical\ntrial activities in the ongoing development of potential products. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and variations from contract\nto contract and may result in uneven payment flows. Payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events, the successful\nenrollment of patients and the completion of portions of the clinical trial or similar conditions. The Company’s accruals for clinical trials are based on estimates\nof the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with numerous clinical trial sites, cooperative groups and CROs. As actual costs become\nknown, the Company adjusts its accruals in that period.\nIn instances where the Company enters into agreements with third parties for clinical trials and other consulting activities, upfront amounts are recorded\nto prepaid expenses and other in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and expensed as services are performed or as the underlying goods are\ndelivered. If the Company does not expect the services to be rendered or goods to be delivered, any remaining capitalized amounts for non-refundable upfront\npayments are charged to expense immediately. Amounts due under such arrangements may be either fixed fee or fee for service, and may include upfront\npayments, monthly payments and payments upon the completion of milestones or receipt of deliverables.\nCosts related to the acquisition of technology rights and patents for which development work is still in process are charged to operations as incurred and\nconsidered a component of R&D expenses.\nAcquired In-Process Research and Development Expense:\nThe Company has acquired, and may continue to acquire, the rights to develop new drug candidates. Payments to acquire a new drug candidate are\nimmediately expensed as acquired in-process research and development provided that the drug candidate has not achieved regulatory approval for marketing\nand, absent obtaining such approval, has no alternative future use.\nStock-Based Compensation:\nStock Option Awards:\nASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation (“ASC 718”) requires the fair value of all share-based payments to employees and nonemployees,\nincluding grants of stock options, to be recognized in the statement of operations over the requisite service period. Under ASC 718, employee and nonemployee\noption grants are generally valued at the grant date and those valuations do not change once they have been established. The fair value of each option award is\nestimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Method. As allowed by ASC 718, the Company’s estimate of expected volatility is based on\nits average volatilities using its past eight years of publicly traded history. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the\nU.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant valuation. Option forfeitures are estimated when the option is granted to reduce the option expense to be\nrecognized over the life of the award. The estimated forfeiture rate considers historical employee turnover rates stratified into employee pools, actual forfeiture\nexperience and other factors. The option expense is adjusted upon the actual forfeiture of a stock option grant and the Company periodically revises the\nestimated forfeiture rate in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Due to its limited history of stock option exercises, the Company\nuses the simplified method to determine the expected life of the option grants. Compensation expense related to modified stock options is measured based on\nthe fair value for the awards as of the modification date. Any incremental compensation expense arising from the excess of the fair value of the awards on the\nmodification date compared to the fair value of the awards immediately before the modification date is recognized at the modification date or ratably over the\nrequisite service period, as appropriate.\nRestricted Stock Units:\nRSUs are valued on the grant date and the fair value of the RSUs is equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date. The\nRSU expense is recognized over the requisite service period. When the requisite service period begins prior to the grant date (because the service inception date\noccurs prior to the grant date), the Company is required to begin recognizing compensation cost before there is a measurement date (i.e., the grant date). The\nservice inception date is the beginning of the requisite service period. If the service inception date precedes the grant date, accrual of compensation cost for\nperiods before the grant date shall be based on the fair value of the award at the reporting date. In the period in which the grant date occurs, cumulative\ncompensation cost shall be adjusted to reflect the cumulative effect of measuring compensation cost based on fair value at the grant date rather than the fair\nvalue previously used at the service inception date (or any subsequent reporting date). RSU forfeitures are estimated when the RSU is granted to reduce the\nRSU expense to be recognized over the life of the award. The estimated forfeiture rate considers historical employee turnover rates stratified into employee\npools, actual forfeiture experience and other factors. The RSU expense is adjusted upon the actual forfeiture of an RSU grant and the Company periodically\nrevises the estimated forfeiture rate in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Compensation expense related to modified RSUs is\nmeasured based on the fair value for the awards as of the modification date. Any incremental compensation expense arising from the excess of the fair value of\nthe awards on the modification date compared to the fair value of the awards immediately before the modification date is recognized at the modification date or\nratably over the requisite service period, as appropriate.\n11\nTable of Contents\nWarrants:\nWarrants (see Note 10—Stockholders’ Equity) granted to employees and nonemployees are valued at the fair value of the instrument on the grant date\nand are recognized in the condensed statement of operations over the requisite service period. When the requisite service period precedes the grant date and a\nmarket condition exists in the warrant, the Company values the warrant using the Monte Carlo Simulation Method. When the terms of the warrant become\nfixed, the Company values the warrant using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Method. As allowed by ASC 718, the Company’s estimate of expected volatility\nis based on its average volatilities using its publicly traded history. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the warrant is based on the U.S.\nTreasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant valuation. In determining the value of the warrant until the terms are fixed, the Company factors in the\nprobability of the market condition occurring and several possible scenarios. When the requisite service period precedes the grant date and is deemed to be\ncomplete, the Company records the fair value of the warrant at the time of issuance as an equity stock-based compensation transaction. The grant date is\ndetermined when all pertinent information, such as exercise price and quantity are known. Compensation expense related to warrant modification is measured\nbased on the fair value of the warrant as of the modification date. Any incremental compensation expense arising from the excess of the fair value of the\nwarrant on the modification date compared to the fair value of the warrant immediately before the modification date is recognized at the modification date or\nratably over the requisite service period, as appropriate.\nIncome Taxes:\nThe Company follows ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”), which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected\nfuture tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and\nliabilities are based on the differences between the consolidated financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the\nyear in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more\nlikely than not that the asset will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in\nthe years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.\nThe standard addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the\nconsolidated financial statements. Under ASC 740, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not\nthat the tax position will be sustained on examination by the tax authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the\nconsolidated financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized\nupon ultimate settlement. ASC 740 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim\nperiods and requires increased disclosures. As of September 30, 2024 the Company’s uncertain tax position reserves include a reserve for its research and\ndevelopment credits.\nLegal Contingencies and Expense:\nFor legal contingencies, the Company accrues a liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered\nprobable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Legal fees and expenses are expensed as incurred based on invoices or estimates provided by legal\ncounsel. The Company periodically evaluates available information, both internal and external, relative to such contingencies and adjusts the accrual as\nnecessary. The Company determines whether a contingency should be disclosed by assessing whether a material loss is deemed reasonably possible. In\ndetermining whether a loss should be accrued, the Company evaluates, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability\nto make a reasonable estimate of the amount of the loss (see Note 12—Commitments and Contingencies).\nFinancial Instruments:\nThe carrying value of financial instruments, such as cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable, approximate their fair value because of\ntheir short-term nature. The carrying value of long-term debt approximates its fair value as the principal amounts outstanding are subject to variable interest\nrates that are based on market rates, which are regularly reset.\nCash and Cash Equivalents:\nThe Company classifies all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents.\nRestricted Cash:\nRestricted cash represents cash held at financial institutions that is pledged as collateral for stand-by letters of credit for lease commitments. The lease-\nrelated letters of credit will lapse at the end of the respective lease terms through 2026. At each of periods ending September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nthe Company had restricted cash in the amount of approximately $2.1 million.\nInvestment Securities:\nThe Company classifies all investment securities (short-term and long-term) as available-for-sale, as the sale of such securities may be required prior to\nmaturity to implement management’s strategies. These securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of\naccumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity until realized. Realized gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities, if any,\nare determined on a specific identification basis. In accordance with ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit\nLosses on Financial Instruments, credit losses on available-for-sale securities are reported using an expected loss model and recorded to an allowance.\nPremiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the related security as an adjustment to yield using the straight-line method. Interest income\nis recognized when earned.\n12\nTable of Contents\nAssets Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis:\nASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement (“ASC 820”) provides a single definition of fair value and a common framework for measuring fair value as\nwell as disclosure requirements for fair value measurements used in financial statements. Under ASC 820, fair value is determined based upon the exit price\nthat would be received by a company to sell an asset or paid by a company to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants,\nexclusive of any transaction costs. Fair value measurements are determined by either the principal market or the most advantageous market. The principal\nmarket is the market with the greatest level of activity and volume for the asset or liability. Absent a principal market to measure fair value, the Company uses\nthe most advantageous market, which is the market from which the Company would receive the highest selling price for the asset or pay the lowest price to\nsettle the liability, after considering transaction costs. However, when using the most advantageous market, transaction costs are only considered to determine\nwhich market is the most advantageous and these costs are then excluded when applying a fair value measurement. ASC 820 creates a three-level hierarchy to\nprioritize the inputs used in the valuation techniques to derive fair values. The basis for fair value measurements for each level within the hierarchy is described\nbelow, with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest.\nLevel 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not\nactive; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets.\nLevel 3: Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable.\nFollowing are the major categories of assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, using quoted\nprices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1), significant other observable inputs (Level 2), and significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) (in\nthousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nCash equivalents $ 14,172 $ 46,298 $ — $ 60,470\nU.S. Government 11,998 — — 11,998\nCommercial paper — 17,464 — 17,464\n$ 26,170 $ 63,762 $ — $ 89,932\nDecember 31, 2023 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nCash equivalents $ 29,068 $ 8,490 $ — $ 37,558\nU.S. Government $ 3,444 $ — $ — $ 3,444\nCommercial paper — 7,910 — 7,910\nTotals $ 32,512 $ 16,400 $ — $ 48,912\nThe Company’s investments in commercial paper and U.S. government securities are exposed to price fluctuations. The fair value measurements for\ncommercial paper and U.S. government securities are based upon the quoted prices of similar items in active markets multiplied by the number of securities\nowned.\nThe following tables summarize the Company’s cash equivalents and short-term investments (in thousands):\nMaturity Amortized Unrealized Estimated\nSeptember 30, 2024 (in years) Cost Gains Losses Fair Value\nCash equivalents $ 60,470 $ — $ — $ 60,470\nU.S. Government Less than 1 11,991 8 (1) 11,998\nCommercial paper Less than 1 17,446 23 (5) 17,464\nTotals $ 89,907 $ 31 $ (6) $ 89,932\nMaturity Amortized Unrealized Estimated\nDecember 31, 2023 (in years) Cost Gains Losses Fair Value\nCash equivalents $ 37,561 $ — $ (3) $ 37,558\nU.S. Government $ 3,443 $ 1 $ — $ 3,444\nCommercial paper Less than 1 7,912 1 (3) 7,910\nTotals $ 48,916 $ 2 $ (6) $ 48,912\nConcentration of Risk:\nFinancial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, principally consist of cash and cash equivalents,\nmarketable securities, and accounts receivable, net. The Company’s cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation and the Securities Investor Protection Corporation insured limits at September 30, 2024 were approximately $68.6 million. The Company does not\nbelieve it is exposed to any significant credit risk due to the nature of the financial instruments in which the money is held. Pursuant to the Company’s internal\ninvestment policy, investments must be rated A-1/P-1 or better by Standard and Poor’s Rating Service and Moody’s Investors Service at the time of purchase.\n13\nTable of Contents\nThe Company sells its products in the United States primarily through specialty pharmacies and specialty distributors. Therefore, wholesale distributors\nand large pharmacy chains account for a large portion of its accounts receivables, net and product revenues, net. The creditworthiness of its customers is\ncontinuously monitored, and the Company has internal policies regarding customer credit limits. The Company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts\nprimarily based on the creditworthiness of its customers, historical payment patterns, aging of receivable balances and general economic conditions.\nThe Company also sells its products to international customers through sub-licensees. Royalty revenue consists of consideration earned related to\ninternational sales of NERLYNX made by the Company’s sub-licensees in their respective territories. A majority of the Company's royalty revenue is generated\nfrom sales into the China market.\nThe Company’s success depends on its ability to successfully commercialize NERLYNX. The Company currently has a single product and limited\ncommercial sales experience, which makes it difficult to evaluate its current business, predict its future prospects and forecast financial performance and\ngrowth. The Company has invested a significant portion of its efforts and financial resources in the development and commercialization of the lead product,\nNERLYNX, and expects NERLYNX to constitute the vast majority of product revenue for the foreseeable future.\nThe Company relies exclusively on third parties to formulate and manufacture NERLYNX and its drug candidates. The commercialization of\nNERLYNX and any other drug candidates, if approved, could be stopped, delayed or made less profitable if those third parties fail to provide sufficient\nquantities of product or fail to do so at acceptable quality levels or prices. The Company has no experience in drug formulation or manufacturing and does not\nintend to establish its own manufacturing facilities. While the drug candidates were being developed by Pfizer, both the drug substance and drug product\nwere manufactured by third-party contractors. The Company is using the same third-party contractors to manufacture, supply, store and distribute drug supplies\nfor clinical trials and the commercialization of NERLYNX and intends to use third party contractors to manufacture, supply, store and distribute drug supplies\nfor its clinical trials of alisertib. If the Company is unable to continue its relationships with one or more of these third-party contractors, it could experience\ndelays in the development or commercialization efforts as it locates and qualifies new manufacturers.\nInventory:\nThe Company values its inventories at the lower of cost and estimated net realizable value. The Company determines the cost of its inventories, which\nincludes amounts related to materials and manufacturing overhead, on a first-in, first-out basis. The Company performs an assessment of the recoverability of\ncapitalized inventory during each reporting period, and it writes down any excess and obsolete inventories to their estimated realizable value in the period in\nwhich the impairment is first identified. Such impairment charges, should they occur, are recorded within cost of sales in the condensed consolidated\nstatements of operations. The determination of whether inventory costs will be realizable requires estimates by management. If actual market conditions are\nless favorable than projected by management, additional write-downs of inventory may be required.\nThe Company capitalizes inventory costs associated with the Company’s products after regulatory approval, if any, when, based on management’s\njudgment, future commercialization is considered probable, and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized. Inventory that can be used in either the\nproduction of clinical or commercial product is recorded as R&D expenses when selected for use in a clinical trial. Starter kits, provided to patients prior to\ninsurance approval, are expensed by the Company to selling, general and administrative expense as incurred.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company’s inventory balance consisted primarily of raw materials and work-in-process\npurchased subsequent to FDA approval of NERLYNX.\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nRaw materials $ 211 $ 5,693\nWork-in-process (materials, labor and overhead) 2,005 820\nFinished goods (materials, labor and overhead) 457 567\nTotal inventories $ 2,673 $ 7,080\nProperty and Equipment, Net:\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over\nthe estimated useful lives of the assets, which is generally three years for computer hardware and software, three years for phone equipment, and seven years\nfor furniture and fixtures. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the lesser of the useful life or the lease term. Upon\nretirement or sale, the cost of assets disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is\ncredited or charged to operations. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.\nThe Company reviews its long-lived assets used in operations for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying\namount of an asset may not be recoverable, as required by ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment (“ASC 360”). The Company performs a\nrecoverability test by comparing the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows over the life of the asset to its carrying value on the consolidated balance\nsheet. If the undiscounted cash flows used in the recoverability test are less than the carrying value, the Company would then determine the fair value of the\nlong-lived asset and recognize an impairment loss for the amount in excess of the carrying value.\nLeases:\nRight-of-use assets (“ROU assets”) represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the\nCompany’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. The assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on\nthe estimated present value of fixed lease payments over the lease term. ROU assets are evaluated for impairment using the long-lived assets impairment\nguidance, as required by ASC 360. A significant indication of impairment of an ROU asset would include a change in the extent or manner in which the asset is\nbeing used. The Company must make assumptions that underlie the most significant and subjective estimates in determining whether any impairment exists.\nThose estimates, and the underlying assumptions, include estimates of future cash flow utilizing market lease rates and determination of fair value. If an ROU\nasset related to an operating lease is impaired, the carrying value of the ROU asset post-impairment should be amortized on a straight-line basis through the\nearlier of the end of the useful life of the ROU asset or the end of the lease term. Post impairment, a lessee must calculate the amortization of the ROU asset\nand interest expense on the lease liability separately, although the sum of the two continues to be presented as a single lease cost. If a lease is planned to be\nabandoned with no intention of subleasing, the ROU asset should be assessed for impairment.\n14\nTable of Contents\nLeases will be classified as financing or operating, which will drive the expense recognition pattern. The Company elects to exclude short-term leases if\nand when the Company has them. For additional information, see Note 5—Leases.\nThe Company leases office space and copy machines, all of which are operating leases. Most leases include the option to renew, and the exercise of the\nrenewal options is at the Company’s sole discretion. Options to extend or terminate a lease are considered in the lease term to the extent that the option is\nreasonably certain of exercise. The leases do not include options to purchase the leased property. The depreciable life of assets and leasehold improvements is\nlimited by the expected lease term. Covenants imposed by the leases include letters of credit required to be obtained by the lessee.\nThe incremental borrowing rate (“IBR”) represents the rate of interest the Company would expect to pay on a collateralized basis to borrow an amount\nequal to the lease payments under similar terms. When determinable, the Company uses the rate implicit in the lease to determine the present value of lease\npayments. As the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the\ncommencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The Company’s average IBR for existing leases as of September 30, 2024 is 10.9%.\nLicense Fees and Intangible Assets:\nThe Company expenses amounts paid to acquire licenses associated with products under development when the ultimate recoverability of the amounts\npaid is uncertain and the technology has no alternative future use when acquired. Acquisitions of technology licenses are charged to expense or capitalized\nbased upon the asset achieving technological feasibility in accordance with management’s assessment regarding the ultimate recoverability of the amounts paid\nand the potential for alternative future use. The Company has determined that technological feasibility for its drug candidates is reached when the requisite\nregulatory approvals are obtained to make the product available for sale. The Company capitalizes technology licenses upon reaching technological feasibility.\nThe Company maintains definite-lived intangible assets related to the license agreement with Pfizer. These assets are amortized over their remaining\nuseful lives, which are estimated based on the shorter of the remaining patent life or the estimated useful life of the underlying product. Intangible assets are\namortized using the economic consumption method if anticipated future revenues can be reasonably estimated. The straight-line method is used when future\nrevenues cannot be reasonably estimated. Amortization costs are recorded as part of cost of sales.\nIn September 2022, the Company entered into an exclusive license agreement with Takeda to license the worldwide research and development and\ncommercial rights to alisertib, a selective, small-molecule, orally administered inhibitor of aurora kinase A. The up-front payment of $7.0 million was expensed\nas acquired in-process research and development as the drug candidate has not achieved regulatory approval for marketing and has no alternative future use.\nThe Company assesses its intangible assets for impairment if indicators are present or changes in circumstance suggest that impairment may exist.\nEvents that could result in an impairment, or trigger an interim impairment assessment, include the receipt of additional clinical or nonclinical data regarding\none of the Company’s drug candidates or a potentially competitive drug candidate, changes in the clinical development program for a drug candidate, or new\ninformation regarding potential sales for the drug. If impairment indicators are present or changes in circumstance suggest that impairment may exist, the\nCompany performs a recoverability test by comparing the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows of each intangible asset to its carrying value on the\nconsolidated balance sheet. If the undiscounted cash flows used in the recoverability test are less than the carrying value, the Company would determine the\nfair value of the intangible asset and recognize an impairment loss if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value. In connection with the\nFDA approval of NERLYNX in July 2017, the Company triggered a one-time milestone payment pursuant to its license agreement with Pfizer. In June 2020,\nthe Company entered into a letter agreement with Pfizer relating to the method of payment associated with a milestone payment under the Company’s license\nagreement with Pfizer (see Note 12—Commitments and Contingencies). In addition, the Company reached a commercial milestone by achieving aggregate\nworldwide net sales of $250.0 million in calendar year 2022, resulting in a payment to Pfizer of $12.5 million during the three months ended March 31,\n2023. The Company capitalized the milestones as intangible assets and is amortizing the assets to cost of sales on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful\nlife of the licensed patent through 2030. The Company recorded amortization expense related to its intangible assets of approximately $2.4 million and\n$7.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 estimated future amortization expense\nrelated to the Company’s intangible assets is approximately $2.4 million for the remainder of 2024 and $9.7 million for each year starting 2025 through 2029,\nand $2.4 million for 2030.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards:\nIn October 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-06, Disclosure Improvements – Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC’s Disclosure Update and\nSimplification Initiative. The ASU modifies the disclosure or presentation requirements of a variety of Topics in the Codification to align with the SEC’s\nregulations. The ASU also makes those requirements applicable to entities that were not previously subject to the SEC’s requirements. The ASU is effective for\nthe Company two years after the effective date to remove the related disclosure from Regulation S-X or S-K. As of the date these financial statements have\nbeen made available for issuance, the SEC has not yet removed any related disclosure. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2023-06 to have a\nmaterial effect on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The ASU requires the annual\nfinancial statements to include consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation, and income taxes paid disaggregated\nby jurisdiction. ASU 2023-09 is effective for the Company’s annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2025. Adoption is either with a prospective\nmethod or a fully retrospective method of transition. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that adoption of ASU 2023-09\nwill have on its consolidated financial statements.\nASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures requires enhanced disclosures about segment expenses\non an annual and interim basis. ASU 2023-07 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods beginning after December\n15, 2024, and early application is permitted.

Total rent\nexpense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was approximately $1.2 million and $3.7 million, respectively. For purposes of determining\nstraight-line rent expense, the lease term is calculated from the date the Company first takes possession of the facility, including any periods of free rent and\nany renewal option periods that the Company is reasonably certain of exercising. The Company’s office leases generally have contractually specified\nminimum rent and annual rent increases that are included in the measurement of the ROU asset and related lease liability. Additionally, under these lease\narrangements, the Company may be required to pay directly, or reimburse the lessors, for real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, maintenance and other\noperating costs. Such amounts are generally variable and therefore not included in the measurement of the ROU asset and related lease liability but are\ninstead recognized as variable lease expense in selling, general and administrative costs in the condensed consolidated statements of operations when they are\nincurred.\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases for the nine months ended September 30, 2024:\nOperating cash flows used for operating leases (in thousands) $ 4,839\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities —\nWeighted average remaining lease term (in years) 1.5\nWeighted average discount rate 10.9%\nFuture minimum lease payments as of September 30, 2024 were as follows (in thousands):\nAmount\n2024 $ 1,463\n2025 5,983\n2026 1,508\nTotal minimum lease payments $ 8,954\nLess: imputed interest (659)\nTotal lease liabilities $ 8,295\nIn February 2019, the Company entered into a long-term sublease agreement for 12,429 square feet of the office space in Los Angeles, California.

The Athyrium Notes were issued for face amount of $100.0 million net of an original issue discount of\n$1.5 million. The Athyrium Notes also require a 2.0% exit payment to be made on each payment of principal. The borrowings under the Athyrium Notes,\ntogether with cash on hand, were used to repay the Company’s outstanding indebtedness, including the applicable exit and prepayment fees owed to lenders\nunder its Oxford Credit Facility. The Athyrium Notes are secured by substantially all of the Company’s assets. The Company incurred $1.9 million of deferred\nfinancing costs with the borrowing.\nInterest on the Athyrium Notes is calculated in part based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), which replaced the “London Interbank\nOffering Rate” as the floating benchmark for interest rate calculations applicable to the Athyrium Notes pursuant to the terms of the Third Amendment to Note\nPurchase Agreement dated as of September 16, 2022 (the “Third Amendment”). The modification of the Note Purchase Agreement pursuant to the Third\nAmendment did not meet the requirements of a debt extinguishment under ASC Topic 470-50 - Debt Modifications and Exchanges and no gain or loss was\nrecognized. The Company performed a quantitative analysis and determined that the terms of the new debt and original debt instrument were not substantially\ndifferent. Accordingly, the Third Amendment is accounted for as a debt modification.\nFollowing the effectiveness of the Third Amendment, the Athyrium Notes bear interest at an annual rate equal to the sum of (a) eight percent (8.00%)\nplus (b) the lesser of (i) the sum of (x) three-month term SOFR for an interest period of three months plus (y) 0.26161% (26.161 basis points) and (ii) three and\none-half of one percent (3.50%) per annum. Interest is payable quarterly on the last business day of March, June, September and December each year. In the\nsecond quarter of 2024, we began paying the principal payments required to be made quarterly at 11.11% of the original face amount. The remaining balance\nwill be paid at maturity. Each principal payment also includes a 2.0% exit payment. Each quarterly principal payment approximates $11.1 million, and each\nquarterly exit fee payment approximates $0.2 million. As of September 30, 2024, the effective interest rate for the loan was 12.99%.\nAt the Company’s option, the Company may prepay the outstanding principal balance of the notes in whole or in part, subject to a prepayment fee\nof 2.0% of the amount prepaid if the prepayment occurs on or prior to the second anniversary of the issuance date of such notes, plus the present value of\nremaining interest that would have accrued through and including the second anniversary date, and 2.0% of the amount prepaid if the prepayment occurs after\nthe second anniversary but on or prior to the third anniversary of the issuance date of such notes.\nThe Athyrium Notes include affirmative and negative covenants applicable to the Company. The affirmative covenants include, among others, covenants\nrequiring the Company to maintain its legal existence and governmental approvals, deliver certain financial reports, maintain insurance coverage, and satisfy\ncertain requirements regarding deposit accounts. The negative covenants include, among others, restrictions on the Company’s transferring collateral, incurring\nadditional indebtedness, engaging in mergers or acquisitions, paying dividends or making other distributions, making investments, creating liens, selling assets\nand suffering a change in control, in each case subject to certain exceptions. The Company is also required to maintain minimum cash balances and achieve\ncertain minimum product revenue targets, measured as of the last day of each fiscal quarter on a trailing year-to-date basis. As of September 30, 2024, the\nCompany was in compliance with such covenants.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the principal balance outstanding under the Athyrium Notes was $77.8 million and exit fees were $1.5 million, representing\nall of the Company’s debt.\nThe future minimum principal and exit payments under the Athyrium Notes as of September 30, 2024 are as follows (in thousands):\nAmount\n2024 $ 11,332\n2025 45,329\n2026 22,674\nTotal $ 79,335\nDebt Issuance Costs and Discounts:\nDebt issuance costs and discounts consist of the following (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nDebt issuance costs and discounts (Athyrium Notes) $ 5,410 $ 5,410\nLess: accumulated amortization (4,149) (3,066)\nIncluded in long-term debt $ 1,261 $ 2,344\nDebt issuance costs and discounts are financing costs related to the Company’s outstanding debt. Amortization of debt issuance costs is expensed using\nthe effective interest method and is included in interest expense in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. For the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Company recorded approximately $0.2 million and $0.7 million of interest expense, respectively.

The Company’s contractual obligations result primarily from obligations for various contract\nmanufacturing organizations and clinical research organizations, which include potential payments we may be required to make under our agreements. The\ncontracts also contain variable costs and milestones that are hard to predict as they are based on such things as patients enrolled and clinical trial sites. The\ntiming of payments and actual amounts paid under contract manufacturing organization (“CMO”) and CRO agreements may be different depending on the\ntiming of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon terms or amounts for some obligations. Also, those agreements are cancelable upon written\nnotice by the Company and, therefore, not long-term liabilities.\nLicense Agreements:\nPfizer License Agreement\nIn August 2011, the Company entered into an agreement pursuant to which Pfizer agreed to grant it a worldwide license for the development,\nmanufacture and commercialization of PB272 (neratinib, oral), PB272 (neratinib, intravenous) and PB357, and certain related compounds. The license is\nexclusive with respect to certain patent rights owned by or licensed to Pfizer. Under the agreement, the Company is obligated to commence a new clinical trial\nfor a product containing one of these compounds within a specified period of time and to use commercially reasonable efforts to complete clinical trials and to\nachieve certain milestones as provided in a development plan. From the closing date of the agreement through December 31, 2011, Pfizer continued to conduct\nthe existing clinical trials on behalf of the Company at Pfizer’s sole expense. At the Company’s request, Pfizer agreed to continue to perform certain services in\nsupport of the existing clinical trials at the Company’s expense. These services would continue through the completion of the transitioned clinical trials. The\nlicense agreement “capped” the out-of-pocket expense the Company would incur to complete the then existing clinical trials. All agreed upon costs incurred by\nthe Company above the “cost cap” would be reimbursed by Pfizer. The Company exceeded the “cost cap” during the fourth quarter of 2012. In accordance with\nthe license agreement, the Company billed Pfizer for agreed upon costs above the “cost cap” until December 31, 2013.\nOn July 18, 2014, the Company entered into an amendment to the license agreement with Pfizer. The amendment amends the agreement to (1) reduce\nthe royalty rate payable by the Company to Pfizer on sales of licensed products; (2) release Pfizer from its obligation to pay for certain out-of-pocket costs\nincurred or accrued on or after January 1, 2014 to complete certain ongoing clinical studies; and (3) provide that Pfizer and the Company will continue to\ncooperate to effect the transfer to the Company of certain records, regulatory filings, materials and inventory controlled by Pfizer as promptly as reasonably\npracticable.\nAs consideration for the license, the Company is required to make substantial payments upon the achievement of certain milestones totaling\napproximately $187.5 million if all such milestones are achieved. In connection with the FDA approval of NERLYNX in July of 2017, the Company triggered\na one-time milestone payment pursuant to the agreement. In June 2020, the Company entered into a letter agreement (the “Letter Agreement”) with Pfizer\nrelating to the method of payment associated with a one-time milestone payment under the license agreement with Pfizer. The Letter Agreement permitted the\nCompany to make the milestone payment in installments with the remaining amount payable to Pfizer (including interest). The milestone\npayment accrued interest at 6.25% per annum. The milestone payment including accrued interest of $1.8 million was paid in full in September 2021. In\naddition, the Company reached a commercial milestone by achieving aggregate worldwide net sales of $250.0 million in calendar year 2022, resulting in a\npayment to Pfizer of $12.5 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023. The Company capitalized the milestones as intangible assets and is\namortizing the assets to cost of sales on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the licensed patent through 2030. Should the Company\ncommercialize any more of the compounds licensed from Pfizer or any products containing any of these compounds, the Company will be obligated to pay to\nPfizer annual royalties at a fixed rate in the low-to-mid teens of net sales of all such products, subject to certain reductions and offsets in some circumstances.\nThe Company’s royalty obligation continues, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, until the later of (1) the last to expire licensed patent\ncovering the applicable licensed product in such country, or (2) the earlier of generic competition for such licensed product reaching a certain level in such\ncountry or expiration of a certain time period after first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country. In the event that the Company sub-licenses\nthe rights granted to the Company under the license agreement with Pfizer to a third party, the same milestone and royalty payments are required. The\nCompany can terminate the license agreement at will, or for safety concerns, in each case upon specified advance notice.\nTakeda License Agreement\nIn September 2022, the Company entered into an exclusive license agreement with Takeda to license the worldwide research and development and\ncommercial rights to alisertib, a selective, small-molecule, orally administered inhibitor of aurora kinase A. Under the terms of the exclusive license agreement,\nthe Company will assume sole responsibility for the global development and commercialization of alisertib. Takeda received an upfront license fee of $7.0\nmillion in October 2022 and is eligible to receive potential future milestone payments of up to $287.3 million upon the Company’s achievement of certain\nregulatory and commercial milestones over the course of the exclusive license agreement, as well as tiered royalty payments for any net sales of alisertib.\nLegal Proceedings:\nThe Company and certain of its executive officers were named as defendants in the lawsuits detailed below. The Company records a liability in the\nconsolidated financial statements for loss contingencies when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the\nreasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the\nrange is accrued. If a loss is reasonably possible but not known or probable, and can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed.\nWhen determining the estimated loss or range of loss, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded.\n22\nTable of Contents\nLegal Malpractice Suit\nOn September 17, 2020, the Company filed a lawsuit against Hedrick Gardner Kincheloe & Garofalo, L.L.P. and David L. Levy, the attorneys who\npreviously represented the Company in Eshelman v. Puma Biotechnology, Inc., et al. in the Superior Court of Mecklenburg County, North Carolina. The\nCompany is alleging legal malpractice based on the defendants’ negligent handling of the defense of the Company in Eshelman v. Puma Biotechnology, Inc., et\nal. The Company is seeking recovery of the entire amount awarded in Eshelman v. Puma Biotechnology, Inc., et al. and all legal fees and expenses incurred in\nappealing from the judgment and retrying the damages phase of the trial. On November 23, 2020, the defendant filed an answer to the complaint denying the\nallegations of negligence. On August 19, 2022, the Company filed a voluntary dismissal of the legal malpractice action, without prejudice, to allow\nthe Eshelman v. Puma Biotechnology, Inc., et al. to conclude before proceedings. On June 2, 2023, the Company re-filed the lawsuit against Hedrick Gardner\nKincheloe & Garofalo, L.L.P. and David L. Levy, the attorneys who previously represented the Company in Eshelman v. Puma Biotechnology, Inc., et al. in the\nSuperior Court of Mecklenburg County, North Carolina. On August 22, 2023, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the case. These motions were presented\nat a hearing on February 20, 2024. The Superior Court Judge granted the motions to dismiss on March 20, 2024. The Company appealed this ruling to the\nNorth Carolina Court of Appeals.\nPatent-Related Proceedings\nAstraZeneca Litigation\nOn September 22, 2021, the Company filed suit against AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals, LP, AstraZeneca AB, and AstraZeneca PLC for infringement of\nUnited States Patent Nos. 10,603,314 (“the ‘314 patent”) and 10,596,162 (“the ‘162 patent”) (Puma Biotechnology, Inc. et al. v. AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals\nLP et al., 1:21CV01338 (D. Del. Sep. 22, 2021)). The Company’s complaint alleges that AstraZeneca’s commercial manufacture, use, offer for sale, sale,\ndistribution, and/or importation of Tagrisso® (osimertinib) products for the treatment of gefitinib and/or erlotinib-resistant non-small cell lung cancer infringes\nthe ‘314 and ‘162 patents. The Company is an exclusive licensee of the ‘314 and ‘162 patents under the Pfizer Agreement. Wyeth is a co-plaintiff. Plaintiffs\nseek a judgment that AstraZeneca’s product infringes the asserted patents and an award of monetary damages in an amount to be proven at trial. AstraZeneca\nAB and AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP filed an answer and counterclaims on November 5, 2021, including claims challenging the asserted patents as not\ninfringed and/or invalid, and accusing plaintiffs of unclean hands and patent misuse. The parties stipulated to dismiss AstraZeneca PLC as a defendant and\nPfizer as a Counterclaim Defendant on December 10, 2021, which the Court so ordered on December 13, 2021. The Company filed its answer to AstraZeneca’s\ncounterclaims on December 17, 2021, denying those claims. The case was reassigned to visiting Judge Matthew Kennelly of the Northern District of Illinois. A\nMarkman Hearing was conducted on March 17, 2023, and the Court issued its claim construction decision on March 29, 2023. Fact discovery closed on May\n19, 2023, and expert discovery closed on November 17, 2023. The Court denied the parties’ respective motions for summary judgment and Daubert motions,\nother than to clarify that Plaintiffs’ damages cannot extend to any time period before the asserted patents were issued. The Court granted AstraZeneca’s motion\nto dismiss the Company as a Plaintiff on constitutional standing grounds but denied the motion to dismiss Wyeth as a Plaintiff on constitutional standing\ngrounds. On April 29, 2024, the Court granted AstraZeneca’s motion to dismiss AstraZeneca’s counterclaims against the Company, which removed the\nCompany from the case. Wyeth remained in the case as a Plaintiff and counterclaim-defendant. Under the Company’s worldwide exclusive license agreement\nwith Pfizer, Inc. (the parent of Wyeth) as amended, the Company also maintains contractual rights to recover monetary damages in the AstraZeneca litigation,\nand those contractual rights are unaffected by the court’s March 18, 2024 and April 29, 2024 orders. A jury trial was held May 13-17, 2024. The jury found in\nfavor of Wyeth and against AstraZeneca. In particular, the jury found that use of Tagrisso® according to each of the three FDA-approved indications infringes\nthe asserted claims of the ‘314 and ‘162 patents, and that AstraZeneca induces that infringement. The jury further rejected AstraZeneca’s challenges to the\nvalidity of the patents, finding that they are not invalid. The jury awarded damages to Wyeth for past acts of infringement through December 31, 2023, in the\namount of $107,500,000. A separate bench trial related to certain equitable claims and defenses raised by AstraZeneca was held before Judge Kennelly on June\n20 and 25, 2024. On August 6, 2024, Judge Kennelly issued his ruling on the issues that were tried in the bench trial, finding for Wyeth and against\nAstraZeneca on all claims and defenses. The Court found that AstraZeneca had not proved its claim that Wyeth’s asserted patents were invalid as indefinite, or\nthat Wyeth had committed acts that would give rise to findings of unclean hands, implied waiver, or patent misuse. AstraZeneca has filed a motion challenging\nthe jury’s verdict and requesting a new trial. Wyeth has filed a motion requesting supplemental damages for past infringement from January 1, 2024, through\nthe date of judgment; pre-and-post judgment interest, and ongoing royalties through the remaining term of the patents. Briefing on these motions from both\nsides was completed on July 16, 2024. On August 14, 2024, Judge Kennelly ruled on AstraZeneca’s motion challenging the jury’s verdict, granting it in part\nand denying it in part. The Court granted AstraZeneca’s motion for judgment as a matter of law that the '314 and '162 patents are invalid under 35 U.S.C. § 112\nfor lacking enablement and adequate written description as to a particular claim limitation. In all other respects, the Court denied AstraZeneca’s motion. The\nCourt entered its final and appealable judgment accordingly. The Company respectfully disagrees with the Court’s ruling regarding invalidity with respect to\nthe particular claim limitation. Wyeth filed a notice of appeal on September 12, 2024 appealing the District Court’s judgment as a matter of law, as well as\nother rulings and opinions of the Court adverse to Wyeth.\nAcebright China Litigation\nOn January 18, 2022, Shanghai Acebright Pharmaceuticals Group Co., Ltd. (“Acebright”) filed an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”) with the\nNational Medical Products Administration in China (“NMPA”) seeking approval to market a generic version of the Company’s NERLYNX® (neratinib) tablet,\n40mg in China.

ZL201410082103.7, ZL201080060546.6, and ZL200880118789.3 (the “’789 patent” and\ncollectively, the “NERLYNX® Patents”), alleging in a Type 4.2 patent declaration that its generic version of NERLYNX does not fall within the scope of the\nclaims of NERLYNX® Patents listed in the Chinese Orange Book. The patent declaration of Acebright was published in the Chinese Orange Book on January\n19, 2022. On March 2, 2022, the Company filed petitions with the China National Intellectual Property Administration (“CNIPA”) and requested administrative\ndetermination that Acebright’s generic neratinib tablet falls within the scope of the claims of NERLYNX® Patents listed in the Chinese Orange Book. The\nCompany’s request for administrative determination was accepted by CNIPA on March 18, 2022. The Company has notified NMPA of the acceptance of the\nrequest for administrative determination for NMPA to institute a stay of Acebright’s ANDA for nine months. On July 11, 2022, CNIPA decided that claims 5\nand 6 of Patent No. ZL200880118789.3 are not eligible for registration in the Chinese Orange Book on the ground that these two pharmaceutical method-of-\nuse claims fall within the scope of “patents of crystalline forms,” which are not eligible for listing in the Chinese Orange Book. On September 9, 2022, CNIPA\ndecided that the generic drug in Acebright’s ANDA does not fall within the protection scope of claims 1, 3, 5 and 6 of Patent No. ZL201410082103.7 and\nclaims 1-4, 7 and 9-13 of Patent No. ZL201080060546.6. The three CNIPA administrative decisions on NERLYNX® Patents have lifted the stay of Acebright’s\nANDA by NMPA. The Company has appealed each CNIPA administrative decision in January 2023 at the Beijing Intellectual Property Court (“BJIPC”). The\nthree appeals were accepted by BJIPC on February 20, 2023. The Company also filed three civil complaints based on the three NERLYNX® Patents against\nAcebright with the BJIPC in July 2022 and requested court determination that Acebright’s generic neratinib tablet falls within the scope of the claims of\nNERLYNX® Patents. On May 6, 2023, the Company withdrew two civil lawsuits and two appeals in relation to Chinese Patent Nos. ZL201410082103.7 and\nZL201080060546.6 at the BJIPC. On May 24, 2023, the BJIPC accepted the Company’s withdrawal request. On July 24, 2023, the Company withdrew the one\nremaining civil lawsuit and one appeal in relation to Chinese Patent No. ZL200880118789.3 at the BJIPC. On August 15, 2023, the BJIPC accepted the\nCompany’s withdrawal request. On September 12, 2023, the NMPA approved Acebright’s ANDA to market a generic version of the Company’s NERLYNX®\nin China with the approval number of GuoYaoZhunZi H20234141.\n23\nTable of Contents\nOn December 28, 2023, the Company filed a civil lawsuit against Acebright for infringement of the ’789 patent under Article 11 of the Chinese Patent\nLaw before Jiangsu Nanjing Intermediate People’s Court. The Company’s complaint alleges that Acebright’s offer for sale of a generic version of the\nCompany’s NERLYNX® product infringes the ’789 patent. The Company seeks a judgment that Acebright’s product infringes the ’789 patent and Acebright’s\nact of offer for sale shall be enjoined. On January 2, 2024, Jiangsu Nanjing Intermediate People’s Court accepted the civil complaint. An oral hearing was held\non June 19, 2024, during which the Company amended its complaint to allege that Acebright making, selling and offering to sell the generic version of\nNERLYNX® infringes the ’789 patent.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed\nconsolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in Item 1 in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, (this “Quarterly Report”). The following\ndiscussion should also be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and “Management’s Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nUnless otherwise provided in this Quarterly Report, references to the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Puma Biotechnology, Inc., a Delaware\ncorporation, together with its wholly owned subsidiary.\nOverview\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company that develops and commercializes innovative products to enhance cancer care and improve treatment outcomes for\npatients. We are currently commercializing NERLYNX®, an oral version of neratinib, for the treatment of certain HER2-positive breast cancers. Additionally,\nin 2022, we in-licensed and became responsible for the global development and commercialization of alisertib. Alisertib is a selective, small-molecule inhibitor\nof aurora kinase A that is designed to disrupt mitosis leading to apoptosis of rapidly proliferating tumor cells that are dependent on aurora kinase A. Prior to our\nlicensing alisertib from Takeda, alisertib was tested in over 1,300 patients who were treated across 22 company-sponsored trials resulting in a large, well-\ncharacterized clinical safety database. Based on information in this database, we believe alisertib has potential application in the treatment of a range of\ndifferent cancer types, including hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, triple-negative breast cancer and small cell lung cancer. We intend to pursue\ndevelopment of alisertib initially in small cell lung cancer and hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.\nNERLYNX is currently approved in the United States for two indications: the extended adjuvant treatment of adult patients with early stage HER2-\noverexpressed/amplified breast cancer following adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy and for use in combination with capecitabine for the treatment of adult\npatients with advanced or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens in the metastatic setting.\nWe currently market NERLYNX in the United States using our direct specialty sales force consisting of approximately 38 sales specialists. Our sales\nspecialists are supported by an experienced sales leadership team consisting of several regional business leaders and a VP of sales as well as experienced\nprofessionals in marketing, managed markets, access and reimbursement, market research, and sales planning and operations. Outside the United States, we\nseek to enter into exclusive sub-license agreements with third parties to pursue regulatory approval, if necessary, and commercialize NERLYNX, if approved.\nAs of September 30, 2024, NERLYNX has received approval for the treatment of certain patients with extended adjuvant or metastatic HER2-positive breast\ncancer in over 40 countries outside the United States. We are currently party to several sub-licenses in various regions outside the United States, including\nEurope (excluding Russia and Ukraine), Australia, Canada, China, Southeast Asia, Israel, South Korea, and various countries and territories in Central America,\nSouth America, Africa and the Middle East.\nIn September 2022, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Takeda to license the worldwide research and development and commercial\nrights to alisertib. Alisertib is an investigational, reversible, ATP-competitive inhibitor that is designed to be highly selective for aurora kinase A. Inhibition of\naurora kinase A can lead to disruption of mitotic spindle apparatus assembly, disruption of chromosome segregation, and inhibition of cell proliferation. In\nclinical trials to date, alisertib has shown single agent activity and activity in combination with other cancer drugs in the treatment of many different types of\ncancers, including hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, small cell lung cancer and head and neck cancer. We initiated the\nALISertib in CAncer (ALISCA™ -Lung1) Phase II trial (PUMA-ALI-4201) of alisertib monotherapy for the treatment of patients with extensive stage small\ncell lung cancer in February 2024, and we plan to commence the ALISCA™ -Breast1 Phase II trial (PUMA-ALI-1201) in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n.\nUnder the terms of the exclusive license agreement, we assumed sole responsibility for the global development and commercialization of alisertib. We\npaid Takeda an upfront license fee of $7.0 million in October 2022, and it is eligible to receive potential future milestone payments of up to $287.3 million\nupon our achievement of certain regulatory and commercial milestones over the course of the exclusive license agreement, as well as tiered royalty payments\nfor any net sales of alisertib. We recorded in-process research and development expense of $7.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 in\nconnection with the up-front payment related to the asset acquisition. As of September 30, 2024, no milestones had been accrued as the underlying\ncontingencies were not probable or estimable.\nOur expenses to date have been related to hiring staff, commencing company-sponsored clinical trials and the build out of our corporate infrastructure\nand, since 2017, the commercial launch of NERLYNX. Accordingly, our success depends not only on the safety and efficacy of our drug candidates, but also\non our ability to finance product development. To date, our major sources of working capital have been proceeds from product and license revenue, public\nofferings of our common stock, proceeds from our credit facility and sales of our common stock in private placements. We intend to satisfy our near-term\nliquidity requirements through a combination of our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024, and proceeds that\nwill become available to us through product sales, royalties and sub-license milestone payments. However, this intention is based on assumptions that may\nprove to be wrong. Changes may occur that would consume our available capital faster than anticipated, including changes in and progress of our development\nactivities, the impact of commercialization efforts, acquisitions of additional drug candidates and changes in regulation. Some of these developments have had\nand may continue to have an adverse effect on our revenue and thus could have an adverse effect on our ability to satisfy the minimum revenue and cash\nbalance covenants contained in the Athyrium Notes.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nAs of the date of the filing of this Quarterly Report, we believe there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates\nduring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from our accounting policies at December 31, 2023, as reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nfiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\n25\nTable of Contents\nSummary of Income and Expenses\nProduct revenue, net:\nProduct revenue, net consists of revenue from sales of NERLYNX. We sell NERLYNX to a limited number of specialty pharmacies and specialty\ndistributors in the United States. We record revenue at the net sales price, which includes an estimate for variable consideration for which reserves are\nestablished. Variable consideration consists of trade discounts and allowances, product returns, provider chargebacks and discounts, government rebates and\nother incentives.\nProduct revenue also consists of product sales under sub-license agreements to our sub-licensees, who then sell into their respective international\nterritories.\nLicense revenue:\nLicense revenue consists of consideration earned for performance obligations satisfied pursuant to our sub-license agreements.\nIn September 2024, the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee approved a change in existing post approval requirements for overall results\nand a reduction in sample size for the Pierre Fabre NERLYFE post-marketing study in Europe. As of September 30, 2024, there is a post-marketing liability of\n$5.0 million, and the final costs of the study are being assessed. Any adjustment to the liability will be recorded as license revenue as the original $9.0 million\nestimate in study costs were recorded as a reduction to license revenue.\nRoyalty revenue:\nRoyalty revenue consists of consideration earned related to product sales made by our sub-licensees in their respective territories pursuant to our sub-\nlicense agreements.\nCost of sales:\nCost of sales consists of third-party manufacturing costs, freight, and indirect overhead costs associated with sales of NERLYNX. Cost of product sales\nalso includes period costs related to royalty charges payable to Pfizer, the amortization of milestone payments made under our license agreement with Pfizer,\ncertain inventory manufacturing services, inventory adjustment charges, unabsorbed manufacturing and overhead costs, and manufacturing variances.

We incurred approximately $0.4 million\nin related costs, which include severance payments and insurance premiums. These costs were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023. All payments related to\nthis plan were paid as of March 31, 2024.\nOperating Activities:\nCash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $23.3 million and consisted of net income of approximately\n$11.0 million, adjusted for non-cash items of approximately $15.1 million, including stock-based compensation of $6.5 million, depreciation and amortization\nof $8.7 million and provision for credit loss of $0.1 million. Total changes in cash flows from operations were due to a decrease in working capital, primarily\nrelated to an increase in accounts receivable of approximately $6.7 million (primarily sales to China) and a decrease in accrued expenses and other of\napproximately $2.1 million, partially offset by a decrease in inventory of $4.4 million (primarily sales to China) and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other\nof $2.4 million.\nCash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $16.6 million and consisted of net income of approximately\n$9.3 million, offset by a decrease of approximately $17.6 million of non-cash items. These non-cash items included stock-based compensation, depreciation\nand amortization, provision for credit loss and loss on impairment of asset. In addition, there were decreases in cash flows from operations due to a decrease in\naccrued expenses and other of approximately $18.9 million, which included an $8.0 million payment related to the Eshelman litigation settlement, net, a\ndecrease of $3.3 million in variable consideration and $2.5 million in the employee bonus accrual, and a net decrease of $4.0 million in our Pfizer royalty\naccrual. Additional decreases in cash flows were due to a decrease in our post-marketing commitment liability of approximately $0.7 million, a decrease of\n$1.4 million in accounts payable and an increase of $1.2 million in inventory. These decreases in cash flows were partially offset by increases in cash flows due\nto a decrease of $10.9 million in accounts receivable from collections and a decrease of $1.4 million in prepaid and other expenses. The decrease of\n$0.4 million in other current assets was due to receipt of CARES Act funds, partially offset by an increase of a $1.7 million receivable from a vendor related to\ndamaged inventory.\nInvesting Activities:\nCash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately $18.1 million, compared to net cash used\nin investing activities of approximately $11.0 million for the same period in 2023. Cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the purchase of\navailable-for-sale securities of approximately $61.0 million, offset by the maturity of available-for-sale securities of approximately $42.9 million.\nCash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was approximately $11.0 million. Cash used in investing activities was\nprimarily due to the purchase of the intangible asset of $12.5 million, and the purchase of available-for-sale securities of approximately $12.5 million, offset by\nthe maturity of available-for-sale securities of approximately $14.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nFinancing Activities:\nCash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately $22.5 million. Of this amount, $22.7 million related\nto the payment of principal, as well as exit fees, on our debt with Athyrium, partially offset by approximately $0.2 million of proceeds from employee stock\noptions exercised.\nThere was no cash provided by or used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nAthyrium Note Purchase Agreement:\nWe issued senior notes for an aggregate principal amount of $100.0 million pursuant to the note purchase agreement dated July 23, 2021, by us, and our\nsubsidiaries, and Athyrium, as Administrative Agent, and certain other investor parties (the “Note Purchase Agreement”), with an initial maturity date of July\n23, 2026 (the “Athyrium Notes”). The Athyrium Notes were issued for face amount of $100.0 million net of an original issue discount of $1.5 million. The\nAthyrium Notes also require a 2.0% exit payment to be made on each payment of principal. The borrowings under the Athyrium Notes, together with cash on\nhand, were used to repay our outstanding indebtedness, including the applicable exit and prepayment fees owed to lenders under our prior Oxford Credit\nFacility. The Athyrium Notes are secured by substantially all of our assets. We incurred $1.9 million of deferred financing costs with the initial borrowing of\nthe Athyrium Notes.\n30\nTable of Contents\nInterest on the Athyrium Notes is calculated in part based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), which replaced the “London Interbank\nOffering Rate” as the floating benchmark for interest rate calculations applicable to the Athyrium Notes pursuant to the terms of the Third Amendment to the\nNote Purchase Agreement dated as of September 16, 2022 (the “Third Amendment”). The modification of the Note Purchase Agreement pursuant to the Third\nAmendment did not meet the requirements of a debt extinguishment under ASC 470-50 - Debt Modifications and Exchanges and no gain or loss was\nrecognized. We performed a quantitative analysis and determined that the terms of the new debt and original debt instrument are not substantially different.\nAccordingly, the Third Amendment is accounted for as a debt modification.\nFollowing the effectiveness of the Third Amendment, the Athyrium Notes bear interest at an annual rate equal to the sum of (a) eight percent (8.00%)\nplus (b) the lesser of (i) the sum of (x) three-month term SOFR for an interest period of three months plus (y) 0.26161% (26.161 basis points) and (ii) three and\none-half of one percent (3.50%) per annum. Interest is payable quarterly on the last business day of March, June, September and December each year. In the\nsecond quarter of 2024, we began paying the principal payments required to be made quarterly at 11.11% of the original face amount. The remaining balance\nwill be paid at maturity. Each principal payment also includes a 2.0% exit payment. Each quarterly principal payment approximates $11.1 million, and each\nquarterly exit fee payment approximates $0.2 million. As of September 30, 2024, the effective interest rate for the loan was 12.99%.\nAt our option, we may prepay the outstanding principal balance of the notes in whole or in part, subject to a prepayment fee of 2.0% of the amount\nprepaid if the prepayment occurs on or prior to the second anniversary of the issuance date of such notes, plus the present value of remaining interest that\nwould have accrued through and including the second anniversary date, and 2.0% of the amount prepaid if the prepayment occurs after the second anniversary\nbut on or prior to the third anniversary of the issuance date of such notes.\nThe Athyrium Notes include affirmative and negative covenants applicable to us. The affirmative covenants include, among others, covenants requiring\nus to maintain our legal existence and governmental approvals, deliver certain financial reports, maintain insurance coverage, and satisfy certain requirements\nregarding deposit accounts. The negative covenants include, among others, restrictions on our transferring collateral, incurring additional indebtedness,\nengaging in mergers or acquisitions, paying dividends or making other distributions, making investments, creating liens, selling assets and suffering a change in\ncontrol, in each case subject to certain exceptions. We are also required to maintain minimum cash balances and achieve certain minimum product revenue\ntargets, measured as of the last day of each fiscal quarter on a trailing year-to-date basis.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the principal balance outstanding under the Athyrium Notes was $77.8 million representing all of our debt. We are in\ncompliance with all applicable covenants under the Athyrium Notes.\nCurrent and Future Financing Needs:\nWe did not receive or record any product revenue until the third quarter of 2017. We have spent, and expect to continue to spend, substantial amounts in\nconnection with implementing our business strategy, including our planned product development efforts, our clinical trials, our R&D efforts and our\ncommercialization efforts.\nWe may choose to begin new R&D efforts, or we may choose to launch additional marketing efforts. For example, we in-licensed alisertib from Takeda\nin 2022 and assumed sole responsibility for its global development and commercialization. These efforts will require funding in addition to the cash and cash\nequivalents totaling approximately $67.3 million and approximately $29.5 million in marketable securities available at September 30, 2024. While our\nconsolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, we may incur significant losses in the future and will need to generate\nsignificant revenue to sustain operations and successfully commercialize neratinib and develop alisertib. While we have been successful in raising financing in\nthe past, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future. Our ability to obtain funding may be adversely impacted by uncertain market\nconditions, our success in commercializing neratinib, our success in developing alisertib, unfavorable decisions of regulatory authorities or adverse clinical trial\nresults. The outcome of these matters cannot be predicted at this time. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities as of\nSeptember 30, 2024, and proceeds that will become available to us through product sales and sub-license payments are sufficient to satisfy our operating cash\nand capital needs for at least one year after the filing of this Quarterly Report.\nIn addition, we have based our estimate of capital needs on assumptions that may prove to be wrong. Changes may occur that would consume our\navailable capital faster than anticipated, including changes in and progress of our development activities, the impact of commercialization efforts, acquisitions\nof additional drug candidates and changes in regulation. Potential sources of financing include strategic relationships, public or private sales of equity or debt\nand other sources of funds. We may seek to access the public or private equity markets when conditions are favorable due to our long-term capital\nrequirements. If we raise funds by selling additional shares of common stock or other securities convertible into common stock, the ownership interests of our\nexisting stockholders will be diluted. If we are not able to obtain financing when needed, we may be unable to carry out our business plan. As a result, we may\nhave to significantly limit our operations, and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially harmed. In such an event, we will\nbe required to undertake a thorough review of our programs, and the opportunities presented by such programs, and allocate our resources in the manner most\nprudent.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to our operating results, as calculated in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) we use certain non-GAAP\nfinancial measures when planning, monitoring, and evaluating our operational performance. The following table presents our net (loss) income and net (loss)\nincome per share, as calculated in accordance with GAAP, as adjusted to remove the impact of stock-based compensation. For the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, stock-based compensation represented approximately 7.0% and 6.3% of our operating expenses, respectively, compared to 7.4% and 7.3%\nfor the same respective periods in 2023, in each case excluding cost of sales. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to\nenhance understanding of our financial performance, are more indicative of our operational performance and facilitate a better comparison among fiscal\nperiods. These non-GAAP financial measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for GAAP reporting measures.\n31\nTable of Contents\nReconciliation of GAAP Net (Loss) Income to Non-GAAP Adjusted Net (Loss) Income and\nGAAP Net (Loss) Income Per Share to Non-GAAP Adjusted Net (Loss) Income Per Share\n(in thousands except share and per share data)\nFor the Three Months Ended For the Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nGAAP net income $ 20,317 $ 5,796 $ 10,973 $ 9,323\nAdjustments:\nStock-based compensation -\nSelling, general and administrative (1) 1,442 1,794 4,328 5,424\nResearch and development (2) 612 751 2,165 2,391\nNon-GAAP adjusted net income $ 22,371 $ 8,341 $ 17,466 $ 17,138\nGAAP net income per share—basic $ 0.41 $ 0.12 $ 0.23 $ 0.20\nAdjustment to net income (as detailed above) 0.05 0.06 0.13 0.16\nNon-GAAP adjusted basic net income per share $ 0.46 (3) $ 0.18 (4) $ 0.36 (3) $ 0.36 (4)\nGAAP net income per share—diluted $ 0.41 $ 0.12 $ 0.22 $ 0.20\nAdjustment to net income (as detailed above) 0.04 0.05 0.14 0.16\nNon-GAAP adjusted diluted net income per share $ 0.45 (5) $ 0.17 (6) $ 0.36 (5) $ 0.36 (6)\n(1) To reflect a non-cash charge to operating expense for selling, general, and administrative stock-based compensation.\n(2) To reflect a non-cash charge to operating expense for research and development stock-based compensation.\n(3) Non-GAAP adjusted basic net income per share was calculated based on 49,008,464 and 48,498,579 weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding\nfor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.\n(4) Non-GAAP adjusted basic net income per share was calculated based on 47,520,338 and 46,977,127 weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding\nfor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\n(5) Non-GAAP adjusted diluted net income per share was calculated based on 49,173,361 and 49,025,103 weighted-average shares of common stock\noutstanding for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.\n(6) Non-GAAP adjusted diluted net income per share was calculated based on 47,819,234 and 47,397,209 weighted-average shares of common stock\noutstanding for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any “off-balance sheet arrangements,” as defined by SEC regulations.\nContractual Obligations\nThere have been no material changes outside the ordinary course of business to our contractual obligations and commitments as described in\n“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December\n31, 2023.\n32\nTable of Contents\nItem 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nSome of the securities that we invest in have market risk in that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the cash\nequivalents to fluctuate. Financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash\nequivalents. We invested our excess cash primarily in cash equivalents such as money market investments as of September 30, 2024. The primary objectives of\nour investment activities are to ensure liquidity and to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our cash and cash\nequivalents without significantly increasing risk. Additionally, we established guidelines regarding approved investments and maturities of investments, which\nare designed to maintain safety and liquidity.\nBecause of the short-term maturities of our cash equivalents, we do not believe that a 10% increase in interest rates would have a material effect on the\nrealized value of our cash equivalents.\nWe also have interest rate exposure as a result of borrowings outstanding under the Athyrium Notes. As of September 30, 2024 the aggregate outstanding\nprincipal amounts of the Athyrium Notes was $77.8 million. The Athyrium Notes bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 8.00% plus the adjusted\nthree-month term SOFR and the lesser of (a) the sum of (i) three-month term SOFR and (ii) 0.26161% (26.161 basis points) and (b) three and one-half of one\npercent (3.50%) per annum. If overall interest rates had increased by one hundred basis points during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, our interest\nexpense would have increased by $0.8 million.\nItem 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange\nAct, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the timelines specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and\ncommunicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding\nrequired disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter\nhow well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and in reaching a reasonable level of\nassurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have\nevaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)), as of September 30, 2024. Based on that\nevaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected,\nor are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n33\nTable of Contents\nPART II – OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nLegal Malpractice Suit\nOn September 17, 2020, the Company filed a lawsuit against Hedrick Gardner Kincheloe & Garofalo, L.L.P. and David L. Levy, the attorneys who\npreviously represented the Company in Eshelman v. Puma Biotechnology, Inc., et al. in the Superior Court of Mecklenburg County, North Carolina. The\nCompany is alleging legal malpractice based on the defendants’ negligent handling of the defense of the Company in Eshelman v. Puma Biotechnology, Inc., et\nal. The Company is seeking recovery of the entire amount awarded in Eshelman v. Puma Biotechnology, Inc., et al. and all legal fees and expenses incurred in\nappealing from the judgment and retrying the damages phase of the trial. On November 23, 2020, the defendant filed an answer to the complaint denying the\nallegations of negligence. On August 19, 2022, the Company filed a voluntary dismissal of the legal malpractice action, without prejudice, to allow\nthe Eshelman v. Puma Biotechnology, Inc., et al. to conclude before proceedings. On June 2, 2023, the Company re-filed the lawsuit against Hedrick Gardner\nKincheloe & Garofalo, L.L.P. and David L. Levy, the attorneys who previously represented the Company in Eshelman v. Puma Biotechnology, Inc., et al. in the\nSuperior Court of Mecklenburg County, North Carolina. On August 22, 2023, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the case. These motions were presented\nat a hearing on February 20, 2024. The Superior Court Judge granted the motions to dismiss on March 20, 2024. The Company appealed this ruling to the\nNorth Carolina Court of Appeals.\nPatent-Related Proceedings\nAstraZeneca Litigation\nOn September 22, 2021, the Company filed suit against AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals, LP, AstraZeneca AB, and AstraZeneca PLC for infringement of\nUnited States Patent Nos. 10,603,314 (“the ‘314 patent”) and 10,596,162 (“the ‘162 patent”) (Puma Biotechnology, Inc. et al. v. AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals\nLP et al., 1:21CV01338 (D. Del. Sep. 22, 2021)). The Company’s complaint alleges that AstraZeneca’s commercial manufacture, use, offer for sale, sale,\ndistribution, and/or importation of Tagrisso® (osimertinib) products for the treatment of gefitinib and/or erlotinib-resistant non-small cell lung cancer infringes\nthe ‘314 and ‘162 patents. The Company is an exclusive licensee of the ‘314 and ‘162 patents under the Pfizer Agreement. Wyeth is a co-plaintiff. Plaintiffs\nseek a judgment that AstraZeneca’s product infringes the asserted patents and an award of monetary damages in an amount to be proven at trial. AstraZeneca\nAB and AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP filed an answer and counterclaims on November 5, 2021, including claims challenging the asserted patents as not\ninfringed and/or invalid, and accusing plaintiffs of unclean hands and patent misuse. The parties stipulated to dismiss AstraZeneca PLC as a defendant and\nPfizer as a Counterclaim Defendant on December 10, 2021, which the Court so ordered on December 13, 2021. The Company filed its answer to AstraZeneca’s\ncounterclaims on December 17, 2021, denying those claims. The case was reassigned to visiting Judge Matthew Kennelly of the Northern District of Illinois. A\nMarkman Hearing was conducted on March 17, 2023, and the Court issued its claim construction decision on March 29, 2023. Fact discovery closed on May\n19, 2023, and expert discovery closed on November 17, 2023. The Court denied the parties’ respective motions for summary judgment and Daubert motions,\nother than to clarify that Plaintiffs’ damages cannot extend to any time period before the asserted patents were issued. The Court granted AstraZeneca’s motion\nto dismiss the Company as a Plaintiff on constitutional standing grounds but denied the motion to dismiss Wyeth as a Plaintiff on constitutional standing\ngrounds. On April 29, 2024, the Court granted AstraZeneca’s motion to dismiss AstraZeneca’s counterclaims against the Company, which removed the\nCompany from the case. Wyeth remained in the case as a Plaintiff and counterclaim-defendant. Under the Company’s worldwide exclusive license agreement\nwith Pfizer, Inc. (the parent of Wyeth) as amended, the Company also maintains contractual rights to recover monetary damages in the AstraZeneca litigation,\nand those contractual rights are unaffected by the court’s March 18, 2024 and April 29, 2024 orders. A jury trial was held May 13-17, 2024. The jury found in\nfavor of Wyeth and against AstraZeneca. In particular, the jury found that use of Tagrisso® according to each of the three FDA-approved indications infringes\nthe asserted claims of the ‘314 and ‘162 patents, and that AstraZeneca induces that infringement. The jury further rejected AstraZeneca’s challenges to the\nvalidity of the patents, finding that they are not invalid. The jury awarded damages to Wyeth for past acts of infringement through December 31, 2023, in the\namount of $107,500,000. A separate bench trial related to certain equitable claims and defenses raised by AstraZeneca was held before Judge Kennelly on June\n20 and 25, 2024. On August 6, 2024, Judge Kennelly issued his ruling on the issues that were tried in the bench trial, finding for Wyeth and against\nAstraZeneca on all claims and defenses. The Court found that AstraZeneca had not proved its claim that Wyeth’s asserted patents were invalid as indefinite, or\nthat Wyeth had committed acts that would give rise to findings of unclean hands, implied waiver, or patent misuse. AstraZeneca has filed a motion challenging\nthe jury’s verdict and requesting a new trial. Wyeth has filed a motion requesting supplemental damages for past infringement from January 1, 2024, through\nthe date of judgment; pre-and-post judgment interest, and ongoing royalties through the remaining term of the patents. Briefing on these motions from both\nsides was completed on July 16, 2024. On August 14, 2024, Judge Kennelly ruled on AstraZeneca’s motion challenging the jury’s verdict, granting it in part\nand denying it in part. The Court granted AstraZeneca’s motion for judgment as a matter of law that the '314 and '162 patents are invalid under 35 U.S.C. § 112\nfor lacking enablement and adequate written description as to a particular claim limitation. In all other respects, the Court denied AstraZeneca’s motion. The\nCourt entered its final and appealable judgment accordingly. The Company respectfully disagrees with the Court’s ruling regarding invalidity with respect to\nthe particular claim limitation. Wyeth filed a notice of appeal on September 12, 2024 appealing the District Court’s judgment as a matter of law, as well as\nother rulings and opinions of the Court adverse to Wyeth.\n34\nTable of Contents\nAcebright China Litigation\nOn January 18, 2022, Shanghai Acebright Pharmaceuticals Group Co., Ltd. (“Acebright”) filed an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”) with the\nNational Medical Products Administration in China (“NMPA”) seeking approval to market a generic version of the Company’s NERLYNX® (neratinib) tablet,\n40mg in China. Acebright seeks approval prior to the expiration of three patents listed on the China Patent Information Registration Platform for Marketed\nDrugs (“Chinese Orange Book”), namely, Chinese Patent Nos. ZL201410082103.7, ZL201080060546.6, and ZL200880118789.3 (the “’789 patent” and\ncollectively, the “NERLYNX® Patents”), alleging in a Type 4.2 patent declaration that its generic version of NERLYNX does not fall within the scope of the\nclaims of NERLYNX® Patents listed in the Chinese Orange Book. The patent declaration of Acebright was published in the Chinese Orange Book on January\n19, 2022. On March 2, 2022, the Company filed petitions with the China National Intellectual Property Administration (“CNIPA”) and requested administrative\ndetermination that Acebright’s generic neratinib tablet falls within the scope of the claims of NERLYNX® Patents listed in the Chinese Orange Book. The\nCompany’s request for administrative determination was accepted by CNIPA on March 18, 2022. The Company has notified NMPA of the acceptance of the\nrequest for administrative determination for NMPA to institute a stay of Acebright’s ANDA for nine months. On July 11, 2022, CNIPA decided that claims 5\nand 6 of Patent No. ZL200880118789.3 are not eligible for registration in the Chinese Orange Book on the ground that these two pharmaceutical method-of-\nuse claims fall within the scope of “patents of crystalline forms,” which are not eligible for listing in the Chinese Orange Book. On September 9, 2022, CNIPA\ndecided that the generic drug in Acebright’s ANDA does not fall within the protection scope of claims 1, 3, 5 and 6 of Patent No. ZL201410082103.7 and\nclaims 1-4, 7 and 9-13 of Patent No. ZL201080060546.6. The three CNIPA administrative decisions on NERLYNX® Patents have lifted the stay of Acebright’s\nANDA by NMPA. The Company has appealed each CNIPA administrative decision in January 2023 at the Beijing Intellectual Property Court (“BJIPC”). The\nthree appeals were accepted by BJIPC on February 20, 2023. The Company also filed three civil complaints based on the three NERLYNX® Patents against\nAcebright with the BJIPC in July 2022 and requested court determination that Acebright’s generic neratinib tablet falls within the scope of the claims of\nNERLYNX® Patents.

On September 12, 2023, the NMPA approved Acebright’s ANDA to market a generic version of the Company’s NERLYNX®\nin China with the approval number of GuoYaoZhunZi H20234141.\nOn December 28, 2023, the Company filed a civil lawsuit against Acebright for infringement of the ’789 patent under Article 11 of the Chinese Patent\nLaw before Jiangsu Nanjing Intermediate People’s Court. The Company’s complaint alleges that Acebright’s offer for sale of a generic version of the\nCompany’s NERLYNX® product infringes the ’789 patent. The Company seeks a judgment that Acebright’s product infringes the ’789 patent and Acebright’s\nact of offer for sale shall be enjoined. On January 2, 2024, Jiangsu Nanjing Intermediate People’s Court accepted the civil complaint. An oral hearing was held\non June 19, 2024, during which the Company amended its complaint to allege that Acebright making, selling and offering to sell the generic version of\nNERLYNX® infringes the ’789 patent. On July 24, 2024, the Company submitted a request to withdraw the lawsuit. On August 8, 2024, Jiangsu Nanjing\nIntermediate People’s Court accepted the withdrawal request.\nOn September 27, 2024, the Company filed an additional patent infringement claim against Acebright at Jiangsu Nanjing Intermediate People’s Court.\nOn October 14, 2024, the Court accepted the complaint and designated case number (2024) Su 01 Min Chu 2192 to this case.\nAosaikang China Litigation\nOn November 17, 2022, Jiangsu Aosaikang Pharmaceutical Co.
