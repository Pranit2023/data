(NASDAQ: SINT) (“SINTX” or the “Company”), an advanced ceramics company that develops and commercializes materials, components, and technologies for medical and technical applications, announces the signing of a Joint Development Agreement (JDA) with NED Medical Inc., an innovative developer of oncology embolization therapy technologies. This collaboration aims to accelerate the development of advanced ceramic-based microspheres, a groundbreaking advancement in radiotherapeutic applications.\n\nThe partnership will see SINTX leverage its expertise in ceramic manufacturing to support NED medical’s pre-clinical testing needs and perform the necessary process validation and verification activities to transition the microsphere process from the R&D scale to pilot production. “Our successful manufacturing feasibility collaboration with NED Medical demonstrated that SINTX could manufacture novel ceramic-based microspheres containing the Yttrium-90 radioisotope that met NED Medical’s preliminary specifications for a transarterial radioembolization (TARE) device for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. Further, these engineered microspheres contain porosity, allowing their future adaptation for targeted chemotherapy and combination therapies,” said Dr. Ryan Bock, CTO of SINTX Technologies. During this JDA, SINTX and NED Medical will collaborate closely, optimizing microsphere production, finalizing characterization and safety assessments, and producing microspheres needed to obtain pre-clinical data to be used as part of a device clearance submission.\n\n“We are excited to partner with NED Medical to develop next generation radiotherapeutic solutions that may have a transformative impact on cancer treatment,” said Eric K. Olson, CEO of SINTX Technologies. “This JDA underscores our commitment to advancing cutting-edge solutions that leverage our unique ceramic technology, which holds the potential to reshape the landscape of oncological therapies.”\n\n“SINTX’s expertise in advanced ceramic processing has facilitated the development of CombiSphere, a next generation, radio-labeled microsphere with differentiated properties, including radiopacity to facilitate new dosimetry modalities and a unique physical structure that allows high per-particle radiation activity at a density similar to red blood cells,” said Richard Yazebeck, President, CEO, and Co-Founder of NED Medical. “Equally exciting, and only achievable because of the material composition and manufacturing process, is that every microsphere in a dose is both radiopaque and radiation-emitting.”\n\n“Our partnership and collaboration with SINTX has transformed the trajectory of NED Medical and has positioned us to provide a unique solution to the clinical community. In addition to the announcement of our partnership, we are excited to welcome Ryan Bock, PhD, to our world-class Scientific Advisory Board (SAB). Dr. Bock is the CTO at SINTX and has played a pivotal role in the development of our R&D prototypes. Dr. Bock will join his peers on our SAB to advise and help direct the clinical development of CombiSphere.”\n\n**Investor Highlights:**\n\n  * **Strategic Expansion:** This partnership highlights SINTX’s expansion into the high-growth field of radio therapeutics, a market projected to see substantial growth over the coming years. \n  * **Innovative Technology:** The use of SINTX’s proprietary ceramic microsphere technology is expected to optimize dosing and enhance treatment precision to improve patient outcomes, positioning SINTX as a front-runner in the field of targeted radio-therapeutic devices.\n  * **Robust Pipeline:** The agreement paves the way for potential future collaborations, including scaling production, further testing to meet regulatory requirements, and expanded indications within the oncology and musculoskeletal spaces.\n\n\n\nThrough this collaboration, SINTX aims to unlock new revenue opportunities and strengthen its position in the medical device sector, making it an attractive prospect for current and potential investors.\n\nFor more information, please visit [www.sintx.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=h2GFPl2jG5oHwj7jSH6IOz9IXnZf5n9vrDe4U0R2ukZP4rJ1_PDkOWCiN4zTmPUzBFawKGXqiL7O0dsFa0NKig==)\n\n**About SINTX Technologies, Inc.**\n\nSINTX Technologies is an advanced ceramics company that develops and commercializes materials, components, and technologies for medical and technical applications.

(NASDAQ: SINT)**(“SINTX” or the “Company”), an advanced ceramics company that develops and commercializes materials, components, and technologies for medical and technical applications, today announced that its Board of Directors has authorized a stock repurchase program to buy back up to $500,000 of the company’s outstanding common stock over the next several quarters which equates to about 20% of total outstanding shares. The repurchases will be conducted based on market conditions and other factors, reflecting SINTX’s confidence in its strategic direction and commitment to enhancing shareholder value.\n\n**Strategic Rationale**\n\nThis initiative aligns with SINTX’s strategic focus on optimizing its capital structure and delivering long-term value to shareholders. By repurchasing shares, the company aims to reduce the number of outstanding shares, thereby increasing the ownership stake of remaining shareholders and enhancing earnings per share. Similar to actions taken by other industry leaders, SINTX believes that a stock repurchase program is an effective way to return capital to shareholders.\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n“We believe that the current market undervalues SINTX’s potential,” said Eric Olson, CEO of SINTX Technologies. “This repurchase program underscores our confidence in the company’s strategic initiatives and our commitment to delivering value to our shareholders. By leveraging our strong balance sheet, we are taking a proactive approach to capital allocation, similar to other companies in our industry that have successfully implemented share repurchase programs.”\n\n**Program Details**\n\nThe stock repurchase program will be managed by Maxim Group, LLC, a recognized leader in investment banking and asset management. The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common shares, and the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time at the Company’s discretion. The timing and amount of any share repurchases under the share repurchase program will be determined by SINTX’s management at its discretion based on ongoing assessments of the capital needs of the business, the market price of the Company’s common stock, corporate and regulatory requirements, and general market conditions. Share repurchases under the program may be made through a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases, in block trades, accelerated share repurchase transactions, exchange transactions, the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any combination of such methods.\n\nFor more information, please visit [www.sintx.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=xT6ch2ZJUlilxtsmQn3sUvfU_Zb9mY7wyNYrF5kaGzhUPHap_g0-j_LsD8XheKRwRDoYs3WBr5R_BJXtlLuIbQ==)\n\n**About SINTX Technologies, Inc.**\n\nSINTX Technologies is an advanced ceramics company that develops and commercializes materials, components, and technologies for medical and technical applications.
