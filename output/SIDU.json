The increase was primarily driven by increased satellite-related revenue contracts and the timing of fixed price milestone contracts as compared to the prior year. \n\nCost of revenue increased 69% to approximately $1.8 million, up from approximately $1.1 million in Q3 2023. The increase was driven by the mix of contract types and increased depreciation expenses in our satellite-related business. \n\nThe gross profit increased 140% to approximately $38,000, compared to a loss of approximately $90,000 in Q3 2023, which is mainly due to a favorable mix of contract types and increased sales in our higher margin satellite related business. \n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses totaled approximately $3.2 million, a $570,000 decrease from $3.8 million in Q3 2023, primarily due to a reduction in legal fees, payroll expenses, and insurance costs. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA loss, a non-GAAP measure, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was $2.5 million, compared to a loss of $3.7 million for the same period the prior year, representing a 33% improvement. Total non-GAAP adjustments for interest expense, depreciation and amortization, acquisition deal costs, severance costs, capital markets and advisory fees, equity-based compensation, and warrant costs are provided in the reconciliation table listed below. \n\nNet Loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was $3.9 million, compared to a net loss of $4.1 million in the same quarter of 2023. \n\n**Conference Call and Webcast**\n\n**Event:** |  Sidus Space Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results Conference Call   \n---|---  \n**Date:** |  Thursday, November 14, 2024   \n**Time:** |  5:00 p.m. Eastern Time   \n**Live Call:** |  + 1-877-269-7751 (U.S. Toll-Free) or +1-201-389-0908 (International)   \n**Webcast:** |  [https://viavid.webcasts.com/starthere.jsp?ei=1696384&tp_key=f4f76f8385](https://viavid.webcasts.com/starthere.jsp?ei=1696384&tp_key=f4f76f8385)  \n  \nFor interested individuals unable to join the conference call, a dial-in replay of the call will be available until Thursday, November 28, 2024, at 11:59 P.M.

The Company is scheduled to host a conference call and webcast today, Thursday, November 14, at 5:00 p.m. ET. \n\n“Our third-quarter results reflect Sidus’ strong momentum as we continue to execute on our strategy, grow our pipeline and manage our operational costs, with a 90% year-over-year quarterly revenue increase and a 15% reduction in SG&A expenses,” said Carol Craig, CEO of Sidus Space. “We are thrilled with the key milestones we’ve achieved this quarter, including our selection as the exclusive satellite manufacturing partner for Lonestar’s lunar data storage constellation and securing FCC approval for our micro constellation in Low Earth Orbit. These accomplishments underscore our commitment to delivering innovative, flexible, and cost-effective solutions in the evolving space industry. As we look ahead, our strategic advancements, such as the launch of our LizzieSat™-2 and 3 satellites and the integration of advanced communication technologies into future LizzieSat™ missions, position Sidus to expand our capabilities and drive continued growth.” \n\n**Operational Highlights for the Quarter Ending September 30, 2024:**\n\n  * Successfully completed the primary objectives of the Autonomous Satellite Technology for Resilient Application (ASTRA) historic in-space payload mission with NASA Stennis Space Center and secured follow-on contract for additional ASTRA support \n  * Secured contract with Xiomas Technologies to supply FeatherEdge™ computing system for fire detection via high-altitude infrared imaging \n  * Awarded $2 million contract from Craig Technologies to manufacture two fleet interactive display equipment (FIDE) pre-production unit main panels for a U.S. Navy Propulsion \n  * Signed agreement with Neuraspace to provide space traffic management and LEOP (Launch and Early Operations) support services, enhancing Sidus’ constellation operation capabilities \n  * Developed the Sidus low voltage differential signaling (LVDS) switch card, which extends the capabilities of the payload processor, enabling communication with multiple optical sensors through high speed LVDS data connections \n\n\n\n**Subsequent Operational Highlights:**\n\n  * Selected to exclusively design and build the first-generation lunar fleet of Data Storage Spacecraft for Lonestar Data Holdings, a provider of premium data storage and Resiliency As A Service (RAAS) \n  * Granted approval by FCC for operation of a micro constellation of remote sensing, multi-mission satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) (LizzieSat™ 2-5) \n  * Announced upgrade to LizzieSat™ communication system to integrate Iridium-enabled technology into future satellites \n  * Successfully completed environmental testing for LizzieSat™-2, which is scheduled for launch no earlier than December 2024 \n  * Completed the critical design review for LizzieSat™ NL, a laser communication satellite contracted by The Netherlands Organization \n\n\n\n**Corporate Governance and Capital Formation Highlights:**\n\nBoard Appointments: \n\n  * Lavanson (LC) Coffey appointed to Board of Directors \n\n\n\n**Financial Highlights for the Third Quarter Ending September 30, 2024:**\n\nTotal revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, totaled approximately $1.9 million, an increase of $0.9 million compared to total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by increased satellite-related revenue contracts and the timing of fixed price milestone contracts as compared to the prior year. \n\nCost of revenue increased 69% to approximately $1.8 million, up from approximately $1.1 million in Q3 2023. The increase was driven by the mix of contract types and increased depreciation expenses in our satellite-related business. \n\nThe gross profit increased 140% to approximately $38,000, compared to a loss of approximately $90,000 in Q3 2023, which is mainly due to a favorable mix of contract types and increased sales in our higher margin satellite related business. \n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses totaled approximately $3.2 million, a $570,000 decrease from $3.8 million in Q3 2023, primarily due to a reduction in legal fees, payroll expenses, and insurance costs. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA loss, a non-GAAP measure, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was $2.5 million, compared to a loss of $3.7 million for the same period the prior year, representing a 33% improvement. Total non-GAAP adjustments for interest expense, depreciation and amortization, acquisition deal costs, severance costs, capital markets and advisory fees, equity-based compensation, and warrant costs are provided in the reconciliation table listed below. \n\nNet Loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was $3.9 million, compared to a net loss of $4.1 million in the same quarter of 2023. \n\n**Conference Call and Webcast**\n\n**Event:** |  Sidus Space Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results Conference Call   \n---|---  \n**Date:** |  Thursday, November 14, 2024   \n**Time:** |  5:00 p.m. Eastern Time   \n**Live Call:** |  + 1-877-269-7751 (U.S. Toll-Free) or +1-201-389-0908 (International)   \n**Webcast:** |  [https://viavid.webcasts.com/starthere.jsp?ei=1696384&tp_key=f4f76f8385](https://viavid.webcasts.com/starthere.jsp?ei=1696384&tp_key=f4f76f8385)  \n  \nFor interested individuals unable to join the conference call, a dial-in replay of the call will be available until Thursday, November 28, 2024, at 11:59 P.M.

These statements include, but are not limited to, statements relating to the expected trading commencement and closing dates. The words ‘anticipate,’ ‘believe,’ ‘continue,’ ‘could,’ ‘estimate,’ ‘expect,’ ‘intend,’ ‘may,’ ‘plan,’ ‘potential,’ ‘predict,’ ‘project,’ ‘should,’ ‘target,’ ‘will,’ ‘would’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including: the uncertainties related to market conditions and other factors described more fully in the section entitled ‘Risk Factors’ in Sidus Space’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and other periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Any forward-looking statements contained in this press release speak only as of the date hereof, and Sidus Space, Inc. specifically disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. \n\n**NON-GAAP MEASURES**\n\nTo provide investors with additional information in connection with our results as determined in accordance with GAAP, we use non-GAAP measures of adjusted EBITDA. We use adjusted EBITDA in order to evaluate our operating performance and make strategic decisions regarding future direction of the company since it provides a meaningful comparison to our peers using similar measures. We define adjusted EBITDA as net income (as determined by U.S. GAAP) adjusted for interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, acquisition deal costs, severance costs, capital market and advisory fees, equity-based compensation and warrant costs. These non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures made by other companies since not all companies will use the same measures. Therefore, these non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for relevant U.S. GAAP measures and should be read in conjunction with information presented on a U.S. GAAP basis. \n\nThe following table reconciles adjusted EBITDA to net loss (the most comparable GAAP measure) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: \n\nThree Months Ended   \n---  \nSeptember 30,   \n2024  |  2023  |  Change  |  %   \nNet Income / (Loss)  |  $  |  (3,902,589)  |  $  |  (4,082,085)  |  $  |  179,496  |  -4%   \nInterest Expense (i)  |  733,714  |  207,343  |  526,371  |  254%   \nDepreciation and Amortization (ii)  |  636,416  |  68,781  |  567,635  |  825%   \nFundraising expense (iii)  |  -
