(NASDAQ: VRDN), a biotechnology company focused on discovering and developing potential best-in-class medicines for serious and rare diseases, today reported recent business highlights and financial results for the third quarter ending September 30, 2024. \n\n“We had another exceedingly strong quarter of execution across our TED and FcRn portfolios,” said Steve Mahoney, Viridian’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “In TED, we reported highly-compelling and positive phase 3 data for veligrotug and eagerly anticipate the readout of THRIVE-2 in December. We also initiated both pivotal phase 3 clinical trials for VRDN-003, our next-generation subcutaneous IGF-1R inhibitor. For our FcRn inhibitor portfolio, we are thrilled today to share VRDN-008 NHP data for the first time, demonstrating a potential best-in-class pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile for this half-life extended bispecific FcRn inhibitor. Together with our Fc fragment approach with VRDN-006, we believe these programs in our FcRn portfolio will bring differentiated options for patients and each contribute to an exciting pipeline beyond TED. This quarter, we also further strengthened our cash position with a financing that allows us to accelerate our R&D pipeline and extend our cash runway into the second half of 2027.” \n\n**RECENT TED PORTFOLIO PROGRESS**\n\n** Veligrotug ** is an intravenously delivered anti-insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) antibody in phase 3 development for thyroid eye disease. \n\n  * **Achieved All Primary and Secondary Endpoints in THRIVE:** In September, Viridian [announced](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.viridiantherapeutics.com%2Fnews%2Fnews-details%2F2024%2FViridian-Therapeutics-Announces-Positive-Topline-Results-from-Veligrotug-VRDN-001-Phase-3-THRIVE-Clinical-Trial-in-Patients-with-Active-Thyroid-Eye-Disease%2Fdefault.aspx&esheet=54151092&newsitemid=20241112340006&lan=en-US&anchor=announced&index=1&md5=44227bd862470e0cd29e83ed3dc6c8b4) positive topline results for veligrotug in THRIVE, a global phase 3 clinical trial in patients with active TED. Veligrotug met all of its primary and secondary endpoints after five infusions with high statistical significance (p < 0.0001) and was generally well-tolerated. \n\n\n  * **THRIVE-2 Topline Data Readout on Track for December 2024:** THRIVE-2 is a global phase 3 clinical trial assessing the efficacy and safety of veligrotug after five infusions in patients with chronic TED. THRIVE-2 completed enrollment in July 2024 with a total of 188 patients, exceeding the enrollment target of 159 patients due to patient demand, and is on track for topline readout of the 15-week primary efficacy analysis in December. \n\n\n  * **Veligrotug BLA on Track for Second Half 2025:** Viridian anticipates submitting a Biologics License Application (BLA) in the second half of 2025, pending data, and expects that its data package will support a marketing authorization application in Europe. \n\n\n\n** VRDN-003 ** is a potential best-in-class, subcutaneous, half-life extended anti-IGF-1R antibody with the same binding domain as veligrotug. \n\n  * **REVEAL-1 and REVEAL-2 Initiated in August 2024:** REVEAL-1 and REVEAL-2 are designed to evaluate VRDN-003 in patients with active and chronic TED, respectively, via a subcutaneous administration every four weeks or every eight weeks. Viridian believes the THRIVE topline results provide strong evidence to support the profile of VRDN-003 as a potential best-in-class subcutaneous anti-IGF-1R antibody in a low-volume, infrequent, self-administered, subcutaneous injection designed for patients to use at home. \n\n\n  * **Topline Data and BLA in 2026:** Viridian anticipates topline data from both REVEAL-1 and REVEAL-2 in the first half of 2026, with a BLA submission planned by year-end 2026. The company plans to launch VRDN-003 with a commercially available low-volume autoinjector for at-home administration. \n\n\n\n**FCRN PORTFOLIO UPDATE WITH NEW VRDN-008 NHP DATA**\n\n** VRDN-006 ** is a highly selective Fc fragment which inhibits FcRn, and is designed to be a convenient subcutaneous and self-administered option for patients. \n\n  * **IND on Track for Year-End 2024:** Viridian is on track to submit an IND application for VRDN-006 by year-end 2024. Viridian anticipates starting a phase 1 clinical trial for VRDN-006 in healthy volunteers in early 2025 and proof-of-concept IgG reductions from that study in the second half of 2025. \n\n\n\n** VRDN-008 ** is a half-life extended bispecific FcRn inhibitor comprising an Fc fragment and an albumin-binding domain designed to prolong IgG suppression and provide a potentially best-in-class subcutaneous option for patients. \n\n  * **Positive New NHP Data Confirms Half-Life Extension:** In a head-to-head study, single doses of VRDN-008 demonstrated 3x the half-life of efgartigimod and showed a deeper and more sustained IgG reduction in NHPs with peak IgG reductions that were 20% deeper than efgartigimod. IgG levels returned to baseline 35 days after VRDN-008 dosing, more than twice as long as efgartigimod, which returned to baseline 14 days after dosing. VRDN-008 spared albumin and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), consistent with efgartigimod. Given that NHP data for FcRn inhibitors have been highly translatable to humans, Viridian believes this data shows the potential for VRDN-008 to be a best-in-class, extended half-life FcRn inhibitor for patients. \n\n\n  * **IND Submission Expected Year-End 2025:** With these positive proof-of-concept data for VRDN-008, Viridian plans to further advance IND-enabling activities and submit an IND by year-end 2025. Viridian anticipates proof-of-concept IgG reduction data in healthy volunteers in the second half of 2026. \n\n\n\n**FINANCIAL RESULTS**\n\n  * **Cash Position** **:** Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were $753.2 million as of September 30, 2024, compared with $571.4 million as of June 30, 2024. The company completed a public offering in September 2024 with net proceeds of $243.2 million and believes that its current cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments will be sufficient to fund its operations into the second half of 2027. \n\n\n  * **R &D Expenses** **:** Research and development expenses were $69.2 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $30.4 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase in research and development expenses was driven by increased clinical trials costs associated with our ongoing THRIVE and THRIVE-2 pivotal clinical trials, as well as increased personnel costs to support our pipeline development. \n\n\n  * **G &A Expenses** **:** General and administrative expenses were $14.4 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $20.9 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was driven by a decrease in personnel-related costs, including share-based compensation expenses. \n\n\n  * **Net Loss** **:** The company’s net loss was $76.7 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared with $47.7 million for the same period last year. \n\n\n  * **Shares Outstanding:** As of September 30, 2024, Viridian had 97,850,645 shares of common stock outstanding on an as-converted basis, which included 79,181,445 shares of common stock and an aggregate 18,669,200 shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of 134,864 and 145,160 shares of Series A and Series B preferred stock, respectively. \n\n\n\n**About Viridian Therapeutics**\n\nViridian is a biopharmaceutical company focused on engineering and developing potential best-in-class medicines for patients with serious and rare diseases.

(NASDAQ: VRDN), a biotechnology company\nfocused on discovering and developing potential best-in-class medicines for serious and rare diseases, today\nreported recent business highlights and \u0000nancial results for the third quarter ending September 30, 2024.\n“We had another exceedingly strong quarter of execution across our TED and FcRn portfolios,” said Steve Mahoney,\n1\nViridian’s President and Chief Executive O\u0000cer. “In TED, we reported highly-compelling and positive phase 3 data\nfor veligrotug and eagerly anticipate the readout of THRIVE-2 in December. We also initiated both pivotal phase 3\nclinical trials for VRDN-003, our next-generation subcutaneous IGF-1R inhibitor. For our FcRn inhibitor portfolio, we\nare thrilled today to share VRDN-008 NHP data for the \u0000rst time, demonstrating a potential best-in-class\npharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic pro\u0000le for this half-life extended bispeci\u0000c FcRn inhibitor. Together with\nour Fc fragment approach with VRDN-006, we believe these programs in our FcRn portfolio will bring di\u0000erentiated\noptions for patients and each contribute to an exciting pipeline beyond TED. This quarter, we also further\nstrengthened our cash position with a \u0000nancing that allows us to accelerate our R&D pipeline and extend our cash\nrunway into the second half of 2027.”\nRECENT TED PORTFOLIO PROGRESS\nVeligrotug is an intravenously delivered anti-insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) antibody in phase 3\ndevelopment for thyroid eye disease.\nAchieved All Primary and Secondary Endpoints in THRIVE: In September, Viridian announced positive topline\nresults for veligrotug in THRIVE, a global phase 3 clinical trial in patients with active TED. Veligrotug met all of\nits primary and secondary endpoints after \u0000ve infusions with high statistical signi\u0000cance (p < 0.0001) and was\ngenerally well-tolerated.\nTHRIVE-2 Topline Data Readout on Track for December 2024: THRIVE-2 is a global phase 3 clinical trial\nassessing the e\u0000cacy and safety of veligrotug after \u0000ve infusions in patients with chronic TED. THRIVE-2\ncompleted enrollment in July 2024 with a total of 188 patients, exceeding the enrollment target of 159\npatients due to patient demand, and is on track for topline readout of the 15-week primary e\u0000cacy analysis in\nDecember.\nVeligrotug BLA on Track for Second Half 2025: Viridian anticipates submitting a Biologics License Application\n(BLA) in the second half of 2025, pending data, and expects that its data package will support a marketing\nauthorization application in Europe.\nVRDN-003 is a potential best-in-class, subcutaneous, half-life extended anti-IGF-1R antibody with the same\nbinding domain as veligrotug.\nREVEAL-1 and REVEAL-2 Initiated in August 2024: REVEAL-1 and REVEAL-2 are designed to evaluate VRDN-003\nin patients with active and chronic TED, respectively, via a subcutaneous administration every four weeks or\nevery eight weeks. Viridian believes the THRIVE topline results provide strong evidence to support the pro\u0000le\nof VRDN-003 as a potential best-in-class subcutaneous anti-IGF-1R antibody in a low-volume, infrequent, self-\nadministered, subcutaneous injection designed for patients to use at home.\n2\nTopline Data and BLA in 2026: Viridian anticipates topline data from both REVEAL-1 and REVEAL-2 in the \u0000rst\nhalf of 2026, with a BLA submission planned by year-end 2026. The company plans to launch VRDN-003 with a\ncommercially available low-volume autoinjector for at-home administration.\nFCRN PORTFOLIO UPDATE WITH NEW VRDN-008 NHP DATA\nVRDN-006 is a highly selective Fc fragment which inhibits FcRn, and is designed to be a convenient subcutaneous\nand self-administered option for patients.\nIND on Track for Year-End 2024: Viridian is on track to submit an IND application for VRDN-006 by year-end\n2024. Viridian anticipates starting a phase 1 clinical trial for VRDN-006 in healthy volunteers in early 2025 and\nproof-of-concept IgG reductions from that study in the second half of 2025.\nVRDN-008 is a half-life extended bispeci\u0000c FcRn inhibitor comprising an Fc fragment and an albumin-binding\ndomain designed to prolong IgG suppression and provide a potentially best-in-class subcutaneous option for\npatients.\nPositive New NHP Data Con\u0000rms Half-Life Extension: In a head-to-head study, single doses of VRDN-008\ndemonstrated 3x the half-life of efgartigimod and showed a deeper and more sustained IgG reduction in\nNHPs with peak IgG reductions that were 20% deeper than efgartigimod. IgG levels returned to baseline 35\ndays after VRDN-008 dosing, more than twice as long as efgartigimod, which returned to baseline 14 days\nafter dosing. VRDN-008 spared albumin and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), consistent with efgartigimod. Given\nthat NHP data for FcRn inhibitors have been highly translatable to humans, Viridian believes this data shows\nthe potential for VRDN-008 to be a best-in-class, extended half-life FcRn inhibitor for patients.\nIND Submission Expected Year-End 2025: With these positive proof-of-concept data for VRDN-008, Viridian\nplans to further advance IND-enabling activities and submit an IND by year-end 2025. Viridian anticipates\nproof-of-concept IgG reduction data in healthy volunteers in the second half of 2026.\nFINANCIAL RESULTS\nCash Position : Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were $753.2 million as of September 30,\n2024, compared with $571.4 million as of June 30, 2024. The company completed a public o\u0000ering in\nSeptember 2024 with net proceeds of $243.2 million and believes that its current cash, cash equivalents, and\nshort-term investments will be su\u0000cient to fund its operations into the second half of 2027.\nR&D Expenses : Research and development expenses were $69.2 million during the quarter ended September\n30, 2024, compared to $30.4 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase in research\nand development expenses was driven by increased clinical trials costs associated with our ongoing THRIVE\n3\nand THRIVE-2 pivotal clinical trials, as well as increased personnel costs to support our pipeline development.\nG&A Expenses : General and administrative expenses were $14.4 million during the quarter ended September\n30, 2024, compared to $20.9 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in general\nand administrative expenses was driven by a decrease in personnel-related costs, including share-based\ncompensation expenses.\nNet Loss : The company’s net loss was $76.7 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024,\ncompared with $47.7 million for the same period last year.\nShares Outstanding: As of September 30, 2024, Viridian had 97,850,645 shares of common stock outstanding\non an as-converted basis, which included 79,181,445 shares of common stock and an aggregate 18,669,200\nshares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of 134,864 and 145,160 shares of Series A and Series B\npreferred stock, respectively.\nAbout Viridian Therapeutics\nViridian is a biopharmaceutical company focused on engineering and developing potential best-in-class medicines\nfor patients with serious and rare diseases.

We make such forward-\nlooking statements pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other federal securities laws. The words\n“anticipate,” “believe,” “contemplate,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intends,” “may,” “might,” “plan,” “possible,” “potential,” “predict,”\n“project,” “should,” “will,” “would” and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a\nstatement is not forward-looking. Forward looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report include, but are not limited to, statements about:\n• the ability of our clinical trials to demonstrate safety and efficacy of our product candidates and other results;\n• the potential utility, efficacy, potency, safety, clinical benefits, half-life, clinical response, convenience and number of indications of our product\ncandidates;\n• the timing and focus of our ongoing and future preclinical studies and clinical trials and the timing of reporting data from those studies and trials;\n• supply chain disruptions, enrollment in clinical trials involving our product candidates or other delays in such trials;\n• our plans relating to commercializing our product candidates, including our plans to commercialize products candidates as combination products, if\napproved, including the geographic areas of focus and sales strategy;\n• the rate and degree of market acceptance and clinical utility for our product candidates;\n• expectations regarding the initiation of clinical trials and interactions and alignment with regulatory authorities;\n• the timing or likelihood of regulatory filings and approvals, including our expectation to seek an accelerated approval pathway and special\ndesignations, such as orphan drug designation, for our product candidates for various diseases;\n• our plans relating to the further development of our product candidates, including additional indications we may pursue;\n• our plans to obtain or protect intellectual property rights;\n• our continued reliance on third parties to conduct additional clinical trials of our product candidates and for the manufacture of our product candidates\nfor preclinical studies, clinical trials and commercialization;\n• our plans regarding any collaboration, licensing or other arrangements that may be necessary or desirable to develop, manufacture or commercialize\nour product candidates;\n• our estimates regarding expenses, future revenue, capital requirements and our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our operations and\ncomplete further development and commercialization of our product candidates; and\n3\nTable of Contents\n• the period over which we estimate our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our future operating expenses and capital\nexpenditure requirements.\nAny forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report reflect our current views with respect to future events and with respect to our future financial\nperformance, and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be\nmaterially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause\nactual results to differ materially from current expectations include, among other things, those described under Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Quarterly\nReport. Given these uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Except as required by law, we assume no\nobligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements for any reason, even if new information becomes available in the future.\nAll of our forward-looking statements are as of the date of this Quarterly Report only. In each case, actual results may differ materially from such forward-\nlooking information. We can give no assurance that such expectations or forward-looking statements will prove to be correct. An occurrence of or any material\nadverse change in one or more of the risk factors or risks and uncertainties referred to in this Quarterly Report or included in our other public disclosures or our\nother periodic reports or other documents or filings filed with or furnished to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) could materially and\nadversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Except as required by law, we do not undertake or plan to update or\nrevise any such forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changes in plans, assumptions, estimates or projections or other circumstances affecting\nsuch forward-looking statements occurring after the date of this Quarterly Report, even if such results, changes or circumstances make it clear that any\nforward-looking information will not be realized. Any public statements or disclosures by us following this Quarterly Report that modify or impact any of the\nforward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report will be deemed to modify or supersede such statements in this Quarterly Report.\nWe may from time to time provide estimates, projections and other information concerning our industry, the general business environment, and the markets for\ncertain diseases, including estimates regarding the potential size of those markets and the estimated incidence and prevalence of certain medical conditions.\nInformation that is based on estimates, forecasts, projections, market research or similar methodologies is inherently subject to uncertainties, and actual events,\ncircumstances or numbers, including actual disease prevalence rates and market size, may differ materially from the information reflected in this Quarterly\nReport. Unless otherwise expressly stated, we obtained this industry, business information, market data, prevalence information and other data from reports,\nresearch surveys, studies and similar data prepared by market research firms and other third parties, industry, medical and general publications, government\ndata, and similar sources, in some cases applying our own assumptions and analysis that may, in the future, prove not to have been accurate.\nUnless otherwise mentioned or unless the context requires otherwise, all references in this Quarterly Report, to “Viridian,” “Viridian Therapeutics,” the\n“Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” or similar references refer to Viridian Therapeutics, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries.\n4\nTable of Contents\nSUMMARY OF THE MATERIAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESS\nBelow is a summary of the principal factors that make an investment in our common stock speculative or risky. This summary does not address all of the risks\nthat we face. Additional discussion of the risks summarized in this risk factor summary, and other risks that we face, can be found below under the heading\n“Item 1A. Risk Factors” and should be carefully considered, together with other information in this Quarterly Report and our other filings with the SEC,\nbefore making an investment decision regarding our common stock.\n• If we are unable to raise additional capital when needed, we would be forced to delay, reduce, or eliminate our research and product development\nprograms or future commercialization efforts.\n• We have historically incurred losses, have a limited operating history on which to assess our business, and anticipate that we will continue to incur\nsignificant losses for the foreseeable future.\n• Clinical trials are costly, time consuming, and inherently risky, and we may fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of applicable\nregulatory authorities.\n• Regulatory approval processes are lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable. Failure to obtain regulatory approval for our product\ncandidates would have a material adverse effect upon our business and business prospects.\n• Our product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit the\ncommercial viability of approved labeling, or result in significant negative consequences following marketing approval, if any.\n• We are heavily dependent on the success of our product candidates, which are in clinical development. Some of our product candidates have produced\nresults only in non-clinical settings, or for other indications than those for which we contemplate conducting development and seeking U.S. Food and\nDrug Administration or other regulatory approval, and we cannot give any assurance that we will generate data for any of our product candidates\nsufficiently supportive to receive regulatory approval in our planned indications, which will be required before they can be commercialized.\n• Product development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier preclinical studies and clinical trials\nmay not be predictive of future clinical trial results.\n• We may find it difficult to enroll and maintain patients or subjects in our clinical trials, in part due to the limited number of patients or subjects who\nhave the diseases for which our product candidates are being studied or the availability of competing therapies and clinical trials. We cannot predict if\nwe will have difficulty enrolling and maintaining patients or subjects in our future clinical trials. Difficulty in enrolling and maintaining patients or\nsubjects could delay or prevent clinical trials of our product candidates.\n• We rely on third parties to conduct our preclinical development activities and clinical trials, manufacture our product candidates, and perform other\nservices. If these third parties do not successfully perform and/or comply with regulatory requirements, we may not be able to successfully complete\nclinical development, obtain regulatory approval, or commercialize our product candidates and our business could be substantially harmed.\n• We rely on patent rights, trade secret protections, and confidentiality agreements to protect intellectual property, including intellectual property related\nto our product candidates and any future product candidates. If we are unable to obtain or maintain exclusivity from the combination of these\napproaches, we may not be able to compete effectively in our markets.\n5\nTable of Contents\n• If we are unable to establish commercial manufacturing, sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to commercially\nmanufacture, market and sell our product candidates, we may be unable to generate any revenue.\n• We face substantial competition and our competitors may discover, develop, or commercialize products faster or more successfully than us.\n• Our future success depends in part on our ability to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel. If we lose key personnel, or if we fail to recruit\nadditional highly skilled personnel, our ability to develop our product candidates will be impaired and our business may be harmed.\n6\nTable of Contents\nPART I.

STATEMENTS\n(unaudited)\n1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\nViridian Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company” or “Viridian”), is a biopharmaceutical company advancing new treatments for patients\nsuffering from serious diseases that are underserved by today’s therapies. The Company’s most advanced program, veligrotug (formerly known as VRDN-001),\nis a differentiated monoclonal antibody targeting insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (“IGF-1R”), a clinically and commercially validated target for the\ntreatment of thyroid eye disease (“TED”). The Company’s second product candidate, VRDN-003, is an extended half-life monoclonal antibody with the same\nbinding domains as veligrotug designed for administration as convenient, low-volume, subcutaneous pen injections. TED is a serious and debilitating rare\nautoimmune disease that causes inflammation within the orbit of the eye that can cause bulging of the eyes, redness and swelling, double vision, pain, and\npotential blindness.\nIn addition to developing therapies for TED, the Company is also developing a portfolio of engineered anti-neonatal Fc receptor (“FcRn”) inhibitors, including\nVRDN-006 and VRDN-008. FcRn inhibitors have the potential to treat a broad array of autoimmune diseases, representing a significant commercial market\nopportunity.\nLiquidity\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a basis that assumes the Company is a going concern and do not\ninclude any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities\nthat may result from any uncertainty related to its ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has funded its operations to date principally through\nproceeds received from the sale of the Company’s common stock, its Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, and other equity securities, debt\nfinancings, license fees, and reimbursements received under collaboration agreements. Since its inception and through September 30, 2024, the Company has\ngenerated an accumulated deficit of $916.1 million. The Company expects to continue to generate operating losses for the foreseeable future.\nThe Company has no products approved for commercial sale, has not generated any revenue from product sales, and cannot guarantee when or if it will\ngenerate any revenue from product sales. Substantially all of the Company’s operating losses resulted from expenses incurred in connection with its research\nand development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with its operations. The Company expects to incur significant expenses and\noperating losses for at least the next several years as it continues the development of, and seeks regulatory approval for, its product candidates. It is expected\nthat operating losses will fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year due to timing of development programs and efforts to achieve\nregulatory approval.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately $753.2 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. In addition, the Company\nalso has access to additional undrawn funds under the Hercules Loan and Security Agreement Amended Term Loan, as further described in Note 5. Debt. As of\nthe issuance date of these condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company expects that its current resources will be sufficient to fund its operating\nexpenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months from the issuance date of these financial statements.\nThe Company will require additional capital in order to continue to finance its operations. The amount and timing of future funding requirements will depend\non many factors, including the pace and results of the Company’s clinical development efforts, timing of market research and other professional and consulting\n12\nTable of Contents\nactivities to prepare for commercial activities, equity financings, entering into license and collaboration agreements, and issuing debt or other financing\nvehicles. The Company’s ability to secure additional capital is dependent upon a number of factors, some of which are outside of the Company’s control,\nincluding success in developing its product candidates, operational performance, and market conditions, including those resulting from the current inflationary\nand broader macroeconomic environment.\nFailure to raise capital as and when needed, on favorable terms or at all, would have a negative impact on the Company’s financial condition and its ability to\ndevelop its product candidates. Changing circumstances may cause the Company to consume capital significantly faster or slower than currently anticipated. If\nthe Company is unable to acquire additional capital or resources, it will be required to modify its operational plans. The estimates included herein are based on\nassumptions that may prove to be wrong, and the Company could exhaust its available financial resources sooner than currently anticipated.\n2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting\nprinciples (“U.S. GAAP”), for interim financial reporting and as required by Regulation S-X, Rule 10-01. Accordingly, they do not include all of the\ninformation and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. Any reference in these notes to applicable guidance is meant to refer to\nthe authoritative U.S. GAAP as found in the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”), and Accounting Standards Updates (“ASU”), or the Financial\nAccounting Standards Board (“FASB”).\nIn the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals and revisions of estimates, considered necessary for a fair presentation\nof the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been included. Interim results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, are not\nnecessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024, or any other future period.\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The\nCompany’s subsidiaries have no employees or operations. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Management has\ndetermined that the Company operates in one segment, which is the business of developing and commercializing novel therapeutics. The information included\nin this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes\nincluded in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on\nFebruary 27, 2024. The Company’s management performed an evaluation of its activities through the date of filing of these unaudited condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements and concluded that there are no subsequent events requiring disclosure, other than as disclosed.\nRisk and Uncertainties – Global Economic Considerations\nThe global macroeconomic environment is uncertain, and could be negatively affected by, among other things, increased U.S. trade tariffs and trade disputes\nwith other countries, instability in the global capital and credit markets, supply chain weaknesses, and instability in the geopolitical environment, including as a\nresult of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the rising tensions between China and Taiwan, the conflict in Israel and surrounding area and other political tensions.\nSuch challenges have caused, and may continue to cause, recession fears, concerns regarding potential sanctions, high interest rates, foreign exchange volatility\nand inflationary pressures. At this time, the Company is unable to quantify the potential effects of this economic instability on its future operations.\n13\nTable of Contents\nGoing Concern\nAt each reporting period, the Company evaluates whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as\na going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. The Company is required to make certain additional disclosures if it\nconcludes substantial doubt exists and it is not alleviated by the Company’s plans or when its plans alleviate substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to\ncontinue as a going concern.\nThe Company’s evaluation entails, among other things, analyzing the results of the Company’s clinical development efforts, license and collaboration\nagreements as well as the entity’s current financial condition including conditional and unconditional obligations anticipated within a year, and related liquidity\nsources at the date the financial statements are issued. This is reflected in the Company’s prospective operating budgets and forecasts and compared to the\ncurrent cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments balance.\nUse of Estimates\nThe Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires it to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and\nthe reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates and assumptions reflected in these condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements include, but are not limited to, the accrual for clinical trial costs, including manufacturing activities, and other outsourced research and\ndevelopment expenses, and the valuation of share-based awards. Although these estimates are based on the Company’s knowledge of current events and actions\nit may take in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company accounts for revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”).\nThe Company enters into collaboration agreements and certain other agreements that are within the scope of ASC 606, under which the Company licenses, may\nlicense, or grants an option to license rights to certain of the Company’s product candidates and performs research and development services in connection with\nsuch agreements. The terms of these agreements typically include payment of one or more of the following: non-refundable, up-front fees; reimbursement of\nresearch and development costs; developmental, clinical, regulatory, and commercial sales milestone payments; and royalties on net sales of licensed products.\nIn accordance with ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the\nconsideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.\nTo determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized, for agreements within the scope of ASC 606, the Company performs the following five\nsteps: (i) identification of the goods or services within the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations,\nincluding whether they are distinct within the terms of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable\nconsideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the identified performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company\nsatisfies each performance obligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the Company will collect\nconsideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer.\n14\nTable of Contents\nThe promised goods or services in the Company’s agreements typically consist of a license, or option to license, rights to the Company’s intellectual property\nor research and development services. Performance obligations are promises in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and are\nconsidered distinct when (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service on its own or together with other readily available resources and (ii) the\npromised good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. In assessing whether promised goods or services are distinct, the\nCompany considers factors such as the stage of development of the underlying intellectual property, the capabilities of the customer to develop the intellectual\nproperty on its own or whether the required expertise is readily available, and whether the goods or services are integral or dependent to other goods or services\nin the contract.\nThe Company estimates the transaction price based on the amount expected to be received for transferring the promised goods or services in the contract. The\nconsideration may include fixed consideration or variable consideration. At the inception of each agreement that includes variable consideration, the Company\nevaluates the amount of potential payment and the likelihood that the payments will be received. The Company utilizes either the most likely amount method\nor expected value method to estimate the amount expected to be received based on which method best predicts the amount expected to be received. The amount\nof variable consideration that is included in the transaction price may be constrained and is included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable\nthat a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur in a future period.\nThe Company’s contracts often include development and regulatory milestone payments that are assessed under the most likely amount method and\nconstrained if it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would occur. Milestone payments that are not within the Company’s control or the licensee’s\ncontrol, such as regulatory approvals, are not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. At the end of each reporting period, the\nCompany re-evaluates the probability of achievement of such development and clinical milestones and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjusts its\nestimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect collaboration and other\nresearch and development revenue in the period of adjustment.\nFor agreements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on the level of sales, and where the license is deemed to be the\npredominant item to which the royalties relate, the Company recognizes revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance\nobligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). To date, the Company has not recognized any royalty\nrevenue resulting from any of the Company’s collaboration or strategic alliance agreements.\nThe Company allocates the transaction price based on the estimated standalone selling price. The Company must develop assumptions that require judgment to\ndetermine the stand-alone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the contract. The Company utilizes key assumptions to determine the\nstand-alone selling price, which may include other comparable transactions, pricing considered in negotiating the transaction, and the estimated costs. Variable\nconsideration is allocated specifically to one or more performance obligations in a contract when the terms of the variable consideration relate to the\nsatisfaction of the performance obligation and the resulting amounts allocated are consistent with the amounts the Company would expect to receive for the\nsatisfaction of each performance obligation.\nThe consideration allocated to each performance obligation is recognized as revenue when control is transferred for the related goods or services. For\nperformance obligations which consist of licenses and other promises, the Company utilizes judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance\nobligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of\nmeasuring progress. The Company evaluates the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related\nrevenue recognition.\n15\nTable of Contents\nThe Company receives payments from its customers based on billing schedules established in each contract. Up-front payments and fees are recorded as\ndeferred revenue upon receipt or when due until the Company performs its obligations under these arrangements. Amounts are recorded as accounts receivable\nwhen the Company’s right to consideration is unconditional.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred in performing research and development activities. The costs include employee-related expense\nincluding salaries, benefits, share-based compensation, restructuring charges including severance costs, fees for acquiring and maintaining licenses under third-\nparty license agreements, consulting fees, costs of research and development activities conducted by third parties on the Company’s behalf, costs to have\nclinical trial materials manufactured on the Company’s behalf, purchases of laboratory supplies, depreciation, and facilities and overhead costs. The Company\nrecords research and development expense in the period in which the Company receives or takes ownership of the applicable goods or when the applicable\nservices are performed. In circumstances where amounts have been paid in excess of costs incurred, the Company records a prepaid expense.\nThe Company records up-front and milestone payments to acquire and retain contractual rights to licensed technology as research and development expenses\nwhen incurred if there is uncertainty in the Company receiving future economic benefit from the acquired contractual rights. The Company considers future\neconomic benefits from acquired contractual rights to licensed technology to be uncertain until such a drug candidate is approved for sale by the U.S. Food and\nDrug Administration (“FDA”) or when other significant risk factors are abated. Such up-front and milestone payments are reflected as cash used in operating\nactivities within the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows.\nClinical Trial and Preclinical Study Accruals\nThe Company makes estimates of accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in its condensed consolidated financial statements based on certain facts and\ncircumstances at that time. The Company’s accrued expenses for clinical trials and preclinical studies are based on estimates of costs incurred for services\nprovided by clinical research organizations, manufacturing organizations, and other providers. Payments under the Company’s agreements with external\nservice providers depend on a number of factors, such as site initiation, patient screening, enrollment, delivery of reports, and other events. In accruing for\nthese activities, the Company obtains information from various sources and estimates the level of effort or expense allocated to each period. Adjustments to the\nCompany’s research and development expenses may be necessary in future periods as its estimates change.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company issues stock-based awards to employees and non-employees in the form of stock options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”). The Company\nmeasures and recognizes share-based compensation expense for its stock-based awards granted to employees and non-employees based on the estimated grant\ndate fair value in accordance with ASC Topic 718, “Compensation - Stock Compensation” and determines the fair value of RSUs based on the fair value of its\ncommon stock. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options. The use of the Black-Scholes option-\npricing model requires the Company to make assumptions with respect to the expected term of the option, the expected volatility of the common stock\nconsistent with the expected life of the option, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend yields of the common stock. The Company recognizes share-based\ncompensation expense for awards with service-based conditions using the straight-line method over the requisite service period, net of any actual forfeitures.\n16\nTable of Contents\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nAll highly-liquid investments that have maturities of 90 days or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are reported at\ncost, which approximates fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments.\nInvestments\nThe Company’s investments consist of highly-rated corporate and U.S. Treasury securities and have been classified as available-for-sale securities.\nAccordingly, these investments are recorded at their respective fair values, as determined based on quoted market prices. The Company may hold securities\nwith stated maturities greater than one year. All available-for-sale securities are considered available to support current operations, and thus investments with\nmaturities beyond one year are generally classified as current assets.\nUnrealized gains and losses are reported as a component of stockholders’ equity until their disposition. Realized gains and losses are included as a component\nof other income (expense), net based on the specific identification method. The securities are subject to a periodic impairment review. An impairment charge\nwould occur when a decline in the fair value of the investments below the cost basis is judged to be other-than-temporary.\nFair Value Measurements\nCertain assets and liabilities are carried at fair value under U.S. GAAP. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to\ntransfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on\nthe measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable\ninputs. Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are to be classified and disclosed in one of the following three levels of the fair value hierarchy, of\nwhich the first two are considered observable and the last is considered unobservable:\n• Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n• Level 2 inputs utilize observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices, for similar assets or liabilities, quoted market prices in\nmarkets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the\nrelated assets or liabilities.\n• Level 3 inputs are unobservable data points for the asset or liability and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or\nliability.\nCertain of the Company’s financial instruments are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis but are recorded at amounts that approximate their fair value\ndue to the short-term nature of their maturities, such as cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, which include short-term\ninvestments that have maturities of less than three months. The Company maintains deposits in federally insured financial institutions in excess of federally\ninsured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts. The Company invests its excess cash primarily in deposits and money market\nfunds held with one financial institution. The Company does not believe that it is subject to unusual credit risk beyond the normal credit risk associated with\ncommercial banking relationships.\n17\nTable of Contents\nProperty and Equipment\nThe Company carries its property and equipment at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line\nmethod over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three to five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the life of the lease\n(including any renewal periods that are deemed to be reasonably assured) or the estimated useful life of the assets. Construction in progress is not depreciated\nuntil placed in service. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred and expenditures for major improvements are capitalized.\nOperating Lease Right-of-Use Assets and Liabilities\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is, or contains, a lease at contract inception and during modifications or renewal of existing leases. Operating lease\nassets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and operating lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make\nlease payments arising from the lease. The Company has recorded operating lease assets and liabilities pursuant to the guidance in ASU No. 2016-02, Leases\n(Topic 842), and subsequent amendments to the initial guidance: ASU No. 2017-13, ASU No. 2018-10, and ASU No. 2018-11 (collectively, “ASC 842”). These\noperating lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of the lease based upon the present value of lease payments over the lease term.\nThe lease payments used to determine the Company’s operating lease assets may include lease incentives, stated rent increases, and escalation clauses and are\nrecognized in the Company’s operating lease assets in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s operating leases are reflected in\noperating lease right-of-use asset and operating lease liability within accrued and other liabilities in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nLease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Short-term leases, defined as leases that have a lease term\nof 12 months or less at the commencement date, are excluded from this treatment and are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Refer to\nNote 6. Commitments and Contingencies - Lease Obligations for additional information related to the Company’s operating leases.\nDebt and Debt Issuance Costs\nDebt issuance costs and expenses paid by the Company to its lenders are presented on the consolidated balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt\nliability rather than capitalized as an asset in accordance with ASU No. 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the\nPresentation of Debt Issuance Costs. Debt issuance costs represent legal and other direct costs incurred in connection with the Company’s Term Loan (as\ndefined in Note 5. Debt). These costs are amortized as a non-cash component of interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the loan.\nConvertible Preferred Stock\nThe Company records shares of non-voting convertible preferred stock at their respective fair values on the dates of issuance, net of issuance costs.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company assesses the carrying amount of its property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such\nassets may not be recoverable. No impairment charges were recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nNet Loss per Share\nBasic net loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period without\nconsideration of common stock equivalents. Since the\n18\nTable of Contents\nCompany was in a loss position for all periods presented, diluted net loss per share is the same as basic net loss per share for all periods, as the inclusion of all\npotential common shares outstanding is antidilutive.\nComprehensive Loss\nComprehensive loss is comprised of net loss and adjustments for the change in unrealized gains and losses on investments. Unrealized accumulated\ncomprehensive gains or losses are reflected as a separate component in the condensed consolidated statements of changes in stockholders’ equity.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes by using an asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are\nrecognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and\ntheir respective tax bases. A valuation allowance is recorded to the extent it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Deferred tax\nassets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to\nbe recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes the\nenactment date.\nThe Company’s significant deferred tax assets are for net operating loss carryforwards, tax credits, accruals and reserves, and capitalized start-up costs. The\nCompany has provided a valuation allowance for its entire net deferred tax assets since inception as, due to its history of operating losses, the Company has\nconcluded that it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nThe Company has no unrecognized tax benefits. The Company classifies interest and penalties arising from the underpayment of income taxes in the condensed\nconsolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss as general and administrative expenses. No such expenses have been recognized during the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nWarrants\nUpon the issuance of warrants to purchase shares of common stock, the Company evaluates the terms of the warrant issue to determine the appropriate\naccounting and classification of the warrant issue pursuant to FASB ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, FASB ASC Topic 505, Equity,\nFASB ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, and classifies warrants for common stock as liabilities or\nequity. Warrants are classified as liabilities when the Company may be required to settle a warrant exercise in cash and classified as equity when the Company\nsettles a warrant exercise in shares of its common stock.\nSegment Information\nThe Company operates in one operating segment and, accordingly, no segment disclosures have been presented herein. All equipment, leasehold\nimprovements, and other fixed assets are physically located within the United States and all agreements with the Company’s partners are denominated in U.S.\ndollars, except where noted.\n19\nTable of Contents\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements – To Be Adopted\nFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standard setting bodies that the Company adopts as of the specified\neffective date.

DEBT\nLoan and Security Agreement with Hercules Capital, Inc.\nIn April 2022, the Company entered into a loan and security agreement (the “Hercules Loan and Security Agreement”) among the Company, certain of its\nsubsidiaries from time to time party thereto (together with the Company, collectively, the “Borrower”), Hercules Capital, Inc. (“Hercules”) and certain other\nlenders named therein (the “Lenders”). Under the Hercules Loan and Security Agreement, the Lenders provided the Company with access to a term loan with\nan aggregate principal amount of up to $75.0 million, in four tranches (collectively the “Term Loan”), including an initial tranche of $25.0 million, available to\nthe Company through June 15, 2023. Upon signing the Hercules Loan and Security Agreement, the Company drew an initial principal amount of $5.0 million\n(the “initial draw”). The Company incurred debt issuance costs of $0.2 million in connection with the Term Loan and paid to the Lenders a facility fee of\n$0.1 million, as well as $0.1 million of other expenses incurred by the Lenders and reimbursed by the Company (“Lender Expenses”) in connection with the\ninitial draw. The debt issuance costs and the Lender Expenses were being amortized as additional interest expense over the term of the loan.\nThe Company was originally obligated to make interest-only payments through April 1, 2024, which was extended to October 1, 2024 upon achievement of a\ndevelopment milestone in August 2022. In addition, the Borrower was required to pay an end-of-term fee equal to 6% of the principal amount of funded Term\nLoan advances at maturity, which were being accreted as additional interest expense over the term of the loan. The obligations of the Borrower under the\nHercules Loan and Security Agreement were secured by substantially all of the assets of the Borrower, excluding the Borrower’s intellectual property. The\nTerm Loan had a maturity date of October 1, 2026.\nIn August 2023, the Company executed an amendment to the Hercules Loan and Security Agreement (the “Hercules Amendment”) to modify certain terms of\nthe agreement and increase the aggregate principal amount to up to $150.0 million. Upon execution of the Hercules Amendment in August 2023, the Company\ndrew a principal amount of $15.0 million. The Hercules Amendment was determined to substantially alter the Hercules Loan and Security Agreement and\ntherefore was accounted for as a debt extinguishment. The Company\n23\nTable of Contents\nrecognized a loss on debt extinguishment of $0.2 million in August 2023 related to unamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs.\nUnder the Hercules Amendment, the Lenders provided the Company access to an increased term loan with an aggregate principal amount of up to\n$150.0 million, in four tranches (collectively the “Amended Term Loan”), consisting of (1) an initial tranche of $50.0 million, $5.0 million of which was drawn\nat closing of the Hercules Loan and Security Agreement in April 2022, $15.0 million of which was drawn at closing of the Hercules Amendment in August\n2023, $5.0 million of which was available through December 15, 2023, and $25.0 million of which is available from July 1, 2024 through December 15, 2024;\n(2) a second tranche of $20.0 million, subject to achievement of certain regulatory milestones, available through February 15, 2025; (3) a third tranche of\n$20.0 million, subject to achievement of certain regulatory milestones, available through March 31, 2025; and (4) a fourth tranche of $60.0 million subject to\napproval by the Lenders’ investment committee(s), available through June 15, 2025. The milestones for the second and third tranches have not yet been\nachieved. The obligations of the Borrower under the Hercules Amendment agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Borrower, excluding\nthe Borrower’s intellectual property. The Amended Term Loan has a maturity date of October 1, 2026.\nThe Amended Term Loan bears interest at a floating per annum rate equal to the greater of (i) 7.45% and (ii) 4.2% above the Prime Rate (as defined therein),\nprovided that the Term Loan interest rate shall not exceed a per annum rate of 8.95%. Interest is payable monthly in arrears on the first day of each month. The\ninterest rate as of September 30, 2024 was 8.95%.\nPer the terms of the Hercules Amendment, the Company was originally obligated to make interest-only payments through April 1, 2025. Upon achievement of\ncertain development milestones related to topline results for the Company’s phase 3 THRIVE trial in September 2024, the interest-only period was extended to\nOctober 1, 2025. If additional development milestones are met, the interest-only period will be further extended to April 1, 2026. The Borrower is required to\nrepay the Amended Term Loan amount in equal monthly installments of the principal amount and interest between the end of the interest-only period and the\nmaturity date of October 1, 2026. In addition, the Borrower is required to pay an end-of-term fee equal to 6% of the principal amount of funded Amended Term\nLoan advances at maturity, which are being accreted as additional interest expense over the term of the loan.\nThe total cost of all items (cash interest, the amortization/accretion of the debt issuance costs and the end-of-term fee) is being recognized as interest expense\nusing an effective interest rate of approximately 9.3%. The Company recorded interest expense of $0.5 million and $1.7 million during the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, and $0.4 million and $0.8 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes the components of the Term Loan, on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2024:\nSeptember 30, 2024\n(in thousands)\nGross term loan proceeds $ 20,000\nAccrued end-of-term fee 523\nTotal debt $ 20,523\nLess: current portion of long-term debt —\nLong-term debt, net $ 20,523\n24\nTable of Contents\nThe carrying value of the Term Loan approximates its fair value.

COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS\nLicense Agreement with Zenas BioPharma\nIn October 2020, the Company became party to a license agreement with Zenas BioPharma (Cayman) Limited (“Zenas BioPharma”) to license technology\ncomprising certain materials, patent rights, and know-how to Zenas BioPharma. Since February 2021, the Company has entered into several letter agreements\nwith Zenas BioPharma pursuant to which the Company agreed to provide assistance to Zenas BioPharma with certain development activities, including\nmanufacturing. In May 2022, the Company entered into a Manufacturing Development and Supply Agreement with Zenas BioPharma to manufacture and\nsupply, or to have manufactured and supplied, clinical drug product for developmental purposes. The license agreement and subsequent letter agreements and\nsupply agreement (collectively, the “Zenas Agreements”) were negotiated with a single commercial objective and are treated as a combined contract for\naccounting purposes. Under the terms of the Zenas Agreements, the Company granted Zenas BioPharma an exclusive license to develop, manufacture, and\ncommercialize certain IGF-1R directed antibody products for non-oncology indications in the greater area of China.\nAs consideration for the Zenas Agreements, the transaction price included upfront non-cash consideration and variable consideration in the form of payment for\nthe Company’s goods and services and milestone payments due upon the achievement of specified events. Under the Zenas Agreements, the Company can\nreceive non-refundable milestone payments upon achieving specific milestone events during the contract term. Additionally, the Company may receive royalty\npayments based on a percentage of the annual net sales of any licensed products sold on a country-by-country basis in the greater area of China. The royalty\npercentage may vary based on different tiers of annual net sales of the licensed products made. Zenas BioPharma is obligated to make royalty payments to the\nCompany for the royalty term in the Zenas Agreements.\nThe Zenas Agreements would qualify as a collaborative arrangement under the scope of Accounting Standards Codification, Topic 808, Collaborative\nArrangements (“ASC 808”). While this arrangement is in the scope of ASC 808, the Company applied ASC 606 to account for certain aspects of this\narrangement. The Company applied ASC 606 for certain activities within the arrangement associated with the Company’s transfer of a good or service (i.e., a\nunit of account) that is part of the Company’s ongoing major or central operations. The Company allocated the transaction price based on the relative estimated\nstandalone selling prices of each performance obligation or, in the case of certain variable consideration, to one or more performance obligations. Research and\ndevelopment activities are priced generally at cost. The Company’s license of goods and services to Zenas BioPharma during the contract term was determined\nto be a single performance obligation satisfied over time. The Company will recognize the transaction price from the license agreement over the Company’s\nestimated period to complete its activities.\nAt the inception of the arrangement, the Company evaluated whether the milestones were considered probable of being reached and estimated the amount to be\nincluded in the transaction price using the most likely amount\n25\nTable of Contents\nmethod. As it was not probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, none of the associated milestone payments were included in the transaction\nprice at contract inception. For the sales-based royalties included in the arrangement, the license was deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties\nrelate. The Company will recognize royalty revenues at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or\nall of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company\nrecognized $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively, of collaboration revenue related to the Zenas Agreements. During the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, the Company recognized $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively, of collaboration revenue related to the Zenas Agreements.\nIn January 2024, the Company entered into a letter agreement with Zenas BioPharma (the “Zenas Letter Agreement”) pursuant to which Zenas BioPharma\nagreed to support the Company’s THRIVE-2 and STRIVE trials by initiating and managing the studies in China. Under the Zenas Letter Agreement, the\nCompany agreed to reimburse costs incurred by Zenas BioPharma, including a full-time equivalent rate for services rendered. In connection with the execution\nof the Zenas Letter Agreement, the Company made an initial payment of $1.5 million, which was recorded as research and development expense during the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 as services were performed.\nThe Zenas Agreements are considered related party transactions because Fairmount Funds Management LLC (“Fairmount”) beneficially owns more than 5% of\nthe Company’s common stock and is also a 5% or greater stockholder of Zenas BioPharma and has a seat on Zenas BioPharma’s board of directors.\nAntibody and Discovery Option Agreement with Paragon Therapeutics, Inc.\nIn January 2022, the Company and Paragon Therapeutics, Inc. (“Paragon”) entered into an antibody and discovery option agreement (the “Paragon Research\nAgreement”) under which the Company and Paragon will cooperate to develop one or more proteins or antibodies. Under the terms of the Paragon Research\nAgreement, Paragon will perform certain development activities in accordance with an agreed upon research plan, and the Company will pay Paragon agreed\nupon development fees in exchange for Paragon’s commitment of the necessary personnel and resources to perform these activities. The Paragon Research\nAgreement stipulates a final deliverable to the Company comprising of a report summarizing the experiments and processes performed under the research plan\n(the “Final Deliverable”).\nAdditionally, Paragon agreed to grant the Company an option for an exclusive license to all of Paragon’s right, title and interest in and to certain antibody\ntechnology and the Final Deliverable, and a non-exclusive license to certain background intellectual property owned by Paragon solely to research, develop,\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale and import of the licensed intellectual property and resulting products worldwide (each, an “Option” and together, the “Options”).\nParagon also granted to the Company a limited, exclusive, royalty-free license, without the right to sublicense, to certain antibody technology and the Final\nDeliverable, and a non-exclusive, royalty-free license without the right to sublicense, under certain background intellectual property owned by Paragon, solely\nto evaluate the antibody technology and Option and for the purpose of allowing the Company to determine whether to exercise the Option with respect to\ncertain programs. The Company may, at its sole discretion, exercise the Option with respect to specified programs (“Programs”) at any time until the date that\nis 90 days after the Company’s receipt of the Final Deliverable the applicable program, or such longer period as agreed upon by the parties (“Option Period”)\nby delivering written notice of such exercise to Paragon. If the Company fails to exercise an Option prior to expiration of the applicable Option Period, such\nOption for such Programs will terminate. In consideration for Paragon’s grant of the Options to the Company, the Company paid to Paragon a non-refundable,\nnon-creditable one-time fee of $2.5 million, which was recorded as research and development expense during the three months ended March 31, 2022. In\nDecember 2022, the Company and Paragon entered into a first amendment to the Paragon Research Agreement, under which the Company obtained an\nadditional limited license for the purpose of conducting certain activities. In consideration for the rights and licenses obtained under the first amendment,\nViridian paid Paragon a non-refundable fee of\n26\nTable of Contents\n$2.3 million (the “First Amendment Payment”), which was recorded as research and development expense during the three months ended December 31, 2022.\nThe non-refundable upfront fee and the First Amendment Payment are separate from any development costs or cost advance paid or owing with respect to the\nspecified program.\nIn October 2023, the Company entered into a License Agreement with Paragon (the “Paragon License Agreement”) as a result of exercising its Option under\nthe Paragon Research Agreement to obtain exclusive licenses to develop, manufacture and commercialize certain antibodies, proteins and associated products.\nIn connection with the execution of the Paragon License Agreement, the Company made an initial payment of $5.3 million, which was recorded as research\nand development expense during the three months ended December 31, 2023. As further described below, the Paragon License Agreement was amended and\nrestated by the Amended and Restated License Agreement with Paragon in September 2024.\nIn January 2024, the Company entered into a letter agreement with Paragon pursuant to which Paragon agreed to continue to perform development activities\nunder the existing Paragon Research Agreement and Paragon License Agreement, which the Company renewed in July 2024. In consideration for the\ndevelopment activities to be conducted by Paragon, the Company will reimburse Paragon for actual development costs incurred and agreed upon development\nfees in exchange for Paragon’s commitment of the necessary personnel and resources to perform these activities. In September 2024, the Company entered into\na second amendment to the Paragon Research Agreement to include additional development activities to be performed by Paragon. Under the amended Paragon\nResearch Agreement, the Company will be obligated to make a one-time non-refundable payment of $3.5 million to Paragon following the achievement of\ncertain research and development objectives.\nIn September 2024, the Company entered into the Amended and Restated License Agreement with Paragon (the “Amended Paragon License Agreement”)\nwhich amended and restated the Paragon License Agreement. In connection with the execution of the Amended Paragon License Agreement, the Company paid\nParagon a non-refundable fee of $4.0 million in September 2024, which was recorded as research and development expense during the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024. In consideration for rights granted by Paragon, the Company is obligated to make certain future milestone payments of up to $16.0 million\non a program-by-program bases upon the achievement of specified clinical or regulatory milestones, with total milestone payments under all programs not to\nexceed $40.0 million. Additionally, if the Company develops a product utilizing certain intellectual property rights granted to it under the Amended Paragon\nLicense Agreement, the Company is obligated to pay Paragon potential additional future development milestone payments of up to $3.1 million and\ncommercial milestone payments of up to $17.0 million with respect to such product. If the Company successfully commercializes any product candidate\nsubject to the Amended Paragon License Agreement, it is responsible for royalty payments equal to a percentage in the mid-single digits of such product’s net\nsales.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded $7.7 million and $10.9 million, respectively, in research and development\ncosts related to the Paragon Research Agreement and Amended Paragon License Agreement (collectively, the “Paragon Agreements”). During the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded $1.1 million and $6.5 million, respectively, in research and development costs related to the\nParagon Agreements.\nThe Paragon Agreements are considered related party transactions because Fairmount beneficially owns more than 5% of the Company’s capital stock and has\ntwo seats on the Company’s board of directors, and beneficially owns more than 5% of Paragon, which is a joint venture between Fairmount and FairJourney\nBiologics, and has appointed the sole director on Paragon’s board of directors and has the contractual right to approve the appointment of any executive\nofficers.\n27\nTable of Contents\n7.

Under the terms of the agreement, the Company was granted an exclusive,\nroyalty-bearing, worldwide license to develop, manufacture, and commercialize certain licensed compounds and licensed products in the field (the “License”).\nIn consideration for the rights granted by the License, the Company initially issued 204,843 shares of its common stock to certain stockholders of the third-\nparty. The shares were valued at $5.0 million and recorded as research and development expense during the three months ended June 30, 2023.

The lease term was amended in March 2021 to extend the lease maturity date to December 31, 2024. Upon adoption of ASC 842 and upon\nsubsequent modification of the lease in 2020 and in March 2021, the Company recognized a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability for the\nColorado Lease of approximately $1.6 million by calculating the present value of lease payments, discounted at 6%, the Company’s estimated incremental\nborrowing rate, over the 12 months expected remaining term.\nIn September 2024, the Company entered into a new, multi-year lease agreement for its Colorado-based office and lab space (the “New Colorado Lease”).\nUnder ASC 842, the New Colorado Lease was treated as a lease modification representing an extension of the lease term for a reduced portion of the space\ncurrently in use under the existing Colorado Lease. As of the effective date, the Company recorded a $0.3 million increase in the right-of-use asset and\ncorresponding lease liability for the extension of the lease term.

The Massachusetts Lease provides for annual base rent of approximately\n$0.5 million during the lease term. The Company is also obligated to pay the landlord certain costs, taxes and operating expenses. Under the Fourth\nAmendment, the Massachusetts Lease will expire in July 2029. The Company has the option to extend the lease term for an additional period of three years\nupon notice to the landlord.\nThe Company recorded a new right-of-use asset of $1.6 million and corresponding lease liability of $1.9 million for the New Premises and simultaneously\nderecognized the right-of-use asset of $1.1 million and corresponding lease liability of $1.2 million for the Original Premises on the lease commencement date\nin April 2024.\nIn September 2024, the Company entered into a Fifth Amendment of the Massachusetts Lease (the “Fifth Amendment”) to lease an additional 2,788 square feet\nof office space in the same building. The Fifth Amendment provides for additional annual base rent of approximately $0.1 million for the additional office\nspace and includes annual base rent escalation clauses during the lease term. The Fifth Amendment was treated as a lease modification accounted for as a\nseparate contract and the Company recorded a new right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability of approximately $0.5 million related to the Fifth\nAmendment on the lease commencement date.\nFuture lease payments under noncancellable leases as of September 30, 2024 are as follows:\n(in thousands)\n2024 (remainder) 273\n2025 723\n2026 748\n2027 613\n2028 627\n2029 370\nTotal future minimum lease payments 3,354\nLess: imputed interest (603)\nTotal $ 2,751\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company’s operating lease obligations were reflected as short-term operating lease liabilities of $0.6 million within accrued\nliabilities and $2.2 million of long-term lease obligations as other liabilities in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nAmortization of the operating lease right-of-use assets, and corresponding reduction of operating lease obligations, amounted to $0.2 million and $0.8 million\nfor the three and nine months ended September 30,\n30\nTable of Contents\n2024, respectively, which was included in operating expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

The Black-\nScholes model requires inputs for risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility, and expected terms of the options. Because the Company has a limited\nhistory of stock purchase and sale activity, expected volatility is based on a blend of historical data from public companies that are similar to the Company in\nsize and nature of operations, as well as the Company’s own volatility. The Company will continue to use similar entity volatility information until its historical\nvolatility is relevant to measure expected volatility for option grants. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur. The risk-free rate for periods within\nthe contractual life of each option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant for a period commensurate with the expected term\nof the grant. The expected term (without regard to forfeitures) for options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be\noutstanding and is derived from the contractual terms of the options granted, and actual and expected option-exercise behaviors. The fair value of the\nunderlying common stock is based on the closing price of the common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market at the date of grant.\n35\nTable of Contents\nThe weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $10.83 and $23.19,\nrespectively. The fair value was determined by the Black-Scholes option pricing model using the following weighted-average assumptions:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nExpected term, in years 5.11 5.57\nExpected volatility 88.8% 90.8%\nRisk-free interest rate 4.3% 3.8%\nExpected dividend yield —% —%\nWeighted average exercise price $15.08 $31.07\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nThe 2016 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) allows qualified employees to purchase shares of common stock at a price equal to 85% of the lower of: (i)\nthe closing price at the beginning of the offering period or (ii) the closing price at the end of the offering period. As of September 30, 2024, the Company\nhad 1,187,109 shares available for issuance, and 102,426 cumulative shares had been issued under the ESPP.\nShare-Based Compensation Expense\nShare-based compensation related to all equity awards issued pursuant to the Equity Incentive Plans, the Inducement Awards, and for estimated shares to be\nissued under the ESPP for the purchase periods active during each respective period is included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and\ncomprehensive loss as follows:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands) (in thousands)\nResearch and development $ 4,673 $ 4,003 $ 17,142 $ 11,671\nGeneral and administrative 4,047 9,603 16,033 29,453\nTotal share-based compensation expense $ 8,720 $ 13,606 $ 33,175 $ 41,124\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded an additional $4.6 million in share-based compensation related to the acceleration\nof vesting for former executive officers, an amount which includes $0.3 million related to the modification of the terms of options outstanding at the time of\ntermination for one executive which would have otherwise forfeited. The Company also recorded $2.0 million in share-based compensation related to the\naccounting for a modification of the equity awards to extend the post-termination exercise period of certain vested stock options for a former executive.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded an additional $9.1 million in share-based compensation related to the acceleration\nof vesting for former executive officers, an amount which includes $1.6 million related to the modification of the terms of options outstanding at the time of\ntermination for one executive which would have otherwise forfeited.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had $87.1 million of total unrecognized share-based compensation costs related to stock options, which the Company\nexpects to recognize over a weighted-average remaining period of 2.95 years.

NET LOSS PER SHARE\nBasic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common stock outstanding.\nDiluted net loss per share is computed similarly to basic net loss per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional shares\nof common stock that would have been outstanding if the potential shares of common stock had been issued and if the additional shares of common stock were\ndilutive. Diluted net loss per share is the same as basic net loss per share of common stock, as the effects of potentially dilutive securities are antidilutive.\nPotentially dilutive securities include the following:\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nSeries A Preferred Stock (as converted to shares of common stock) 8,991,383 11,496,241\nSeries B Preferred Stock (as converted to shares of common stock) 9,677,817 3,414,171\nOptions to purchase common stock 11,352,087 8,261,261\nWarrants to purchase common stock 249,883 249,883\nRestricted stock units 514,540 338,875\nTotal 30,785,710 23,760,431\n37\nTable of Contents\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read together with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included in\nPart I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report and our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in\nour Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 27, 2024 (“2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K”). This discussion and other parts of this\nreport contain forward-looking statements reflecting our current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives, expectations,\nintentions, and beliefs. See “Forward-Looking Statements” for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks, and assumptions associated with these statements.\nActual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute\nto such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section entitled “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this\nQuarterly Report.\nOverview and Recent Developments\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing potential best-in-class medicines for serious and rare diseases.\nWe target disease areas where marketed therapies often leave room for improvements in efficacy, safety, and/or dosing convenience. We believe that first-\ngeneration medicines rarely represent optimal solutions, especially in rare disease areas, and that there is potential to develop differentiated, best-in-class\nmedicines that could lead to improved patient outcomes, reduced side effects, improved quality of life, expanded market access, and augmented market\ncompetition. Our business model is designed to identify and evaluate product opportunities in disease areas where trial data establishes proof-of-concept for a\ndrug target in the clinic, but the competitive evolution of the product life cycle management and number of entrants appears incomplete. We intend to prioritize\nindications where a fast-follower and a potentially differentiated drug candidate, or overall product profile, could create significant medical benefit for patients.\nWe are engineering product candidates to address unmet medical needs for patients and further advance drug innovation.\nOur goal is to identify and evaluate product concepts leveraging clinically validated molecular targets using established therapeutic modalities. We prioritize\nproduct concepts that are aligned with clinical and commercial hypotheses, which we expect will provide an attractive balance of risk and opportunity, thereby\nrepresenting a compelling allocation of our resources. We focus on advancing therapeutic proteins, including antibodies, that we either in-license or discover\ninternally, incorporating proprietary therapeutic protein and antibody discovery and optimization platforms to advance clinical candidates with unique\ncharacteristics. We have built relevant expertise in protein and antibody discovery and engineering, biologics manufacturing, nonclinical and clinical\ndevelopment for TED, development of anti-neonatal Fc receptor therapies, and nonclinical and clinical development for indications in rare and autoimmune\ndiseases.\nOur approach to rapidly discovering and developing novel therapeutics relies on our scientific expertise in evaluating pre-existing clinical proof-of-concept\ndata for the drug targets we are pursuing, and opportunities to improve upon existing investigational and/or approved therapies. This approach informs how we\ndesign, select, and develop our product candidates, including in critical areas such as pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, clinical trial design, trial\nendpoints, and the selection and recruitment of patients. We believe this strategy reduces the risks associated with discovering and developing novel\ntherapeutics.\nWe have first prioritized the development of therapies for the treatment of TED, a serious and debilitating rare autoimmune disease that causes inflammation\nwithin the orbit of the eye that can cause bulging of the eyes, redness and swelling, double vision, pain, and potential blindness. TED significantly impacts\nquality of life, imposing a high burden on activities of daily living and mental health for patients suffering from the disease. TED is a progressive disease\nconsisting of an initial active phase, followed by a transition to a secondary\n38\nTable of Contents\nchronic phase. The only medicine approved by the FDA for TED is Tepezza® (teprotumumab), which is an intravenously administered monoclonal antibody\nthat targets IGF-1R. Tepezza® is marketed in the United States by Horizon Therapeutics plc (“Horizon”), which was acquired by Amgen Inc. (“Amgen”) in\nOctober 2023.\nThe results from clinical trials of teprotumumab conducted by Horizon provide strong clinical validation linking the targeting of IGF-1R to clinical benefit in\npatients with TED. However, clinical trials evaluating teprotumumab in patients with TED reported to date used a single dosing regimen, providing little\nguidance as to the optimal dosing required for clinical activity in TED. We believe that there are multiple opportunities to develop fast-follower therapeutics\nthat improve on teprotumumab’s features, including dosing schedule, route of administration, and safety profile.\nWe are developing two product candidates, veligrotug (formerly known as VRDN-001) for intravenous and VRDN-003 for subcutaneous administration, to\ntreat patients who suffer from TED. Our most advanced program, veligrotug, is a differentiated humanized monoclonal antibody targeting IGF-1R\nintravenously administered for the treatment of TED. In previously presented in vitro preclinical data, we showed that veligrotug is a potentially differentiated\nfull antagonist of IGF-1R, compared to teprotumumab’s incomplete antagonism of IGF-1R. We also conducted phase 1/2 clinical trials of veligrotug in patients\nwith active or chronic TED. In the active TED portion of the phase 1/2 clinical trials, data reported from all three dose cohorts of veligrotug (n=21) showed\nsignificant and rapid improvement in both the signs and symptoms of TED after two infusions of veligrotug compared to placebo. Across all veligrotug treated\npatients in the active TED trial, 71% were proptosis responders, 67% were overall responders, 62% achieved a CAS of 0 or 1, and 54% had complete\nresolution of their diplopia. In the chronic TED portion of the phase 1/2 clinical trials, data reported from both dose cohorts of veligrotug (n=12) showed\nsignificant and rapid improvement in the signs and symptoms of TED after two infusions of veligrotug compared to placebo. Across all veligrotug treated\npatients in the chronic TED trial, 42% were proptosis responders, 40% achieved a CAS of 0 or 1, and no patients had complete resolution of their diplopia. In\nthe phase 1/2 clinical trials of both active and chronic TED, veligrotug had a favorable safety profile and was well-tolerated by all patients treated in all dose\ncohorts.\nWe are conducting a global pivotal program for veligrotug, including evaluating its efficacy and safety in two global well-controlled phase 3 clinical trials,\nTHRIVE and THRIVE-2, for the treatment of active and chronic TED, respectively. On September 10, 2024, we announced topline data from the THRIVE\nstudy, which enrolled 113 patients, randomized to veligrotug (n=75) and placebo (n=38). THRIVE achieved all primary and secondary endpoints with a high\nlevel of statistical significance (p < 0.0001) and was generally well-tolerated, with no treatment-related SAEs. Veligrotug additionally showed a rapid onset of\naction, with the majority (53%) of veligrotug-treated patients achieving a proptosis response after just one infusion, or three weeks after start of therapy. We\ncompleted enrollment of THRIVE-2 in July 2024, and expect to announce topline data for this study by the end of 2024. THRIVE and THRIVE-2 are each\ndesigned to compare a five-dose IV treatment arm of veligrotug at 10 mg/kg, dosed three weeks apart, to placebo. This five-dose veligrotug regimen features\nfewer infusions and a shorter time per infusion compared to teprotumumab, the currently marketed IGF-1R inhibitor. In addition, to meet the 300 patient\nstandard safety database requirements for the veligrotug biologics license application (“BLA”), we are actively enrolling patients into our STRIVE clinical\ntrial. STRIVE is a global study of veligrotug in TED patients that utilizes broad inclusion criteria (e.g., any severity or duration of disease) and is randomized\n3:1 (10 mg/kg IV with an active control of 3 mg/kg IV). We are also enrolling patients in the open label extension study for non-responding patients in\nTHRIVE and THRIVE-2. We anticipate filing a BLA for veligrotug in the second half of 2025.\nIn addition to our veligrotug IV program, in December 2023 we selected VRDN-003 as our subcutaneous product candidate for pivotal development in TED\nfollowing positive data in a phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers. We believe VRDN-003 has the potential to be the best-in-class subcutaneous anti-IGF-\n1R product candidate by preserving the efficacy of anti-IGF-1Rs in TED, improving safety, and maximizing convenience for patients. VRDN-003 has the same\nbinding domain as veligrotug, and was engineered to have a longer half-\n39\nTable of Contents\nlife. VRDN-003 is designed to be a low-volume, self-administered, infrequently dosed subcutaneous IGF-1R for TED, which we plan to launch commercially\nwith an auto-injector.\nThe VRDN-003 phase 1 clinical study showed VRDN-003 to have a prolonged half-life of 40 to 50 days, which is four to five times that of veligrotug. Because\nof the healthy volunteer data and the similarities between the veligrotug and VRDN-003 antibodies, we expect VRDN-003 to have similar clinical responses at\nthe exposure levels of veligrotug that led to robust clinical activity in its clinical trials to date in TED. Further, pharmacokinetic modeling of VRDN-003 based\non the healthy volunteer data predicted that exposure levels of VRDN-003 could be achieved that are equivalent to exposure levels of veligrotug that produced\nclinically meaningful results with multiple dosing regimens of VRDN-003, i.e., subcutaneous injection every two, four, or eight weeks. We are advancing our\nVRDN-003 program, including the initiation of two global phase 3 clinical trials for VRDN-003 in August 2024: REVEAL-1 and REVEAL-2 in active and\nchronic TED, respectively. Both studies will evaluate subcutaneous VRDN-003 administered every four weeks or every eight weeks and will assess outcomes\nversus placebo. We also anticipate that the program will include a safety study to complete a 300 patient standard safety database (to include patients from the\nREVEAL-1 and REVEAL-2 trials), and we expect that it will also include the required development to have an auto-injector device available at the time of\ncommercial launch, if approved. We anticipate topline data for REVEAL-1 and REVEAL-2 in the first half of 2026, and we anticipate submitting a BLA for\nVRDN-003 for the treatment of TED by the end of 2026.\nIn addition to developing therapies for TED, we have also prioritized developing a portfolio of engineered anti-FcRn inhibitors, including VRDN-006 and\nVRDN-008. FcRn inhibitors have the potential to treat a broad array of autoimmune diseases, representing a possible significant commercial market\nopportunity. Our multi-pronged engineering approach has resulted in a portfolio of FcRn-targeting molecules that leverage the clinically and commercially\nvalidated mechanism of FcRn inhibition while potentially addressing the limitations of current agents such as incomplete immunoglobulin G (“IgG”)\nsuppression, safety, and inconvenience of dosing.\nVRDN-006 is a FcRn-targeting Fc fragment, and in non-human primate studies, demonstrated specificity for blocking FcRn-IgG interactions while not\nshowing decreases in albumin or increases in LDL levels, which are known potential side effects associated with certain full-length anti-FcRn monoclonal\nantibodies. In our head-to-head non-human primate studies, VRDN-006 demonstrated comparable potency and IgG reductions to efgartigimod, which is the\ncurrent standard of care in FcRn inhibition, as well as a similar safety profile. We plan to file an IND for VRDN-006 by the end of 2024 and expect healthy\nvolunteer data for VRDN-006 in the second half of 2025. VRDN-008 is a novel, potential first-in-class FcRn inhibitor that aims to pair IgG suppression with\nextended half-life technology, potentially enabling deeper and more durable suppression of IgG than existing anti-FcRn therapies. Both molecules are designed\nto be convenient, self-administered, subcutaneous products.\nGlobal Economic Considerations\nThe global macroeconomic environment is uncertain, and could be negatively affected by, among other things, increased U.S. trade tariffs and trade disputes\nwith other countries, instability in the global capital and credit markets, supply chain weaknesses, and instability in the geopolitical environment, including as a\nresult of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the rising tensions between China and Taiwan, the conflict in Israel and surrounding area and other political tensions.\nSuch challenges have caused, and may continue to cause, recession fears, concerns regarding potential sanctions, high interest rates, foreign exchange volatility\nand inflationary pressures. At this time, we are unable to quantify the potential effects of this economic instability on our future operations.\n40\nTable of Contents\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nOur revenue has historically consisted primarily of up-front payments for licenses, milestone payments, and payments for other research and development\nservices earned under license and collaboration agreements as well as for amounts earned under certain grants we have been awarded.\nIn October 2020, we became party to a license agreement with Zenas BioPharma (Cayman) Limited (“Zenas BioPharma”). Since February 2021, we have\nentered into several letter agreements with Zenas BioPharma in which we agreed to provide assistance to Zenas BioPharma with certain development activities,\nincluding manufacturing (collectively with the license agreement, the “Zenas Agreements”). Under the terms of the Zenas Agreements, we granted Zenas\nBioPharma an exclusive license to develop, manufacture, and commercialize certain IGF-1R directed antibody products for non-oncology indications in the\ngreater area of China in exchange for upfront non-cash consideration and non-refundable milestone payments upon achieving specific milestone events during\nthe contract term. Zenas BioPharma announced that it had obtained IND approval in China in July 2022. Under the license agreement, we received a $1.0\nmillion milestone payment from Zenas BioPharma. Additionally, we are eligible to receive royalty payments based on a percentage of the annual net sales of\nany licensed products sold on a country-by-country basis in the greater area of China. The royalty percentage may vary based on different tiers of annual net\nsales of the licensed products made. Zenas BioPharma is obligated to make royalty payments to us for the royalty term in the Zenas Agreements. In May 2022,\nwe entered into a Manufacturing Development and Supply Agreement with Zenas BioPharma to manufacture and supply, or have manufactured and supplied,\nclinical drug product for development purposes.\nIn the future, we expect to continue to generate revenue from a combination of license fees and other up-front payments, payments for research and\ndevelopment services, milestone payments, product sales, and royalties in connection with strategic alliances. We expect that any revenue we generate could\nfluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing of our achievement of development and commercial milestones, the timing and amount of payments\nrelating to such milestones, and the extent to which any of our product candidates are approved and successfully commercialized by us or our strategic alliance\ncollaborators, if any. If we or our strategic alliance collaborators, if any, fail to develop product candidates in a timely manner or to obtain regulatory approval\nfor them, then our ability to generate future revenue, and our results of operations and financial position would be adversely affected.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist of costs incurred for the research and development of our therapeutic programs and product candidates, which\ninclude:\n• employee-related expenses, including salaries, severance, retention, benefits, insurance, and share-based compensation expense;\n• expenses incurred under agreements with clinical research organizations (“CROs”), investigative sites that conduct our clinical trials, and other\nclinical trial-related vendors, and consultants;\n• the costs of acquiring, developing, and manufacturing and testing clinical and preclinical materials, including costs incurred under agreements with\ncontract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”);\n• costs associated with non-clinical activities and regulatory operations;\n• license fees and milestone payments related to the acquisition and retention of certain licensed technology and intellectual property rights; and\n41\nTable of Contents\n• facilities, depreciation, market research, and other expenses, which include allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, depreciation of\nleasehold improvements and equipment, and laboratory supplies.\nWe make non-refundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities. These payments are\nrecorded as expense in the period in which we receive or take ownership of the goods or when the services are performed.\nWe record up-front and milestone payments to acquire and retain contractual rights to in-licensed technology and intellectual property rights as research and\ndevelopment expenses when incurred if there is uncertainty in our receiving future economic benefit from the acquired contractual rights. We consider future\neconomic benefits from acquired contractual rights to licensed technology to be uncertain until such a drug candidate is approved by the FDA or other\nregulatory authorities, or when other significant risk factors are abated.\nWe expect that our research and development expenses will increase as we expand our clinical development programs and initiate new clinical trials. The\nprocess of conducting clinical trials and preclinical studies necessary to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time consuming. We, or our strategic alliance\ncollaborators, if any, may never succeed in achieving marketing approval for any of our product candidates. The probability of success for each product\ncandidate may be affected by numerous factors, including clinical data, preclinical data, competition, manufacturability, and commercial viability of our\nproduct candidates.\nSuccessful development of future product candidates is highly uncertain and may not result in approved products. Completion dates and completion costs can\nvary significantly for each future product candidate and are difficult to predict. We anticipate we will make determinations as to which programs to pursue and\nhow much funding to direct to each program on an ongoing basis in response to our ability to maintain or enter into new strategic alliances with respect to each\nprogram or potential product candidate, the scientific and clinical success of each future product candidate, and ongoing assessments as to each future product\ncandidate’s commercial potential. We will need to raise additional capital and may seek additional strategic alliances in the future in order to advance the\nvarious clinical trials that are part of our clinical development program described above.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits, including share-based compensation, and severance and retention\nbenefits related to our finance, accounting, human resources, legal, business development, and other support functions, professional fees for auditing, tax, and\nlegal services, market research and other professional and consulting fees to prepare for commercial activities, as well as insurance, board of director\ncompensation, consulting, and other administrative expenses.\nOther Income, net\nOther income, net consists primarily of interest income, net of fees, and various income items of a non-recurring nature. Interest expense consists of cash and\nnon-cash interest expense on our long-term debt. We earn interest income from interest-bearing accounts, money market funds, and short-term investments.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThere were no changes to our critical accounting policies as disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K during the nine months ended September 30,\n2024. Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our condensed consolidated financial\nstatements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report.\n42\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 Increase (Decrease)\n(in thousands)\nCollaboration revenue - related party $ 86 $ 72 $ 14\nResearch and development expenses 69,158 30,385 38,773\nGeneral and administrative expenses 14,408 20,911 (6,503)\nOther income, net 6,791 3,564 3,227\nRevenue\nRevenue for both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was attributable to our collaboration agreement with Zenas BioPharma.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses were $69.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $30.4 million during the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. The $38.8 million increase in research and development expenses is primarily attributable to the following:\n• $17.4 million increase in clinical trial costs mainly due to expenses associated with our ongoing THRIVE and THRIVE-2 clinical trials;\n• $10.6 million increase in chemistry, manufacturing and controls costs to support our ongoing and planned clinical trials;\n• $3.3 million increase in milestone, license and option fees due to the $4.0 million upfront payment to Paragon for an exclusive license agreement\nduring the three months ended September 30, 2024;\n• $4.3 million increase in preclinical research costs to advance our FcRn inhibitor portfolio; and\n• $2.9 million increase in personnel related costs, due primarily to increased headcount to support our ongoing research and development efforts,\nincluding share-based compensation and other employee compensation and recruiting costs.\nWe expect our research and development expenses to increase as we continue to advance our clinical and preclinical programs.\n43\nTable of Contents\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $14.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $20.9 million during the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. The $6.5 million decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to a $7.1 million decrease in\npersonnel-related costs, primarily due to a decrease in headcount and a decrease in share-based compensation and other employee compensation and recruiting\ncosts. This decrease is partially offset by a $0.7 million increase in market research and other professional services fees.\nOther Income, net\nOther income, net was $6.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $3.6 million during the three months ended September 30,\n2023. Other income, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is comprised of $7.5 million of interest income earned on short-term investments, $0.2\nmillion gain on investment as well as $0.1 million of sub-lease income, offset by $0.5 million in interest expense related to our Hercules Loan and Security\nAgreement and $0.4 million loss on disposal of equipment. Other income, net for the three months ended September 30, 2023 is comprised of $4.1 million of\ninterest income earned on short-term investments as well as $0.1 million of sub-lease income, partially offset by $0.4 million in interest expense related to our\nHercules Loan and Security Agreement and a $0.2 million loss on debt extinguishment related to the Hercules Amendment. The increase in interest income, as\ncompared to prior year, is primarily attributable to higher average short-term investment balances during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as\ncompared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nComparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 Increase (Decrease)\n(in thousands)\nCollaboration revenue - related party $ 230 $ 242 $ (12)\nResearch and development expenses 166,294 121,208 45,086\nGeneral and administrative expenses 45,499 62,006 (16,507)\nOther income, net 21,339 12,098 9,241\nRevenue\nRevenue for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was attributable to our collaboration agreement with Zenas BioPharma.\nResearch and development expenses were $166.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $121.2 million during the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. The $45.1 million increase in research and development expenses is primarily attributable to the following:\n• $37.6 million increase in clinical trial costs mainly due to expenses associated with our ongoing THRIVE and THRIVE-2 clinical trials;\n• $8.5 million increase in chemistry, manufacturing and controls costs to support our ongoing and planned clinical trials;\n44\nTable of Contents\n• $4.2 million increase in severance costs primarily related to separation agreements with former executive officers, including a $3.2 million increase in\nshare-based compensation related to the acceleration of stock option vesting during the nine months ended September 30, 2024;\n• $8.1 million increase in personnel related costs, due primarily to increase in headcount to support our ongoing research and development efforts,\nincluding increased share-based compensation and other employee compensation and recruiting costs;\n• $2.4 million increase in professional service fees for consultants and contractors to support ongoing programs; and\n• $0.9 million increase in preclinical research costs to advance our FcRn inhibitor portfolio.\nThese increases are partially offset by a $16.7 million decrease in milestone, license and option fees as a result of the $15.0 million upfront payment for\ndevelopment of subcutaneous delivery systems and the $5.7 million upfront payment for an exclusive license and collaboration agreement incurred during the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023, offset by the $4.0 million upfront payment to Paragon for an exclusive license agreement during the nine months\nended September 30, 2024.\nWe expect our research and development expenses to increase as we continue to advance our clinical and preclinical programs.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $45.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $62.0 million during the nine months\nended September 30, 2023. The $16.5 million decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to the following:\n• $8.2 million decrease in severance costs primarily related to separation agreements with former executive officers, including a $5.7 million decrease in\nshare-based compensation related to the modification and acceleration of stock option vesting for former executives. Share-based compensation costs\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included $3.4 million in costs related to the modification and acceleration of vesting for former\nexecutive officers as compared to $9.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023; and\n• $8.8 million decrease in personnel-related costs, primarily due to a decrease in headcount and a decrease in share-based compensation and other\nemployee compensation and recruiting costs.\nThese decreases were partially offset by a $0.9 million increase in consulting and other professional services fees.\nOther Income, net\nOther income, net was $21.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $12.1 million during the nine months ended September\n30, 2023. Other income, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is comprised of $23.1 million of interest income earned on cash equivalents and\nshort-term investments, $0.2 million gain on investment as well as $0.3 million of sub-lease income, offset by $1.7 million in interest expense related to our\nHercules Loan and Security Agreement and $0.4 million loss on disposal of equipment. Other income, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is\ncomprised of $12.8 million of interest income earned on cash equivalents and short-term investments as well as $0.2 million of sub-lease income, partially\noffset by $0.8 million in interest expense related to our Hercules Loan and Security Agreement and a $0.2 million loss on debt extinguishment related to the\nHercules Amendment. The increase in\n45\nTable of Contents\ninterest income, as compared to prior year, is primarily attributable to higher average cash equivalent and short-term investment balances during the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have funded our operations to date principally through proceeds received from the sale of our common stock, our Series A Preferred Stock, our Series B\nPreferred Stock and other equity securities, debt financings, license fees, and reimbursements received under collaboration agreements. As of September 30,\n2024, we had $753.2 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. We expect that our current cash, cash equivalents and short-term\ninvestments will be sufficient to fund our operations, including our clinical development plan described above, into the second half of 2027. In addition, as of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Company has access to additional undrawn funds under the Hercules Amended Term Loan, as described below.\nWe have no products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. Since our inception and through September 30,\n2024, we have generated an accumulated deficit of $916.1 million. Substantially all of our operating losses resulted from expenses incurred in connection with\nour research and development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations.\nWe will continue to require substantial additional capital to continue the development of our product candidates, and potential commercialization activities, and\nto fund our ongoing operations, including our clinical development plan described above. The amount and timing of future funding requirements will depend\non many factors, including the pace and results of our clinical development efforts, equity financings, securing additional license and collaboration agreements,\nand issuing debt or other financing vehicles. Our ability to secure capital is dependent upon a number of factors, including success in developing our\ntechnology and product candidates. Failure to raise capital as and when needed, on favorable terms or at all, would have a negative impact on our financial\ncondition and our ability to develop our product candidates. Changing circumstances, such as changes in the scope and timing of our clinical studies, may\ncause us to consume capital significantly faster or slower than we currently anticipate. If we are unable to acquire additional capital or resources, we will be\nrequired to modify our operational plans to complete future milestones. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we\ncould exhaust our available financial resources sooner than we currently anticipate. We may be forced to reduce our operating expenses and raise additional\nfunds to meet our working capital needs, principally through the additional sales of our securities or debt financings or entering into strategic collaborations.\nOur commitments primarily consist of obligations under our collaboration, development, and license agreements. Under these agreements, we are required to\nmake milestone payments upon successful completion of certain regulatory and sales milestones. The payment obligations under the license agreements are\ncontingent upon future events such as our achievement of specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones and we will be required to make\ndevelopment milestone payments and royalty payments in connection with the sale of products developed under these agreements. As of September 30, 2024,\nwe were unable to estimate the timing or likelihood of achieving the milestones or making future product sales. For additional information regarding our\nagreements, see Note 6 and Note 7 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nOur operating lease obligations primarily consist of lease payments on our lab and office facilities in Boulder, Colorado and our office space in Waltham,\nMassachusetts. For additional information regarding our lease obligations, see Note 7 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in\nthis report.\nAdditionally, we have entered into agreements with third-party contract manufacturers for the manufacture and processing of certain of our product candidates\nfor clinical testing purposes, and we have entered and will enter into other contracts in the normal course of business with contract research organizations for\nclinical trials and\n46\nTable of Contents\nother vendors for other services and products for operating purposes. These agreements generally provide for termination or cancellation with appropriate\nnotice, other than for costs already incurred. We expect to enter into additional clinical development, contract research, clinical and commercial manufacturing,\nsupplier and collaborative research agreements in the future, which may require upfront payments and long-term commitments of capital resources.\nIf we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt, the obligations related to such debt could be senior to rights of holders of our capital stock and could\ncontain covenants that may restrict our operations. Should additional capital not be available to us in the near term, or not be available on acceptable terms, we\nmay be unable to realize value from our assets and discharge our liabilities in the normal course of business, which may, among other alternatives, cause us to\nfurther delay, substantially reduce, or discontinue operational activities to conserve our cash resources.\nLoan and Security Agreement with Hercules Capital, Inc.\nOn April 1, 2022, we entered into a loan and security agreement (the “Hercules Loan and Security Agreement”) among the Company, certain of our\nsubsidiaries from time to time party thereto (together with the Company, collectively, the “Borrower”), Hercules Capital, Inc. (“Hercules”) and certain other\nlenders party thereto (the “Lenders”). Under the Hercules Loan and Security Agreement, the Lenders provided us with access to a term loan with an aggregate\nprincipal amount of up to $75.0 million, in four tranches (collectively the “Term Loan”), including an initial tranche of $25.0 million, which was available\nthrough June 15, 2023.\nPer the terms of the Hercules Loan and Security Agreement, we were originally obligated to make interest-only payments through April 1, 2024, which was\nextended to October 1, 2024 upon the achievement of a development milestone in August 2022. We were required to repay the Term Loan amount in equal\nmonthly installments of the principal amount and interest between the end of the interest-only period and the maturity date of October 1, 2026. In addition, we\nwere required to pay an end-of-term fee equal to 6% of the principal amount of funded Term Loan Advances (as defined in the Hercules Loan and Security\nAgreement) at maturity, which were being accreted as additional interest expense over the term of the loan.\nIn August 2023, we executed an amendment to the Hercules Loan and Security Agreement (the “Hercules Amendment”).The Hercules Amendment was\ndetermined to substantially alter the Hercules Loan and Security Agreement and therefore was accounted for as a debt extinguishment. We recognized a loss on\ndebt extinguishment of $0.2 million in August 2023 related to unamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs.\nUnder the Hercules Amendment, the Lenders provided the Company access to an increased term loan with an aggregate principal amount of up to $150\nmillion, in four tranches (collectively the “Amended Term Loan”), consisting of (1) an initial tranche of $50.0 million, $5.0 million of which was drawn at\nclosing of the Hercules Loan and Security Agreement in April 2022, $15.0 million of which was drawn at closing of the Hercules Amendment in August 2023,\n$5.0 million of which was available through December 15, 2023, and $25.0 million available from July 1, 2024 through December 15, 2024; (2) a second\ntranche of $20.0 million, subject to achievement of certain regulatory milestones, available through February 15, 2025; (3) a third tranche of $20.0 million,\nsubject to achievement of certain regulatory milestones, available through March 31, 2025; and (4) a fourth tranche of $60.0 million subject to approval by the\nLenders’ investment committee(s), available through June 15, 2025. The milestones for the second and third tranches have not yet been achieved. The\nobligations of the Borrower under the Hercules Amendment agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Borrower, excluding the Borrower’s\nintellectual property. The Amended Term Loan has a maturity date of October 1, 2026.\nThe Amended Term Loan bears interest at a floating per annum rate equal to the greater of (i) 7.45% and (ii) 4.2% above the Prime Rate (as defined therein),\nprovided that the Term Loan interest rate shall not exceed a per\n47\nTable of Contents\nannum rate of 8.95%. Interest is payable monthly in arrears on the first day of each month. The interest rate as of September 30, 2024 was 8.95%.\nPer the terms of the Hercules Amendment, we were originally obligated to make interest-only payments through April 1, 2025. Upon achievement of certain\ndevelopment milestones related to our topline results for our phase 3 THRIVE trial in September 2024, the interest-only period was extended to October 1,\n2025. If additional development milestones are met, the interest-only period will be further extended to April 1, 2026. The Borrower is required to repay the\nAmended Term Loan amount in equal monthly installments of the principal amount and interest between the end of the interest-only period and the maturity\ndate of October 1, 2026. In addition, the Borrower is required to pay an end-of-term fee equal to 6% of the principal amount of funded Amended Term Loan\nadvances at maturity, which are being accreted as additional interest expense over the term of the loan.\nPublic Offerings\nIn January 2024, we entered into an underwriting agreement with Jefferies LLC (“Jefferies”) and Leerink Partners LLC relating to the offer and sale (the\n“January 2024 Public Offering”) of 7,142,858 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $21.00 per share. The aggregate gross proceeds to us\nfrom the January 2024 Public Offering were approximately $150.0 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering\nexpenses payable by us.\nIn September 2024, we entered into an underwriting agreement with Jefferies, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated\nrelated to the offer and sale (the “September 2024 Public Offering”) of 12,466,600 shares of our common stock, which includes 1,800,000 shares of common\nstock issued in connection with the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares at a public offering price of $18.75 per\nshare, and 20,000 shares of our Series B Preferred Stock at a price per share of $1,250.0625 per share. The aggregate gross proceeds to us from the September\n2024 Public Offering, including the exercise of the option, were approximately $258.8 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and\nother offering expenses payable by us.\nPrivate Placements\nIn November 2023, we issued and sold in private placement transactions an aggregate of 8,869,797 shares of our common stock at a price per share of $12.38\nand 92,312 shares of our Series B Preferred Stock at a price per share of $825.3746, pursuant to securities purchase agreements with certain institutional and\naccredited investors. We received aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $186.0 million, before deducting offering expenses payable by us.\nATM Agreement\nIn September 2022, we entered into an Open Market Sale AgreementSM (the “September 2022 ATM Agreement”) with Jefferies pursuant to which we may offer\nand sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $175.0 million from time to time at prices and on terms to be determined by\nmarket conditions at the time of offering, with Jefferies acting as the sales agent. Jefferies will receive a commission of 3.0% of the gross proceeds of any\nshares of common stock sold under the September 2022 ATM Agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company sold 684,298 shares under\nthe September 2022 ATM Agreement with Jefferies at a weighted average price of $22.30 per share, for aggregate net proceeds of approximately $14.8 million,\nincluding commissions to Jefferies as a sales agent. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 1,561,570 shares under the September 2022\nATM Agreement with Jefferies at a weighted average price of $23.22 per share, for aggregate net proceeds of approximately $35.2 million, including\ncommissions to Jefferies as a sales agent. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no sales under the September 2022 ATM Agreement.\n48\nTable of Contents\nSummarized cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are as follows:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 Increase (Decrease)\n(in thousands)\nNet cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ (158,987) $ (146,170) $ (12,817)\nInvesting activities (165,736) 75,459 (241,195)\nFinancing activities 422,213 26,729 395,484\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 97,490 $ (43,982) $ 141,472\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $159.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and primarily consisted of our net loss of $190.2\nmillion, adjusted for non-cash items of $22.1 million (primarily share-based compensation of $33.2 million, offset by the accretion and amortization of\npremiums and discounts on available-for-sale securities of $12.4 million), and changes in working capital of $9.1 million. The change in working capital was\nprimarily related to a net increase of $14.6 million in accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities, partially offset by an increase of $5.3 million in\nprepaid expenses and other current assets due to the timing of payments to vendors for ongoing clinical trial and manufacturing activities.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $146.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and primarily consisted of a net loss of $170.9 million,\nadjusted for non-cash items of $39.7 million (primarily share-based compensation of $41.1 million) and changes in working capital of $15.0 million. The\nchange in working capital was primarily related to a net decrease of $10.3 million in accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities and an increase of $4.5\nmillion in prepaid expenses and other current assets due to the timing of payments to vendors for ongoing clinical trial and manufacturing activities.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $165.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and consisted primarily of $165.3 million in net\npurchases of short-term investments and $0.4 million in purchases of property and equipment.\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $75.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and consisted primarily of $76.3 million in net\nmaturities of short-term investments, offset by $0.9 million in purchases of property and equipment.\n49\nTable of Contents\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $422.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and consisted of primarily of net proceeds of\n$419.4 million from the January 2024 Public Offering, September 2024 Public Offering and the September 2022 ATM Agreement, as well as $2.2 million in\nproceeds from the exercise of stock options and $0.7 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $26.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and consisted primarily of $14.5 million in net\nproceeds from the Hercules Amendment, as well as $9.8 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options, $1.9 million in proceeds from the exercise of\nwarrants and $0.6 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan.\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThere were no material changes to our market risks in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the disclosures in Item 7A of our 2023\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file under the\nExchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information\nis accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely\ndecisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and\nprocedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is\nrequired to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\nAs required by Rule 13a-15(b) and Rule 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of\nmanagement, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined\nin Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the quarter covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive\nofficer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable level of assurance.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or\nare reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n50\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nFrom time to time, we may be involved in legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. We are currently not a party to any legal proceedings that we\nbelieve would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business, financial condition, and operating results may be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not\nlimited to those described below. Any one or more of such factors could directly or indirectly cause our actual results of operations and financial condition to\nvary materially from past or anticipated future results of operations and financial condition. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and stock price. The following information should be read in conjunction with the other\ninformation contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations” and the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition and Capital Requirements\nWe have historically incurred losses, have a limited operating history on which to assess our business, and anticipate that we will continue to incur\nsignificant losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history. We have historically incurred net losses. During the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023, our net loss was $190.2 million and $170.9 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $916.1 million\nand cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $753.2 million.\nWe believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to fund our operations, including our clinical development plan,\nand enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second half of 2027. We will need to raise substantial additional\ncapital to continue to fund our operations in the future. The amount and timing of our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including the\npace, results and costs of our clinical development efforts and macroeconomic conditions affecting our business and industry.\nFailure to raise capital as and when needed, on favorable terms or at all, would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to develop our\nproduct candidates. Changing circumstances may cause us to consume capital significantly faster or slower than we currently anticipate. If we are unable to\nacquire additional capital or resources, we will be required to modify our operational plans to complete future milestones. We have based these estimates on\nassumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available financial resources sooner than we currently anticipate. We may be forced to\nreduce our operating expenses and raise additional funds to meet our working capital needs, principally through the additional sales of our securities or debt\nfinancings or entering into strategic collaborations.\nWe have devoted substantially all of our financial resources to identify, acquire, and develop our product candidates, including conducting clinical trials and\nproviding general and administrative support for our operations. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities,\nconvertible promissory notes and the Hercules Loan and Security Agreement. The amount of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of our future\nexpenditures and our ability to obtain funding through equity or debt financings, strategic collaborations, or grants. Biopharmaceutical product development is\na highly speculative\n51\nundertaking and involves a substantial degree of risk. We expect our losses to increase as our product candidates continue advancing through clinical\ndevelopment and as new product candidates enter clinical trials and then advance through clinical development. It may be several years, if ever, before we\ncomplete pivotal clinical trials or have a product candidate approved for commercialization. We expect to invest significant funds into the research and\ndevelopment of our current product candidates to determine the potential to advance these product candidates to regulatory approval.\nIf we obtain regulatory approval to market a product candidate, our future revenue will depend upon the size of any markets in which our product candidates\nmay receive approval, and our ability to establish and maintain a commercial supply chain in each market, achieve sufficient market acceptance, pricing,\ncoverage, and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, and adequate market share for our product candidates in those markets. Additionally, patients\nand physicians may not use our products as intended, if approved, which could impact the pricing and reimbursement of our products.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future and our expenses will increase substantially if and\nas we:\n• continue the development of our product candidates;\n• continue efforts to discover and develop new product candidates;\n• continue the manufacturing of our product candidates or increase volumes manufactured by third parties;\n• continue to advance our programs into large, expensive clinical trials;\n• initiate additional preclinical studies or clinical trials for our product candidates;\n• seek regulatory and marketing approvals and reimbursement for our product candidates;\n• establish a sales, marketing, and supply chain and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain marketing\napproval and market for ourselves;\n• seek to identify, assess, acquire, and/or develop other product candidates;\n• make milestone, royalty, or other payments under third-party license agreements or enter into additional third-party license agreements;\n• seek to maintain, protect, and expand our intellectual property portfolio;\n• seek to attract and retain skilled personnel; and\n• experience any delays or encounter issues with the development and potential for regulatory approval of our clinical and product candidates such as\nsafety issues, manufacturing delays, clinical trial accrual delays, longer follow-up for planned studies or trials, additional major studies or trials, or\nsupportive trials necessary to support marketing approval.\nFurther, the net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year, such that a period-to-period comparison of our results of\noperations may not be a good indication of our future performance.\n52\nIf we are unable to raise capital when needed, we would be forced to delay, reduce, or eliminate our research and product development programs or future\ncommercialization efforts.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had $753.2 million of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and\nshort-term investments, will be sufficient to fund our operations, including our clinical development plan, into the second half of 2027. We will need to raise\nadditional capital to continue to fund our operations and service our obligations in the future. If we are unable to raise additional capital when needed, we will\nnot be able to continue as a going concern.\nDeveloping our product candidates requires a substantial amount of capital. We expect our research and development expenses to increase in connection with\nour ongoing activities, particularly as we advance our product candidates through clinical trials. We will need to raise additional capital to fund our operations\nand such funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe do not currently have any products approved for sale and do not generate any revenue from product sales. Accordingly, we expect to rely primarily on\nequity and/or debt financings to fund our continued operations. Our ability to raise additional funds will depend, in part, on the success of our preclinical\nstudies and clinical trials and other product development activities, regulatory events, our ability to identify and enter into licensing or other strategic\narrangements, and other events or conditions that may affect our value or prospects, as well as factors related to financial, economic and market conditions,\nmany of which are beyond our control. For example, even if our clinical trials generate data that we view favorably, investors may not share our interpretation\nof these data, and we may be unable to raise additional funds. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available to us when required or on\nacceptable terms, if at all.\nIf we are unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, we may be required to:\n• significantly delay, scale back, or discontinue the development or commercialization of our product candidates;\n• seek strategic alliances, or amend existing alliances, for research and development programs at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or\nthat we otherwise would have sought to develop independently, or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available in the future;\n• dispose of technology assets, or relinquish or license on unfavorable terms, our rights to technologies or any of our product candidates that we\notherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves;\n• pursue the sale of our company to a third party at a price that may result in a loss on investment for our stockholders; or\n• file for bankruptcy or cease operations altogether.\nAny of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and prospects.\nWe have never generated any revenue from product sales and may never be profitable.\nWe have no products approved for commercialization and have never generated any revenue from product sales. Our ability to generate revenue and achieve\nprofitability depends on our ability, alone or with strategic collaborators, to successfully complete the development of, obtain the regulatory and marketing\napprovals, and build and maintain a commercial supply chain necessary to commercialize one or more of our product candidates. We do not anticipate\ngenerating revenue from product sales for the foreseeable future. Our ability to generate future revenue from product sales depends heavily on our success in\nmany areas, including but not limited to:\n53\n• completing research and development of our product candidates;\n• obtaining regulatory and marketing approvals for our product candidates;\n• manufacturing product candidates and establishing and maintaining supply and manufacturing relationships with third parties that are commercially\nfeasible, meet regulatory requirements and our supply needs in sufficient quantities to meet market demand for our product candidates, if approved;\n• establishing and maintaining a commercial supply chain for our product candidates in the countries or regions in which we obtain regulatory approval\nfor them, including receipt and maintenance of necessary licenses, permits, or similar permissions, either directly or with a collaborator or distributor;\n• marketing, launching, and commercializing product candidates for which we obtain regulatory and marketing approval, either directly or with a\ncollaborator or distributor;\n• gaining market acceptance of our product candidates as treatment options;\n• addressing any competing products;\n• developing, protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, and know-how;\n• negotiating favorable terms in any collaboration, licensing, or other arrangements into which we may enter;\n• obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors and maintaining pricing for our product candidates that supports profitability;\nand\n• attracting, hiring, and retaining qualified personnel.\nEven if one or more of the product candidates that we develop is approved for commercial sale, we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with\ncommercializing any approved product candidate. Portions of our current pipeline of product candidates have been in-licensed from third parties, which make\nthe commercial sale of such in-licensed products potentially subject to additional royalty and milestone payments to such third parties. We will also have to\ndevelop or acquire manufacturing capabilities or continue to contract with contract manufacturers in order to continue development and potential\ncommercialization of our product candidates. For instance, if the costs of manufacturing our drug product are not commercially feasible, we will need to\ndevelop or procure our drug product in a commercially feasible manner in order to successfully commercialize a future approved product, if any.\nAdditionally, if we are not able to generate revenue from the sale of any approved products, we may never become profitable.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our stockholders, restrict our operations, or require us to relinquish rights.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial revenue from the sale of our product candidates, we expect to finance our cash needs through a\ncombination of equity offerings, debt financings, and license and development agreements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of\nequity securities or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include\nliquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a stockholder. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve\nagreements that include covenants limiting\n54\nor restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, or declaring dividends.\nIf we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution, or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may be\nrequired to relinquish valuable rights to our research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable\nto raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or other arrangements with third parties when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or\nterminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to third parties to develop and market product candidates that we would\notherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity, including pursuant to any sales under our September 2022 ATM Agreement with\nJefferies, convertible debt, or other securities convertible into equity, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these new\nsecurities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. Any additional sales of our capital stock by us will\ndilute the ownership interest of our stockholders and may cause the price per share of our common stock to decrease. In addition, any exercise of outstanding\nwarrants will dilute the ownership interest of our stockholders and may cause the price per share of our common stock to decrease.\nDebt financing, including under our Hercules Loan and Security Agreement, may include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions,\nsuch as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, making additional product acquisitions, or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds\nthrough strategic collaborations or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our product candidates or future\nrevenue streams or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. We cannot be assured that we will be able to obtain additional funding, if and when\nnecessary, to fund our entire portfolio of product candidates to meet our projected plans. If we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis, we may be\nrequired to delay or discontinue one or more of our development programs or the commercialization of any product candidates or be unable to expand our\noperations or otherwise capitalize on potential business opportunities, which could materially harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nBusiness disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nOur operations, and those of our third-party research institution collaborators, CROs, CMOs, and other contractors and consultants, could be subject to acts of\nwar, earthquakes, power shortages, information technology and telecommunications failures, water shortages, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme\nweather conditions, governmental actions, medical pandemics or epidemics, such as the novel coronavirus, and other natural or man-made disasters or business\ninterruptions, for which we are partly uninsured. In addition, we rely on our third-party research institution collaborators for conducting research and\ndevelopment of our product candidates, and they may be affected by government shutdowns or withdrawn funding. The occurrence of any of these business\ndisruptions could seriously harm our operations and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nRisks Related to the Discovery and Development of Our Product Candidates\nClinical trials are costly, time consuming, and inherently risky, and we may fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of applicable\nregulatory authorities.\nClinical development is expensive, time consuming, and involves significant risk. We cannot guarantee that any clinical trials will be conducted as planned or\ncompleted on schedule, if at all. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of development. Events that may prevent successful or timely\ncompletion of clinical development include but are not limited to:\n55\n• inability to generate satisfactory preclinical, toxicology, or other in vivo or in vitro data or diagnostics to support the initiation or continuation of\nclinical trials;\n• delays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with CROs and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and\nmay vary significantly among different CROs, clinical trial sites, and in countries or regions where our trials are conducted;\n• delays in obtaining required approvals from institutional review boards or independent ethics committees at each clinical trial site;\n• failure to permit the conduct of a clinical trial by regulatory authorities;\n• delays in or inability to recruit a sufficient number of eligible patients and/or subjects in our clinical trials;\n• failure by clinical sites, CROs, or other third parties to adhere to clinical trial requirements or to perform their obligations related to the clinical\ndevelopment of our product candidates;\n• failure of CMOs, shipping logistics providers or other third parties to deliver necessary clinical material;\n• failure by our clinical sites, CROs, or other third parties to perform in accordance with current good clinical practice (“GCP”), current good laboratory\npractice (“GLP”), current good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”) or other applicable requirements of the FDA or applicable foreign regulatory\nauthorities;\n• patients and/or subjects dropping out of our clinical trials;\n• adverse events or tolerability or animal toxicology issues significant enough in our studies, in studies of third parties, or as reported for marketed\nproducts for the FDA or other regulatory agencies to put any or all clinical trials on hold, require us to change how we conduct our IND-enabling\nstudies or our ongoing or future trials, including amending or submitting new clinical protocols or additional safety monitoring or measurements;\n• occurrence of adverse events associated with our product candidates;\n• changes in regulatory requirements and guidance that require amending or submitting new clinical protocols;\n• geopolitical unrest and adverse regulatory or other actions taken against us, or third parties on whom we rely, by foreign governments or entities,\nincluding in Israel and China, where we have current or planned clinical trial operations;\n• significant costs of clinical trials of our product candidates, including manufacturing activities;\n• negative or inconclusive results from our clinical trials or the trials of third parties with related or similar product candidates, which may result in our\ndeciding, or regulators requiring us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon development programs in other ongoing or planned indications for\na product candidate, or change how we conduct our IND-enabling studies or our ongoing or future trials, including amending or submitting new\nclinical protocols or additional safety monitoring or measurements; and\n56\n• delays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with third-party manufacturers and the time to manufacture sufficient quantities of our product\ncandidates acceptable for use in clinical trials.\nWe are expecting that that the THRIVE and THRIVE-2 phase 3 clinical trials, together with a safety database comprising 300 treated patients, will support\nglobal health authority registration for veligrotug for marketing approval in both active and chronic TED, respectively. However, the FDA or other regulatory\nauthorities may require additional patients in this safety database or may require us to take other additional steps. In August 2024, we initiated a pivotal\nprogram for VRDN-003. We may be required to take other additional steps in the course of development and regulatory interaction regarding our product\ncandidates, including veligrotug and VRDN-003. Such additional steps may include, without limitation, initiating new trials, starting at an earlier phase of\nclinical trial, conducting bridging studies, enrolling more patients, amending trial protocols, or requiring us to assess additional parameters related to safety or\nefficacy. For example, we may make adjustments to the VRDN-003 clinical trial designs as a result of the veligrotug data. These additional requirements or\nsteps could increase the cost of development of our product candidates, negatively affect our anticipated timelines, delay our time to market with our product\ncandidates, if approved, and could harm our business.\nThe FDA or other regulatory authorities may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems\noccur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity\nor frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or non-compliance with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new\nsafety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions,\nfor example, under a Risk Evaluation Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:\n• restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market, or product recalls;\n• fines, warning letters, or holds on post-approval clinical studies;\n• refusal of the FDA or other regulatory authorities to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or\nrevocation of existing product approvals;\n• product seizure or detention, or refusal of the FDA or other regulatory authorities to permit the import or export of products; or\n• injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nAny inability to successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates could result in additional costs to us or\nimpair our ability to generate revenue. In addition, if we make manufacturing or formulation changes to our product candidates, we may need to conduct\nadditional clinical or nonclinical studies and the results obtained from studying such new formulation may not be consistent with previous results obtained.\nClinical trial delays could also shorten any periods during which our products have patent protection and may allow competitors to develop and bring products\nto market before we do, which could impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and may harm our business and results of\noperations.\nRegulatory approval processes are lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable. Failure to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates\nwould have a material adverse effect upon our business and business prospects.\n57\nIn connection with the advancement of our clinical programs and before we can commercialize any of our current or future product candidates, we must obtain\nmarketing approval from regulatory authorities. We may not be able to receive approval to market any of our current or future product candidates from\nregulatory authorities in our desired indications in any jurisdiction, and it is possible that none of our product candidates or any product candidates we may\nseek to develop in the future will ever obtain regulatory approval. We may need to rely on third party CROs and regulatory consultants to assist us in this\nprocess. Securing regulatory approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to the various regulatory\nauthorities for each therapeutic indication to establish a product candidate’s safety and efficacy. Securing regulatory approval also requires the submission of\ninformation about the biologic manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the relevant regulatory authorities, who may deny\napproval based on the results of such submissions and inspections. Our current or future product candidates may not be effective, may be only moderately\neffective or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that may preclude our obtaining marketing approval or\nprevent or limit commercial use. The FDA and other regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process, including determining when or\nwhether regulatory approval will be obtained for a product candidate. Even if we believe the data collected from clinical trials are promising, such data may not\nbe sufficient to support approval by the FDA or any other regulatory authority or such authorities may request additional information that may be difficult to\ngenerate or provide. Further, following approval, the FDA or other regulatory authorities may conduct additional inspections and, based on the results of such\ninspections, deem the inspected manufacturing facilities to be deficient, suspending our ability to manufacture our product candidates until we can secure\nsatisfactory alternative manufacturing facilities.\nIn addition to the United States, we may seek regulatory approval to commercialize our product candidates in other jurisdictions. While the scope of regulatory\napproval is similar in many countries, to obtain separate regulatory approval in multiple countries will require us to comply with numerous and varying\nregulatory requirements of each such country or jurisdiction regarding safety, efficacy and quality, and governing, among other things, clinical trials,\ncommercial sales, pricing and distribution, and we cannot predict success in any such jurisdictions, even if we were to receive approval in the United States.\nThe process of obtaining regulatory approvals, both in the United States and in other countries, is time consuming, expensive, may take many years, if approval\nis obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved.\nChanges in marketing approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in\nregulatory review for each submitted BLA, or equivalent application types, may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application.\nRegulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data are insufficient\nfor approval and require additional preclinical studies or clinical or other trials for our current or future product candidates. Our current and future product\ncandidates could be delayed in receiving, or fail to receive, regulatory approval or we may fail or cease to advance their development for many reasons,\nincluding the following:\n• regulatory authorities may disagree with the number, design or implementation of our clinical trials to support further development or approval;\n• we may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities that a product candidate is safe and effective for its proposed indication\nor that its clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;\n• regulatory authorities could require us to collect additional data or conduct additional clinical trials, which could include a requirement to compare our\nproducts or product candidates to other therapies for the treatment of the same indication;\n58\n• regulatory authorities, following the discovery of adverse safety signals or side effects from approved therapeutics or therapeutics in development in\nthe same or related class as our products or product candidates, could require us to collect additional data or conduct additional clinical trials;\n• the results of clinical trials may produce negative, inconclusive or uncompetitive results, which may result in us deciding, or regulatory authorities\nrequiring us, to conduct additional clinical trials or to modify or cease development programs for our product candidates;\n• the results of clinical trials may not meet the primary or secondary endpoints of the applicable trial or the level of statistical significance required by\nregulatory authorities;\n• regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n• the data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates may not be sufficient to support the submission of a BLA, supplementary BLA or other\nsubmission or to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere;\n• the number of participants required for clinical trials may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we\nanticipate, participants may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate or we may fail to recruit suitable participants for a trial;\n• our third-party contractors may fail to comply with data quality and regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely\nmanner, or at all;\n• regulatory authorities may believe that we have not sufficiently demonstrated our ability to manufacture our candidates to the requisite level of quality\nstandards, including that such material is sufficiently comparable to material used in previous clinical trials, or they may fail to approve our\nmanufacturing processes or facilities, or the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical and\ncommercial supplies;\n• regulatory authorities may conclude that on-site inspections and data audits have not sufficiently demonstrated the quality and integrity of the clinical\ntrial conduct and of data submitted to regulatory authorities in support of our new product approvals and marketing applications;\n• the supply or quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates may be insufficient or\ninadequate;\n• our product candidates may have undesirable side effects, toxicities or other unexpected characteristics, causing us or our investigators, regulatory\nauthorities, institutional review boards or ethics committees to reject, suspend or terminate the clinical trials; and\n• the approval policies or regulations of regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data, biologic manufacturing\nprocess and other supporting information insufficient for approval.\nIn addition, even if we were to obtain approval for one or more of our current or future product candidates, regulatory authorities may approve such product\ncandidates for fewer indications or more limited patient populations than we request. Furthermore, regulatory authorities or payers may not approve the price\nwe intend to charge, may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials, may impose certain post-marketing\nrequirements that impose limits on our marketing and distribution activities, or may approve a product candidate with labeling that does not include the claims\nnecessary or desirable for the\n59\nsuccessful commercialization of that product candidate. Any of the foregoing scenarios could materially harm the commercial prospects for our current or\nfuture product candidates.\nFailure to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates would have a material adverse effect upon our business and business prospects.\nOur product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit the\ncommercial viability of approved labeling, or result in significant negative consequences following marketing approval, if any.\nWe are or may develop our product candidates in areas with existing investigational and/or approved products where such products may have known risk\nprofiles. Undesirable side effects caused by our product candidates, or other product candidates, including in the TED space, could cause us or regulatory\nauthorities to interrupt, delay, or terminate clinical trials. Such side effects additionally may result in a delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA,\nEMA, or comparable foreign authorities, or, even in the instance that an affected product candidate is approved, may result in restrictive drug labeling. For\nexample, hearing impairment observed in Tepezza®, or other negative side effects of other IGF-1R antagonists in development, may negatively affect clinical\ntrials for our product candidates, delay regulatory approval or result in restrictive drug labeling, if approved.\nEven if one or more of our product candidates receives marketing approval, and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by such products,\npotentially significant negative consequences could result, including but not limited to:\n• regulatory authorities may withdraw approvals of such products;\n• regulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the drug labeling;\n• we may be required to create a REMS, which could include a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients, a\ncommunication plan for healthcare providers, and/or other elements to assure safe use;\n• we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients or subjects; and\n• our reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of a product candidate, even if approved, and could significantly harm\nour business, results of operations, and prospects.\nAdditional time may be required to obtain marketing authorizations for certain of our product candidates because they are, or are anticipated to be,\ncombination products.\nSome of our product candidates, including VRDN-003, VRDN-006 and VRDN-008, are or are anticipated to be combination products that will require\ncoordination within the FDA and similar foreign regulatory agencies for review of their device and drug components. Although the FDA and similar foreign\nregulatory agencies have systems in place for the review and approval of combination products, such as drugs that utilize delivery systems like auto-injectors or\nprefilled syringes, we may experience delays in the development and commercialization of our product candidates due to complexities arising from them being\ncombination products and associated regulatory timing constraints and uncertainties in the product development and approval process. Of note, prior clearance\nor approval of one component of a combination product does not increase the likelihood that the FDA will approve a later product combining the previously\ncleared product or approved\n60\nactive ingredient with a novel active ingredient. See “Business—Government Regulation—Regulation of Combination Products” in our 2023 Annual Report\non Form 10-K.\nOur product development program may not uncover all possible adverse events that patients or subjects who take our product candidates may experience.\nThe number of patients or subjects exposed to our product candidates and the average exposure time in the clinical development program may be\ninadequate to detect rare adverse events that may only be detected once the product is administered to more patients or subjects and for greater periods of\ntime.\nClinical trials by their nature utilize a sample of the potential patient population. But, with a limited number of subjects and limited duration of exposure, we\ncannot be fully assured that rare and severe side effects of our product candidates will be uncovered. Such rare and severe side effects may only be uncovered\nwith a significantly larger number of patients or subjects exposed to the drug. If such safety problems occur or are identified after our product candidates reach\nthe market, the FDA or other regulatory authorities may require that we amend the labeling of the product, implement a REMS, recall the product, conduct a\npost-approval study or studies, implement surveillance measures, or may even withdraw approval for the product. Later discovered undesirable side effects\ncould further result in reduced market acceptance and utilization of our product or potential product liability claims. Any of these occurrences may materially\nharm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe are heavily dependent on the success of our product candidates, and we cannot give any assurance that we will generate data for any of our product\ncandidates sufficiently supportive to receive regulatory approval in our planned indications, which will be required before they can be commercialized.\nWe have invested substantially all of our effort and financial resources to identify, acquire, and develop our portfolio of product candidates. Our future success\nis dependent on our ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize one or more product candidates. We currently generate no\nrevenue from sales of any products, and we may never be able to develop or commercialize a product candidate. We continue to evaluate and pursue additional\nopportunities to expand our product pipeline, either by discovering novel antibodies or proteins internally, or by acquiring rights to existing antibodies or\nantibody sequences or proteins and protein sequences. Our goal is to build a sustainable portfolio of protein and antibody therapies.\nWe currently have a limited number of product candidates. There can be no assurance that the data that we may or may not develop for our product candidates\nin our planned indications will be sufficiently supportive to obtain regulatory approval.\nWe are not permitted to market or promote any of our product candidates before they receive regulatory approval from the FDA, EMA, or comparable foreign\nregulatory authorities, and we may never receive such regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. We cannot be certain that any of our product\ncandidates will be successful in clinical trials or receive regulatory approval. Further, our product candidates may not receive regulatory approval even if they\nare successful in clinical trials. If we do not receive regulatory approvals for our product candidates, we may not be able to continue our operations.\nProduct development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier preclinical studies and clinical trials may\nnot be predictive of future clinical trial results.\nClinical testing is expensive and generally takes many years to complete, and the outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the\nclinical trial process. The results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials of our product candidates may not be predictive of the results of larger, later-stage\ncontrolled clinical trials. Product candidates that have shown promising results in early-stage clinical trials may still suffer significant setbacks in subsequent\nclinical trials. In addition, from time to time, we may publicly disclose interim, topline, or preliminary data from our preclinical studies and clinical trials,\nwhich is based on a\n61\npreliminary analysis of then-available data, and the results and related findings and conclusions are subject to change as more patient data become available.\nThe interim, topline, or preliminary results that we report may differ from final results upon study completion, or different conclusions or considerations may\nqualify such results.\nWe will have to conduct well-controlled trials in our proposed indications to support any regulatory submissions for further clinical development. A number of\ncompanies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles\ndespite promising results in earlier, smaller clinical trials. Larger scale clinical trials for our product candidates may generate additional data that raise issues\nregarding the safety and efficacy of our product candidates that were not observed in smaller clinical trials. Certain approaches that we take in our clinical trials\nwith respect to measurement of safety and efficacy outcomes may differ in important respects as compared to the trials of our competitors, which may lead to\nnegative regulatory and/or commercial outcomes.\nMoreover, both preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses. Third parties upon whom we rely may analyze data\ndifferently than others, or differently than we do. As a result, they or we may reach different conclusions regarding the results of our studies, including our\nclinical studies.\nWe do not know whether any clinical trials we may conduct will demonstrate consistent or adequate safety and efficacy of our product candidates, with respect\nto the proposed indication for use, sufficient to receive regulatory approval to market our drug candidates. Failure to demonstrate safety and efficacy of our\nproduct candidates, and failure to obtain regulatory approval, would have a material adverse effect upon our business and business prospects. Additionally,\ndifferences in our clinical trial designs as compared to those of our competitors could render our product candidates less attractive than those of our\ncompetitors.\nPreliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes\nin the final data.\nFrom time to time, we publish preliminary data from our clinical trials. On December 18, 2023, we reported clinical data from our phase 1 clinical study in\nhealthy volunteers and announced the selection of VRDN-003 as our lead subcutaneous product candidate for TED. Based on the comparable pharmacology of\nVRDN-003 to veligrotug, we believe VRDN-003 has the potential to maintain the clinical response of veligrotug while significantly increasing patient\nconvenience. However, we have just initiated clinical trials of VRDN-003 in patients with TED in August of 2024, and results of any clinical trials conducted\nin TED patients with VRDN-003 may not demonstrate safety or efficacy comparable to veligrotug or at all.\nOn September 10, 2024, we announced topline data from the phase 3 THRIVE trial of veligrotug in patients with active TED. While THRIVE met all primary\nand secondary endpoints at 15 weeks, this data may not be fully reflective of the final results for the THRIVE trial. These THRIVE topline results may also not\nbe reflective of our phase 3 THRIVE-2 trial, for which topline results are expected by year end 2024. If clinical data from the THRIVE-2 trial are not positive\nor favorable, it could negatively impact or alter the development of veligrotug and could materially harm our business prospects. If clinical data from the\nveligrotug trials are not positive or favorable, it could negatively impact or alter the development of VRDN-003 and could materially harm our business\nprospects. Similarly, negative or unfavorable clinical data from our VRDN-003 product candidate could negatively impact veligrotug and could materially\nharm our business prospects.\nTopline or preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time, including the data from our phase 1 study in healthy\nvolunteers, the data for veligrotug from our ongoing trials, and topline data may change as more patient data become available and we become subject to audit\nand verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data. This creates a risk that the final results could be materially different from the\npreliminary results reported, including those reported to date. Additionally, differences in patient populations across our clinical trials may lead to inconsistent\nor unrepresentative data.\n62\nSignificant adverse differences between preliminary data and final, audited and verified data could negatively affect the prospect of regulatory approval for our\nproduct candidates and could materially harm our reputation and business prospects.\nWe may use our financial and human resources to pursue a particular research program or product candidate and fail to capitalize on programs or\nproduct candidates that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited financial and human resources, we may forgo or delay the pursuit of opportunities with some programs or product candidates or for\nother indications, that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable\ncommercial products or more profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs and future product\ncandidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products. We may also enter into additional strategic collaboration agreements to\ndevelop and commercialize some of our programs and potential product candidates in indications with potentially large commercial markets. If we do not\naccurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate\nthrough strategic collaborations, licensing, or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole\ndevelopment and commercialization rights to such product candidate. We may allocate internal resources to a product candidate in a therapeutic area in which it\nwould have been more advantageous to enter into a collaboration arrangement.\nWe may find it difficult to enroll and maintain patients or subjects in our clinical trials, in part due to the limited number of patients or subjects who have\nthe diseases for which our product candidates are being studied or the availability of competing therapies and clinical trials. We cannot predict if we will\nhave difficulty enrolling and maintaining patients or subjects in our future clinical trials. Difficulty in enrolling and maintaining patients or subjects could\ndelay or prevent clinical trials of our product candidates.\nIdentifying and enrolling patients or subjects to participate in clinical trials of our product candidates is essential to our success. The timing of our clinical trials\ndepends in part on the rate at which we can recruit patients or subjects to participate in clinical trials of our product candidates, and we may experience delays\nin our clinical trials if we encounter difficulties in enrollment. Our current or future clinical trials may face increased competition for and difficulty recruiting\neligible patients for enrollment, for example, as a result of additional therapies for TED being tested in clinical trials or the availability of approved therapies.\nIn addition, our enrollment has been, and may in the future be, delayed due to supply chain delays and difficulties in site activation. Delays in enrollment may\ndelay the generation of clinical data and the completion of our clinical trials.\nThe eligibility criteria of our clinical trials may further limit the available eligible trial participants, as we expect to require that patients or subjects have\nspecific characteristics that we can measure or meet the criteria to assure their conditions are appropriate for inclusion in our clinical trials. We may not be able\nto identify, recruit, enroll and maintain a sufficient number of patients or subjects to complete our clinical trials in a timely manner because of the perceived\nrisks and benefits of the product candidate under study, the availability and efficacy of competing therapies and clinical trials, the option for patients to choose\nalternate existing approved therapies and the willingness of physicians to participate in our planned clinical trials. Additional factors outside our control, such\nas pandemics or other public health crises, may also impact our ability to enroll patients in our planned clinical trials. If patients or subjects are unwilling or\nunable to participate in our clinical trials for any reason, the timeline for conducting trials and obtaining regulatory approval of our product candidates may be\ndelayed.\nIf we experience delays in the completion of, or termination of, any clinical trials of our product candidates, the commercial prospects of our product\ncandidates could be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenue from any of these product candidates could be delayed or prevented. In addition, any\ndelays in completing our\n63\nclinical trials would likely increase our overall costs, impair product candidate development, and jeopardize our ability to obtain regulatory approval relative to\nour current plans. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition, and prospects significantly.\nWe may face liability for our products, if approved, and for our product candidates, and if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur\nsubstantial liability and costs. If the use or misuse of our approved products, if any, or product candidates harm patients or subjects, or is perceived to harm\npatients or subjects even when such harm is unrelated to our approved products, if any, or product candidates, our regulatory approvals, if any, could be\nrevoked or otherwise negatively impacted, and we could be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims. If we are unable to obtain adequate\ninsurance or are required to pay for liabilities resulting from a claim excluded from, or beyond the limits of, our insurance coverage, a material liability\nclaim could adversely affect our financial condition.\nThe use or misuse of our product candidates in clinical trials and the sale of any products for which we may obtain marketing approval exposes us to the risk of\npotential product liability claims. There is a risk that our product candidates may induce adverse events. If we cannot successfully defend against product\nliability claims, we could incur substantial liability and costs. Patients with the diseases targeted by our product candidates may already be in severe and\nadvanced stages of disease and have both known and unknown significant preexisting and potentially life-threatening health risks. During the course of\ntreatment, patients may suffer adverse events, including death, for reasons that may or may not be related to our product candidates. Such events could subject\nus to costly litigation, require us to pay substantial amounts of money to injured patients, delay, negatively impact, or end our opportunity to receive or\nmaintain regulatory approval to market our products, or require us to suspend or abandon our commercialization efforts. Even in a circumstance in which an\nadverse event is unrelated to our product candidates, the investigation into the circumstance may be time-consuming or inconclusive. These investigations may\ndelay our regulatory approval process or impact and limit the type of regulatory approvals our product candidates receive or maintain.\nAs a result of these factors, a product liability claim, even if successfully defended, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or\nresults of operations.\nAlthough we have product liability insurance, which covers our historical clinical trials in the United States, for up to $10.0 million per occurrence, up to an\naggregate limit of $10.0 million, our insurance may be insufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may suffer. We will also likely be required to\nincrease our product liability insurance coverage for any future clinical trials that we may initiate. If we obtain marketing approval for any of our product\ncandidates, we will need to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products. There is no way to know if we will be able to continue\nto obtain product liability coverage and obtain expanded coverage, if we require it, in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability, on\nacceptable terms, or at all. We may not have sufficient resources to pay for any liabilities resulting from a claim excluded from, or beyond the limits of, our\ninsurance coverage. Where we have provided indemnities in favor of third parties under our agreements with them, there is also a risk that these third parties\ncould incur liability and bring a claim under such indemnities. An individual may bring a product liability claim against us alleging that one of our product\ncandidates causes, or is claimed to have caused, an injury or is found to be unsuitable for consumer use. Any such product liability claims may include\nallegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability, and a breach of\nwarranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. Any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could\nresult in:\n• inability to recruit clinical trial volunteers, investigators, patients or subjects, or trial sites;\n• withdrawal of clinical trial volunteers, investigators, patients or subjects, or trial sites, or limitations on approved indications;\n64\n• delay in the development of product candidates;\n• the inability to commercialize, or if commercialized, decreased demand for, our product candidates;\n• if commercialized, product recalls, labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions, or the need for product modification;\n• initiation of investigations by regulators;\n• loss of revenue;\n• substantial costs of litigation, including monetary awards to patients or other claimants;\n• liabilities that substantially exceed our product liability insurance, which we would then be required to pay ourselves;\n• an increase in our product liability insurance rates or the inability to maintain insurance coverage in the future on acceptable terms, if at all;\n• the diversion of management’s attention from our business; and\n• damage to our reputation and the reputation of our products and our technology.\nProduct liability claims may subject us to the foregoing and other risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or\nresults of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our preclinical development activities and clinical trials, manufacture our product candidates, and perform other\nservices. If these third parties do not successfully perform and comply with regulatory requirements, we may not be able to successfully complete clinical\ndevelopment, obtain regulatory approval, or commercialize our product candidates and our business could be substantially harmed.\nWe have relied upon and plan to continue to rely upon third-party CROs to conduct, monitor, and manage preclinical and clinical programs. Adding or\nchanging CROs for our clinical programs carries implementation risk and may delay advancement of our clinical programs. We rely on these parties for\nexecution of clinical trials, and we manage and control only some aspects of their activities. We remain responsible for ensuring that each of our trials is\nconducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory, and scientific standards, and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our\nregulatory responsibilities. We and our CROs and other vendors are required to comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and guidelines, including those\nrequired by the FDA, EMA, and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for all of our product candidates in clinical development. If we or any of our CROs\nor vendors fail to comply with applicable and evolving laws, regulations, and guidelines, the results generated in our clinical trials may be deemed insufficient\nor unreliable, and the FDA, EMA, or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our\nmarketing applications. For example, we are aware of certain instances of non-compliance with GCP regulations. While we believe that we have made\nsignificant progress in remediating these deficiencies, we cannot be assured that our CROs, clinical sites, and other vendors will fully remediate any\ndeficiencies and will meet these requirements on an ongoing basis, or that upon inspection by any regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine\nthat efforts, including any of our clinical trials, comply with applicable requirements. Any non-compliance with these laws, regulations and guidelines may\nnegatively impact the integrity of the data collected in our clinical trials and may prevent approval or require us\n65\nto repeat clinical trials or add patients to ongoing clinical trials, which would be costly and delay the regulatory submission and/or approval process.\nIf any of our relationships with these third-party CROs terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs in a timely manner or\ndo so on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, our CROs may not prioritize our clinical trials relative to those of other customers, and any turnover in\npersonnel or delays in the allocation of CRO employees by the CRO may negatively affect our clinical trials. If CROs do not successfully carry out their\ncontractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, our clinical trials may be delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to meet our current plans\nwith respect to our product candidates. Additionally, regional disruptions, including natural disasters or health emergencies (such as novel viruses or\npandemics), could significantly disrupt the timing of clinical trials. CROs may also involve higher costs than anticipated, which could negatively affect our\nfinancial condition and operations.\nShortages and governmental restrictions resulting from pandemics or other public health crises may disrupt the ability of or increase the cost for our clinical\ntrial sites and other CROs to procure items that are essential for our research and development activities, including animals that are used for preclinical studies.\nFor example, the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting disruptions to the global supply chain caused shortages of various animals used in research studies, such\nas several types of monkeys, which are typically sourced from China.\nWe do not currently have, nor do we currently plan to establish, the capability to manufacture product candidates for use in the conduct of our clinical trials,\nand we lack the resources and the capability to manufacture any of our product candidates on a clinical or commercial scale without the use of third-party\nmanufacturers. We rely, and plan to continue to rely, on third-party manufacturers whose responsibilities include purchasing from third-party suppliers the\nmaterials necessary to produce our product candidates for our clinical trials and regulatory approval. There are expected to be a limited number of suppliers for\nthe active ingredients and other materials, including devices and device components, that we expect to use to manufacture and deliver our product candidates,\nincluding those of our product candidates that are anticipated to be combination products. We may not be able to identify alternative suppliers to prevent a\npossible disruption of the manufacture of our product candidates for our clinical trials, and, if approved, ultimately for commercial sale. Although we generally\ndo not expect to begin a clinical trial unless we believe we have a sufficient supply of a product candidate to complete the trial, any significant delay or\ndiscontinuity in the supply of a product candidate, or the active ingredient or other material components in the manufacture of the product candidate, could\ndelay completion of our clinical trials and potential timing for regulatory approval of our product candidates, which would harm our business and results of\noperations.\nOur manufacturing processes are complex, and we may encounter difficulties in production, which would delay or prevent our ability to provide a\nsufficient supply of our product candidates for clinical trials or commercialization, if approved.\nThe process of manufacturing our biologic product candidates is complex, highly regulated, variable, and subject to numerous risks. Our manufacturing process\nis susceptible to product loss or failure, or product variation that may negatively impact patient outcomes, due to logistical issues associated with preparing the\nproduct for administration, administering the product to patients, manufacturing issues, or different product characteristics resulting from changing a\nmanufacturer, changing a manufacturing location, the inherent differences in starting materials, variations between reagent lots, interruptions in the\nmanufacturing process, contamination, equipment or reagent failure, improper installation or operation of equipment and/or programs, vendor or operator error,\nloss of product during shipment or storage and variability in product characteristics. Some of our product candidates, including VRDN-003, VRDN-006 and\nVRDN-008, are or are anticipated to be combination products. In particular, we anticipate using an autoinjector device in connection with our product\ncandidate VRDN-003. Combination products are complex to manufacture, and this manufacturing complexity could lead to delays in manufacturing and\nproduct candidate availability for our clinical trials. In addition,\n66\ncombination products typically have a longer and more complex supply chain that increases the risk of supply interruptions and could negatively impact\nproduct candidate availability.\nEven minor variations in starting reagents and materials, deviations from normal manufacturing processes, changing a manufacturer, or changing a\nmanufacturing location could result in reduced production yields, product shortages, product defects, manufacturing failure, changes in product characteristics\nand other supply disruptions. If microbial, viral, or other contaminations are discovered in our product candidates or in any of the manufacturing facilities in\nwhich products or other materials are made, such manufacturing facilities may need to be closed for an extended period of time to investigate and remedy the\ncontamination. Any failure in the foregoing processes could render a batch of product unusable, could affect the regulatory approval of such product candidate,\ncould cause us to incur fines or penalties, or could harm our reputation and that of our product candidates.\nWe may make changes to our manufacturing process for various reasons, such as to control costs, increase yield or dose, achieve scale, decrease processing\ntime, increase manufacturing success rate, availability of raw materials, or for other reasons. Changes to our process made during the course of clinical\ndevelopment could require us to show the comparability of the product used in earlier clinical phases or at earlier portions of a trial to the product used in later\nclinical phases or later portions of the trial. Other changes to our manufacturing process made before or after commercialization could require us to show the\ncomparability of the resulting product to the product candidate used in the clinical trials using earlier processes. Such showings could require us to collect\nadditional nonclinical or clinical data from any modified process prior to obtaining marketing approval for the product candidate produced with such modified\nprocess. If such data are not ultimately comparable to that seen in the earlier trials or earlier in the same trial in terms of safety or efficacy, we may be required\nto make further changes to our process and/or undertake additional clinical testing, either of which could significantly delay the clinical development or\ncommercialization of the associated product candidate, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and\ngrowth prospects.\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on third parties to manufacture our clinical product supplies, including Chinese manufacturers WuXi Biologics and\nWuXi AppTec, for drug substance and drug product, and other third parties for devices and device components. If we are unable to source these supplies on\na timely basis, at sufficient quantities, or at acceptable quality or prices, establish longer-term contracts with our suppliers, or if our third party\nmanufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the development and, if approved, commercialization of our product candidates\ncould be stopped, delayed, or made less profitable.\nWe do not currently have, nor do we currently plan to develop, the infrastructure or capability internally to manufacture our clinical supplies for use in the\nconduct of our clinical trials, and we lack the resources and the capability to manufacture any of our product candidates, devices, or device components on a\nclinical or commercial scale. We currently rely on outside vendors to manufacture our clinical supplies of our product candidates and plan to continue relying\non third parties to manufacture our product candidates, devices, or device components on a commercial scale, if approved. In particular, we rely upon single-\nsourced manufacturing with one CMO for manufacturing our product candidates, including drug substance and drug product. We also rely on single-sourced\nmanufacturing for various elements of our combination products.\nWe do not yet have sufficient information to reliably estimate the cost of the commercial manufacturing of our product candidates and our current cost to\nmanufacture our drug products may not be commercially feasible. Additionally, the actual cost to manufacture our product candidates could materially and\nadversely affect the commercial viability of our product candidates. As a result, we may never be able to develop a commercially viable product.\nIn addition, our reliance on third-party manufacturers exposes us to the following additional risks:\n67\n• We may be unable to identify additional manufacturers of our product candidates, including combination product candidates, on acceptable terms or at\nall.\n• Our third-party manufacturers might be unable to timely formulate and manufacture our product or produce the quantity and quality required to meet\nour clinical and commercial needs, if any.\n• Contract manufacturers may not be able to execute our manufacturing process or procedures appropriately.\n• Our future third-party manufacturers may not perform as agreed or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time required to\nsupply our clinical trials or to successfully produce, store, and distribute our commercial products, if approved.\n• Our reliance on single-sourced manufacturing with one CMO increases the risk that any problems or delays with that CMO could materially,\nnegatively affect the development of our product candidates, or their commercialization, if approved.\n• Manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA, applicable foreign regulatory authorities and some state agencies\nto ensure strict compliance with current good manufacturing practice and other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards. We do\nnot have control over third-party manufacturers’ compliance with these regulations and standards.\n• We may not own, or may have to share, the intellectual property rights to any improvements made by our third-party manufacturers in the\nmanufacturing process for our product candidates.\n• Our third-party manufacturers could breach or terminate their agreement with us.\n• Our third-party manufacturers’ performance, available capacity and ability to manufacture clinical or commercial products may be impacted by\nmergers and or acquisitions.\n• We may experience labor disputes or shortages, raw material shortages or manufacturing capacity shortages, including from the effects of health\nemergencies (such as novel viruses or pandemics) and natural disasters.\n• We and our third-party manufacturers may be impacted by global conflicts, including any potential conflict involving China and Taiwan, and any\nresulting trade sanctions or regulatory actions.\n• We are heavily reliant on third-party manufacturing operations in China, and any regional or geopolitical disruption could negatively impact our\nclinical trials and development or commercialization of our product candidates, which would harm our business.\n• Foreign third-party manufacturers may be subject to U.S. legislation, regulatory actions, or investigations, including the proposed BIOSECURE Act,\ntrade restrictions and other U.S. or foreign regulatory requirements, which could increase the cost or reduce the supply of material available to us,\ndelay or prevent the procurement or supply of such material, delay clinical trials, delay commercial launch, affect the ability to transfer to different\nmanufacturers or have an adverse effect on our ability to secure commitments from governments to purchase our potential therapies.\nEach of these risks could delay our clinical trials, as well as the approval, if any, of our product candidates by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, or the\ncommercialization of our product candidates, or could result in higher costs, or could deprive us of potential product revenue.\n68\nIn addition, we rely on third parties to perform release testing on our product candidates prior to delivery to patients. If these tests are not appropriately\nconducted and test data are not reliable, patients could be put at risk of serious harm, and this could result in product liability suits.\nAs we currently rely upon single suppliers for the development and manufacture of our product candidates, we are taking steps to build redundancy into our\nsupply chain. In connection with those efforts, we are currently evaluating options and taking steps to establish the development and/or manufacture of our\nproduct candidates at new manufacturers. If we encounter any material problems in connection with that process, we may be delayed in the development or\ncommercialization of our product candidates, including veligrotug, and our business could be harmed.\nThe manufacture of drug products, including combination products that comprise a biological drug product and a device, is complex and requires significant\nexpertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques, process controls and product testing methods.\nManufacturers of medical products often encounter difficulties in production, particularly in scaling up and validating initial production and absence of\ncontamination. These problems include difficulties with raw material supply, production costs and yields, quality control, stability of the product, quality\nassurance testing, operator error, shortages of qualified personnel, logistical problems or delays encountered when using multiple sites for manufacturing and\ntesting, as well as compliance with strictly enforced federal, state, and foreign regulations. These problems may be more likely, or worse, in cases where the\nproducts candidates being manufactured are combination products, like certain of our product candidates, due to the increased complexity in their manufacture\nand associated supply chain. Furthermore, if contaminants are discovered in our supply of our product candidates or in the manufacturing facilities, such\nmanufacturing facilities may need to be closed for an extended period of time to investigate and remedy the contamination. We cannot be assured that any\nstability issue or other issues relating to the manufacture of our product candidates will not occur in the future. Additionally, our manufacturers may experience\nmanufacturing difficulties due to resource constraints or as a result of labor disputes, shortages, including from the effects of heath emergencies (such as novel\nviruses or pandemics) and natural disasters, or unstable political environments. If our manufacturers were to encounter any of these difficulties, or otherwise\nfail to comply with their contractual obligations, our ability to provide our product candidates to patients or subjects in clinical trials would be jeopardized. Any\ndelay or interruption in the supply of clinical trial supplies could delay the initiation or completion of clinical trials, increase the costs associated with initiating\nor maintaining clinical trial programs and, depending upon the period of delay, require us to commence new clinical trials at additional expense or terminate\nclinical trials completely.\nWe currently rely on the Chinese contract research, development and manufacturing organizations (“CDMOs”) WuXi AppTec (Hong Kong) Limited and WuXi\nBiologics (Hong Kong) Limited (together, “WuXi”) and other foreign CDMOs, to develop and manufacture our product candidates, and will likely continue to\nrely on them in the future. There has been increased governmental focus in the United States on the role of Chinese companies in the life sciences industry.\nThis focus has included U.S. legislative proposals, such as the proposed BIOSECURE Act, which has been passed by the U.S. House of Representatives and is\npending before the U.S. Senate. If enacted, the BIOSECURE Act would, among other things, prohibit U.S. federal agencies from entering into or renewing any\ncontract with any entity that uses biotechnology equipment or services produced or provided by a “biotechnology company of concern” to perform that contract\nwith the government. Although the proposed Act has not been enacted and thus is subject to change through the legislative process, a version of the Act passed\nby the U.S. House of Representatives defines a “biotechnology company of concern” to include WuXi Biologics and WuXi AppTec. If adopted, the\nBIOSECURE Act could cause us to seek to exit some or all of our arrangements with WuXi (or any other China-based service provider determined to be\n“biotechnology companies of concern”) and accelerate the transition of these services to alternative companies or continue to engage redundant suppliers for\nthe U.S. market. Additionally, the legislation could adversely impact WuXi’s operations or financial position which, in turn, could impact their ability to\nperform under our agreements with it. Our reliance on Chinese-based contract research organizations, such as WuXi, may also cause us to face\n69\nadditional risks due to geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China and related legal and regulatory restrictions and requirements, including measures\ndirectly affecting WuXi.\nIn addition, these entities may be subject to other U.S. legislation, sanctions, investigations, regulations, trade restrictions, regulatory actions, or ex-U.S.\nlegislation, regulatory actions or requirements that could increase the cost or reduce the supply of material available to us, delay or prevent the procurement or\nsupply of such material, delay or impact the availability of our product candidates, delay or impact clinical trials, availability of commercial supply, or have an\nadverse effect on our ability to secure significant commitments from governments to purchase our potential therapies. Any of the foregoing outcomes could\nadversely affect our financial condition and business prospects.\nFor example, in February 2024, the chair and ranking member of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, along with certain Senators,\nsent a letter to the Biden administration requesting that certain WuXi related entities be added to the Department of Defense’s Chinese Military Companies List\n(pursuant to Section 1260H of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021), the Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security\nEntity List, and the Department of Treasury’s Non-SDN Chinese Military-Industrial Complex Companies List. While the Biden administration has yet to take\naction on this letter, adding either or both previously mentioned WuXi entities on any or all of the aforementioned lists could materially impact our agreements\nwith WuXi and could delay the initiation or completion of clinical trials, increase the costs associated with starting or maintaining clinical trial programs and,\ndepending upon the period of delay, require us to commence new clinical trials at additional expense or terminate clinical trials completely or adversely impact\nour financial condition and business prospects.\nFurthermore, the biopharmaceutical industry in China is strictly regulated by the Chinese government, including Chinese collaborators and service providers\nsuch as CROs and CDMOs. Changes to Chinese regulations or government policies affecting biopharmaceutical companies are unpredictable and may\nadversely impact or have a material adverse effect on us or on our collaborators or in China. Such changes may also adversely impact the management of data\ngenerated in China, the availability of data generated with Chinese collaborators or in studies in China and the availability of data or records generated by\nservice providers, which could have an adverse effect on our business, the development of our product candidates, our financial condition, results of operations\nand business prospects. In addition, it may be difficult or impossible to obtain certain source documentation from Chinese entities, which may adversely affect\nour business where such source documentation is required.\nEvolving changes in China’s economic, political, and social conditions and the uncertainty around China’s relationship with other governments, such as the\nU.S. and the U.K., could also negatively impact our ability to use Chinese companies to manufacture our product candidates for our clinical trials or have an\nadverse effect on our ability to secure commitments from governments to purchase our potential therapies, which could cause us to delay our clinical\ndevelopment programs or adversely affect our financial condition.\nIf it becomes necessary to shift our operations away from reliance upon WuXi or other non-US based CROs and CMOs, we will need to find suitable\nreplacements for their services. We may encounter significant difficulty in finding suitable replacement partners and vendors, difficulties in transferring our\nprograms or processes from one CRO or CMO to another, and such parties may have limited capacity due to the influx of demand from other companies,\nincluding other biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies in a position similar to ours. Inability to find suitable replacements for these necessary\nservices could increase the cost or reduce or eliminate the supply of material available to us, delay or prevent the procurement or supply of such material, delay\nor impact the availability of our product candidates, delay or impact clinical trials, availability of commercial supply, or have an adverse effect on our ability to\nsecure significant commitments from governments to purchase our potential therapies. Any of the foregoing outcomes could adversely affect our financial\ncondition and business prospects.\n70\nWe may be unable to realize the potential benefits of any collaboration.\nEven if we are successful in entering into additional future collaborations with respect to the development and/or commercialization of one or more product\ncandidates, there is no guarantee that the collaboration will be successful. Collaborations may pose a number of risks, including:\n• collaborators often have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to the collaboration and may not commit\nsufficient resources to the development, marketing, or commercialization of the product or products that are subject to the collaboration;\n• collaborators may not perform their obligations as expected;\n• any such collaboration may significantly limit our share of potential future profits from the associated program and may require us to relinquish\npotentially valuable rights to our current product candidates, potential products, proprietary technologies, or grant licenses on terms that are not\nfavorable to us;\n• collaborators may cease to devote resources to the development or commercialization of our product candidates if the collaborators view our product\ncandidates as competitive with their own products or product candidates;\n• disagreements with collaborators, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation, or the course of development, might cause\ndelays or termination of the development or commercialization of product candidates, and might result in legal proceedings, which would be time\nconsuming, distracting, and expensive;\n• collaborators may be impacted by changes in their strategic focus or available funding, or business combinations involving them, which could cause\nthem to divert resources away from the collaboration;\n• collaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability, which would be\ntime consuming, distracting, and expensive;\n• the collaborations may not result in us achieving revenue to justify such transactions; and\n• collaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for us to raise additional capital to pursue further development or\ncommercialization of the applicable product candidate.\nAs a result, a collaboration may not result in the successful development or commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe enter into various contracts in the normal course of our business in which we indemnify the other party to the contract. In the event we have to perform\nunder these indemnification provisions, we could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn the normal course of business, we periodically enter into commercial, service, licensing, consulting, and other agreements that contain indemnification\nprovisions. With respect to our research agreements, we typically indemnify the party and related parties from losses arising from claims relating to the\nproducts, processes, or services made, used, sold, or performed pursuant to the agreements for which we have secured licenses, and from claims arising from\nour or our sublicensees’ exercise of rights under the agreement. With respect to future collaboration agreements, we may indemnify our collaborators from any\nthird-party product liability claims that could result from the production, use, or consumption of the product, as well as for alleged infringements of any patent\nor other intellectual property right by a third party. With respect to consultants, we indemnify them from claims arising from the good faith performance of\ntheir services.\n71\nShould our obligation under an indemnification provision exceed applicable insurance coverage or if we were denied insurance coverage, our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. Similarly, if we are relying on a collaborator to indemnify us and the collaborator is\ndenied insurance coverage or the indemnification obligation exceeds the applicable insurance coverage, and if the collaborator does not have other assets\navailable to indemnify us, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe rely on patent rights, trade secret protections and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property related to our product candidates and\nany future product candidates. If we are unable to obtain or maintain exclusivity from the combination of these approaches, we may not be able to compete\neffectively in our markets.\nWe rely or will rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection, and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property related to our\ntechnologies and product candidates. Our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain regulatory exclusivity and our and our licensors’ ability to\nmaintain patent and other intellectual property protection in the United States and in other countries with respect to our proprietary technologies and product\ncandidates.\nWe have sought to protect our proprietary position by filing and licensing the rights to patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our\ntechnologies and product candidates that are important to our business. This process is expensive and time consuming, and we may not be able to file and\nprosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable\naspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions for which\nlegal principles continue to evolve and may remain unresolved. The patent applications that we own or in-license may fail to result in issued patents with\nclaims that cover our product candidates in the United States or in other foreign countries. There is no assurance that all potentially relevant prior art relating to\nour patents and patent applications has been found, which can invalidate a patent or prevent a patent from issuing from a pending patent application. Even if\npatents do successfully issue, and even if such patents cover our product candidates, third parties may challenge their validity, enforceability, or scope, which\nmay result in such patents being narrowed, found unenforceable, unpatentable, or invalidated. Furthermore, even if they are unchallenged, our patents and\npatent applications may not adequately protect our intellectual property, provide exclusivity for our product candidates, or prevent others from designing\naround our claims. Any of these outcomes could impair our ability to prevent competition from third parties, which may have an adverse impact on our\nbusiness.\nWe, independently or together with our licensors, have filed patent applications covering various aspects of our product candidates, including compositions of\nmatter and their methods of use. We cannot offer any assurances about which, if any, patents will issue, the breadth of any such patent, or whether any issued\npatents will be found invalid and unenforceable or unpatentable following a challenge by third parties. Any successful post-grant review proceeding or\nlitigation with respect to these patents or any other patents owned by or licensed to us after patent issuance could deprive us of rights necessary for the\nsuccessful commercialization of any product candidates that we may develop. Further, if we encounter delays in regulatory approvals, the period of time during\nwhich we could market a product candidate under patent protection could be reduced.\nIf we cannot obtain and maintain effective protection of exclusivity from our regulatory efforts and intellectual property rights, including patent protection or\ndata exclusivity, for our product candidates, we may not be able to compete effectively, and our business and results of operations would be harmed.\n72\nWe may not have sufficient patent term protections for our product candidates to effectively protect our business.\nPatents have a limited term. In the United States, the statutory expiration of a patent is generally 20 years after it is filed. Additional patent terms may be\navailable through a patent term adjustment process, resulting from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) delays during prosecution.\nAlthough various extensions may be available, the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Even if patents covering our product candidates are\nobtained, once the patent life has expired for a product candidate, we may be open to competition.\nPatent term extensions (“PTEs”) under the Hatch-Waxman Act in the United States and under supplementary protection certificates in Europe may be available\nto extend the patent exclusivity terms of our product candidates. We will likely rely on PTEs, and we cannot provide any assurances that any such PTEs will be\nobtained and, if so, for how long. As a result, we may not be able to maintain exclusivity for our product candidates for an extended period after regulatory\napproval, if any, which would negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. If we do not have sufficient patent terms\nor regulatory exclusivity to protect our product candidates, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nChanges in patent laws in the U.S. and other jurisdictions could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our\nproducts, and recent patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the\nenforcement or defense of our issued patents.\nAs is the case with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the\nbiotechnology industry involve both technological and legal complexity, and is therefore costly, time-consuming, and inherently uncertain. In addition, in 2011\nthe U.S. enacted the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (the “Leahy-Smith Act”) and is still currently implementing wide-ranging patent reform legislation.\nRecent rulings from the U.S. Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit have narrowed the scope of patent protection available in\nspecified circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in specified situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to\nobtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by\nthe U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our\nability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future.\nThe USPTO has issued subject matter eligibility guidance instructing USPTO examiners on the ramifications of the Supreme Court rulings in Mayo\nCollaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc. and Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc., and applied the Myriad ruling to\nnatural products and principles including all naturally occurring molecules. In addition, the USPTO continues to provide updates to its guidance continues to be\na developing area. The USPTO guidance may make it impossible for us to obtain similar patent claims in future patent applications. Currently, our patent\nportfolio contains claims of various types and scope, including methods of medical treatment. The presence of varying types of claims in our patent portfolio\nsignificantly reduces, but may not eliminate, our exposure to potential validity challenges.\nFor our U.S. patent applications, which contain claims entitled to priority after March 16, 2013, there is a greater level of uncertainty due to the Leahy-Smith\nAct mentioned above. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent\napplications will be prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. The USPTO has promulgated regulations and developed procedures to govern\nadministration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, and in particular, the first to\nfile provisions, did not come into effect until March 16, 2013. The Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the\n73\nuncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nAn important change introduced by the Leahy-Smith Act is that, as of March 16, 2013, the United States transitioned to a “first-to-file” system for deciding\nwhich party should be granted a patent when two or more patent applications are filed by different parties claiming the same invention. This will require us to\nbe cognizant going forward of the time from invention to filing of a patent application. Furthermore, our ability to obtain and maintain valid and enforceable\npatents depends on whether the differences between our technology and the prior art allow our technology to be patentable over the prior art. Since patent\napplications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing, we cannot be certain that we were the first to either:\n(i) file any patent application related to our product candidates or (ii) invent any of the inventions claimed in our patents or patent applications until these\nfilings are no longer confidential.\nAmong some of the other changes introduced by the Leahy-Smith Act are changes that limit where a patentee may file a patent infringement suit and new post-\ngrant review procedures providing opportunities for third parties to challenge any issued patent in the USPTO. Included in these new procedures is a process\nknown as Inter Partes Review, which has been generally used by many third parties since the enactment of the Leahy-Smith Act to render patents unpatentable.\nThese post-grant review procedures are and continue to be an evolving and developing area of law.\nGeopolitical actions in the U.S. and in foreign countries could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution or maintenance of patent\napplications and the maintenance, enforcement or defense of issued patents. For example, the U.S. and foreign government actions related to Russia’s invasion\nof Ukraine may limit or prevent filing, prosecution and maintenance of patent applications in Russia. Government actions may also prevent maintenance of\nissued patents in Russia. These actions could result in abandonment or lapse of patents or patent applications, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent\nrights in Russia. If such an event were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, a decree was adopted by the Russian\ngovernment in March 2022, allowing Russian companies and individuals to exploit inventions owned by patentees that have citizenship or nationality in, are\nregistered in, or have predominately primary place of business or profit-making activities in the United States and other countries that Russia has deemed\nunfriendly without consent or compensation. Consequently, we would not be able to prevent third parties from practicing its inventions in Russia or from\nselling or importing products made using its inventions in and into Russia. Accordingly, our competitive position may be impaired, and our business, financial\ncondition, operations and prospects may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, a European Unified Patent Court (“UPC”) came into force on June 1, 2023. The UPC will be a common patent court to hear patent infringement\nand revocation proceedings effective for member states of the European Union. This could enable third parties to seek revocation of a European patent in a\nsingle proceeding at the UPC rather than through multiple proceedings in each of the jurisdictions in which the European patent is validated. A revocation of\nany European patents and applications that we may own now or license or obtain in the future could have a material adverse impact on our business and our\nability to commercialize or license our technology and products. Moreover, the controlling laws and regulations of the UPC will develop over time and may\nadversely affect our ability to enforce or defend the validity of any European patents obtained. We may decide to opt out from the UPC for any future European\npatent applications that we may file and any patents we may obtain. If certain formalities and requirements are not met, however, such European patents and\npatent applications could be challenged for non-compliance and brought under the jurisdiction of the UPC. We cannot be certain that future European patents\nand patent applications will avoid falling under the jurisdiction of the UPC, even if we are able to or decide to opt out of the UPC.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective proprietary rights for our product candidates or any future product candidates, we may not be able to compete\neffectively in our proposed markets.\n74\nIn addition to the protection afforded by patents, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary know-how that is not\npatentable or that we elect not to patent, such as processes for which patents are difficult to enforce, other elements of our product candidate discovery and/or\ndevelopment processes that involve proprietary know-how, information, or technology that is not covered by patents. However, trade secrets can be difficult to\nprotect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants,\nscientific advisors, and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of\nour premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations, and\nsystems, the agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for such a breach. In addition, our trade secrets may\notherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors.\nAlthough we expect all of our employees and consultants to assign their inventions to us, and all of our employees, consultants, advisors, and any third parties\nwho have access to our proprietary know-how, information, or technology to enter into confidentiality agreements, we cannot provide any assurances that all\nsuch agreements have been duly executed, or that our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed, or that competitors will\nnot otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. Misappropriation or unauthorized\ndisclosure of our trade secrets could impair our competitive position and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of\noperations. Additionally, if the steps taken to maintain our trade secrets are deemed inadequate, we may have insufficient recourse against third parties for\nmisappropriating the trade secret.\nThird-party claims of intellectual property infringement may prevent or delay our development and commercialization efforts.\nOur commercial success depends in part on our ability to develop, manufacture, market, and sell our product candidates and use our proprietary technology\nwithout infringing the patent rights of third parties. Numerous third-party U.S. and non-U.S. issued patents and pending applications exist in the area of our\nproduct candidates. From time to time, we may also monitor these patents and patent applications. We may in the future pursue available proceedings in the\nU.S. and foreign patent offices to challenge these patents and patent applications. In addition, or alternatively, we may consider whether to seek to negotiate a\nlicense of rights to technology covered by one or more of such third-party patents and patent applications. If any patents or patent applications cover our\nproduct candidates or technologies, we may not be free to manufacture or market our product candidates as planned, absent such a license, which may not be\navailable to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nIt is also possible that we have failed to identify relevant third-party patents or applications. For example, applications filed before November 29, 2000 remain\nconfidential until patents issue, and applications filed after that date that will not be filed outside the United States can elect to remain confidential until patents\nissue.\nMoreover, it is difficult for industry participants, including us, to identify all third-party patent rights that may be relevant to our product candidates and\ntechnologies because patent searching is imperfect due to differences in terminology among patents, incomplete databases, and the difficulty in assessing the\nmeaning of patent claims. We may fail to identify relevant patents or patent applications or may identify pending patent applications of potential interest but\nincorrectly predict the likelihood that such patent applications may issue with claims of relevance to our technology. In addition, we may be unaware of one or\nmore issued patents that would be infringed by the manufacture, sale, or use of a current or future product candidate, or we may incorrectly conclude that a\nthird-party patent is invalid, unenforceable, unpatentable, or not infringed by our activities. Additionally, pending patent applications that have been published\ncan, subject to specified limitations, be later amended in a manner that could cover our technologies, our product candidates, or the use of our product\ncandidates.\n75\nThere have been many lawsuits and other proceedings involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical\nindustries, including patent infringement lawsuits in federal courts, and interferences, oppositions, inter partes reviews, post-grant reviews, and reexamination\nproceedings before the USPTO and corresponding foreign patent offices. Numerous U.S. and foreign-issued patents and pending patent applications, which are\nowned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are developing product candidates. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more\npatents are issued, the risk increases that our product candidates may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent rights of third parties.\nParties making claims against us may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize\none or more of our product candidates. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a\nsubstantial diversion of employee resources from our business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial\ndamages, including treble damages and attorneys’ fees for willful infringement, pay royalties, redesign our infringing products, cease development or\ncommercialization, or obtain one or more licenses from third parties, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure.\nWe are dependent on intellectual property licensed from third parties. We may not be successful in meeting our obligations under our existing license\nagreements necessary to maintain our product candidate licenses in effect. In addition, if required in order to commercialize our product candidates, we\nmay be unsuccessful in obtaining or maintaining necessary rights to our product candidates through acquisitions and in-licenses.\nWe currently have rights to certain intellectual property, through licenses from third parties and under technology and patents that we do not own, to develop\nand commercialize our product candidates. Because our programs may require the use of proprietary rights held by third parties, the growth of our business will\nlikely depend in part on our ability to maintain in effect these proprietary rights. Mergers and acquisitions involving the third parties from whom we license\nintellectual property may negatively impact our rights. Any termination of license agreements with third parties with respect to our product candidates would\nbe expected to negatively impact our business prospects.\nWe may be unable to acquire or in-license any compositions, methods of use, processes, or other third-party intellectual property rights from third parties that\nwe identify as necessary for our product candidates. The licensing and acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights is a competitive area, and a number\nof more established companies are also pursuing strategies to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights that we may consider attractive. These\nestablished companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash resources, and greater clinical development and commercialization\ncapabilities. In addition, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license their patent rights to us. Even if we are able to\nlicense or acquire third-party intellectual property rights that are necessary for our product candidates, there can be no assurance that they will be available on\nfavorable terms.\nIf we are unable to successfully obtain and maintain rights to required third-party intellectual property, we may have to abandon development or\ncommercialization of that product candidate or pay additional amounts to the third party, and our business and financial condition could suffer.\nThe patent protection and patent prosecution for some of our product candidates are dependent on third parties.\nWhile we normally seek and gain the right to fully prosecute the patents relating to our product candidates, there may be times when the prosecution and\nmaintenance of patent applications and patents relating to our product candidates are controlled by our licensors. In these instances, we normally seek a right to\nparticipate in such prosecution or maintenance, which is not always granted. If any of our licensors fail to appropriately follow our\n76\ninstructions or consider our comments with regard to the prosecution and maintenance of patent protection for patents covering any of our product candidates,\nit may result in patent rights that do not or do not sufficiently cover products. If this happens, our ability to develop and commercialize those product\ncandidates may be adversely affected, and we may not be able to prevent competitors from making, using, importing, and selling competing products. In\naddition, even where we now have the right to control patent prosecution of patents and patent applications, we have licensed from third parties, we may still\nbe adversely affected or prejudiced by actions or inactions of our licensors in effect from actions prior to us assuming control over patent prosecution.\nIf we fail to comply with obligations in the agreements under which we license intellectual property and other rights from third parties or otherwise\nexperience disruptions to our business relationships with our licensors, we could lose license rights that are important to our business, which would harm\nour business.\nWe are a party to intellectual property licenses and supply agreements that are important to our business and expect to enter into additional license agreements\nin the future. Our existing agreements impose, and we expect that future license agreements will impose, various diligence, milestone payments, royalties,\npurchasing, and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with our obligations under these agreements, or we are subject to a bankruptcy, our agreements\nmay be subject to termination by the licensor, in which event we would not be able to develop, manufacture, or market products covered by the license or\nsubject to supply commitments. Further, these agreements are complex, and certain provisions in such agreements may be susceptible to multiple\ninterpretations. If material disputes with respect to these agreements prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current arrangements on acceptable terms, or\nare insufficient to provide us the necessary rights to use the intellectual property or supply our needs, we may be unable to successfully develop and\ncommercialize the affected product candidates. Any material disputes with our licensors or suppliers or any termination of the agreements on which we depend\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits or post-grant review proceedings to defend, protect, or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, which could be\nexpensive, time consuming, and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or the patents of our licensors. If we, or one of our licensing partners, were to initiate legal proceedings against a third\nparty to enforce a patent covering one of our product candidates, the defendant could counterclaim that the patent covering our product candidate is invalid\nand/or unenforceable or file a post-grant review proceeding to challenge the patentability of the patent. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant\ncounterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability and post-grant review proceeding to challenge the patentability of the patent are commonplace.\nGrounds for these challenges could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness, written\ndescription, clarity, or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent\nwithheld material information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity,\nunenforceability, and patentability is unpredictable.\nInterference proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by us or declared by the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with\nrespect to our patents or patent applications or those of our licensors. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to\nattempt to license rights to us from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially\nreasonable terms or offer us a license at all. Our defense of litigation or interference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs\nand distract our management and other employees. In addition, the uncertainties associated with litigation or post-grant review proceedings could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our clinical trials, continue our research programs, license necessary technology\nfrom third parties, or enter into development partnerships that would help us bring our product candidates to market.\n77\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our\nconfidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of\nhearings, motions, or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants, or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of\nthird parties or that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nWe employ individuals who were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or\npotential competitors. Although we have written agreements and make every effort to ensure that our employees, consultants, and independent contractors do\nnot use the proprietary information or intellectual property rights of others in their work for us, we may in the future be subject to any claims that our\nemployees, consultants, or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties. Litigation may be necessary to\ndefend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights\nor personnel, which could adversely impact our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs\nand be a distraction to management and other employees.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting, and defending patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual\nproperty rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries\ndo not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Competitors may use our technologies in\njurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop our own products and may also export infringing products to territories where we have\npatent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products and our patents or other\nintellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of\nsome countries, particularly some developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets, and other intellectual property protection,\nparticularly those relating to biotechnology and therapeutic products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing\nof competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally.\nProceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention\nfrom other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing,\nand could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if\nany, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a\nsignificant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Approval of Our Product Candidates and Other Legal Compliance Matters\nWe expect the product candidates we develop will be regulated as biologics, and they may be subject to competition from biosimilar and interchangeable\nbiological products.\n78\nThe BPCIA was enacted as part of the ACA to establish an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products. The\nregulatory pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as\n“interchangeable” based on its similarity to an approved biologic. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be approved by the FDA\nuntil 12 years after the reference product was approved under a BLA. The law is complex and is still being interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a\nresult, its ultimate impact, implementation, and meaning are subject to uncertainty.\nWe believe that any of the product candidates we develop that is approved in the United States as a biological product under a BLA should qualify for the\ncurrent 12-year period of exclusivity provided law. However, there is a risk that this exclusivity could be shortened in the future due to congressional action or\notherwise, or that the FDA will not consider the subject product candidates to be reference products for competing products, potentially creating the\nopportunity for generic competition sooner than anticipated. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for any one of the\nreference products in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of\nmarketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing.\nIn addition, the first biologic product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has\nexclusivity against other biologics submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway for the lesser of (i) one year after the first commercial marketing, (ii) 18\nmonths after approval if there is no legal challenge, (iii) 18 months after the resolution in the applicant’s favor of a lawsuit challenging the biologics’ patents if\nan application has been submitted, or (iv) 42 months after the application has been approved if a lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period. The approval\nof a biologic product biosimilar to one of our product candidates could have a material adverse impact on our business as it may be significantly less costly to\nbring to market and may be priced significantly lower than our product candidates.\nWe may seek orphan drug designation for our product candidates, but we might not receive such designation.\nWe are no longer pursuing orphan drug designation for veligrotug for thyroid eye disease in the U.S., but we may seek orphan drug designation for veligrotug\nin other indications and/or territories and for our other product candidates in various indications and/or territories.\nEven if we obtain orphan drug designation for any of our current and potential future product candidates, we may not be the first to obtain marketing approval\nfor any particular orphan indication due to the uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical products. Exclusive marketing rights in the United\nStates also may be limited if we seek approval for an indication broader than the orphan designated indication and may be lost if the FDA later determines that\nthe request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients\nwith the rare disease or condition. Further, even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for an existing or future product candidate, that exclusivity may not\neffectively protect the product from competition because different drugs with different active moieties still can be approved for the same condition even with an\norphan drug designation. Additionally, even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve the same drug with the same active moiety\nfor the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is clinically superior in that it is safer, more effective, or makes a major contribution to patient\ncare. Orphan drug designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug or biologic nor gives the drug or biologic any\nadvantage in the regulatory review or approval process.\nIn addition, the regulatory agency responsible for the granting of orphan drug exclusivity may change their interpretation of the scope of orphan drug\nexclusivity. For example, the FDA’s longstanding interpretation of the Orphan Drug Act is that exclusivity is specific to the orphan indication for which the\ndrug was actually\n79\napproved. As a result, the scope of exclusivity has been narrow and protected only against competition from the same “use or indication” rather than the\nbroader “disease or condition.” See “Business—Government Regulation—Orphan Drug Designation” in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our ability to\nobtain and maintain orphan drug designation and the benefits thereof, including orphan drug exclusivity, may materially impact our financial performance.\nWe may seek Breakthrough Therapy designation for one or more of our product candidates from the FDA, but we might not receive such designation, and\neven if we do, such designation may not actually lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process.\nWe may seek a breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA for some of our product candidates. Designation as a breakthrough therapy is within the\ndiscretion of the FDA. Accordingly, even if we believe that one of our product candidates meets the criteria for designation as a breakthrough therapy, the FDA\nmay disagree and instead determine not to make such designation. In any event, the receipt of a breakthrough therapy designation for a product candidate may\nnot result in a faster development process, review, or approval compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and does not\nassure ultimate approval by the FDA. In addition, even if one of our product candidates is designated as a breakthrough therapy, the FDA may later decide that\nthe product candidate no longer meets the conditions for designation and the designation may be rescinded. See “Business—Government Regulation—\nExpedited Development and Review Programs” in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe may seek Fast Track designation for one or more of our product candidates, but we might not receive such designation, and even if we do, such\ndesignation may not actually lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process.\nIf a product candidate is intended for the treatment of a serious condition and nonclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical\nneed for this condition, a product sponsor may apply for FDA Fast Track designation. If we seek Fast Track designation for a product candidate, we may not\nreceive it from the FDA. However, even if we receive Fast Track designation, Fast Track designation does not ensure that we will receive marketing approval\nin any particular timeframe or at all. We may not experience a faster development or regulatory review or approval process with Fast Track designation\ncompared to conventional FDA procedures. In addition, the FDA may withdraw Fast Track designation if it believes that the designation is no longer supported\nby data from our clinical development program. Fast Track designation alone does not guarantee qualification for the FDA’s priority review procedures. See\n“Business—Government Regulation—Expedited Development and Review Programs” in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe may attempt to obtain accelerated approval of our product candidates. If we are unable to obtain accelerated approval, we may be required to conduct\nclinical trials beyond those that we contemplate, or the size and duration of our pivotal clinical trials could be greater than currently planned, which could\nincrease the expense of obtaining, reduce the likelihood of obtaining, and/or delay the timing of obtaining necessary marketing approvals. Even if we\nreceive accelerated approval from the FDA, the FDA may require that we conduct confirmatory trials to verify clinical benefit. If our confirmatory trials do\nnot verify clinical benefit, or if we do not comply with rigorous post-approval requirements, the FDA may seek to withdraw accelerated approval.\nWe may seek accelerated approval for our product candidates. The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product designed to treat a serious or life-\nthreatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage over available therapies and demonstrates an effect on a surrogate endpoint or\nintermediate clinical endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA considers a clinical benefit to be a positive therapeutic effect that is\nclinically meaningful in the context of a given disease. If granted, accelerated approval may be contingent on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent\nmanner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the drug’s predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or\n80\nother clinical benefit. Under the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022, the FDA may require, as appropriate, that such confirmatory studies be\nunderway prior to approval for a product granted accelerated approval. If such post-approval studies fail to confirm the drug’s clinical benefits relative to its\nrisks, the FDA may withdraw its approval of the drug. If we choose to pursue accelerated approval, there can be no assurance that the FDA will agree that our\nproposed primary endpoint is an appropriate surrogate endpoint. Similarly, there can be no assurance that after subsequent FDA feedback that we will continue\nto pursue accelerated approval or any other form of expedited development, review, or approval, even if we initially decide to do so. Furthermore, if we submit\nan application for accelerated approval, there can be no assurance that such application will be accepted or that approval will be granted on a timely basis, or at\nall. The FDA also could require us to conduct further studies or trials prior to considering our application or granting approval of any type. We might not be\nable to fulfill the FDA’s requirements in a timely manner, which would cause delays, or approval might not be granted because our submission is deemed\nincomplete by the FDA.\nEven if we receive accelerated approval from the FDA, we will be subject to rigorous post-approval requirements, including submission to the FDA of all\npromotional materials prior to their dissemination. The FDA may require us to conduct a confirmatory study to verify the predicted clinical benefit. The FDA\ncould withdraw accelerated approval for multiple reasons, including our failure to conduct any required post-approval study with due diligence, or the inability\nof such study to confirm the predicted clinical benefit. A failure to obtain accelerated approval or any other form of expedited review or approval for a product\ncandidate could result in a longer time period prior to commercializing such product candidate, increase the cost of development of such product candidate, and\nharm our competitive position in the marketplace.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate, we will remain subject to ongoing regulatory requirements.\nIf any of our product candidates are approved, we will be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements with respect to manufacturing, labeling, packaging,\nstorage, advertising, promotion, sampling, record-keeping, conduct of post-marketing clinical trials, and submission of safety, efficacy, and other post-approval\ninformation, including both federal and state requirements in the United States, and requirements of the EMA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities.\nSee “Business—Government Regulation—Expedited Development and Review Programs” and “Business—Government Regulation—Regulation in the\nEuropean Union” in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAny regulatory approvals that we receive for our product candidates may be subject to limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the product may be\nmarketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing, including phase 4 clinical trials, and\nsurveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the marketed product. We will be required to report adverse reactions and production problems, if any, to the\nFDA, EMA, and comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Any new legislation could result in delays in product development or commercialization, or\nincreased costs to assure compliance. If our original marketing approval for a product candidate was granted accelerated approval by the FDA, we could be\nrequired to conduct a successful post-marketing clinical trial in order to confirm the clinical benefit of our products. Other regulatory authorities outside of the\nUnited States may have similar requirements. An unsuccessful post-marketing clinical trial or failure to complete such a trial could result in the withdrawal of\nmarketing approval. We and any of our suppliers or collaborators, including our CDMOs, would be subject to periodic inspections by the FDA, EMA, and, as\napplicable, comparable foreign regulatory authorities to monitor compliance with cGMPs and other FDA, EMA, and, as applicable, any comparable foreign\nregulatory requirements. Application holders must further notify the FDA, and any comparable foreign regulatory authorities, as applicable, and depending on\nthe nature of the change, obtain FDA pre-approval or pre-approval from other comparable foreign regulatory authorities, as applicable, for product and\nmanufacturing changes.\nWe must comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion for any product candidates for which we seek or obtain marketing approval.\nPromotional communications with respect to drugs and biologics are\n81\nsubject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities. When the FDA or comparable foreign\nregulatory authorities issue regulatory approval for a product candidate, the regulatory approval is limited to those specific uses and indications for which a\nproduct is approved. If we are not able to obtain FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authority approval for desired uses or indications for our product\ncandidates, we may not market or promote them for those indications and uses, and our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects and\nreputation may be materially harmed. We also must sufficiently substantiate any claims that we make for our products, including claims comparing our\nproducts to other companies’ products, and must abide by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authority’s strict requirements regarding the content of\npromotion and advertising.\nAny government investigation or enforcement action concerning alleged violations of law, including with respect to promotional requirements, would be\nexpected to require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could result in significant liability, including civil and administrative remedies\nas well as criminal sanctions and fines. Even if it is later determined that we were not in violation of these laws, we may be faced with negative publicity, incur\nsignificant expenses defending our actions and have to divert significant management resources from other matters. Any non-compliance with ongoing\nregulatory requirements may significantly and adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our products, and the value of the company and our\noperating results would be adversely affected.\nHealthcare legislative reform measures may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations, and current and\nfuture legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us, and any collaborators, to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our drug\ncandidates and affect the prices we, or they, may obtain.\nIn the United States, there have been and continues to be a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. For example, in March 2010, the ACA\nwas passed, which was intended to substantially change the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impact the\nU.S. pharmaceutical industry. More recently, on August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the IRA, which, among other provisions, included several\nmeasures intended to lower the cost of prescription drugs and related healthcare reforms. See “Business—Health Reform” in our 2023 Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\nHeightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products has resulted in several recent Congressional\ninquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the\nrelationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. We expect that\nadditional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, particularly in light of the new presidential administration, any of which\ncould limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare therapies, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates\nor additional pricing pressures. We cannot be sure whether additional legislation or rulemaking related to the IRA will be issued or enacted, or what impact, if\nany, such changes will have on the profitability of any of our drug candidates, if approved for commercial use, in the future.\nWe may be subject, directly or indirectly, to foreign, federal, and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, and health information privacy\nand security laws. If we are unable to comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws, we could face substantial penalties, sanctions, or other liability.\nOur operations may be subject to various foreign, federal, and state fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the\nfederal False Claims Act, and Physician Payments Sunshine Act, the European General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679, and other regulations. These laws\nmay impact, among other things, our relationships with healthcare professionals and our proposed sales, marketing, and education programs. In addition, we\nmay be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal\n82\ngovernment and the states in which we conduct our business. See “Business—Other Regulations” in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to\npenalties, including significant civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, disgorgement, damages, fines, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished\nprofits and future earnings, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, imprisonment, additional\nreporting requirements and/or oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of noncompliance\nwith these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of\noperations.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur research and development activities and our third-party manufacturers’ and suppliers’ activities involve the controlled storage, use, and disposal of\nhazardous materials, including the components of our product candidates and other hazardous compounds. We and our manufacturers and suppliers are subject\nto laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling, and disposal of these hazardous materials. In some cases, these hazardous materials\nand various wastes resulting from their use are stored at our and our manufacturers’ facilities pending their use and disposal. We cannot eliminate the risk of\ncontamination, which could cause an interruption of our commercialization efforts, research and development efforts, and business operations, and cause\nenvironmental damage resulting in costly clean-up and liabilities under applicable laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling, and disposal of\nthese materials and specified waste products. Although we believe that the safety procedures utilized by us and our third-party manufacturers for handling and\ndisposing of these materials generally comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations, we cannot guarantee that this is the case or eliminate\nthe risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In such an event, we may be held liable for any resulting damages and such liability could\nexceed our resources, and state or federal or other applicable authorities may curtail our use of specified materials and/or interrupt our business operations.\nFurthermore, environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, and have tended to become more stringent. We cannot predict the impact of\nsuch changes and cannot be certain of our future compliance. We do not currently carry biological or hazardous waste insurance coverage.\nNon-compliance with existing or future laws and regulations related to privacy or data security could lead to government enforcement actions (which could\ninclude civil or criminal fines or penalties), private litigation, other liabilities, and/or adverse publicity. Compliance or non-compliance with such laws\ncould increase the costs of our products and services, could limit their use or adoption, and could otherwise negatively affect our operating results and\nbusiness.\nRegulation of personal data or personal information processing is evolving, as federal, state, and foreign governments continue to adopt new, or modify\nexisting, laws and regulations addressing data privacy and security, and the collection, processing, storage, transfer, and use of such data. We, our collaborators,\nand our service providers may be subject to current, new, or modified federal, state, and foreign data protection laws and regulations (e.g., laws and regulations\nthat address data privacy and data security, including, without limitation, health data). These new or proposed laws and regulations are subject to differing\ninterpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions, and guidance on implementation and compliance practices are often updated or otherwise revised,\nwhich adds to the complexity of processing personal data. These and other requirements could require us or our collaborators to incur additional costs to\nachieve compliance, limit our competitiveness, necessitate the acceptance of more onerous obligations in our contracts, restrict our ability to use, store, transfer,\nand process data, impact our or our collaborators’ ability to process or use data in order to support the provision\n83\nof our products or services, affect our or our collaborators’ ability to offer our products and services or operate in certain locations, cause regulators to reject,\nlimit, or disrupt our clinical trial activities, result in increased expenses, reduce overall demand for our products and services and make it more difficult to meet\nexpectations of or commitments to customers or collaborators. See “Business—Other Regulations” in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNon-compliance with U.S. and foreign data protection laws and regulations could result in government investigations and enforcement actions (which could\ninclude civil or criminal penalties, fines, or sanctions), private litigation, and/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business.\nMoreover, patients or subjects about whom we or our collaborators obtain information, as well as the providers who share this information with us, may\ncontractually limit our ability to use and disclose the information. Claims that we have violated individuals’ privacy rights or failed to comply with data\nprotection laws or applicable privacy notices even if we are not found liable, could be expensive and time-consuming to defend and could result in adverse\npublicity that could harm our business. Any failure by our third-party collaborators, service providers, contractors, or consultants to comply with applicable\nlaw, regulations, or contractual obligations related to data privacy or security could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others.\nWe may publish privacy policies and other documentation regarding our collection, processing, use, and disclosure of personal information and/or other\nconfidential information. Although we endeavor to comply with our published policies and other documentation, we may at times fail to do so or may be\nperceived to have failed to do so. Moreover, despite our efforts, we may not be successful in achieving compliance if our employees or vendors fail to comply\nwith our published policies and documentation. Such failures can subject us to potential foreign, local, state, and federal action if they are found to be\ndeceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of our actual practices. Moreover, subjects about whom we or our partners obtain information, as well as the providers\nwho share this information with us, may contractually limit our ability to use and disclose the information. Claims that we have violated individuals’ privacy\nrights or failed to comply with data protection laws or applicable privacy notices even if we are not found liable, could be expensive and time-consuming to\ndefend and could result in adverse publicity that could harm our business. Any of these matters could materially adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, or operational results.\nRisks Related to Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\nIf we are unable to establish commercial manufacturing, sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to commercially\nmanufacture, market and sell our product candidates, we may be unable to generate any revenue.\nAlthough some of our employees may have been employed at companies that have launched pharmaceutical products in the past, we have no experience\nestablishing commercial manufacturing relationships for or selling and marketing our product candidates and we currently have no commercial manufacturing\nrelationships or marketing or sales organization. To successfully commercialize any products that may result from our development programs, we will need to\nfind one or more collaborators to commercialize our products or invest in and develop these capabilities, either on our own or with others, which would be\nexpensive, difficult, and time consuming. Any failure or delay in entering into agreements with third parties to market or sell our product candidates or in the\ntimely development of our internal commercialization capabilities could adversely impact the potential for the launch and success of our products.\nIf commercialization collaborators do not commit sufficient resources to commercialize our future products and we are unable to develop the necessary\nmarketing and sales capabilities on our own, we will be unable to generate sufficient product revenue to sustain or grow our business. We may be competing\nwith companies that currently have extensive and well-funded marketing and sales operations, particularly in the markets our\n84\nproduct candidates are intended to address. Without appropriate capabilities, whether directly or through third-party collaborators, we may be unable to\ncompete successfully against these more established companies.\nWe may attempt to form collaborations in the future with respect to our product candidates, but we may not be able to do so, which may cause us to alter\nour development and commercialization plans.\nWe may attempt to form strategic collaborations, create joint ventures, or enter into licensing arrangements with third parties with respect to our programs that\nwe believe will complement or augment our existing business. We may face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic collaborators, and the\nnegotiation process to secure appropriate terms is time consuming and complex. We may not be successful in our efforts to establish such a strategic\ncollaboration for any product candidates and programs on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. This may be because our product candidates and programs\nmay be deemed to be at too early of a stage of development for collaborative effort, our research and development pipeline may be viewed as insufficient, the\ncompetitive or intellectual property landscape may be viewed as too intense or risky, and/or third parties may not view our product candidates and programs as\nhaving sufficient potential for commercialization, including the likelihood of an adequate safety and efficacy profile.\nEven if we are able to successfully enter into a collaboration regarding the development or commercialization of our product candidates, we cannot guarantee\nthat such a collaboration will be successful. Any delays in identifying suitable collaborators and entering into agreements to develop and/or commercialize our\nproduct candidates could delay the development or commercialization of our product candidates, which may reduce their competitiveness even if they reach the\nmarket. Absent a strategic collaborator, we would need to undertake development and/or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to fund\nand undertake development and/or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional expertise and additional capital, which may not\nbe available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to do so, we may not be able to develop our product candidates or bring them to market and our\nbusiness may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe face substantial competition, and our competitors may discover, develop, or commercialize products faster or more successfully than us.\nThe development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive, particularly in the treatment of TED. We face competition from major\npharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, universities, and other research institutions worldwide with respect\nto our product candidates. We are aware that the following companies, among others, have therapeutics marketed or in development for TED: Amgen, argenx\nSE (“Argenx”), Immunovant, Inc., Roche Holdings AG, Acelyrin, Inc., Tourmaline Bio, Inc., Lassen Therapeutics and Sling Therapeutics, Inc. Other\ncompanies such as Kriya Therapeutics, Inc., Septerna and Crinetics Pharmaceuticals, Inc. among others, have earlier stage products in development which, if\nsuccessfully developed, may impact the value of our product candidates over their lifecycle. If approved, veligrotug and VRDN-003 will also compete against\ngeneric medications, such as corticosteroids, and surgical procedures that are prescribed for the treatment of TED. We are also aware that the following\ncompanies, among others, may have anti-FcRn therapeutics marketed or in development: Argenx, UCB S.A., Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson &\nJohnson, Immunovant, Inc. and AstraZeneca/Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Moreover, there are more than 20 indications announced or in development across\nthe FcRn class. Depending on the indications in which we choose to develop VRDN-006 and VRDN-008, there may be further competition from marketed and\nin-development therapeutics targeting other mechanisms such as complement inhibition, T-cell inhibitors, anti-1L-6 and other mechanisms of action.\nOur product candidates may demonstrate inferior efficacy and safety profiles as compared to currently approved drugs, or product candidates currently in\ndevelopment by our competitors. Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring, or licensing technologies and drug products that are more effective or\nless costly than our product candidates that we are currently developing or that we may develop, which could render our product\n85\ncandidates obsolete and noncompetitive. Our competitors may also adopt a similar licensing and development strategy as ours with regard to the development\nof an existing anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibody for the treatment of TED. If any competitor was able to effect this strategy in a more efficient manner, there\nmay be less demand for our product candidates if any are approved.\nMany of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources, such as larger research and development staff and experienced\nmarketing and manufacturing organizations. Third-party payors, including governmental and private insurers, may also encourage the use of generic products.\nFor example, if veligrotug is approved, it may be priced at a significant premium over other competitive products. This may make it difficult for veligrotug or\nany other future products to compete with these products.\nIf our competitors obtain marketing approval from the FDA, EMA, or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for their product candidates more rapidly than\nus, it could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.\nMany of our competitors have materially greater name recognition and financial, manufacturing, marketing, research, and drug development resources than we\ndo. Additional mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated in our\ncompetitors. For example, in October 2023, Amgen completed its acquisition of Horizon, which could have a significant impact on the competitive landscape\nfor clinical trials and therapeutics for TED. Large pharmaceutical companies in particular have extensive expertise in preclinical and clinical testing and in\nobtaining regulatory approvals for drugs. In addition, academic institutions, government agencies, and other public and private organizations conducting\nresearch may seek patent protection with respect to potentially competitive products or technologies. These organizations may also establish exclusive\ncollaborative or licensing relationships with our competitors. If our product candidates fail to compete effectively against established treatment options or\nfuture products currently in development, this would harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe commercial success of any of our current or future product candidates will depend upon the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients,\nthird-party payors, and others in the medical community.\nEven with the approvals from the FDA, EMA, and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, the commercial success of our products will depend in part on the\nhealthcare providers, patients, and third-party payors accepting our product candidates as medically useful, cost-effective, and safe. Any product that we bring\nto the market may not gain market acceptance by physicians, patients, and third-party payors. The degree of market acceptance of any of our products will\ndepend on a number of factors, including but not limited to:\n• the efficacy or safety of the product as demonstrated in clinical trials and potential advantages over competing treatments;\n• the prevalence and severity of the disease and any side effects;\n• the clinical indications for which approval is granted, including any limitations or warnings contained in a product’s approved labeling;\n• the convenience and ease of administration;\n• the cost of treatment;\n• the willingness of the patients and physicians to accept these therapies;\n• the perceived ratio of risk and benefit of these therapies by physicians and the willingness of physicians to recommend these therapies to patients\nbased on such risks and benefits;\n86\n• the marketing, sales, and distribution support for the product;\n• the publicity concerning our products or competing products and treatments; and\n• the pricing and availability of third-party payor coverage and adequate reimbursement.\nEven if a product displays a favorable efficacy and safety profile upon approval, market acceptance of the product remains uncertain. We may be unable to\npenetrate the existing TED market and successfully commercialize our product candidates, if approved. Efforts to educate the medical community and third-\nparty payors on the benefits of the products may require significant investment and resources and may never be successful. If our products fail to achieve an\nadequate level of acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors, and other healthcare providers, we will not be able to generate sufficient revenue to\nbecome or remain profitable.\nIn addition, the market for TED therapies may fail to continue its growth, or may shrink, which could affect the commercial viability of our product candidates\nand could negatively impact revenues from any approved products. For example, sales of Tepezza® may fall, and this could cause our business to be negatively\nimpacted. Our estimates of the market size and market opportunity for our product candidates may prove inaccurate, which could negatively impact their\ncommercial viability.\nWe may not be successful in any efforts to identify, license, discover, develop, or commercialize additional product candidates.\nAlthough a substantial amount of our effort will focus on clinical testing, potential approval, and commercialization of our existing product candidates, the\nsuccess of our business is also expected to depend in part upon our ability to identify, license, discover, develop, or commercialize additional product\ncandidates. Research programs to identify new product candidates require substantial technical, financial, and human resources. We may focus our efforts and\nresources on potential programs or product candidates that ultimately prove to be unsuccessful. Our research programs or licensing efforts may fail to yield\nadditional product candidates for clinical development and commercialization for a number of reasons, including but not limited to the following:\n• our research or business development methodology or search criteria and process may be unsuccessful in identifying potential product candidates;\n• we may not be able or willing to assemble sufficient resources to acquire or discover additional product candidates;\n• our product candidates may not succeed in preclinical or clinical testing;\n• our potential product candidates may be shown to have harmful side effects or may have other characteristics that may make the products\nunmarketable or unlikely to receive marketing approval;\n• competitors may develop alternatives that render our product candidates obsolete or less attractive;\n• product candidates we develop may be covered by third parties’ patents or other exclusive rights;\n• the market for a product candidate may change during our program so that such a product may become unreasonable to continue to develop;\n• a product candidate may not be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at an acceptable cost, or at all; and\n87\n• a product candidate may not be accepted as safe and effective by patients, the medical community, or third-party payors.\nIf any of these events occur, we may be forced to abandon our development efforts for a program or programs, or we may not be able to identify, license,\ndiscover, develop, or commercialize additional product candidates, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results\nof operations and could potentially cause us to cease operations.\nFailure to obtain or maintain adequate reimbursement or insurance coverage for our products, if any, could limit our ability to market those products and\ndecrease our ability to generate revenue.\nThe pricing, as well as the coverage, and reimbursement of our approved products, if any, must be sufficient to support our commercial efforts and other\ndevelopment programs, and the availability of coverage and adequacy of reimbursement by third-party payors, including government healthcare programs,\nhealth maintenance organizations, private insurers, and other healthcare management organizations, are essential for most patients to be able to afford\nexpensive treatments. Sales of our approved products, if any, will depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our\napproved products, if any, will be paid for or reimbursed by third-party payors. If coverage and reimbursement are not available, or are available only in limited\namounts, we may have to subsidize or provide products for free, or we may not be able to successfully commercialize our products. See “Business—Coverage\nand Reimbursement” in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOutside the U.S., international operations are generally subject to extensive governmental price controls and other price-restrictive regulations, and we believe\nthe increasing emphasis on cost-containment initiatives in Europe, Canada, and other countries has and will continue to put pressure on the pricing and usage of\nproducts. In many countries, the prices of products are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems. Price controls or other\nchanges in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our products, if any. Accordingly, in markets outside the U.S., the potential\nrevenue may be insufficient to generate commercially reasonable revenue and profits.\nWe expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with products due to the increasing trend toward managed healthcare, including the increasing\ninfluence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative changes. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly\nprescription drugs, has increased and is expected to continue to increase in the future. As a result, profitability of our products, if any, may be more difficult to\nachieve even if they receive regulatory approval.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations\nOur future success depends in part on our ability to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel. If we lose key personnel, or if we fail to recruit\nadditional highly skilled personnel, our ability to develop our product candidates will be impaired and our business may be harmed.\nOur ability to compete in the highly competitive biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries depends greatly upon our ability to attract and retain highly\nqualified managerial, scientific and medical personnel with particular subject matter expertise. We are highly dependent on our management team. The loss of\nthe services of key personnel, and our inability to find suitable replacements, could result in delays in the development of our product candidates and harm our\nbusiness.\nUnless we are able to replace departed employees effectively, we may require current employees to fill additional roles, and this could overextend their\nresponsibilities. As a result, we may experience increased turnover due to employees being overworked. Employees also may be unable to perform these\nmultiple roles effectively due to time and resource constraints. Additionally, if we are unable to retain key personnel, we may\n88\nbe required to cover the roles previously performed by such employees with consultants. These consultants may lack the same skills and performance of\ndeparted employees and, as a result, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval of our\nproduct candidates or otherwise advance our business.\nWe primarily conduct our business in Massachusetts. This region is headquarters to many other biopharmaceutical companies and many academic and research\ninstitutions. There is currently a shortage of highly qualified personnel in our industry, which is likely to continue. Competition for skilled personnel in our\nmarket is intense and may limit our ability to hire and retain highly qualified personnel on acceptable terms or at all.\nTo induce valuable employees to remain at our company, in addition to salary and cash incentives, we may grant equity awards that vest over time or vest upon\nthe achievement of certain pre-established milestones. The value to employees of equity awards has been, and may continue to be, significantly affected by\nmovements in our stock price that are beyond our control, and these equity awards may at any time be insufficient to counteract more lucrative offers from\nother companies. Despite our efforts to retain valuable employees, they may terminate their employment with us on short notice. Although we have\nemployment agreements with our key employees, these agreements provide for at-will employment, which means that any of our employees could leave our\nemployment at any time, with or without notice. We do not maintain “key man” insurance policies on the lives of these individuals or the lives of any of our\nother employees.\nWe utilize shares under our Amended and Restated 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2016 Plan”) to issue equity awards, in order to induce new employees to\njoin our Company and to retain existing employees. We historically seek stockholder approval to increase the number of shares issuable under the 2016 Plan. If\nstockholders do not approve future increases to the number of shares issuable under the 2016 Plan, however, our ability to attract and retain employee talent,\nand our ability to compete for talent, may be adversely affected, which could negatively affect our ability to attract and retain talent and negatively affect our\nbusiness and business prospects.\nWe will need to expand our organization and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nAs our development and commercialization plans and strategies develop and our geographical footprint expands, we expect to need additional managerial,\noperational, sales, marketing, financial, legal, and other resources. Our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of our attention away from\nour day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion\nof our operations, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees, and reduced\nproductivity among remaining employees. Our expected growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other\nprojects, such as the development of additional product candidates. If our management is unable to effectively manage our growth, our expenses may increase\nmore than expected, our ability to generate and/or grow revenue could be reduced and we may not be able to implement our business strategy. Our future\nfinancial performance and our ability to commercialize product candidates and compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage\nany future growth.\nUnstable market and economic conditions, inflation, increases in interest rates, natural disasters, public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic,\npolitical crises, geopolitical events, such as the crisis in Ukraine, or other macroeconomic conditions, may have serious adverse consequences on our\nbusiness and financial condition.\nThe global economy, including credit and financial markets, have experienced extreme volatility and disruptions at various points over the last few decades,\nincluding, among other things, diminished liquidity and\n89\ncredit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, supply chain shortages, increases in inflation rates, higher interest rates, and\nuncertainty about economic stability. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in widespread unemployment, economic slowdown and extreme volatility\nin the capital markets. The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates multiple times in response to concerns about inflation and it may raise them again. Higher\ninterest rates, coupled with reduced government spending and volatility in financial markets, may increase economic uncertainty and affect consumer spending.\nSimilarly, the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the rising tensions between China and Taiwan, the conflict in Israel and surrounding area\nand domestic tensions within the U.S. have created, or may create, significant volatility in the capital markets and may have further global economic\nconsequences, including disruptions of the global supply chain. Any such volatility and disruptions may adversely affect our clinical trials, our business and the\nthird parties on whom we rely.\nIf the equity and credit markets deteriorate, including as a result of political unrest or war, it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult to\ncomplete, more costly, and more dilutive. Failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse\neffect on our growth strategy, financial performance and share price and could require us to delay or abandon development or commercialization plans. In\naddition, there is a risk that one or more of our service providers, manufacturers or other partners would not survive or be able to meet their commitments to us\nunder such circumstances, which could directly affect our ability to attain our operating goals on schedule and on budget.\nWe have experienced and may in the future experience disruptions as a result of such macroeconomic conditions, including delays or difficulties in initiating or\nexpanding clinical trials and manufacturing sufficient quantities of materials. Any one or a combination of these events could have a material and adverse effect\non our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Hercules Loan and Security Agreement contains certain covenants that could adversely affect our operations and, if an event of default were to occur,\nwe could be forced to repay any outstanding indebtedness sooner than planned and possibly at a time when we do not have sufficient capital to meet this\nobligation.\nPursuant to the Hercules Loan and Security Agreement, we have pledged substantially all of our assets, other than our intellectual property rights. Additionally,\nthe Hercules Loan and Security Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants that could prevent us from taking certain actions without the\nconsent of our lenders. These covenants may limit our flexibility in operating our business and our ability to take actions that might be advantageous to us and\nour stockholders. The Hercules Loan and Security Agreement also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit our\nability, subject to certain exceptions, to incur indebtedness, grant liens, enter into a merger or consolidation, enter into transactions with affiliates, or sell all or a\nportion of our property, business or assets. The Hercules Loan and Security Agreement contains customary events of default. Upon the occurrence and\ncontinuation of an event of default, all amounts due under the Hercules Loan and Security Agreement become (in the case of an insolvency or bankruptcy\nevent), or may become (in the case of all other events of default and at the option of Hercules), immediately due and payable. If an event of default under the\nHercules Loan and Security Agreement should occur, we could be required to immediately repay any outstanding indebtedness. If we are unable to repay such\ndebt, the lenders would be able to foreclose on the secured collateral, including our cash accounts, and take other remedies permitted under the Hercules Loan\nand Security Agreement. Even if we are able to repay any indebtedness on an event of default, the repayment of these sums may significantly reduce our\nworking capital and impair our ability to operate as planned.\nFailure in our information technology and storage systems, or those of third parties upon whom we rely, could significantly disrupt the operation of our\nbusiness and adversely impact our financial condition.\n90\nOur ability to execute our business plan and maintain operations depends on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology (“IT”)\nsystems or those of third parties upon whom we rely. IT systems are vulnerable to risks and damages from a variety of sources, including telecommunications\nor network failures, malicious human acts, and natural disasters (such as a tornado, an earthquake, or a fire). Moreover, despite network security and back-up\nmeasures, some of our and our vendors’ servers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, including cyber-attacks, computer viruses, and\nsimilar disruptive problems. The techniques used by criminal elements to attack computer systems are sophisticated, change frequently, and may originate from\nless regulated and remote areas of the world. As a result, we may not be able to address these techniques proactively or implement adequate preventative\nmeasures. If the IT systems are compromised, we could be subject to fines, damages, litigation, and enforcement actions, and we could lose trade secrets, the\noccurrence of which could harm our business. Despite precautionary measures designed to prevent unanticipated problems that could affect the IT systems,\nsustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to generate and maintain data could adversely affect our ability to operate our business. In\naddition, the failure of our systems, maintenance problems, upgrading or transitioning to new platforms, or a breach in security could result in delays and\nreduce efficiency in our operations. Remediation of such problems could result in significant, unplanned capital investments.\nFurthermore, parties in our supply chain may be operating from single sites, increasing their vulnerability to natural disasters or other sudden, unforeseen, and\nsevere adverse events. If such an event were to affect our supply chain, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA data breach, security incident, or other unauthorized network intrusion or access may allow unauthorized access to our network or data, which could\nresult in a material disruption of our clinical trials, harm our reputation, harm our business, create additional liability and adversely impact our financial\nresults or operational results.\nCybersecurity threats to our information networks and systems, and those of our service providers or collaborators have generally increased in sophistication,\nscale, and frequency in recent years. In addition to threats from natural disasters, telecommunications and electrical failures, traditional computer hackers,\nmalicious code (such as malware, viruses, worms, and ransomware), employee error, theft or misuse, password spraying, phishing, and distributed denial-of-\nservice attacks, we now also face threats from sophisticated nation-state and nation-state supported actors who engage in attacks (including advanced persistent\nthreat intrusions) that add to the risks to our internal networks and systems, our third-party service providers, our collaborators and the information that they\nstore and process. Despite having implemented technical and organizational security measures and made other significant efforts to safeguard against such\nthreats, it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate these risks. The security measures we have integrated into our internal networks and systems, which\nare designed to detect unauthorized activity and prevent or minimize security incidents or breaches, may not function as expected or may not be sufficient to\nprotect our internal networks and platform against certain threats. In addition, techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to networks in which data is stored\nor through which data is transmitted change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target. As a result, we may be unable to\nanticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures to prevent such an event.\nIn addition, security incidents or breaches affecting us or our current or future collaborators or third-party service providers could result in the unauthorized\naccess to, or disclosure or loss of information, including information that we process. This, in turn, could require notification under applicable data privacy\nregulations or contracts, and could lead to financial losses, litigation, governmental audits, investigations, fines, penalties, and other possible liability, damage\nour relationships with our collaborators, trigger indemnification and other contractual obligations, cause us to incur investigation, mitigation and remediation\nexpenses, have a negative impact on our ability to conduct clinical trials, and cause reputational damage. For example, the loss of clinical trial data for our\nproduct candidates could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data.\n91\nWe may not have adequate insurance coverage for security incidents or breaches or information system failures. The successful assertion of one or more large\nclaims against us that exceeds our available insurance coverage or results in changes to our insurance policies (including premium increases or the imposition\nof large deductible or co-insurance requirements), could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, we cannot be sure that any existing insurance\ncoverage and coverage for errors and omissions will continue to be available on acceptable terms or that our insurers will not deny coverage as to any future\nclaim.\nAny failure or perceived failure by us or our employees, representatives, contractors, consultants, collaborators, or other third-party service providers to comply\nwith our data privacy, security, protection, or confidentiality, or to respond to any data security incidents, breaches or other unauthorized access, acquisition, or\ndisclosure of sensitive information (including, without limitation personal information), may result in financial losses, additional cost and/or liability to us,\nincluding costs from governmental investigations, enforcement actions, regulatory fines, litigation, costs of doing business or damage to our reputation. Any of\nthese events could cause harm to our reputation, business, financial condition or operational results.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes to offset future taxable income or taxes may be limited.\nOur net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities because of their limited duration or\nbecause of restrictions under U.S. tax law. Our NOLs generated in tax years ending on or prior to December 31, 2017 are only permitted to be carried forward\nfor 20 years under applicable U.S. tax law. Under the Tax Act, our federal NOLs generated in tax years ending after December 31, 2017 may be carried forward\nindefinitely, but the deductibility of federal NOLs generated in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 is limited. It is uncertain if and to what extent\nvarious states will conform to the Tax Act.\nIn addition, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation\nundergoes an “ownership change,” which is generally defined as a greater than 50% change, by value, in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the\ncorporation’s ability to use its pre-change NOL carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. Our\nmost recent analysis of possible ownership changes was completed for certain tax periods ending through December 31, 2023. It is possible that we have in the\npast undergone and may in the future undergo, additional ownership changes that could result in additional limitations on our NOL and tax credit\ncarryforwards. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of net operating losses is suspended or otherwise limited, which could\naccelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed. Consequently, even if we achieve profitability, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of our NOL\ncarryforwards and certain other tax attributes, which could have a material adverse effect on cash flow and results of operations.\nChanges in tax laws or regulations that are applied adversely to us or our customers may have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow,\nfinancial condition, or results of operations.\nNew income, sales, use, or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations, or ordinances could be enacted at any time, which could adversely affect our business\noperations and financial performance. Further, existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations, or ordinances could be interpreted, changed, modified, or applied\nadversely to us. For example, the Tax Act enacted many significant changes to the U.S. tax laws. Future guidance from the Internal Revenue Service and other\ntax authorities with respect to the Tax Act may affect us, and certain aspects of the Tax Act could be repealed or modified in future legislation. In addition, it is\nuncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the Tax Act or any newly enacted federal tax legislation. Changes in corporate tax rates, the\nrealization of net deferred tax assets relating to our operations, the taxation of foreign earnings, and the deductibility of expenses under the Tax Act or future\nreform legislation could have a material\n92\nimpact on the value of our deferred tax assets, could result in significant one-time charges, and could increase our future U.S. tax expense.\nOur effective tax rate may fluctuate, and we may incur obligations in tax jurisdictions in excess of accrued amounts.\nWe are subject to taxation in numerous U.S. states and territories and non-U.S. jurisdictions. As a result, our effective tax rate is derived from a combination of\napplicable tax rates in the various places that we operate. In preparing our financial statements, we estimate the amount of tax that will become payable in each\nof such places. Nevertheless, our effective tax rate may be different than experienced in the past due to numerous factors including the results of examinations\nand audits of our tax filings, our inability to secure or sustain acceptable agreements with tax authorities, changes in accounting for income taxes, and changes\nin tax laws. Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations and\nmay result in tax obligations in excess of amounts accrued in our financial statements.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law and the terms of some of our contracts could make an acquisition of us more\ndifficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management.\nProvisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition or a change in management. These provisions include a\nprohibition on actions by written consent of our stockholders and the ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. In\naddition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporate Law, which prohibits\nstockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us, unless certain conditions are met. Although we\nbelieve these provisions collectively will provide for an opportunity to receive higher bids by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of\ndirectors, they would apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any\nattempts by our stockholders to replace or remove then current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of the board of\ndirectors, which is responsible for appointing the members of management.\nIn addition, the Certificate of Designation of our Series A Preferred Stock and the provisions of our warrants issued in 2020 may delay or prevent a change in\ncontrol of our company. At any time while at least 30% of the originally issued Series A Preferred Stock remains issued and outstanding, we may not\nconsummate a Fundamental Transaction (as defined in the Certificate of Designation of the Series A Preferred Stock) or any merger or consolidation of the\nCompany with or into another entity or any stock sale to, or other business combination in which the stockholders of the Company immediately before such\ntransaction do not hold at least a majority of the capital stock of the Company immediately after such transaction, without the affirmative vote of the holders of\na majority of the then outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock. As of December 31, 2023, a majority of the then outstanding shares of Series A\nPreferred Stock was held by entities affiliated with one stockholder. This provision of the Certificate of Designation may make it more difficult for us to enter\ninto any of the aforementioned transactions. In addition, pursuant to such warrants, under certain circumstances each warrant holder has the right to demand\nthat we redeem the warrant for a cash amount equal to the Black-Scholes value of a portion of the warrant upon the occurrence of specified events, including a\nmerger, an asset sale or certain other change of control transactions. A takeover of us may trigger the requirement that we redeem the warrants, which could\nmake it more costly for a potential acquirer to engage in a business combination transaction with us.\n93\nOur Bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our\nstockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other\nemployees.\nOur Bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum\nfor any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, or other\nemployees to us or our stockholders, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our\ncertificate of incorporation or our Bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Our Bylaws further\nprovide that, unless we consent in writing to an alternative forum, federal district courts of the United States will be the exclusive forum for resolving any\ncomplaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”).\nWhile these choice of forum provisions do not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act, or any other claim for which\nthe federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction, the choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds\nfavorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against our and our directors, officers, and\nother employees. If a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in the bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur\nadditional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions.\nWe do not anticipate that we will pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nThe current expectation is that we will retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, capital appreciation,\nif any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain, if any, for the foreseeable future.\nFuture sales of shares by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\nIf our stockholders sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market after legal restrictions on resale lapse, the\ntrading price of our common stock could decline. In addition, shares of our common stock that are subject to our outstanding options will become eligible for\nsale in the public market to the extent permitted by the provisions of various vesting agreements and Rules 144 and 701 under the Securities Act.\nFuture sales and issuances of equity and debt could result in additional dilution to our stockholders.\nWe expect that we will need significant additional capital to fund our current and future operations, including to complete potential clinical trials for our\nproduct candidates. To raise capital, we may sell common stock, convertible securities, or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a\nmanner we determine from time to time. As a result, our stockholders may experience additional dilution, which could cause our stock price to fall.\nIn addition, pursuant to our equity incentive plans, we may grant equity awards and issue additional shares of our common stock to our employees, directors,\nand consultants, and the number of shares of our common stock reserved for future issuance under certain of these plans will be subject to automatic annual\nincreases in accordance with the terms of the plans. To the extent that new options are granted and exercised, or we issue additional shares of common stock in\nthe future, our stockholders may experience additional dilution, which could cause our stock price to fall.\n94\nOur principal stockholders own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder\napproval.\nOur directors, officers, 5% stockholders, and their affiliates currently beneficially own a substantial portion of our outstanding voting stock. Therefore, these\nstockholders have the ability and may continue to have the ability to influence us through this ownership position. These stockholders may be able to determine\nsome or all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, these stockholders, acting together, may be able to control elections of directors, amendments\nof organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited\nacquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may believe are in your best interest as one of our stockholders.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe market price of our common stock has historically been volatile, and the market price of our common stock may drop in the future.\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, subject to significant fluctuations. Market prices for securities of early-stage\npharmaceutical, biotechnology, and other life sciences companies have historically been particularly volatile. In addition to the factors described elsewhere in\nthis “Risk Factors,” some of the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate greatly, and to decline significantly, include:\n• failure to meet or exceed financial and development projections we may provide to the public and the investment community;\n• failure of investors to view the clinical trial data that we generate favorably, even if we view the data favorably;\n• negative outcomes, or perceived negative outcomes, from our interactions with regulatory authorities in connection with the development of our\nproduct candidates;\n• the perception of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries by the public, legislatures, regulators, and the investment community;\n• announcements of significant acquisitions, strategic collaborations, joint ventures, or capital commitments by us or our competitors;\n• significant lawsuits, including patent or stockholder litigation;\n• if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our\nbusiness and stock;\n• changes in the market valuations of similar companies;\n• changes in the possible market size, or perceived market size, for our product candidates;\n• announcements by commercial partners or competitors of new commercial products, clinical progress or the lack thereof, significant contracts,\ncommercial relationships, or capital commitments;\n• the introduction of technological innovations or new therapies that compete with our potential products;\n95\n• changes in the structure of health care payment systems; and\n• period-to-period fluctuations in our financial results.\nMoreover, the capital markets in general have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of individual\ncompanies, including volatility resulting from general global macroeconomic conditions. These broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the trading\nprice of our common stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities, stockholders have often instituted class\naction securities litigation against those companies. Such litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and\nresources, which could significantly harm our business and reputation.\nWe may be subject to risks related to litigation and other legal proceedings that may materially adversely affect our business, operating results or financial\ncondition.\nFrom time to time in the ordinary course of its business, we and our directors and officers may become involved in various legal proceedings, including\ncommercial, employment and other litigation and claims, as well as governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings. Such matters can be\ntime-consuming, divert management’s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, the results of\nany such actions may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nWe incur costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies.\nWe incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses associated with public company reporting requirements. We also incur costs associated with\ncorporate governance requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), as well as rules implemented\nby the SEC and The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”). These rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some\nactivities more time-consuming and costly. These rules and regulations may also make it difficult and expensive for us to obtain directors’ and officers’ liability\ninsurance. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as our executive officers,\nwhich may adversely affect investor confidence and could cause our business or stock price to suffer.\nIf equity research analysts do not publish research or reports, or publish unfavorable research or reports, about us, our business, or our market, our stock\nprice and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business. Equity\nresearch analysts may elect not to provide research coverage of our common stock and such lack of research coverage may adversely affect the market price of\nour common stock. In the event we do have equity research analyst coverage, we will not have any control over the analysts or the content and opinions\nincluded in their reports. The price of our common stock could decline if one or more equity research analysts downgrade our stock or issue other unfavorable\ncommentary or research. If one or more equity research analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock\ncould decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired,\ninvestors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock may be negatively\naffected.\n96\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations of Nasdaq. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act\nrequires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We must perform\nsystem and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal\ncontrols over financial reporting in our annual report filing for that year, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This requires that we incur\nsubstantial professional fees and internal costs to expand our accounting and finance functions and that we expend significant management efforts. We may\nexperience difficulty in meeting these reporting requirements in a timely manner for each period.\nWe may discover weaknesses in our system of internal financial and accounting controls and procedures that could result in a material misstatement of our\nfinancial statements. Our internal control over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well\ndesigned and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations\nin all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues\nand instances of fraud will be detected.\nIf we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or if we are unable to maintain proper and effective internal\ncontrols, it could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis, which could require a\nrestatement, cause us to be subject to sanctions or investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, cause investors to lose confidence in our\nfinancial information, or cause our stock price to decline.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting, insurance, and other expenses, and our management and other personnel have and will need to\ncontinue to devote a substantial amount of time to compliance initiatives resulting from operating as a public company. We also anticipate that these costs and\ncompliance initiatives will continue to increase as a result of ceasing to be a “smaller reporting company,” as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act.\nOur transition to being a large accelerated filer and compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 has been and will continue to be time\nconsuming and costly. Our inability to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future could result in investors losing confidence\nin the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nAs a public company, we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls. We\nbecame a large accelerated filer effective December 31, 2023, and Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires our independent registered public\naccounting firm to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our transition to becoming subject to additional requirements of\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act has been and will continue to be time-consuming, and there is a risk of noncompliance. Further, the costs associated\nwith the compliance with and implementation of procedures under these and future laws and related rules could have a material impact on our results of\noperations.\nIf we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be\nmaterially misstated. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, if we are unable to comply with the requirements of\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner, if we are unable to assert that our internal controls over financial reporting is effective or if our\nindependent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors\nmay lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, and the market price of our common stock could be\n97\nnegatively affected. In addition, we could become subject to investigations by any stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC or other\nregulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources, which could have an adverse impact on our business.\nITEM 2.

In such event, Viridian’s obligations under this Agreement with respect to\nthe [***] IP and [***] License Agreement (including Section 4.2(b) Payment Obligations Pursuant to [***] License Agreement) will\nalso terminate, and any payments payable by Viridian to [***] in consideration for a direct license to [***] IP shall be included in the\napplicable agreement between Viridian and [***]. Paragon will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Viridian with any\nnecessary assistance for Viridian to enter into such direct agreement with [***] pursuant to Section 10.6(b) of the [***] License\nAgreement as reasonably requested by Viridian.\n8.7 Effect of Termination of this Agreement.

The Party claiming indemnity under this Article IX (Indemnification) (the\n“Indemnified Party”) will give written notice to the Party from whom indemnity is being sought (the “Indemnifying Party”)\npromptly after learning of the claim, suit, proceeding or cause of action for which indemnity is being sought (“Claim”). The\nIndemnifying Party’s obligation to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless pursuant to Section 9.1 (By Viridian) or Section 9.2 (By\nParagon) as applicable, will be reduced to the extent the Indemnified Party’s delay in providing notification pursuant to the previous\nsentence results in material prejudice to the Indemnifying Party; provided, however, that the failure by an Indemnified Party to give\nsuch notice or otherwise meet its obligations under this Section 9.3 (Indemnification Procedures) will not relieve the Indemnifying\nParty of its indemnification obligation under this Agreement. At its option, the Indemnifying Party may assume the defense and have\nexclusive control, at its own expense, of any Claim for which indemnity is being sought by giving written notice to the Indemnified\nParty within [***] days after receipt of the notice of the Claim, provided that (a) it agrees to indemnify the Indemnified Party from\nand against all Losses the Indemnified Party may suffer arising out of the Claim; (b) the Claim involves only money damages and\ndoes not seek an injunction or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party; and (c) the Indemnifying Party conducts the\ndefense of the Claim diligently.

The Indemnified Party may participate in and\nmonitor such defense with counsel of its own choosing at its sole expense; provided, however, the Indemnifying Party will have the\nright to assume and conduct the defense of the Claim with counsel of its choice. The Indemnifying Party will not settle any Claim\nwithout the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, not to be unreasonably withheld, unless the settlement involves only the\npayment of money and unconditionally releases the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party will not settle any such Claim without\nthe prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume and conduct the defense of the Claim\nas provided above, (i) the Indemnified Party may defend against, and consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any\nsettlement with respect to the Claim in any manner the Indemnified Party may deem reasonably appropriate (and the Indemnified\nParty need not consult with, or obtain any consent from, the Indemnifying Party in connection therewith), and (ii) the Indemnified\nParty reserves any right it may have under this Article IX (Indemnification) to obtain indemnification from the Indemnifying Party.\n9.4 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. NEITHER PARTY NOR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES SHALL BE LIABLE IN\nCONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, BREACH OF STATUTORY DUTY OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\nINCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS\n148540263_3\nSUFFERED BY THE OTHER PARTY.

Nothing in this Agreement should be construed to create a partnership, joint\nventure, or employer-employee relationship between the Parties. Neither Party is an agent of the other Party or authorized to make\nany representation, contract, or commitment on behalf of the other Party.\n10.2 Force Majeure. Neither Party will be charged with any liability for delay or failure in performance of an obligation\nunder this Agreement (other than any obligation to pay monies when due) to the extent such delay or failure is due to a cause beyond\nthe reasonable control of the affected Party, such as war, riots, labor disturbances, epidemic, pandemic, fire, explosion, and\ncompliance in good faith with any Applicable Law. The Party affected will give prompt written notice to the other Party of the nature\nof the cause of any material delay or failure to perform, its anticipated duration and any action being taken to avoid or minimize the\neffect.

Neither this Agreement nor any rights or obligations hereunder may be assigned by either Party without\nthe prior written consent of the other Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld); provided, however, that either Party\nmay assign this Agreement and its rights and obligations hereunder without the other Party’s consent, but with prompt notice to the\nother Party, to an Affiliate or to its successor to all or substantially all of the business of such Party to which this Agreement relates,\nwhether by merger, sale of stock, sale of assets or otherwise.

In the event of the occurrence of any Dispute, the Parties will follow the following procedures in an attempt to resolve\nthe Dispute or disagreement:\n(a) The Party claiming that such a Dispute exists will give notice in writing (a “Notice of Dispute”) to the other\nParty of the nature of the Dispute.\n(b) The Dispute will be referred to the then Chief Operating Officer of Paragon and the then Chief Executive\nOfficer of Viridian who will meet no later than thirty (30) days following the initial receipt of the Notice of Dispute and use\nreasonable endeavors to resolve the Dispute.\n(c) If, within [***] days of initial receipt of the Notice of Dispute, the Dispute has not been resolved, or if, for any\nreason, the meeting described in Section 10.7(b) hereof has not been held within [***] days of initial receipt of the Notice of\nDispute, then the Parties agree that such Dispute will be finally resolved through binding arbitration to be administered by JAMS\npursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those Rules, as\nspecifically modified by the provisions of this Section 10.7(c). The arbitration will be conducted by a panel of three arbitrators.\nWithin [***] days after the initiation of the arbitration, each Party will nominate one person to act as arbitrator, and the\n148540263_3\ntwo arbitrators so named will then jointly appoint the third arbitrator within [***] days of their appointment, who will serve as\nchairman of the panel. All three arbitrators must be independent Third Parties having at least ten (10) years of dispute resolution\nexperience (which may include judicial experience) or legal or business experience in the biotech or pharmaceutical industry. If\neither Party fails to nominate its arbitrator, or if the arbitrators selected by the Parties cannot agree on a person to be named as\nchairman within such [***]-day period, JAMS will make the necessary appointments for such arbitrator(s) or the chairman. Once\nappointed by a Party, such Party will have no ex parte communication with its appointed arbitrator. The place of arbitration will be in\nBoston, Massachusetts or such other venue as the Parties may mutually agree. The arbitration proceedings and all communications\nwith respect thereto will be in English. Any written evidence originally in another language will be submitted in English translation\naccompanied by the original or a true copy thereof.
