The weighted-average share count for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 includes 298,675,810 and 307,392,341 Ordinary shares and 44,210,406 and 45,198,702 Non-voting Ordinary shares, respectively.  \n  \n**Third Quarter 2024 Business Highlights**\n\n  * **Revenue Highlights**\n    * Revenue growth driven by the addition of new publisher partners and Tier 1 advertisers to the Taboola network.\n    * Publisher wins that were new and from competitors included National World and Axiom Media Alliance.\n    * Renewed relationships with many well-known publishers and OEM partners including Xiaomi, El Universal, and Network18.\n  * **Notable product launches and advancements**\n    * Introduction of Abby, a Generative AI technology that advertisers can use to start and manage campaigns, even without being an expert in advertising.\n    * Taboola was chosen as a winner for ‘Best Native Advertising Platform’ with the Digiday Technology Awards.\n    * Taboola was re-awarded the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) UK Gold Standard Certification in recognition of its commitment to upholding the latest key advertising industry standards.\n\n**Fourth Quarter & Full Year 2024 Financial Guidance **  \n---  \nFor the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024, the Company currently expects (dollars in millions):  \n**Q4 2024**|  ​| **FY 2024**  \n**Guidance**| **Guidance**  \n**Unaudited**  \n(dollars in millions)  \nRevenues| $460 - $490| $1,735 - $1,765  \nGross profit| $180 - $196| $535 - $555  \nex-TAC Gross Profit*| $205 - $221| $656 - $679  \nAdjusted EBITDA*| $83 - $99| $200+  \nNon-GAAP Net Income (Loss)*| $37 - $53| $84 - $104  \nAlthough we provide guidance for Adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss), we are not able to provide guidance for projected net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Certain elements of net income (loss), including share-based compensation expenses and warrant valuations, are not predictable due to the high variability and difficulty of making accurate forecasts. As a result, it is impractical for us to provide guidance on net income (loss) or to reconcile our Adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) guidance without unreasonable efforts. Consequently, no disclosure of projected net income (loss) is included. For the same reasons, we are unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information.  \n  \nFor more commentary on the quarter, please refer to Taboola’s Q3 2024 [_Shareholder Letter_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=O1muZOyKb_Vismynod0BhKPc85yA09yOEidvAuaGQrtgxpfF_qkVMlO59y5F6YX9CmSkk-h5_JRPe7tDrjEGQJ4h_SBY4PPWbdHTtFR7b1bZE7nOxGIOof3SiIGMs9p7TaoE3WBSkrTxUMYw2FVTeGPh1Hx1wQN_KpDJ3g-71mw=) and [_Investor Presentation_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=UC02kpzoRLF82E_kfBVQbRL_ApCjtjQsx5QI6U_o_9BExx_gT7o72cXIqdr4JA6L4p2WjwKuSxeHVUdtSGA4hHwarT1suA59BI0SiUWFtjpiRjRVSBzotQPIacegc_uZB3NSjEkn0Ry8NAfdg29WtkCN9SFi5hBRje0LyX9Xc6g=), both of which are posted on Taboola’s website today at [_investors.taboola.com_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=pStpU-hgYM-wb5xpmPCoV-vk7PANMJRH373g6SgldSdM8SBv7TRenE7n-A9B2bevpRrZMcJmON55kp5lpwi08ufeTIrFwDpV4_wo3RPA3Ng=)\n\n**Webcast Details**\n\nTaboola's senior management team will discuss the Company's earnings on a call that will take place on November 7, 2024, at 8:30 AM ET.

These non-GAAP financial measures are not measures of financial performance in accordance with GAAP and may exclude items that are significant in understanding and assessing the Company’s financial results. Therefore, these measures should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to revenues, gross profit, net income (loss), cash flows from operations or other measures of profitability, liquidity or performance under GAAP. You should be aware that the Company’s presentation of these measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies.\n\nThe Company believes non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding future financial and business trends relating to the Company. The Company believes that the use of these measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating operating results and trends and in comparing the Company’s financial measures with other similar companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. Non-GAAP financial measures are subject to inherent limitations because they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which items are excluded or included in calculating them, which may vary from period to period. Please refer to the appendix at the end of this press release for reconciliations to the most directly comparable measures in accordance with GAAP.\n\n**Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nCertain statements in this press release are forward-looking statements.

As a result, it is impractical for us to provide projections on net cash provided by operating activities or to reconcile our Free Cash Flow projections without unreasonable efforts. Consequently, no disclosure of projected net cash provided by operating activities is included. For the same reasons, we are unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information.  \n![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/YWY5ZmMwNmUtZGFlMy00NjUxLWFlYTktNTliOTQyMjIzMDRjLTEwMzAwNjg=/tiny/Taboola-Inc-.png)\n\n### Quick Links\n\n[ SEC filings ](/financial-information/sec-filings)\n\n**SEC filings**\n\n[ Investor Presentations & Materials ](/news-events/investor-presentations-and-materials)\n\n**Investor Presentations & Materials**\n\n[ Sign up for Email Alerts ](/investor-resources/email-alerts)\n\n**Sign up for Email Alerts**\n\n[ Contact IR ](/investor-resources/contact-ir)\n\n**Contact IR**\n"
