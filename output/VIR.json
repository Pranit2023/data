Investor conference call November 19, 2024, at 5.15 a.m. PT / 8.15 a.m. ET –_\n\nSAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--  Vir Biotechnology, Inc. (NASDAQ:VIR) today announced positive results from the SOLSTICE Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating tobevibart alone, or in combination with elebsiran, in people with chronic hepatitis delta (CHD). The most-advanced and potential first-of-its-kind investigational human monoclonal antibody and siRNA combination dosed monthly achieved 100% virologic response and rapid hepatitis delta virus (HDV) RNA suppression. HDV RNA below the lower limit of quantification (< LLOQ), target not detected (TND), the best measure that the virus is cleared from the body, was achieved in 41% (13/32) of participants at Week 24 rising to 64% (14/22) of participants by Week 36. In a cohort that reached Week 60, 80% (4/5) achieved HDV RNA TND. \n\nThese data were presented in an oral session at the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) The Liver Meeting ** ® ** , in San Diego, CA. Based on these results, and following a recent meeting with the FDA, Vir Biotechnology plans to initiate the Phase 3 registrational ECLIPSE program in the first half of 2025 to further evaluate the combination of tobevibart and elebsiran for the treatment of CHD. \n\nCHD is a chronic inflammatory liver disease caused by HDV 1 . It is the most severe form of chronic viral hepatitis 2 and on average, people living with CHD will progress to cirrhosis and liver failure within 5 years 3 . There is no approved treatment in the United States. The objective of therapy is to clear the virus, and combination therapy offers the potential to do so by tackling the viral lifecycle through multiple mechanisms. \n\n“Achieving HDV RNA suppression with a safe, well-tolerated, and conveniently dosed treatment could be transformative for people living with hepatitis delta. The impressive rates of virologic suppression seen in the SOLSTICE Phase 2 data suggest that tobevibart and elebsiran have the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes,” said Tarik Asselah, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Hepatology at the Hôpital Beaujon, APHP, Clichy, France, and at the University of Paris-Cité, and Head of the unit Viral Hepatitis UMR1149 at INSERM, France. “New, effective therapeutic options are urgently needed, and I am excited to see this combination advance into a registrational Phase 3 program.” \n\n** Primary Endpoint Analysis from the Phase 2 SOLSTICE Trial **\n\nClinical trial participants were randomized to receive tobevibart 300 mg monotherapy every two weeks (n=33) or a combination of tobevibart 300 mg and elebsiran 200 mg every four weeks (combination _de novo_ arm, n=32). In addition, the participants from previous tobevibart or elebsiran monotherapy cohorts could rollover to receive the combination of tobevibart 300 mg and elebsiran 200 mg every four weeks (combination _rollover,_ n=13). Rates of virologic suppression were evaluated at Week 24, and further assessed at Weeks 36, 48 and 60 in those participants that had reached each timepoint. Further monitoring will continue up to 192 weeks. \n\n**Rapid and Sustained Virologic Suppression** – 100% of participants across combination arms achieved an HDV RNA ≥2 log 10 decrease or below limit of detection (LOD) at Week 24, and this rate was sustained over time in all participants at Weeks 36 (22/22) and those in the _rollover_ cohort that reached Week 60 (5/5). \n\nHDV RNA TND was achieved in 41% (13/32) of participants across combination arms at Week 24 and this rose to 64% (14/22) at Week 36. By week 60, this had risen further with 80% (4/5) of participants in the _rollover_ cohort having achieved no detectable viral RNA. \n\nApproximately 90% of participants receiving the combination achieved reductions in hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) values below <10 IU/mL at Week 24, with sustained responses at later time points. This indicates suppression of the key biologic mechanisms that HDV requires for viral replication. \n\n**ALT Normalization** – Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) decreased in most participants between Day 1 and Week 24 and normalized in 47% (15/32) of participants in the combination _de novo_ cohort and 56% (5/9) in the _rollover_ cohort by Week 24. These rates were sustained at Week 36. \n\n**Combined Endpoints** – The protocol defined combined endpoint of HDV RNA decrease ≥ 2 log 10 compared to baseline or HDV RNA below LOD and ALT normalization at Week 24 was observed in 47% (15/32) of participants in the combination _de novo_ arm. \n\nThe more stringent composite endpoint of HDV RNA TND and ALT normalization was achieved in 19% (6/32) of participants in the combination _de novo_ arm at Week 24, which increased to 27% (6/22) by Week 36. This trend was reflected in the combination _rollover_ cohort in which 33% (3/9) of participants achieved this endpoint at Week 24 and 40% (2/5) at Week 60. Rates of HDV RNA suppression and ALT normalization were similar between non-cirrhotic and cirrhotic participants across combination arms. \n\n**Safety Profile** – The safety profile of tobevibart and elebsiran is consistent with previous studies. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were generally mild or moderate and transient across all treatment groups, with influenza-like illness being the most common event. No ALT flares were observed. There were no study-related discontinuations in the combination arms, and no treatment-related severe adverse events (SAEs) were reported. \n\n“People living with hepatitis delta in the US have no approved treatment options, and therapies are limited globally. At Vir Biotechnology we are committed to changing that,” said Marianne De Backer, M.Sc., Ph.D., MBA, Chief Executive Officer, Vir Biotechnology. “We are confident that our regimen has the potential to deliver transformative benefits for patients, and we will build on our strong SOLSTICE data to start our Phase 3 registrational ECLIPSE program as soon as possible in 2025.” \n\n** Phase 3 Registrational ECLIPSE Program **\n\nFollowing a meeting with the FDA, Vir Biotechnology finalized the design of the Phase 3 registrational clinical program, ECLIPSE, which evaluates the tobevibart and elebsiran combination in people living with CHD. This program, which will commence in the first half of 2025, will include three randomized, controlled trials designed to evaluate the combination therapy in comparison to deferred treatment or bulevirtide. All studies will enroll both cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic participants. ECLIPSE 1 and 2 are Phase 3 trials designed to provide the registrational efficacy and safety data needed for submission to global regulatory agencies. ECLIPSE 3 is a Phase 2b trial designed to provide important supportive data, particularly in Europe, to help establish appropriate pricing and reimbursement in key markets. \n\n  * ECLIPSE 1 will assess the efficacy and safety of tobevibart and elebsiran compared to deferred treatment in regions such as the U.S. where bulevirtide is not available or its use is limited. \n\n\n  * ECLIPSE 2 will evaluate the efficacy and safety of switching to tobevibart and elebsiran in people with CHD who have not achieved viral suppression with bulevirtide therapy. \n\n\n  * ECLIPSE 3 is a Phase 2b head-to-head trial to evaluate tobevibart and elebsiran compared with bulevirtide in bulevirtide-naïve patients. \n\n\n\nIn June 2024, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted [fast track designation](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.vir.bio%2Fnews%2Fnews-details%2F2024%2FVir-Biotechnology-Receives-FDA-IND-Clearance-and-Fast-Track-Designation-for-Tobevibart-and-Elebsiran-for-the-Treatment-of-Chronic-Hepatitis-Delta-Infection%2Fdefault.aspx&esheet=54154769&newsitemid=20241118939659&lan=en-US&anchor=fast+track+designation&index=1&md5=6e73477bca023800c252fc6bf7d87ada) for the combination of tobevibart and elebsiran for the treatment of CHD.

This Phase 2 study is a multi-center, open-label, randomized study. Primary endpoints include proportion of participants with undetectable hepatitis delta virus (HDV) RNA (defined as HDV RNA equal or greater than 2 log 10 decrease from baseline or below limit of detection) up to week 24, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) normalization (defined as ALT below upper limit of normal) up to week 24, and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) up to 118 weeks. Secondary endpoints include proportion of participants with undetectable HDV RNA and different timepoints and up to 192 weeks. More information about this trial can be found at [clinicaltrials.gov](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fstudy%2FNCT05461170%3Fterm%3DNCT05461170%26spons%3DVir%2520Biotechnology%2C%2520Inc.%26rank%3D1&esheet=54154769&newsitemid=20241118939659&lan=en-US&anchor=clinicaltrials.gov&index=5&md5=1e77aa293edad335365cd405903f1d54) (NCT05461170). \n\n**About Tobevibart and Elebsiran**\n\nTobevibart is an investigational broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibody targeting the hepatitis B surface antigen. It is designed to inhibit the entry of hepatitis B and hepatitis delta viruses into hepatocytes, and to reduce the level of circulating viral and subviral particles in the blood. Tobevibart, which incorporates Xencor’s Xtend™ and other Fc technologies, has been engineered to have an extended half-life and was identified using Vir Biotechnology’s proprietary monoclonal antibody discovery platform. Tobevibart is administered subcutaneously, and it is currently in clinical development for the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis B and patients with chronic hepatitis delta. \n\nElebsiran is an investigational hepatitis B virus-targeting small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) designed to degrade hepatitis B virus RNA transcripts and limit the production of hepatitis B surface antigen. Current data indicates that it has the potential to have direct antiviral activity against hepatitis B virus and hepatitis delta virus. Elebsiran is administered subcutaneously, and it is currently in clinical development for the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis B and patients with chronic hepatitis delta. It is the first asset in Vir Biotechnology’s collaboration with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to enter clinical studies. \n\nTobevibart and elebsiran are also being evaluated as a potential functional cure for chronic hepatitis B. Vir Biotechnology recently presented positive safety and efficacy end-of-treatment results from the MARCH Phase 2 clinical study evaluating combinations of tobevibart and elebsiran, alone or in combination with pegylated interferon alfa (PEG-IFNα), in participants with chronic hepatitis B in a late-breaker oral presentation at AASLD The Liver Meeting ® . \n\n**About Vir Biotechnology, Inc.**\n\nVir Biotechnology, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on powering the immune system to transform lives by discovering and developing medicines for serious infectious diseases and cancer.

(Nasdaq: VIR) today provided a corporate update and reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\n“This quarter was transformational for Vir. We have bolstered our clinical pipeline with three potential best-in-class dual-masked T-cell engagers in oncology, and have sharpened our focus within infectious diseases to the areas where we believe we can make the most significant impact for patients. We are also thrilled to welcome Jason O’Byrne as our new CFO. Jason brings a wealth of financial leadership experience, further strengthening our ability to bring these potentially transformative therapies to patients as quickly as possible,” said Marianne De Backer, M.Sc., Ph.D., MBA, Chief Executive Officer, Vir Biotechnology. “Looking ahead, this is an exciting time for the Company. We eagerly anticipate critical data in our hepatitis programs in the fourth quarter and look forward to sharing initial clinical data from our dual-masked T-cell engagers in the first quarter of 2025.” \n\n** Pipeline Programs **\n\n**Chronic Hepatitis Delta (CHD)**\n\n  * Preliminary data from the Phase 2 chronic hepatitis delta SOLSTICE study was presented at the European Study of the Liver (EASL) Meeting in June 2024. This data demonstrated the potential for transformative treatment for people living with chronic hepatitis delta, with both tobevibart as a monotherapy, and in combination with elebsiran, achieving high rates of virologic response and ALT normalization after 12 and 24 weeks of treatment. No treatment-related serious adverse events were observed. \n  * The combination of tobevibart and elebsiran has been granted Fast Track Designation by the U.S. FDA. Given the robust rates of virologic suppression observed with the combination, the Company is diligently working to advance this regimen into a pivotal development program as quickly as possible to address the urgent needs of these patients. \n  * At the upcoming American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) “The Liver Meeting” in November 2024, the Company will present additional data from the Phase 2 chronic hepatitis delta SOLSTICE trial, including: 24-week clinical data for both study cohorts in approximately 60 patients and further data for those patients who were on study beyond 24 weeks at the time of data cut-off. \n    * One cohort assesses the combination of tobevibart and elebsiran administered every four weeks, while a second cohort evaluates tobevibart monotherapy administered every two weeks. \n  * The SOLSTICE trial is evaluating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of tobevibart and elebsiran for the treatment of chronic hepatitis delta. \n\n\n\n**Chronic Hepatitis B (CHB)**\n\n  * The Company plans to share end-of-treatment data from the Phase 2 MARCH Part B trial as a Late Breaking presentation at the AASLD meeting in November 2024. \n    * The MARCH-B trial is evaluating the safety, tolerability and antiviral activity of the triplet combination of tobevibart and elebsiran plus peginterferon alfa-2a in approximately 30 participants, and approximately 50 participants treated with the doublet combination of tobevibart and elebsiran. \n    * The Company plans to share further data assessing a potential functional cure in the second quarter of 2025. \n\n\n\n**Solid Tumors**\n\n  * VIR-5818 is a dual-masked HER2-targeted T-cell engager in clinical development designed to minimize off-tumor toxicity, potentially allowing for higher doses and increased efficacy to address the significant unmet needs of patients with HER2 expressing cancers. \n    * A Phase 1 basket study of VIR-5818 as a monotherapy, and in combination with pembrolizumab, is on-going in multiple tumor types, including metastatic breast cancer and metastatic colorectal cancer. \n    * The Company plans to share initial clinical data for VIR-5818 in the first quarter of 2025. \n  * VIR-5500 is a dual-masked PSMA directed T-cell engager in clinical development designed to minimize off-tumor toxicity and potentially improve efficacy relative to the existing approved PSMA-targeted therapies. \n    * A Phase 1 dose escalation study of VIR-5500 is ongoing to assess its safety profile and optimal dose levels for future development in metastatic-castration resistant prostate cancer. \n    * The Company plans to share initial clinical data for VIR-5500 in the first quarter of 2025. \n  * VIR-5525 is a dual-masked EGFR targeted T-cell engager with a cleared Investigational New Drug Application (IND) from the U.S. FDA. \n    * The Company plans to initiate a Phase 1 basket study of VIR-5525 in the first quarter of 2025 in patients across a number of solid tumor indications of high unmet need, which may include metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, metastatic adenocarcinoma, squamous non-small cell lung cancer, and metastatic colorectal cancer. \n\n\n\n**Preclinical Pipeline Candidates**\n\n  * The Company continues to advance pre-clinical assets in respiratory syncytial virus in partnership with GSK and pursue HIV cure in collaboration with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. \n\n\n\n** Corporate Update **\n\n  * On August 1, 2024 the Company [announced](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.vir.bio%2Fnews%2Fnews-details%2F2024%2FVir-Biotechnology-Acts-on-Expanded-Strategy-of-Powering-the-Immune-System-Through-Exclusive-Worldwide-License-Agreement-with-Sanofi-for-Multiple-Potential-Best-in-Class-Clinical-Stage-T-cell-Engagers%2Fdefault.aspx&esheet=54145053&newsitemid=20241031806056&lan=en-US&anchor=announced&index=1&md5=b70773b79fddfebd02acef156d0171eb) an exclusive worldwide license to three clinical-stage masked T-cell engagers (TCEs) with potential applications in a range of cancers, as well as the exclusive use of the proprietary PRO-XTEN™ masking platform for oncology and infectious disease.

The Company is seeking partners to advance these clinical programs through further development. Additionally, the Company announced a workforce reduction of approximately 25%, or approximately 140 employees, and expects to end 2024 with approximately 435 employees – a decrease of approximately 200 from its peak headcount in the second quarter of 2023. \n  * On September 10, 2024, the Company [announced](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.vir.bio%2Fnews%2Fnews-details%2F2024%2FVir-Biotechnology-Appoints-Jason-OByrne-as-Chief-Financial-Officer%2Fdefault.aspx&esheet=54145053&newsitemid=20241031806056&lan=en-US&anchor=announced&index=4&md5=752c07cd91121082adb16602c09a5084) the appointment of Jason O’Byrne as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, effective October 2, 2024. Mr. O’Byrne is an accomplished executive with more than 20 years of finance and operations experience, and brings leadership in capital allocation and formation, corporate strategy and operational excellence. \n  * The Company will host two virtual investor events instead of the previously scheduled R&D Day in the fourth quarter of 2024. The first event, focusing on our hepatitis programs, will be held in November 2024, following the AASLD conference, and will provide detailed updates on our hepatitis delta and hepatitis B programs. In the first quarter of 2025, the Company will share initial clinical data for our masked T-cell engager programs during a second dedicated investor event. \n\n\n\n** Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results **\n\n**Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments:** As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately $1.19 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments, representing a decrease of approximately $245.1 million during the third quarter of 2024. The decrease includes a $103.7 million upfront payment made to Sanofi upon the closing of the agreement and a $75.0 million escrowed milestone payment reclassified to restricted cash. The escrowed milestone is subject to VIR-5525 achieving \"first in human dosing\" by 2026. Excluding the impact of the Sanofi agreement, the decrease in cash, cash equivalents and investments in the third quarter was approximately $66.4 million. \n\n**Revenues:** Total revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, were $2.4 million compared to $2.6 million for the same period in 2023. \n\n**Cost of Revenue:** Cost of revenue was nominal for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023. \n\n**Research and Development Expenses (R &D):** R&D expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $195.2 million, which included $8.9 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense, compared to $145.0 million for the same period in 2023, which included $15.8 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense. The increase was primarily driven by $102.8 million of the Sanofi upfront payment being recognized as in-process research and development expense, partially offset by lower clinical development costs and manufacturing costs associated with the discontinued flu asset, VIR-2482. \n\n**Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG &A): ** SG&A expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $25.7 million, which included $7.8 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense, compared to $40.9 million for the same period in 2023, which included $11.1 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense. The decrease was largely related to cost savings initiatives implemented during the second half of 2023. \n\n**Restructuring, long-lived assets impairment and related charges:** Restructuring, long-lived assets impairment and related charges for the third quarter of 2024 were $12.7 million compared to $3.4 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by severance charges incurred related to our strategic restructuring announcement in August 2024 and to a lesser extent right-of-use asset impairment charges related to the closing of our Portland, Oregon facility, which was previously announced on December 13, 2023. \n\n**Other Income:** Other income for the third quarter of 2024 was $17.8 million compared to $20.1 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower interest income. \n\n**(Provision for) Benefit from Income Taxes:** Provision for income taxes for the third quarter of 2024 was $0.2 million compared to a benefit from income taxes of $3.2 million for the same period in 2023. \n\n**Net Loss:** Net loss attributable to Vir for the third quarter of 2024 was $(213.7) million, or $(1.56) per share, basic and diluted, compared to a net loss of $(163.4) million, or $(1.22) per share, basic and diluted for the same period in 2023. \n\n** 20 24 Financial Guidance **\n\nThe Company has updated its operating expense guidance for the full-year 2024, which includes the upfront in-process research and development expense associated with the clinical-stage T-cell engagers licensed through its agreement with Sanofi: \n\n_(in $ millions)_  \n---  \nGAAP operating expense range:  |  $  |  660  |  to  |  $  |  680   \nThe following expenses are included in the GAAP operating expense range:   \nUpfront payment to Sanofi recognized as R&D expense in the third quarter of 2024  |  $103   \nStock-based compensation expense  |  $  |  90  |  to  |  $  |  80   \nRestructuring charges*  |  $  |  40  |  to  |  $  |  30   \n* Restructuring charges include employee severance cash payouts, as well as non-cash expense related to the closing of two R&D sites previously announced on December 13, 2023.   \n  \nThe GAAP operating expense guidance does not include the effect of GAAP adjustments caused by events that may occur subsequent to the publication of this guidance, including, but not limited to, business development activities, litigation, in-process R&D impairments, and changes in the fair value of contingent considerations. \n\n** Conference Call **\n\nVir will host a conference call to discuss the third quarter results at 1:30 p.m. PT / 4:30 p.m. ET today. A live webcast will be available on [https://investors.vir.bio/](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.vir.bio%2F&esheet=54145053&newsitemid=20241031806056&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.vir.bio%2F&index=5&md5=ae13994c066f6ac86f27cf4a8c4b5a07) and will be archived on [www.vir.bio](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vir.bio&esheet=54145053&newsitemid=20241031806056&lan=en-US&anchor=www.vir.bio&index=6&md5=6ec27c15b6d6c156dd97590e6cb8cb2d) for 30 days. \n\n**About Tobevibart (VIR-3434)**\n\nTobevibart is an investigational broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibody targeting the hepatitis B surface antigen. It is designed to inhibit the entry of hepatitis B and hepatitis delta viruses into hepatocytes, and to reduce the level of circulating viral and subviral particles in the blood. Tobevibart, which incorporates Xencor’s Xtend™ and other Fc technologies, has been engineered to have an extended half-life and was identified using Vir’s proprietary monoclonal antibody discovery platform. Tobevibart is administered subcutaneously, and it is currently in clinical development for treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis B and patients with chronic hepatitis delta. \n\n**About Elebsiran (VIR-2218)**\n\nElebsiran is an investigational hepatitis B virus-targeting small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) designed to degrade hepatitis B virus RNA transcripts and limit the production of hepatitis B surface antigen. Current data indicates that it has the potential to have direct antiviral activity against hepatitis B virus and hepatitis delta virus. Elebsiran is administered subcutaneously, and it is currently in clinical development for treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis B and patients with chronic hepatitis delta. It is the first asset in Vir’s collaboration with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to enter clinical studies. \n\n**About VIR-5818, VIR-5500, VIR-5525**\n\nVIR-5818, VIR-5500, VIR-5525 are investigational, clinical candidates currently being evaluated for the treatment of solid tumors. These assets leverage the PRO-XTEN™ masking technology with three different T-cell engagers (TCEs) targeting HER2, PSMA, and EGFR, respectively. \n\nTCEs are powerful anti-tumor agents that direct the immune system, specifically T-cells, to destroy cancer cells. The PRO-XTEN™ masking technology is designed to keep the TCEs inactive (or masked) until they reach the tumor microenvironment, where tumor-specific proteases cleave off the mask and activate the TCEs leading to killing of cancer cells. By driving the activity exclusively to the tumor microenvironment, we aim to circumvent the traditionally high toxicity associated with TCEs and increase their efficacy and tolerability. Additionally, the mask also helps drug candidates stay in the bloodstream longer in their inactive form, allowing them to better reach the site of action and potentially allowing more convenient dosing regimens for patients and clinicians. \n\n**About Vir Biotechnology, Inc.**\n\nVir Biotechnology, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on powering the immune system to transform lives by discovering and developing medicines for serious infectious diseases and cancer. Vir’s clinical-stage portfolio includes infectious disease programs for chronic hepatitis delta and chronic hepatitis B infections, in addition to programs across several clinically validated targets in solid tumor indications. Vir also has a preclinical portfolio of programs across a range of other infectious diseases and oncologic malignancies. Vir routinely posts information that may be important to investors on its website. \n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as “should,” “could,” “may,” “might,” “will,” “plan,” “potential,” “aim,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “promising” and similar expressions (as well as other words or expressions referencing future events, conditions or circumstances) are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on Vir’s expectations and assumptions as of the date of this press release. Forward-looking statements contained in this press release include, but are not limited to, statements regarding; Vir’s cash balance; Vir’s future financial and operating results and its expectations related thereto including Vir’s financial guidance; Vir’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the exclusive worldwide license agreement with Sanofi; potential of, and expectations for, Vir’s pipeline; Vir’s clinical and preclinical development programs; clinical studies, including the enrollment of clinical studies, and the expected timing of data readouts and presentations; the potential benefits, safety, and efficacy of Vir’s investigational therapies; Vir’s strategy and plans; and risks and uncertainties associated with drug development and commercialization. Many factors may cause differences between current expectations and actual results, including whether or when anticipated cost reductions will be achieved; unexpected safety or efficacy data or results observed during clinical studies or in data readouts; the occurrence of adverse safety events; risks of unexpected costs, delays or other unexpected hurdles; difficulties in collaborating with other companies; successful development and/or commercialization of alternative product candidates by Vir’s competitors; changes in expected or existing competition; delays in or disruptions to Vir’s business or clinical studies due to geopolitical changes or other external factors; failure to achieve any necessary regulatory approvals; the timing and amount of actual expenses, including, without limitation, Vir’s anticipated combined GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses; and unexpected litigation or other disputes. Drug development and commercialization involve a high degree of risk, and only a small number of research and development programs result in commercialization of a product. Results in early-stage clinical studies may not be indicative of full results or results from later stage or larger scale clinical studies and do not ensure regulatory approval. You should not place undue reliance on these statements, or the scientific data presented. Other factors that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements in this press release are discussed in Vir’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including the section titled “Risk Factors” contained therein. Except as required by law, Vir assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in expectations, even as new information becomes available. \n\nPRO-XTEN™ is a trademark of Amunix Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Sanofi company. \n\n**VIR BIOTECHNOLOGY, INC.** **Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets** **_(in thousands, except share and per share data)_ ** **_(unaudited)_ **  \n---  \n**September 30,** **2024** |  **December 31,** **2023**  \n**ASSETS**  \nCURRENT ASSETS:   \nCash and cash equivalents  |  $  |  168,350  |  $  |  241,576   \nShort-term investments  |  740,607  |  1,270,980   \nRestricted cash and cash equivalents, current  |  89,598  |  13,268   \nEquity investments  |  5,517  |  9,853   \nPrepaid expenses and other current assets  |  43,085  |  52,549   \nTotal current assets  |  1,047,157  |  1,588,226   \nIntangible assets, net  |  19,258  |  22,565   \nGoodwill  |  16,938  |  16,937   \nProperty and equipment, net  |  64,791  |  96,018   \nOperating lease right-of-use assets  |  60,779  |  71,182   \nRestricted cash and cash equivalents, noncurrent  |  6,382  |  6,448   \nLong-term investments  |  271,495  |  105,275   \nOther assets  |  11,556  |  12,409   \nTOTAL ASSETS  |  $  |  1,498,356  |  $  |  1,919,060   \n**LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY**  \nCURRENT LIABILITIES:   \nAccounts payable  |  $  |  7,305  |  $  |  6,334   \nAccrued and other liabilities  |  94,658  |  104,220   \nDeferred revenue, current  |  15,198  |  64,853   \nTotal current liabilities  |  117,161  |  175,407   \nOperating lease liabilities, noncurrent  |  93,405  |  111,673   \nContingent consideration, noncurrent  |  33,170  |  25,960   \nOther long-term liabilities  |  13,893  |  15,784   \nTOTAL LIABILITIES  |  257,629  |  328,824   \nCommitments and contingencies (Note 8)   \nSTOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY:   \nPreferred stock, $0.0001 par value; 10,000,000 shares authorized as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023; no shares issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023  |  —  |  —   \nCommon stock, $0.0001 par value; 300,000,000 shares authorized as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023; 136,706,350 and 134,781,286 shares issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively  |  14  |  13   \nAdditional paid-in capital  |  1,894,781  |  1,828,862   \nAccumulated other comprehensive gain (loss)  |  1,127  |  (815  |  )   \nAccumulated deficit  |  (655,195  |  )  |  (237,824  |  )   \nTOTAL STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY  |  1,240,727  |  1,590,236   \nTOTAL LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY  |  $  |  1,498,356  |  $  |  1,919,060   \n  \n**VIR BIOTECHNOLOGY, INC.** **Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations** **(_in thousands, except share and per share data_ ) ** **_(unaudited)_ **  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended** **September 30,**  \n**2024** |  **2023**  \nRevenues:   \nCollaboration revenue  |  $  |  (1,102  |  )  |  $  |  (4,387  |  )   \nContract revenue  |  1,391  |  289   \nGrant revenue  |  2,091  |  6,737   \nTotal revenues  |  2,380  |  2,639   \nOperating expenses:   \nCost of revenue  |  50  |  38   \nResearch and development  |  195,178  |  145,028   \nSelling, general and administrative  |  25,744  |  40,933   \nRestructuring, long-lived assets impairment and related charges  |  12,712  |  3,372   \nTotal operating expenses  |  233,684  |  189,371   \nLoss from operations  |  (231,304  |  )  |  (186,732  |  )   \nOther income:   \nChange in fair value of equity investments  |  1,130  |  (2,707  |  )   \nInterest income  |  17,527  |  21,931   \nOther (expense) income, net  |  (893  |  )  |  882   \nTotal other income  |  17,764  |  20,106   \nLoss before (provision for) benefit from income taxes  |  (213,540  |  )  |  (166,626  |  )   \n(Provision for) benefit from income taxes  |  (177  |  )  |  3,213   \nNet loss  |  (213,717  |  )  |  (163,413  |  )   \nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interest  |  —  |  —   \nNet loss attributable to Vir  |  $  |  (213,717  |  )  |  $  |  (163,413  |  )   \nNet loss per share attributable to Vir, basic and diluted  |  $  |  (1.56  |  )  |  $  |  (1.22  |  )   \nWeighted-average shares outstanding, basic and diluted  |  136,653,753  |  134,289,620   \n  \n**Media** Arran Attridge Senior Vice President, Corporate Communications aattridge@vir.bio\n\n**Investors** Richard Lepke Senior Director, Investor Relations rlepke@vir.bio\n\nSource: Vir Biotechnology, Inc.\n\n[ View all news ](/news/default.aspx)\n"
