We look forward to presenting additional data from patients at efficacious dose cohorts by early next year,” said Ahmed Hamdy, M.D., Chief Executive Officer. “Securing the funding necessary to advance our programs remains a priority. Alongside exploring financing options, we remain focused on strategic partnerships, particularly as pharmaceutical companies intensify their search for truly differentiated and transformative technologies.”\n\n**THIRD QUARTER 2024 CLINICAL PROGRAM HIGHLIGHTS AND ANTICIPATED MILESTONES**\n\n**VIP943**\n\n  * VIP943 is a novel CD123-targeted ADC developed with the Company’s next-generation VersAptx platform.\n  * VIP943 has shown promising safety, efficacy, and tolerability in an ongoing Phase 1 dose-escalation study for patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) ([NCT06034275](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06034275?term=VIP943&rank=1)). In October, the Company reported two complete responses in this Phase 1 study: one out of four patients with relapsed AML in the 1 mg/kg dose cohort achieved complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi), and one out of one patient with higher-risk MDS in the 1.3 mg/kg dose cohort achieved complete remission with limited count recovery (CRL).\n  * VIP943 has shown effective target engagement and elimination of CD123+ malignant cells, with pharmacodynamic data demonstrating decreases in CD123+ blasts after dosing. Preliminary pharmacokinetic data indicates minimal payload release (≤1% in plasma), signifying a stable linker.\n  * Given the favorable safety and tolerability observed for VIP943, the Company continues dose escalation to assess potential for additional efficacy. Enrollment in the once-weekly and twice-weekly (as an induction therapy) dosing schedules is ongoing.\n  * Vincerx expects to share additional Phase 1 study data for VIP943 by early 2025.\n\n\n\n**Enitociclib**\n\n  * Enitociclib is a highly selective CDK9 inhibitor designed to block the activation of RNA polymerase II, leading to inhibition of oncogenes, including MYC and MCL1.\n  * Enitociclib is currently in a Phase 1 dose-escalation study ([NTC05371054](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05371054)) evaluating the combination of enitociclib, venetoclax, and prednisone in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL). This study is being conducted in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health (NIH). As of September 2024, the study reported four partial responses (PRs) in seven patients (57% overall response rate), including one patient with double hit lymphoma (DH-DLBCL) and three patients with PTCL.\n  * Enitociclib has successfully completed its Phase 1 dose-escalation study as a monotherapy ([NCT02635672](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02635672?term=vip152&rank=2)), enrolling 63 patients across dose-escalation and expansion cohorts. The treatment demonstrated a favorable safety profile, dose-proportional pharmacokinetics, and on-target pharmacodynamic activity. Clinical benefits included durable complete metabolic remissions in two patients with DH-DLBCL, lasting 3.7 and 2.3 years, with both remissions continuing more than two years after treatment cessation. In addition, a transformed follicular (tFL) patient achieved a PR with a 63% tumor reduction after nearly two years, a meaningful outcome given the historically poor prognosis of tFL. Furthermore, 13 patients with solid tumors achieved stable disease as their best response, including five ovarian cancer patients—indicating a promising path for future combination studies in this indication.\n  * The Company is actively focused on finding a strategic partner to continue the development of this asset.\n\n\n\n**VIP236**\n\n  * VIP236 is a αVβ3 SMDC conjugated to an optimized camptothecin (CPT) payload developed with the Company’s VersAptx platform.\n  * VIP236 has completed its Phase 1 dose-escalation study ([NCT05712889](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05712889)), identifying the maximum tolerated dose that could be utilized in future studies. As reported in October, a total of 29 patients were enrolled in the Phase 1 study, resulting in a 45% disease control rate. The drug demonstrated a favorable safety profile, distinguishing itself from other CPTs by showing no instances of common dose-limiting side effects such as life-threatening diarrhea, severe stomatitis/mucositis, or interstitial lung disease.\n  * The Company intends to identify a partner to champion VIP236 through further development.\n\n\n\n**THIRD QUARTER 2024 FINANCIAL RESULTS**\n\n  * Vincerx had approximately $10.1 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024, as compared to approximately $16.3 million as of June 30, 2024. Based on its current business plans and assumptions, Vincerx believes its available capital will be sufficient to meet its operating requirements into early 2025.\n  * Research and development expenses for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, were approximately $3.9 million, as compared to approximately $6.1 million for the same period in 2023. This decrease is primarily the result of decreases in research services of approximately $2.4 million and personnel-related expenses of approximately $0.8 million, offset by an increase in clinical-related expenses of approximately $0.9 million.\n  * General and administrative expenses for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, were approximately $3.9 million, as compared to approximately $3.5 million for the same period in 2023. This increase was due to a $0.5 million increase in professional services, partially offset by a decrease in personnel-related expenses of $0.1 million.\n  * For the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, Vincerx reported a net loss of approximately $7.8 million, or $0.17 per share. For the third quarter ended September 30, 2023, Vincerx reported a net loss of approximately $9.0 million, or $0.42 per share.\n\n\n\n**About Vincerx Pharma, Inc.** Vincerx Pharma, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to developing differentiated and novel therapies to address the unmet medical needs of patients with cancer.

Yair Levy_\n\nPALO ALTO, Calif., Oct. 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- [Vincerx Pharma, Inc.](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=pCliP23GRVuvczW7w9URDwCkmmcLVCVDfbAqgL0-6fsuuCh4VOuEm_z3P9leCGZizu7mo6G0noksDlRDgfUhuA==) (Nasdaq: VINC), a biopharmaceutical company aspiring to address the unmet medical needs of patients with cancer through paradigm-shifting therapeutics, announced two complete responses in the ongoing first-in-human, Phase 1 dose-escalation study of VIP943, the Company’s next-generation antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) being evaluated in relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML), higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (HR-MDS), and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). The Company also provided pipeline and corporate updates.\n\n**VIP943 Data Highlights**\n\nThe ongoing Phase 1 dose-escalation study of VIP943 has enrolled 22 patients to date across several escalating dose cohorts (0.2 to 1.3 mg/kg once weekly). These 22 patients represent a ‘hard-to-treat’ salvage population, which rarely responds to monotherapy. Nine patients (six AML; three HR-MDS) have received at least three doses of an efficacious dose of VIP943 (i.e., ≥1.0 mg/kg). Of these nine patients, four (44%) remain on study. So far, one patient with relapsed AML has achieved complete remission with incomplete hematologic improvement ([CRi](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=cQajofLq0mBVoE5bdvuKR0jskvjErVSQaSv9gbtksCDXezu7BMC_jMx5NxwYwRAzLV9qc4fOPMIX8VQN9vkoJxM37pJx0EadTrQbnVb9cjI=)) and one patient with HR-MDS has achieved complete remission with limited count recovery ([CR](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=H1-VlrUzYkAcEGwtFlHFGX0bm5LofxSU2YcutcdqmC9k1XH4friyQhFi75viS-wW-VAHzMaJhaQ-14XZc5sSuVZJnHWZyRIH_jbVYU3671I=)[L](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=QCGJ_g3rs5_TQoVyRCgpaADBl8OPEnu_fsp23R-fqpu9I9IBmNhvUX-kdsR21P5250vNAISVyLq-7vvx095DorLDLrmNDuLviIGJ4ahZclY=)) based on international consensus response criteria. These response criteria are widely recognized as an approvable benchmark in AML and MDS studies, further underscoring the significance of these early results.\n\n“We are excited by the emerging data from our Phase 1 study of VIP943, showing clinical responses in difficult-to-treat patients,\" said Ahmed Hamdy, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Vincerx. \"We believe these promising clinical responses highlight the potential of VIP943 as a best-in-class therapy for CD123+ hematologic malignancies and validate our VersAptx platform’s ability to create safer, more effective bioconjugates by overcoming the challenges of historical ADCs.”\n\nAs of August 2024, VIP943 has shown favorable safety and tolerability, with no dose-limiting toxicities reported in 22 patients. Serious adverse events (SAEs) have been consistent with expectations for this patient population. The most common SAEs included pneumonia (three patients, 14%), and cellulitis and febrile neutropenia (two patients each, 9%). Only one patient (5%) experienced a drug-related SAE (Grade 3 diarrhea).\n\nTarget engagement (i.e., receptor occupancy) has been demonstrated by binding of VIP943 to CD123+ peripheral blood blasts from patients with AML from the Phase 1 study. Maximal receptor occupancy of 84% was achieved in the highest dose cohort (1.3 mg/kg). Across all the cohorts, receptor occupancy was retained for less than 96 hours. Concurrent decreases in CD123+ peripheral blood blasts were also observed after dosing. These pharmacodynamic (PD) markers show that VIP943 is binding to and eliminating CD123+ malignant cells. Preliminary pharmacokinetic (PK) data continues to show low release of payload (≤1% in plasma). The half-life of VIP943 is less than 96 hours, and no accumulation occurs with repeat dosing. These PK and PD results have prompted evaluation of twice weekly dosing of VIP943 as a potential “induction” regimen. Enrollment in the once weekly and twice weekly dosing cohorts is ongoing.\n\nDr. Hamdy continued, “Our initial clinical results demonstrate that VersAptx is a next-generation platform that overcomes key challenges associated with traditional ADCs. The PK profile shows that our linker is stable, cleaving exclusively inside cells without extracellular degradation. Our PD results coupled with clinical responses confirm the payload effectively kills cancer cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow without harming nearby healthy tissue. This innovative design with proof-of-concept in Phase 1 reinforces our confidence in VersAptx as a transformative platform for ADC development.”\n\nThe company anticipates providing another data update on the ongoing Phase 1 VIP943 study by the end of the year.\n\nDr. M. Yair Levy, Director of Hematologic Malignancies Research at Texas Oncology added, \"Although this is still early data, VIP943 is clearly differentiated from other ADCs, particularly with its favorable safety profile. We’re not seeing neutropenia as a dose-limiting toxicity, which is encouraging and may allow the drug to move into earlier lines of therapy in combination. I look forward to the continued development of VIP943 and its potential to improve treatment options for patients with CD123+ malignancies.”\n\n**VIP236 Update**\n\nVIP236 is Vincerx’s first-in-class small molecule drug conjugate (SMDC) being evaluated in an ongoing first-in-human, Phase 1 dose-escalation study as a monotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumors. As of September 2024, 29 patients have been enrolled. Of these patients, 20 were evaluable per-protocol for response from the every 2- or 3-week schedule; nine of 20 patients had stable disease for a disease control rate of 45%. In addition, one of these subjects has been on treatment for over 300 days and four additional patients were on study for more than 120 days, demonstrating promising monotherapy duration of response in patients with advanced cancer. VIP236 continued to show a favorable safety and tolerability profile in these 29 patients, with no instances of the dose-limiting side effects commonly associated with camptothecins, such as life-threatening diarrhea, severe stomatitis/mucositis, or interstitial lung disease. These results support the potential role of VIP236 as a strong combination agent for the treatment of advanced cancers.\n\nConsidering the promising VIP236 clinical data, the Company intends to pursue a strategic partner to champion its future development for the benefit of patients.\n\n“We've made significant progress in identifying an effective dose and schedule. We believe it is now crucial to study VIP236 in the right patient population, which could include triple-negative breast cancer and gastric cancer, where camptothecins are used, especially in combination with other anticancer agents,” added Dr. Hamdy.\n\nBy transitioning VIP236 to a partnering asset, the Company plans to streamline its operations and focus its efforts on the continued development of its lead ADC, VIP943.\n\n**Enitociclib Update**\n\nEnitociclib, a highly selective CDK9 inhibitor, is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 dose-escalation study in combination with venetoclax and prednisone for relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL), in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health (NIH). As of September 2024, the study reported four partial responses (PRs) in seven patients (57% overall response rate), including one patient with double hit lymphoma (DH-DLBCL) and three patients with PTCL. All responses occurred in patients considered refractory by SCHOLAR-1 [criteria](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=wzVXKwPPNIyvQNa0b7q2x9fnkElHB0aMGm31zwvPPmgtquBt2XEA3_YZIIEDR1A-6PXxjjjvbJmfM8_DauoaJletjMcs14RRotS9R_gPNwE=) and included one patient with prior CAR-T therapy. The study is currently enrolling in the third dose level (enitociclib 30 mg [efficacious dose] and venetoclax 600 mg) with two patients enrolled to date.\n\nAdditionally, in a separate Phase 1 study of enitociclib as a monotherapy (30 mg), one patient with transformed follicular lymphoma achieved a metabolic PR. As of September 2024, this patient remains on enitociclib monotherapy after more than 26 months. Overall, these clinical results continue to show the promising safety, tolerability, and efficacy of enitociclib for the treatment of relapsed/refractory lymphoma. The Company is actively focused on finding a strategic partner to continue the development of this asset.\n\n**Corporate Webcast**\n\nVincerx will host a corporate webcast today at 5:00 PM EDT. The webcast will provide a pipeline and corporate update, including discussing the initial clinical data from the Phase 1 dose-escalation study of VIP943, followed by commentary with key opinion leader, Dr. M. Yair Levy (Texas Oncology), and live Q&A with Vincerx leadership.\n\nThe webcast may be accessed through the “Corporate Overview & Events” in the Investors section of the Company’s website, located at [investors.vincerx.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=9dVCE6Thwx4xaRmQEpbyKK0BCWO2qT2ZZsC1V8_gqIigLqzqSrM1O-kJfIzCMK4mmEE6vNi_vIyD4w8_-JEQRKzUmJXizjHO9bpczECVkyBK1Yd3umiaL6xMnJ6qVJLoAyHG88sDgqKW2dXW4FZC6A==). An archived replay will be available shortly following the webcast.\n\n**About VIP236** VIP236, the first-in-class SMDC from the VersAptx Platform, consists of an αvβ3 integrin binder, a neutrophil elastase linker cleaved in the tumor microenvironment, and a camptothecin payload optimized for high permeability and low active efflux. VIP236 was designed to deliver its payload to advanced/metastatic solid tumors that express αvβ3. VIP236 is being evaluated in a first-in-human, Phase 1 dose escalation study in patients with advanced malignancies ([NCT05712889](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=9cpSzGC1xskU5gpA6djeAiIjDfRAjvJD6psup9U8Qrk1Tj6ROZuugh8WkAGAoBHVU3jFTFP_voYYrB2SzLtQTaxpRDMebttQxs64hzlTops=)).\n\n**About VIP943** VIP943, the first ADC from the VersAptx platform, consists of an anti-CD123 antibody, a unique linker cleaved intracellularly by legumain, and a novel kinesin spindle protein inhibitor (KSPi) payload enhanced with Vincerx’s CellTrapper™ technology. Vincerx’s proprietary effector chemistry (linker + payload) was designed to reduce non-specific release of the payload and ensure payload accumulation in cancer cells versus healthy cells. The increased therapeutic index has the potential to address challenges associated with many ADCs by improving efficacy and reducing severe toxicities. VIP943 is being evaluated in a Phase 1 dose-escalation trial in patients with relapsed/refractory AML, HR-MDS, and B-ALL who have exhausted standard therapeutic options ([NCT06034275](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=WtLsen87TLS3AIysZXWUqwJxsFJ1sSVLJSDCS0_uElLy3rZNzS5seuFEwgA_GM-E7AoEA1mdU9IgNjpjLhBB2hluw71AqB9zNabkFfwQOl-WFP9TSy3oquLQdcssTfNaFXfTAgaXN4sP4hBQh1xEMA==)).\n\n**About Enitociclib** Enitociclib, a highly selective CDK9 inhibitor, is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 dose-escalation study ([NCT05371054](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=9cpSzGC1xskU5gpA6djeAtY47WDuNaNvTYc_Kz0wQPawYPXcv2fNhak-TWVTwsqdOcWE2pkmzP8mGkQOE4me6lMP0rrPvI5tem_CfmcO0jM=)) in combination with venetoclax and prednisone for DLBCL and PTCL, in collaboration with the NIH.

Its next-generation effector chemistry was designed to address challenges associated with many ADCs by improving efficacy and reducing severe toxicities.\n  * Vincerx expects to share additional Phase 1 study data for VIP943 for patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) ([NCT06034275](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06034275?term=VIP943&rank=1)) by the end of Q4 2024.\n\n\n\n**VIP236**\n\n  * VIP236 is an αVβ3 SMDC conjugated to an optimized camptothecin (CPT) payload created from Vincerx’s VersAptx platform. VIP236 is a first-in-class drug designed to deliver its optimized CPT payload directly to tumor tissues to overcome chemotherapy-related side effects. Preclinical studies have shown 11 times more optimized CPT is delivered to the cancerous tissues than found circulating in the blood. In addition, the optimized CPT is designed to limit drug transporter liabilities, a common mechanism for cancer resistance to chemotherapy.\n  * Vincerx looks forward to sharing additional data from this Phase 1 study ([NTC05371054](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05712889?term=VIP236&rank=1)) by the end of Q3 2024.\n\n\n\n**Enitociclib**\n\n  * Enitociclib is a highly selective CDK9 inhibitor designed to block the activation of RNA polymerase II, leading to the reduction of oncogenes, including MYC and MCL1.\n  * Enitociclib is currently in a Phase 1 dose-escalation study ([NTC05371054](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05371054?term=%22vip152%22&rank=2)) evaluating the combination of enitociclib, venetoclax and prednisone in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL). This study is being conducted in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health (NIH). \n    * At the AACR Advances in Malignant Lymphoma meeting in June 2024, the NIH presented the interim study results previously shared by Vincerx in [January 2024](https://investors.vincerapharma.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vincerx-pharma-announces-compelling-clinical-efficacy) and [May 2024](https://investors.vincerapharma.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vincerx-pharma-reports-first-quarter-2024-financial-results-and).\n\n\n\n**VIP924**\n\n  * VIP924 is a first-in-class CXCR5-targeted ADC created from Vincerx’s VersAptx platform.\n  * VIP924 can be evaluated in B-cell malignancies, including mantle cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, DLBCL, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia , as a monotherapy and in combination.\n  * IND application is anticipated in early 2026, pending funding.\n\n\n\n**VersAptx™ Platform**\n\n  * VersAptx is Vincerx’s versatile and adaptable, next-generation bioconjugation platform. The modular nature of this platform enables the combination of different targeting, linker, and payload technologies to develop bespoke bioconjugates to address different cancer biologies.\n\n\n\n**SECOND QUARTER 2024 FINANCIAL RESULTS**\n\n  * Vincerx had approximately $16.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of June 30, 2024, as compared to approximately $5.1 million as of March 31, 2024. Based on its current business plans and assumptions, Vincerx believes its available capital, including the proceeds of its April financing of approximately $16.9 million, will be sufficient to meet its operating requirements through the end of 2024.\n  * Research and development expenses for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024 were approximately $3.8 million, as compared to approximately $8.2 million for the same period in 2023. This decrease is primarily the result of decreases in research services of approximately $1.8 million, manufacturing services associated with our ADC program of approximately $1.6 million, and personnel related expenses of approximately $0.8 million.\n  * General and administrative expenses for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024 were approximately $3.6 million, as compared to approximately $3.8 million for the same period in 2023. This decrease is primarily driven by decreases in personnel-related expenses of approximately $0.3 million.\n  * For the second quarter ended June 30, 2024, Vincerx reported a net loss of approximately $1.8 million, or $0.05 per share. For the second quarter ended June 30, 2023, Vincerx reported a net loss of approximately $11.6 million, or $0.54 per share.\n\n\n\n**About Vincerx Pharma, Inc.** Vincerx Pharma, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to developing differentiated and novel therapies to address the unmet medical needs of patients with cancer.

We look forward to sharing an update on VIP236 by the end of Q3 and on VIP943 by the end of Q4. This timing will enable us to present more advanced dose-escalation data for both programs.”\n\n“We also continue to be excited by the clinical progress of enitociclib,” continued Dr. Hamdy. “We have one patient with tFL who has achieved a metabolic PR and continues on enitociclib monotherapy therapy after 33 cycles. In addition, in the NIH study of enitociclib in combination with venetoclax and prednisone, two-thirds of patients have achieved a PR. We believe these clinical results show enitociclib is a best-in-class CDK9 inhibitor and has the potential to be a preferred partner for innovative combination therapies for hard-to-treat cancers.”\n\n**FIRST QUARTER 2024 CLINICAL PROGRAM HIGHLIGHTS**\n\n**VIP236**\n\n  * VIP236 is an αVβ3 SMDC conjugated to an optimized camptothecin (CPT) payload, created from Vincerx’s VersAptx platform. VIP236 is a first-in-class drug designed to deliver its optimized CPT payload directly to tumor tissues to overcome chemotherapy-related side effects. Preclinical studies have shown 11 times more optimized CPT is delivered to the cancerous tissues than found circulating in the blood. In addition, the optimized CPT is designed to limit drug transporter liabilities, a common mechanism for cancer resistance to chemotherapy.\n  * At the 2024 American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting, Vincerx reported positive preliminary monotherapy data on VIP236 from a Phase 1 dose-escalation study demonstrating signs of clinical activity, including tumor reduction, and an improved safety profile in heavily pretreated patients with metastatic solid tumors.\n  * As of March 25, 2024, the VIP236 open-label, multicenter, Phase 1 dose-escalation study ([NTC05371054](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05712889?term=VIP236&rank=1)) had enrolled 20 patients with advanced or metastatic cancers unresponsive to standard therapies.\n  * Vincerx looks forward to sharing additional Phase 1 data by the end of Q3 2024. \n\n\n\n**VIP943**\n\n  * VIP943, a novel CD123-targeted ADC created from Vincerx’s VersAptx platform, consists of an anti-CD123 antibody, a unique linker cleaved intracellularly by legumain, and a novel kinesin spindle protein inhibitor (KSPi) payload enhanced with Vincerx’s CellTrapper® technology. Its next-generation effector chemistry was designed to address challenges associated with many ADCs by improving efficacy and reducing severe toxicities.\n  * Enrollment has begun in the fourth cohort of the Phase 1 dose-escalation study of VIP943 in relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) ([NCT06034275](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06034275?term=VIP943&rank=1)). Preliminary pharmacokinetic (PK) results on the first two cohorts were presented at the 2024 AACR Annual Meeting and as expected, showed very little payload circulating in the blood. In addition, no dose-limiting toxicities have occurred in the 11 patients who have received VIP943 so far. The preliminary PK and early observations of a favorable safety profile are consistent with VIP943 [preclinical data](https://investors.vincerx.com/static-files/3efc4d67-fae7-4011-9b5e-6b91324d398b). \n  * Vincerx expects to present updated Phase 1 dose-escalation data for VIP943 by the end of Q4 2024.\n\n\n\n**Enitociclib**\n\n  * Enitociclib is a highly selective CDK9 inhibitor designed to block the activation of RNA polymerase II, leading to the reduction of oncogenes, including MYC and MCL1.\n  * Enitociclib is currently in a Phase 1 dose-escalation study ([NTC05371054](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05371054?term=%22vip152%22&rank=2)) evaluating the combination of enitociclib, venetoclax and prednisone in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and PTCL. This study is being conducted in collaboration with the NIH. \n    * In January 2024, Vincerx and the NIH reported two PRs in patients with PTCL with tumor reductions ranging from 86% to 91%. Additionally, one PR was reported in a patient with double-hit diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DH-DLBCL) with an 80% reduction in tumor burden. Most recently, an additional PR was announced in PTCL with a reduction in lymph node size and skin lesions, totaling four PRs observed to date. Notably, these results were obtained with enitociclib doses below the anticipated efficacious levels. Currently, the study is enrolling patients for the third dose level (30 mg), which is the recommended dose established in the enitociclib monotherapy study.\n    * These data will be presented by the NIH at the upcoming AACR Advances in Malignant Lymphoma meeting in June 2024.\n  * In a Phase 1 dose-escalation study ([NCT02635672](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02635672?term=vip152&rank=2)) of enitociclib as a monotherapy, one newly confirmed metabolic PR was observed with 63% tumor reduction in a tFL patient who has been enrolled in the study for just under two years. This is particularly notable because outcomes of patients with tFL are historically poor. \n    * In total, this study enrolled 63 patients in the dose-escalation and expansion cohorts.\n    * Enitociclib showed a favorable safety profile, dose-proportional pharmacokinetics, and on-target pharmacodynamic activity.\n    * Significant clinical benefit across various indications includes two patients with DH-DLBCL who experienced durable complete metabolic remissions (3.7 and 2.3 years), which continued more than two years after stopping treatment.\n    * This long duration of treatment and response for patients with DH-DLBCL and tFL highlight enitociclib’s favorable safety profile and monotherapy efficacy in hard-to-treat hematologic malignancies.\n    * Additionally, 13 patients with solid tumors achieved stable disease as their best response to monotherapy treatment. Notably, of these, five were patients with ovarian cancer, providing a promising signal for future combination studies in this indication.\n  * Research collaborations continue with the University of Calgary and the Pediatric Oncology Experimental Therapeutics Investigators’ Consortium (POETIC) to discover combination strategies for pediatric leukemia and central nervous system tumors. To date, these collaborations have shown that enitociclib has monotherapy and combination activity in preclinical models of rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma and KMT2A-rearranged pediatric leukemia.\n\n\n\n**VIP924**\n\n  * VIP924 is a first-in-class CXCR5-targeted ADC created from Vincerx’s VersAptx platform.\n  * VIP924 can be evaluated in B-cell malignancies, including MCL, FL, DLBCL, and CLL and monotherapy and in combination.\n  * IND application is anticipated in late 2025 or early 2026, pending funding.\n\n\n\n**VersAptx™ Platform**\n\n  * VersAptx is Vincerx’s versatile and adaptable, next-generation bioconjugation platform. The modular nature of this platform enables the combination of different targeting, linker and payload technologies to develop bespoke bioconjugates to address different cancer biologies.\n  * At the AACR Annual Meeting, Vincerx reported data from preclinical studies applying the next-generation effector chemistry of its VersAptx platform to TRODELVY® and ENHERTU®, two marketed ADCs, demonstrating the potential to improve tumor toxicity of ADCs by orders of magnitude, while improving on safety and tolerability. These findings further support the versatility of VersAptx to address multiple cancer types and increase the efficacy and safety of ADCs.\n\n\n\n**FIRST QUARTER 2024 FINANCIAL RESULTS**\n\n  * Vincerx had approximately $5.1 million in cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2024, which does not include the proceeds from our recent financing in April, as compared to approximately $12.8 million as of December 31, 2023. Based on its current business plans and assumptions, Vincerx believes its available capital, including the recent financing proceeds of approximately $17.8 million, will be sufficient to meet its operating requirements through the end of 2024.\n  * Research and development expenses for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024 were approximately $4.6 million, as compared to approximately $10.9 million for the same period in 2023. This decrease is primarily the result of decreases in manufacturing services associated with our ADC programs of approximately $2.6 million, research services of approximately $2.6 million, and personnel-related expenses of approximately $1.1 million.\n  * General and administrative expenses for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024 were approximately $2.9 million, as compared to approximately $4.5 million for the same period in 2023. This decrease is primarily driven by decreases in personnel-related expenses of approximately $0.6 million, professional services of $0.5 million and facilities and other corporate overhead expenses of $0.3 million.\n  * For the first quarter ended March 31, 2024, Vincerx reported a net loss of approximately $12.4 million, or $0.58 per share. For the first quarter ended March 31, 2023, Vincerx reported a net loss of approximately $14.6 million, or $0.69 per share.\n\n\n\n**About Vincerx Pharma, Inc.** Vincerx Pharma, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to developing differentiated and novel therapies to address the unmet medical needs of patients with cancer.

(Nasdaq: VINC), a biopharmaceutical company aspiring to address the unmet medical needs of patients with cancer through paradigm-shifting therapeutics, today presented positive preliminary Phase 1 data for VIP236 and updates on pipeline progress at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2024.\n\n“The positive preliminary data we’ve reported for VIP236 and VIP943, coupled with preclinical findings leveraging our VersAptx platform to improve the efficacy of TRODELVY® and ENHERTU®, two marketed ADCs, underscore the power of our platform approach for hematologic malignancies and solid tumors,” said Ahmed Hamdy, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Vincerx. “The early VIP236 data demonstrated positive clinical activity, including tumor reductions. This represents significant promise for patients who have exhausted standard anticancer therapy options with many different tumor types, including tumors not usually responsive to camptothecin-derived therapies. Dose escalation continues in the VIP236 and VIP943 first-in-human studies. As we advance into higher dose levels, we look forward to sharing more clinical data for VIP236 later this summer and for VIP943 on or around the 2024 European Hematology Association annual meeting.”\n\nRaquel Izumi, Ph.D., President and Chief Operating Officer of Vincerx added, “The main objectives of a Phase 1 dose-escalation study are to assess safety and tolerability while establishing an optimal dose and schedule, so seeing dose-dependent clinical activity at this point in the development of VIP236 is exciting. We are still in dose escalation and are starting to see tumor reduction after only two doses. We expect to see responses deepen with more time on treatment and as we continue to escalate.”\n\nVivek Subbiah, M.D., Chief of Early-Phase Drug Development at Sarah Cannon Research Institute commented, \"In the oncology landscape, ADCs have emerged as a new and encouraging treatment option for people facing cancer. With a decade of invaluable insights in ADC drug development, we are transitioning from first to second to third generations, and the imperative now is for novel mechanisms of action. Innovations like VIP236's optimized camptothecin, which can potentially circumvent some of the known camptothecin liabilities and issues with drug resistance, deliver a potent payload from a clinically validated drug class. The goal is to deliver best-in-class therapies to meet the urgent needs of patients battling advanced cancers.”\n\n**VIP236 Updates**\n\n  * Study VNC-236-101 is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1 dose-escalation study with monotherapy VIP236 for the treatment of patients with metastatic tumors who have exhausted all standard therapy options. The study's main objective is to determine a safe dose and schedule for VIP236 for further clinical development.\n  * Fifteen patients have been dosed to date on the once every three weeks (Q3W) schedule. Sequential dose-escalation cohorts with the Q3W schedule were 0.2 mg/kg (n=2), 0.4 mg/kg (n=5), 0.6 mg/kg (n=5), and 0.8 mg/kg (n=3). Results of the Q3W schedule (n=15) show: \n    * The patient population is typical of a Phase 1 study with heavily pretreated patients and a wide range of tumor types.\n    * The Q3W schedule is well tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in any patients, and no patients have discontinued VIP236 due to an adverse event. Importantly, no severe or life-threatening diarrhea has been observed, validating the purposeful design of VIP236’s optimized camptothecin payload.\n    * First efficacy assessment was at the end of cycle 2 (i.e. after only two doses on the Q3W schedule). Seven patients have achieved objective stable disease, including tumor reduction. Four patients remain on study with the longest treated patient on study for 168 days.\n  * Dose escalation continues on the Q3W schedule. Vincerx anticipates presenting additional Phase 1 data for VIP236 later this summer.\n\n\n\n**VIP943 Updates**\n\n  * Study VNC-943-101 is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1 dose-escalation study with monotherapy VIP943 for the treatment of patients with CD123+ acute myeloid leukemia (AML), B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (B-ALL) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) who have exhausted standard therapeutic options. The study's main objective is to determine a safe dose and schedule for VIP943 for further clinical development.\n  * VIP943 is administered once per week. Three patients were dosed in Cohort 1 (0.2 mg/kg) and four patients were dosed in Cohort 2 (0.4 mg/kg).\n  * Despite the initial low doses in the study, all seven sequentially enrolled patients completed the 28-day DLT evaluation period. Five out of seven received a cycle 2 dose and two of these patients started cycle 3. One patient with MDS is still on study on cycle 3.\n  * No DLTs occurred in Cohort 1 and 2. Four patients have been enrolled in Cohort 3 (0.7 mg/kg) and are undergoing DLT assessment.\n  * VIP943 PK data shows very little free payload in circulation, consistent with the favorable safety profile observed preclinically and clinically.\n  * As the study progresses through the dose escalation, Vincerx will present additional Phase 1 data for VIP943 on or around the 2024 European Hematology Association Annual Meeting in June 2024.\n\n\n\n**New** **In Vitro Solid Tumor Data**\n\n  * Today Vincerx also reported preclinical experiments applying the next-generation effector chemistry of its VersAptx platform to the antibodies of approved ADCs, TRODELVY and ENHERTU, demonstrating the potential to improve tumor toxicity of ADCs by orders of magnitude.\n  * In in vitro tumor models, Vincerx’s sacituzumab-legumain-KSPi ADC had a 20-fold improvement in tumor toxicity compared with TRODELVY (sacituzumab-govitecan). The company’s trastuzumab-legumain-KSPi ADC demonstrated an 8-fold increase in tumor toxicity compared with ENHERTU (fam-trastuzumab-deruxtecan).\n  * These findings further support the versatility of VersAptx to address multiple cancer types, including solid tumors, and increase the efficacy and safety of ADCs. Further studies will be conducted in animal models.\n\n\n\n**Virtual Investor Event**\n\nVincerx will host a virtual investor event featuring company management and key opinion leaders to review preliminary clinical data from its Phase 1 dose-escalation study of VIP236 and provide an update on pipeline progress today at 2:00 PM PDT/ 5:00 PM EDT.

VIP236 was designed to deliver its payload to advanced/metastatic tumors that express αvβ3. Preclinical data show enhanced efficacy, independent of HER2 status, in patient-derived and cell line-derived gastric cancer models compared with ENHERTU®, an approved ADC. VIP236 is being evaluated in a Phase 1 dose-escalation trial treating patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors (NTC05371054).\n\n**About VIP943**\n\nVIP943, the first ADC from the VersAptx platform, consists of an anti-CD123 antibody, a unique linker cleaved intracellularly by legumain, and a novel kinesin spindle protein inhibitor (KSPi) payload enhanced with our CellTrapper® technology. The next-generation effector chemistry (linker + payload with CellTrapper) was designed to reduce non-specific release of the payload and ensure payload accumulation in cancer cells versus healthy cells. The increased therapeutic index has the potential to address challenges associated with many ADCs by improving efficacy and reducing severe toxicities. VIP943 is in a Phase 1 dose-escalation trial evaluating patients with relapsed/refractory AML, B-ALL, and MDS who have exhausted standard therapeutic options (NCT06034275).\n\n**About VersAptx Platform**\n\nVersAptx is a versatile and adaptable next-generation bioconjugation platform. The modular nature of this innovative platform allows for the combination of different targeting, linker, and payload technologies to develop bespoke bioconjugates to address different cancer biologies. With this platform, (i) antibodies and small molecules can be used to target different tumor antigens, (ii) linkers can be designed to reduce non-specific release of the payload, cleave intracellularly or extracellularly, and conjugate to single or multiple payloads, and (iii) payloads can be designed with reduced permeability using the CellTrapper technology to ensure accumulation in cancer cells or to be permeable for release in the tumor microenvironment. The VersAptx platform allows for the optimization of these technologies to a specific target and the development of bioconjugates designed to address the safety and efficacy challenges of many ADCs and the needs of cancer patients.\n\n**About Vincerx Pharma, Inc.**\n\nVincerx Pharma, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to developing differentiated and novel therapies to address the unmet medical needs of patients with cancer.

To date, we have dosed 20 patients across two dosing schedules and results from the once every 3-week dosing schedule continue to show a strong safety profile with dose-dependent clinical activity. We are excited to share more details regarding the preliminary Phase 1 data during the 2024 AACR Annual Meeting.”\n\nDr. Izumi continued, “VIP943, our best-in-class anti-CD123 ADC, is in a Phase 1 dose-escalation trial in hematologic malignancies. Enrollment in the third cohort is underway with a total of 9 patients dosed. Preliminary pharmacokinetic data from the first two cohorts show very little payload in circulation, which aligns with the favorable safety profile observed in nonhuman primates in our preclinical studies. We look forward to sharing pharmacokinetic data for VIP943 during AACR and more details regarding the preliminary Phase 1 data on or around EHA. Enitociclib, our highly selective CDK9 inhibitor, in a Phase 1 dose-escalation study with the National Institutes of Health (NIH), has signaled encouraging efficacy in Phase 1 combination studies in peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) and double-hit B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Earlier this year, we reported partial responses at doses below expected efficacy levels, highlighting the drugs synergistic potential with other treatments.”\n\nDr. Hamdy concluded, “We entered 2024 with strong momentum and remain focused on aggressively advancing our programs and maximizing the value of our next-generation VersAptx platform.”\n\n**FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2023 CLINICAL PROGRAM HIGHLIGHTS**\n\n**VersAptx™ Platform**\n\n  * VersAptx is Vincerx’s versatile and adaptable, next-generation bioconjugation platform. The modular nature of this platform enables the combination of different targeting, linker, and payload technologies to develop bespoke bioconjugates to address different cancer biologies.\n  * Recent preclinical data demonstrated the ability of our legumain linker + KSPi payload with CellTrapper effector chemistry to enhance the potency of TRODELVY® and ENHERTU®, two marketed ADCs, by conjugating TRODELVY's TROP2 and ENHERTU's HER2 antibodies with our effector chemistry. The results of this study demonstrated a significant improvement in the potency of both drugs, with TRODELVY potency amplified by a factor of 20 and ENHERTU potency by a factor of 8.\n  * Vincerx published a manuscript in _Frontiers in Pharmacology_ titled, “Neutrophil elastase as a versatile cleavage enzyme for activation of αvβ3 integrin-targeted small molecule drug conjugates with different payload classes in the tumor microenvironment _._ ”\n  * Vincerx presented a preclinical poster at the 2023 AACR Annual Meeting demonstrating the promise of VIP924, a first-in-class CXCR5-targeted ADC from the VersAptx platform.\n\n\n\n**VIP236**\n\n  * VIP236 is a αVβ3 SMDC conjugated to an optimized camptothecin (CPT) from the VersAptx platform. VIP236 is a first-in-class product candidate designed to deliver its optimized CPT payload directly to tumor tissues to overcome the chemotherapy-related side effects and transporter liabilities of this well-established class of anticancer drugs. Preclinical studies have shown 11 times more optimized CPT is delivered to the cancerous tissues than found circulating in the blood. Additionally, the active component of VIP236 is designed to bypass cancer resistance mechanisms.\n  * The favorable characteristics of VIP236, including improved linker attachment, stable solubility, and tumor-specific payload release, were featured in a peer-reviewed publication titled, “Unleashing the Potential of Camptothecin: Exploring Innovative Strategies for Structural Modification and Therapeutic Advancements,” by Zheng Chen in the March 14, 2024 issue of _Journal of Medicinal Chemistry_.\n  * To date, the VIP236 Phase 1 dose-escalation trial ([NTC05371054](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05712889?term=VIP236&rank=1)) has enrolled 20 patients with advanced or metastatic cancer unresponsive to standard therapies.\n  * Vincerx will present more details around the preliminary Phase 1 data at the upcoming 2024 AACR Annual Meeting, accompanied by a virtual investor event to review the data and provide a pipeline update on April 8 at 2:00 PM PT. The event can be accessed through the [Investors Page](https://investors.vincerx.com/) on the Vincerx website.\n\n\n\n**VIP943**\n\n  * VIP943 is a novel CD123-targeted antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) from the VersAptx platform.\n  * In August 2023, Vincerx received IND clearance for a Phase 1 dose-escalation trial of VIP943 in relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) ([NCT06034275](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06034275?term=VIP943&rank=1)).\n  * In September 2023, Vincerx announced the dosing of its first patient in that study.\n  * Enrollment in the third cohort is underway, with a total of 9 patients dosed. Preliminary pharmacokinetic results continue to show very little payload circulating in the blood, validating the favorable safety profile observed in nonhuman primates in preclinical studies.\n  * Vincerx will present more details regarding the preliminary Phase 1 data for VIP943 on or around the 2024 EHA Annual Meeting.\n\n\n\n**Enitociclib**\n\n  * Enitociclib is a highly selective CDK9 inhibitor designed to block the activation of RNA polymerase II, leading to the reduction of oncogenes MYC and MCL1.\n  * In 2023, Vincerx presented preclinical data supporting the continued advancement of enitociclib at multiple medical congresses. Vincerx also published a manuscript titled, “Enitociclib, a Selective CDK9 Inhibitor, Induces Complete Regression of MYC+ Lymphoma by Downregulation of RNA Polymerase II Mediated Transcription” in _Cancer Research Communications_ , an AACR journal.\n  * Enitociclib is currently in a Phase 1 dose-escalation trial ([NTC05371054](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05371054?term=%22vip152%22&rank=2)) evaluating the combination of enitociclib, venetoclax, and prednisone in DLBCL and PTCL. This trial is being conducted in collaboration with the NIH.\n  * Earlier this year, Vincerx announced that 2 out of 3 patients with PTCL had a partial response (PR). The first patient saw a 91% reduction in their tumor burden, while the second patient saw an 86% reduction in pulmonary lesions and resolution of skin lesions. In addition, 1 out of 2 patients with DH-DLBCL had a PR after one cycle of treatment, seeing an 80% reduction in tumor burden. These responses occurred at doses below expected efficacy levels.\n\n\n\n**VIP924**\n\n  * VIP924 is a first-in-class CXCR5-targeted ADC from the VersAptx platform.\n  * Vincerx presented preclinical data at the 2023 AACR Annual Meeting demonstrating significant activity in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) lymphoma mouse models.\n  * Vincerx shared preclinical data at the 2023 ASH Annual Meeting showing superior activity and safety compared with commercially available B-cell targeted ADCs.\n  * IND application anticipated in late 2025 or early 2026, pending funding.\n\n\n\n**FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2023 FINANCIAL RESULTS**\n\n  * Vincerx had $12.8 million in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023, as compared to $52.5 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2022. Based on its current business plans and assumptions, Vincerx believes its available capital will be sufficient to meet its operating requirements into early third quarter of 2024.\n  * Research and development (R&D) expenses for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 were $3.7 million and $29.0 million, respectively, as compared to $11.5 million and $49.8 million, respectively, for each of the same periods in 2022. The year over year decrease of approximately $20.9 million is primarily the result of decreases in third party service and supplier expenses, including manufacturing services associated with our ADC program of approximately $9.7 million and clinical services of approximately $2.6 million, as well as decreases in expenses related to headcount, including declines in stock-based compensation expense of approximately $3.3 million and employee salaries of approximately $3.1 million as a result of our headcount reduction in June 2022.\n  * General and administrative (G&A) expenses for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 were $1.8 million and $13.6 million, respectively, as compared to $4.0 million and $18.9 million for the same periods in 2022. The year over year decrease of approximately $5.2 million was primarily driven by decreases in stock-based compensation expense of $2.8 million, professional services of $1.4 million, and a decrease in expenses related to headcount of $0.7 million.\n  * For the fourth quarter and full year 2023, Vincerx reported a net loss of $4.9 million, or $0.23 per share, and a net loss of $40.2 million, or $1.89 per share, respectively. For the fourth quarter and full year 2022, Vincerx reported a net loss of $13.8 million, or $0.65 per share, and a net loss of $63.0 million, or $3.00 per share, respectively.\n\n\n\n**About Vincerx Pharma, Inc.** Vincerx Pharma, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to developing differentiated and novel therapies to address the unmet medical needs of patients with cancer.

VIP236 was designed to deliver its payload to advanced/metastatic tumors that express αvβ3. Preclinical data show enhanced efficacy, independent of HER2 status, in patient-derived and cell line-derived gastric cancer models compared with ENHERTU®, an approved ADC. VIP236 is being evaluated in a Phase 1 dose-escalation trial treating patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors (NTC05371054). As VIP236 is a first-in-class drug, the Phase 1 trial is evaluating various dosing schedules. To date, 20 patients with advanced or metastatic disease that has relapsed or is refractory to standard of care have received VIP236.\n\n**About VIP943**\n\nVIP943, the first ADC from our VersAptx platform, consists of an anti-CD123 antibody, a unique linker cleaved intracellularly by legumain, and a novel kinesin spindle protein inhibitor (KSPi) payload enhanced with our CellTrapper® technology. Our proprietary effector chemistry (linker + payload) was designed to reduce non-specific release of the payload and ensure payload accumulation in cancer cells versus healthy cells. The increased therapeutic index has the potential to address challenges associated with many ADCs by improving efficacy and reducing severe toxicities. VIP943 is in a Phase 1 dose-escalation trial evaluating patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia who have exhausted standard therapeutic options (NCT06034275). Preliminary pharmacokinetic data from the first cohort shows low levels of unconjugated payload (VIP716) in circulation, as predicted from preclinical experiments. Reduced nonspecific release of payload is one of many features engineered into VIP943 to increase the therapeutic index compared with existing technologies. We expect to expand into additional CD123-positive indications, including TP53 mutated AML, both as monotherapy and in combination, as safety and efficacy data are generated. Preliminary Phase 1 data are expected in mid-2024.\n\n**About VersAptx Platform**\n\nVersAptx is our versatile and adaptable next-generation bioconjugation platform. The modular nature of this innovative platform allows us to combine different targeting, linker, and payload technologies to develop bespoke bioconjugates to address different cancer biologies. With this platform, (i) antibodies and small molecules can be used to target different tumor antigens, (ii) linkers can be designed to reduce non-specific release of the payload, cleave intracellularly or extracellularly, and conjugate to single or multiple payloads, and (iii) payloads can be designed with reduced permeability using our CellTrapper technology to ensure accumulation in cancer cells or to be permeable for release in the tumor microenvironment. The VersAptx platform allows us to optimize these technologies to a specific target and develop bioconjugates designed to address the safety and efficacy challenges of many ADCs and the needs of cancer patients.\n\n**About Vincerx Pharma, Inc.**\n\nVincerx Pharma, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to developing differentiated and novel therapies to address the unmet medical needs of patients with cancer.
