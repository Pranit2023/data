(NASDAQ: SIGI) reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, with net income per diluted common share of $1.47 and non-GAAP operating income1 per diluted common share of $1.40. Return on common equity was 12.6% and non-GAAP operating ROE1 was 12.1%. \n\nNPW increased 9% from a year ago driven by accelerating renewal pure price increases and stable Standard Commercial Lines retention. The investments segment generated 13.1 points of annualized ROE in the quarter, as after-tax net investment income was $93 million, up 16% from a year ago. \n\nFor the quarter, Selective reported a combined ratio of 99.5% with no net prior year casualty reserve development. Elevated catastrophe losses of $149 million increased the combined ratio by 13.4 points, up from 6.6 points a year ago. Losses resulted from 19 named storms in the quarter, with Hurricane Helene estimated at $85 million of pre-tax losses. \n\n“The continued frequency and severity of storms in the third quarter, including the devastation from Hurricane Helene, underscore our unwavering commitment to our customers, agency partners, and communities. During these challenging times for those impacted by the storms, I thank my colleagues for continuing to deliver superior claims service and supporting customers and claimants,” said John J. Marchioni, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. \n\n“We maintain a disciplined approach to pricing and underwriting our business. Loss trends remain elevated and uncertain, but we continue to be prudent and vigilant in addressing them. In the quarter, renewal pure price increased 10.5%. In Standard Commercial Lines, renewal pure price accelerated to 9.1%. For General Liability, the line most impacted by loss emergence in previous quarters, renewal pure price was 10.2%, up from 7.6% in the second quarter. Importantly, retention was stable in Standard Commercial Lines at 86%.” \n\n“Our primary goal is to consistently achieve our 95% combined ratio target. Although catastrophe losses impacted the quarter, our underlying performance was excellent, reflecting our underwriting and pricing actions and disciplined expense management. We added Nevada, Oregon, and Washington to our Standard Commercial Lines footprint in early October, now covering 35 states. With our strong capital position, financial flexibility, and strategic execution, we are well positioned to face the uncertainty in the external environment,” concluded Mr. Marchioni. \n\n**Operating Highlights**\n\n**Consolidated Financial Results**| **Quarter ended****September 30,**| **Change**| **Year-to-Date****September 30,**| **Change**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n _$ and shares in millions, except per share data_| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nNet premiums written |  $ |  1,157.6 |  1,058.3 |  9 |  % |  $ |  3,540.4 |  3,143.0 |  13 |  %   \nNet premiums earned |  1,112.2 |  981.9 |  13 |  3,243.4 |  2,826.4 |  15   \nNet investment income earned |  117.8 |  100.9 |  17 |  334.3 |  290.1 |  15   \nNet realized and unrealized gains (losses), pre-tax |  5.4 |  (6.9 |  ) |  (178 |  ) |  5.1 |  (9.0 |  ) |  (156 |  )   \nTotal revenues |  1,244.3 |  1,081.1 |  15 |  3,605.3 |  3,121.4 |  16   \nNet underwriting income (loss), after-tax |  4.1 |  25.0 |  (83 |  ) |  (118.0 |  ) |  54.7 |  (316 |  )   \nNet investment income, after-tax |  93.4 |  80.2 |  16 |  265.3 |  231.1 |  15   \nNet income (loss) available to common stockholders |  90.0 |  86.9 |  4 |  104.6 |  233.5 |  (55 |  )   \nNon-GAAP operating income (loss)1|  85.7 |  92.3 |  (7 |  ) |  100.6 |  240.6 |  (58 |  )   \nCombined ratio |  99.5 |  % |  96.8 |  2.7 |  pts |  104.6 |  % |  97.5 |  7.1 |  pts   \nLoss and loss expense ratio |  68.8 |  65.8 |  3.0 |  73.8 |  65.7 |  8.1   \nUnderwriting expense ratio |  30.6 |  30.9 |  (0.3 |  ) |  30.6 |  31.6 |  (1.0 |  )   \nDividends to policyholders ratio |  0.1 |  0.1 |  — |  0.2 |  0.2 |  —   \nNet catastrophe losses |  13.4 |  pts |  6.6 |  6.8 |  9.1 |  pts |  7.8 |  1.3   \nNon-catastrophe property losses and loss expenses |  13.2 |  17.6 |  (4.4 |  ) |  15.5 |  16.9 |  (1.4 |  )   \n(Favorable) unfavorable prior year reserve development on casualty lines |  — |  — |  — |  6.5 |  (0.6 |  ) |  7.1   \nNet income (loss) available to common stockholders per diluted common share |  $ |  1.47 |  1.42 |  4 |  % |  $ |  1.71 |  3.83 |  (55 |  ) |  %   \nNon-GAAP operating income (loss) per diluted common share1|  1.40 |  1.51 |  (7 |  ) |  1.64 |  3.95 |  (58 |  )   \nWeighted average diluted common shares |  61.3 |  61.0 |  — |  61.3 |  60.9 |  1   \nBook value per common share |  $ |  48.82 |  40.35 |  21 |  $ |  48.82 |  40.35 |  21   \nAdjusted book value per common share1|  50.80 |  48.54 |  5 |  50.80 |  48.54 |  5   \n  \n**Overall Insurance Operations**\n\nFor the third quarter, overall NPW increased 9%, or $99 million, from a year ago. Average renewal pure price increased 10.5%, up 3.5 points from a year ago. Selective's 99.5% combined ratio was 2.7 points higher than a year ago, as elevated catastrophe losses were partially offset by lower non-catastrophe property losses and a lower expense ratio. There was no net unfavorable prior year casualty reserve development in either period. The combined ratio excluding net catastrophe losses and prior year casualty reserve development was 86.1%, 4.1 points lower than a year ago. \n\nOverall, our insurance segments increased ROE by 0.6 points in the third quarter of 2024. \n\n**Standard Commercial Lines Segment**\n\nFor the third quarter, Standard Commercial Lines premiums (representing 78% of total NPW) grew 8% from a year ago. The premium growth reflected average renewal pure price increases of 9.1% and stable retention of 86%. The third quarter combined ratio was 99.2%, up 4.5 points from a year ago, primarily due to catastrophe losses. \n\nThere was no net prior year casualty reserve development in the quarter, compared to $3.0 million, or 0.4 points, of favorable development a year ago. \n\nThe following table shows the variances in key quarter-to-date and year-to date measures: \n\n**Standard Commercial Lines Segment**| **Quarter ended****September 30,**| **Change**| **Year-to-Date****September 30,**| **Change**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n _$ in millions_| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nNet premiums written |  $ |  903.9 |  833.6 |  8 |  % |  $ |  2,798.7 |  2,517.0 |  11 |  %   \nNet premiums earned |  875.4 |  785.3 |  11 |  2,563.0 |  2,279.7 |  12   \nCombined ratio |  99.2 |  % |  94.7 |  4.5 |  pts |  105.6 |  % |  95.5 |  10.1 |  pts   \nLoss and loss expense ratio |  67.6 |  62.8 |  4.8 |  74.0 |  63.0 |  11.0   \nUnderwriting expense ratio |  31.4 |  31.7 |  (0.3 |  ) |  31.4 |  32.3 |  (0.9 |  )   \nDividends to policyholders ratio |  0.2 |  0.2 |  — |  0.2 |  0.2 |  —   \nNet catastrophe losses |  11.5 |  pts |  4.7 |  6.8 |  7.4 |  pts |  5.9 |  1.5   \nNon-catastrophe property losses and loss expenses |  11.0 |  15.6 |  (4.6 |  ) |  13.1 |  14.9 |  (1.8 |  )   \n(Favorable) unfavorable prior year reserve development on casualty lines |  — |  (0.4 |  ) |  0.4 |  8.2 |  (0.9 |  ) |  9.1   \n  \n**Standard Personal Lines Segment**\n\nFor the third quarter, Standard Personal Lines premiums (representing 10% of total NPW) decreased 2% from a year ago with renewal pure price of 22.8% and higher average policy sizes. Retention was 75%, down 13 points from a year ago, and new business decreased 49% due to deliberate profit improvement actions. Despite elevated catastrophe losses, the third quarter 2024 combined ratio decreased by 5.3 points from a year ago to 122.1%. There was no prior year casualty reserve development in the quarter, compared to $3 million in unfavorable prior year casualty reserve development in personal auto a year ago. Flood claims handling fees from the National Flood Insurance Program's Write Your Own program, primarily related to Hurricane Helene, reduced the loss and loss expense ratio by 4.3 points in the quarter, up from 1.2 points in the prior-year period. \n\nThe following table shows the variances in key quarter-to-date and year-to-date measures: \n\n**Standard Personal Lines Segment**| **Quarter ended****September 30,**| **Change**| **Year-to-Date****September 30,**| **Change**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n _$ in millions_| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nNet premiums written |  $ |  111.0 |  113.2 |  (2 |  ) |  % |  $ |  327.1 |  307.5 |  6 |  %   \nNet premiums earned |  107.5 |  95.2 |  13 |  317.8 |  264.2 |  20   \nCombined ratio |  122.1 |  % |  127.4 |  (5.3 |  ) |  pts |  115.2 |  % |  123.6 |  (8.4 |  ) |  pts   \nLoss and loss expense ratio |  98.7 |  104.5 |  (5.8 |  ) |  91.8 |  98.7 |  (6.9 |  )   \nUnderwriting expense ratio |  23.4 |  22.9 |  0.5 |  23.4 |  24.9 |  (1.5 |  )   \nNet catastrophe losses |  38.8 |  pts |  25.6 |  13.2 |  24.8 |  pts |  22.8 |  2.0   \nNon-catastrophe property losses and loss expenses |  35.3 |  44.7 |  (9.4 |  ) |  39.4 |  43.2 |  (3.8 |  )   \nUnfavorable prior year reserve development on casualty lines |  — |  3.2 |  (3.2 |  ) |  — |  3.4 |  (3.4 |  )   \n  \n**Excess and Surplus Lines Segment**\n\nFor the third quarter, Excess and Surplus Lines premiums (representing 12% of total NPW) increased 28% compared to the prior-year period, driven by new business growth of 43% and average renewal pure price increases of 8.0%.

The after-tax income yield averaged 4.0% for the overall and fixed income securities portfolios. With this and invested assets per dollar of common stockholders' equity of $3.25 as of September 30, 2024, the Investments segment generated 13.1 points of non-GAAP operating ROE. \n\n**Investments Segment**| **Quarter ended****September 30,**| **Change**| **Year-to-Date****September 30,**| **Change**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n _$ in millions, except per share data_| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nNet investment income earned, after-tax |  $ |  93.4 |  80.2 |  16 |  % |  $ |  265.3 |  231.1 |  15 |  %   \nNet investment income per common share |  1.52 |  1.31 |  16 |  4.33 |  3.79 |  14   \nEffective tax rate |  20.7 |  % |  20.5 |  0.2 |  pts |  20.6 |  % |  20.3 |  0.3 |  pts   \nAverage yields:   \nPortfolio:   \nPre-tax |  5.0 |  4.9 |  0.1 |  4.9 |  4.8 |  0.1   \nAfter-tax |  4.0 |  3.9 |  0.1 |  3.9 |  3.8 |  0.1   \nFixed income securities:   \nPre-tax |  5.0 |  % |  5.1 |  (0.1 |  ) |  pts |  4.9 |  % |  5.0 |  (0.1 |  ) |  pts   \nAfter-tax |  4.0 |  4.1 |  (0.1 |  ) |  3.9 |  4.0 |  (0.1 |  )   \nAnnualized ROE contribution |  13.1 |  13.1 |  — |  12.6 |  12.7 |  (0.1 |  )   \n  \n**Balance Sheet**\n\n$ in millions, except per share data | **September 30, 2024**| **December 31, 2023**| **Change**  \n---|---|---|---  \nTotal assets |  $ |  13,473.1 |  11,802.5 |  14 |  %   \nTotal investments |  9,635.3 |  8,693.7 |  11   \nLong-term debt |  508.2 |  503.9 |  1   \nStockholders’ equity |  3,167.8 |  2,954.4 |  7   \nCommon stockholders' equity |  2,967.8 |  2,754.4 |  8   \nInvested assets per dollar of common stockholders’ equity |  3.25 |  3.16 |  3   \nNet premiums written to policyholders' surplus |  1.63 |  1.51 |  8   \nBook value per common share |  48.82 |  45.42 |  7   \nAdjusted book value per common share1|  50.80 |  50.03 |  2   \nDebt to total capitalization |  13.8 |  % |  14.6 |  % |  (0.8 |  ) |  pts   \n  \nBook value per common share increased by $3.40, or 7%, during the first nine months of 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to a $2.61 decrease in after-tax net unrealized losses on our fixed income securities portfolio and $1.71 of net income per diluted common share, partially offset by $1.05 in common stockholder dividends. The decrease in after-tax net unrealized losses on our fixed income securities portfolio was primarily related to lower interest rates. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company repurchased 103,000 shares of common stock at an average price of $84.34 for $8.7 million. Capacity under the existing repurchase authorization was $75.5 million as of September 30, 2024. \n\nSelective's Board of Directors declared: \n\n  * A 9% increase in the quarterly cash dividend on common stock to $0.38 per common share that is payable December 2, 2024, to holders of record on November 15, 2024; and \n  * A quarterly cash dividend of $287.50 per share on our 4.60% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series B (equivalent to $0.28750 per depositary share) payable on December 16, 2024, to holders of record as of December 2, 2024. \n\n\n\n**Guidance**\n\nFor 2024, we increased our expected GAAP combined ratio to 102.5%. The change reflects the third quarter's elevated catastrophe losses, partially offset by better-than-expected non-catastrophe property losses. Full-year expectations are as follows: \n\n  * A GAAP combined ratio of 102.5%, up 1 point from our prior guidance of 101.5%. Our combined ratio estimate includes net catastrophe losses of 7.5 points, up from prior guidance of 5.5 points. Although too early to provide a specific estimate, we expect losses from Hurricane Milton, which made landfall on October 9, 2024, to be immaterial. Our combined ratio estimate assumes no additional prior year casualty reserve development; \n  * After-tax net investment income of $360 million that includes $32 million from alternative investments; \n  * An overall effective tax rate of approximately 21.0%, which assumes an effective tax rate of 20.5% for net investment income and 21% for all other items; and \n  * Weighted average shares of 61.5 million on a fully diluted basis. \n\n\n\nThe supplemental investor package, with financial information not included in this press release, is available on the Investors page of Selective’s website at [www.Selective.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.Selective.com&esheet=54139565&newsitemid=20241021614542&lan=en-US&anchor=www.Selective.com&index=1&md5=8eca4e22b2d3f101e548f8325943af04). \n\nSelective’s quarterly analyst conference call will be simulcast at 8:30 AM ET, on Tuesday, October 22, 2024, on [www.Selective.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.Selective.com&esheet=54139565&newsitemid=20241021614542&lan=en-US&anchor=www.Selective.com&index=2&md5=c753179da373537cc56589057cce8c26).

Adjusted book value per common share differs from book value per common share by excluding total after-tax unrealized gains and losses on investments included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). These non-GAAP measures are used as important financial measures by management, analysts, and investors, because the timing of realized and unrealized investment gains and losses on securities in any given period is largely discretionary. In addition, net realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments could distort the analysis of trends. These operating measurements are not intended to be a substitute for net income (loss) available to common stockholders, net income (loss) available to common stockholders per diluted common share, return on common equity, and book value per common share prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Reconciliations of net income (loss) available to common stockholders, net income (loss) available to common stockholders per diluted common share, return on common equity, and book value per common share to non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP operating income (loss) per diluted common share, non-GAAP operating return on common equity, and adjusted book value per common share, respectively, are provided in the tables below. \n\nNote: All amounts included in this release exclude intercompany transactions. \n\n**Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) Available to Common Stockholders to Non-GAAP Operating Income (Loss)**\n\n_$ in millions_| **Quarter ended September 30,**| **Year-to-Date September 30,**  \n---|---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nNet income (loss) available to common stockholders |  $ |  90.0 |  86.9 |  104.6 |  233.5   \nNet realized and unrealized investment (gains) losses included in net income, before tax |  (5.4 |  ) |  6.9 |  (5.1 |  ) |  9.0   \nTax on reconciling items |  1.1 |  (1.4 |  ) |  1.1 |  (1.9 |  )   \nNon-GAAP operating income (loss) |  $ |  85.7 |  92.3 |  100.6 |  240.6   \n  \n**Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) Available to Common Stockholders per Diluted Common Share to Non-GAAP Operating Income (Loss) per Diluted Common Share**\n\n**Quarter ended September 30,**| **Year-to-Date September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nNet income (loss) available to common stockholders per diluted common share |  $ |  1.47 |  1.42 |  1.71 |  3.83   \nNet realized and unrealized investment (gains) losses included in net income, before tax |  (0.09 |  ) |  0.11 |  (0.08 |  ) |  0.15   \nTax on reconciling items |  0.02 |  (0.02 |  ) |  0.01 |  (0.03 |  )   \nNon-GAAP operating income (loss) per diluted common share |  $ |  1.40 |  1.51 |  1.64 |  3.95   \n  \n**Reconciliation of Return on Common Equity to Non-GAAP Operating Return on Common Equity**\n\n**Quarter ended September 30,**| **Year-to-Date September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nReturn on Common Equity |  12.6 |  % |  14.1 |  5.0 |  12.8   \nNet realized and unrealized investment (gains) losses included in net income, before tax |  (0.8 |  ) |  1.1 |  (0.2 |  ) |  0.5   \nTax on reconciling items |  0.3 |  (0.2 |  ) |  — |  (0.1 |  )   \nNon-GAAP Operating Return on Common Equity |  12.1 |  % |  15.0 |  4.8 |  13.2   \n  \n**Reconciliation of Book Value per Common Share to Adjusted Book Value per Common Share**\n\n**Quarter ended September 30,**| **Year-to-Date September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nBook value per common share |  $ |  48.82 |  40.35 |  48.82 |  40.35   \nTotal unrealized investment (gains) losses included in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, before tax |  2.50 |  10.38 |  2.50 |  10.38   \nTax on reconciling items |  (0.52 |  ) |  (2.19 |  ) |  (0.52 |  ) |  (2.19 |  )   \nAdjusted book value per common share |  $ |  50.80 |  48.54 |  50.80 |  48.54   \n  \nNote: Amounts in the tables above may not foot due to rounding. \n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nCertain statements in this report, including information incorporated by reference, are “forward-looking statements” defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (\"PSLRA\").

However, should the highest courts determine otherwise, our loss and loss expenses may increase, our related reserves may not be adequate, and our financial condition and liquidity may be materially impacted. \n  * Ongoing wars and conflicts impacting global economic, banking, commodity, and financial markets, exacerbating ongoing economic challenges, including inflation and supply chain disruption, which influences insurance loss costs, premiums, and investment valuations; \n  * Uncertainties related to insurance premium rate increases and business retention; \n  * Changes in insurance regulations that impact our ability to write and/or cease writing insurance policies in one or more states; \n  * The effects of data privacy or cyber security laws and regulations on our operations; \n  * Major defect or failure in our internal controls or information technology and application systems that result in harm to our brand in the marketplace, increased senior executive focus on crisis and reputational management issues, and/or increased expenses, particularly if we experience a significant privacy breach; \n  * Potential tax or federal financial regulatory reform provisions that could pose certain risks to our operations; \n  * Our ability to maintain favorable financial ratings, which may include sustainability considerations, from rating agencies, including AM Best, Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s, and Fitch; \n  * Our entry into new markets and businesses; and \n  * Other risks and uncertainties we identify in filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and other periodic reports. \n\n\n\n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20241021614542r1&sid=acqr8&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\nView source version on businesswire.com: <https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241021614542/en/>\n\n**Investor Contact:** Brad B.
