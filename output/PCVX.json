(Nasdaq: PCVX), a clinical-stage vaccine innovation company engineering high-fidelity vaccines to protect humankind from the consequences of bacterial diseases, today announced positive regulatory updates, including the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance of the VAX-31 infant Investigational New Drug (IND) application and the FDA granting Breakthrough Therapy designation (BTD) for VAX-31 for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in adults.\n\nVAX-31, the broadest-spectrum PCV candidate in the clinic, is a potentially best-in-class investigational 31-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) candidate being studied for the prevention of IPD in the adult and pediatric populations. VAX-31 is designed to cover approximately 94% of IPD in U.S. children under five and over 95% of IPD in U.S. adults today, with the potential to offer much greater coverage relative to the standard-of-care PCVs against both currently circulating and historically prevalent strains.\n\n“Vaxcyte continues to maintain positive momentum with our PCV programs, and these regulatory milestones represent important steps in the development of VAX-31,” said Grant Pickering, Chief Executive Officer and Co-founder of Vaxcyte. “The recent data from our adult Phase 1/2 study affirmed that VAX-31 has best-in-class potential, and we look forward to fully exploring its clinical utility in both the pediatric and adult populations. For the pediatric indication, we plan to initiate the VAX-31 infant Phase 2 study by the end of January 2025. For the adult indication, we look forward to moving VAX-31 into a Phase 3 program and plan to initiate the pivotal non-inferiority study by mid-2025.”\n\n“We are incredibly proud of the significant progress we continue to make with VAX-31, underscored by the clearance of the infant IND application and receipt of the Breakthrough Therapy designation for adults,” said Jim Wassil, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Vaxcyte. “The body of positive evidence generated by the VAX-31 and VAX-24 adult studies validates the potential of our site-specific, carrier-sparing platform to deliver best-in-class, broad-spectrum PCVs designed to provide protection against both currently circulating and historically prevalent serotypes while raising the bar for immunogenicity. As we advance our VAX-31 clinical programs, we are also encouraged by the ACIP’s recent decision to expand its pneumococcal vaccination recommendation to all U.S. adults aged 50 and older, an important step toward facilitating broader disease protection in this population.”\n\n**VAX-31 Infant IND Clearance and Phase 2 Study Initiation** The FDA clearance of the VAX-31 infant IND application, supported by the positive topline safety, tolerability and immunogenicity results from the VAX-31 adult Phase 1/2 study, enables the initiation of a VAX-31 pediatric study that proceeds directly into healthy infants. The VAX-31 infant Phase 2 study will be a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, dose-finding clinical study that will include a primary immunization series consisting of three doses at two, four and six months of age followed by a subsequent booster dose at 12-15 months of age concomitantly with routine pediatric vaccines.\n\nDespite the effectiveness of current vaccines, IPD remains a significant threat during the first years of life. Approximately 300,000 children under the age of five worldwide die every year due to _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ which is the leading cause of vaccine-preventable fatalities in this age group. The burden of disease in the pediatric population underscores the need for a broader-spectrum vaccine. VAX-31 was designed to cover approximately 94% of IPD and approximately 86% of acute otitis media in children under five years of age in the United States.\n\n**VAX-31 Adult Breakthrough Therapy Designation** The FDA’s decision to grant BTD to VAX-31 in the adult population for the prevention of IPD was informed by the positive topline results from the VAX-31 Phase 1/2 study in adults. Based on the strength of these study results, the Company selected VAX-31 to exclusively advance to an adult Phase 3 program.\n\nThe FDA’s BTD process is designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions. The designation is based upon preliminary clinical evidence indicating that the drug or vaccine may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. With BTD, Vaxcyte will have access to all the elements of the FDA’s Fast Track program, as well as the ability to receive guidance and support from the FDA on an efficient drug development program and an organizational commitment from senior managers within the FDA.\n\n**Key Anticipated PCV Franchise Milestones** Vaxcyte is advancing the clinical development of its PCV programs with several anticipated key milestones, including:\n\n**_PCV Franchise Adult Indication:_**\n\n**_VAX-31_**\n\n  * Following an FDA End-of-Phase 2 meeting, initiate a Phase 3 pivotal, non-inferiority study by mid-2025 and announce topline safety, tolerability and immunogenicity data in 2026.\n  * Initiate remaining Phase 3 studies in 2025 and 2026.\n\n\n\n**_PCV Franchise Infant Indication:_**\n\n**_VAX-24_**\n\n  * Announce topline safety, tolerability and immunogenicity data from the primary three-dose immunization series of the Phase 2 study, which is fully enrolled with 802 healthy infants, by the end of the first quarter of 2025, followed by topline data from the booster dose by the end of 2025.\n\n\n\n**_VAX-31_**\n\n  * Initiate Phase 2 study by the end of January 2025.\n  * Announce topline safety, tolerability and immunogenicity data from the VAX-31 infant Phase 2 study primary three-dose immunization series in mid-2026, followed by topline data from the booster dose approximately nine months later.\n\n\n\n**About Pneumococcal Disease** Pneumococcal disease (PD) is an infection caused by  _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ bacteria. It can result in invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), including meningitis and bacteremia, and non-invasive PD, including pneumonia, otitis media and sinusitis. In the United States, pneumococcal pneumonia is estimated to result in approximately 150,000 hospitalizations each year.  _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ is among the World Health Organization’s top antibiotic-resistant pathogens to be urgently addressed, and the U.S. CDC lists drug-resistant  _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ as a “serious threat.” In children under five, _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ is the leading cause of vaccine-preventable deaths globally. Pneumococci also cause over 50% of all cases of bacterial meningitis in the United States. Antibiotics are used to treat PD, but some strains of the bacteria have developed resistance to treatments. The morbidity and mortality due to PD are significant, particularly for young children and older adults, underscoring the need for a broader-spectrum vaccine.\n\n**About VAX-31** VAX-31, a 31-valent PCV candidate advancing to a Phase 3 adult clinical program and a Phase 2 infant clinical program, is designed to prevent IPD, which is especially serious in infants, young children, older adults and those with immune deficiencies or certain chronic health conditions. IPD is associated with high case-fatality rates, antibiotic resistance and meningitis. VAX-31 is the broadest-spectrum PCV in the clinic and has the potential to provide protection against both currently circulating and historically prevalent serotypes. VAX-31 was designed to increase coverage, in a single vaccine, to more than 95% of IPD circulating in adults in the United States aged 50 and older, with the potential to provide an incremental 12-40% of coverage over current standard-of-care adult PCVs. In infants, it was designed to cover approximately 94% of IPD and approximately 86% of acute otitis media in children under five years of age in the United States.\n\n**About Vaxcyte** Vaxcyte is a vaccine innovation company engineering high-fidelity vaccines to protect humankind from the consequences of bacterial diseases. The Company is developing broad-spectrum conjugate and novel protein vaccines to prevent or treat bacterial infectious diseases. VAX-31 is a Phase 3-ready 31-valent, carrier-sparing PCV being developed for the prevention of IPD in adults and infants and is the broadest-spectrum PCV candidate in the clinic today. VAX-24, the Company’s 24-valent PCV candidate, is designed to cover more serotypes than any infant PCV on-market and is currently being evaluated in a Phase 2 infant study. Both VAX-31 and VAX-24 are designed to improve upon the standard-of-care PCVs by covering the serotypes in circulation that are responsible for a significant portion of IPD and are associated with high case-fatality rates, antibiotic resistance and meningitis, while maintaining coverage of previously circulating strains that are currently contained through continued vaccination practice.Vaxcyte is re-engineering the way highly complex vaccines are made through modern synthetic techniques, including advanced chemistry and the XpressCF™ cell-free protein synthesis platform, exclusively licensed from Sutro Biopharma, Inc. Unlike conventional cell-based approaches, the Company’s system for producing difficult-to-make proteins and antigens is intended to accelerate its ability to efficiently create and deliver high-fidelity vaccines with enhanced immunological benefits. Vaxcyte’s pipeline also includes VAX-A1, a prophylactic vaccine candidate designed to prevent Group A Strep infections; VAX-PG, a therapeutic vaccine candidate designed to slow or stop the progression of periodontal disease; and VAX-GI, a vaccine candidate designed to prevent Shigella. Vaxcyte is driven to eradicate or treat invasive bacterial infections, which have serious and costly health consequences when left unchecked.

(Nasdaq: PCVX), a clinical-stage vaccine innovation company engineering high-fidelity vaccines to protect humankind from the consequences of bacterial diseases, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and provided a business update.\n\n“We are exceptionally proud of the significant progress we have made across the adult and infant clinical programs for our broad-spectrum, carrier-sparing pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) candidates, VAX-31 and VAX-24,” said Grant Pickering, Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of Vaxcyte. “We believe the recent topline results for VAX-31 in adults demonstrate its potential as a best-in-class PCV to provide protection against both currently circulating and historically prevalent strains while setting a new standard for immunogenicity. For the adult indication, we look forward to moving VAX-31 into a Phase 3 program and plan to initiate the pivotal non-inferiority study by mid-2025. For the pediatric indication, we anticipate delivering the topline data from the primary immunization series of the VAX-24 Phase 2 study by the end of the first quarter of 2025, followed by topline data from the booster dose by the end of 2025. In addition, we plan to initiate the VAX-31 infant Phase 2 study in the first quarter of 2025, subject to IND application clearance by the end of this year.”\n\n“On the heels of our positive VAX-31 data, we completed a follow-on equity offering, raising $1.4 billion in net proceeds and further bolstering our balance sheet,” said Andrew Guggenhime, President and Chief Financial Officer of Vaxcyte. “We are well-positioned to maintain continued positive momentum across our PCV franchise, including the advancement of multiple adult and infant clinical studies and key steps to ensure global manufacturing readiness for the large, well-established pediatric population and the expanding adult market. We also continue to invest in our early-stage pipeline, including candidates targeting Group A Strep and Shigella, which, along with _Streptococcus_ _pneumoniae_ , are among the World Health Organization’s top antibiotic-resistant pathogens requiring urgent solutions.”\n\n**Key Third Quarter and Recent Highlights**\n\n**_PCV Franchise Adult Indication:_**\n\n  * **_Reported Positive Topline Data from Phase 1/2 Study of VAX-31, Company’s 31-Valent PCV Candidate, in Adults Aged 50 and Older:_** In September 2024, Vaxcyte [announced](https://investors.vaxcyte.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vaxcyte-reports-positive-topline-data-phase-12-study-vax-31-its) positive topline results from the Phase 1/2 study evaluating the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of VAX-31, designed to prevent invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), in 1,015 healthy adults aged 50 and older. Based on the strength of the results from this study, the Company selected VAX-31 to exclusively advance to an adult Phase 3 program.In the Phase 1/2 study, VAX-31 was observed to be well tolerated and demonstrated a safety profile at all doses studied through the full six-month evaluation period similar to Prevnar 20® (PCV20). VAX-31 showed robust opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) immune responses for all 31 serotypes at all doses studied. At the middle and high doses, VAX-31 met or exceeded the OPA response non-inferiority criteria(1) for all 20 serotypes common with PCV20. At the VAX-31 high dose, average OPA immune responses were greater for 18 of 20 serotypes compared to PCV20 (geometric mean ratio (GMR) greater than 1.0), with seven of these serotypes achieving statistically higher immune responses(2) compared to PCV20. At the middle dose, 13 of 20 serotypes had a GMR greater than 1.0 and five serotypes achieved statistically higher immune responses compared to PCV20. For all 11 incremental serotypes unique to VAX-31, and not in PCV20, all three doses met the superiority criteria(3).The public health community continues to call for pneumococcal vaccines with broader serotype and disease coverage. VAX-31 has the potential to provide, in a single vaccine, over 95% coverage of IPD in U.S. adults today, with the potential to offer much greater coverage relative to any of today’s PCVs and maintain pressure on historically circulating strains.\n\n\n  * **_Positive Results from VAX-24 Phase 2 Study in Adults Aged 65 and Older Published in the Journal Vaccine Adds to Body of Evidence Validating the Potential of the Company’s Carrier-Sparing Platform:_** In July 2024, the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity results from the VAX-24 Phase 2 study in adults aged 65 and older were published in the journal [ _Vaccine_](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X24007862). In the study, VAX-24, the Company’s 24-valent PCV candidate, demonstrated a safety and tolerability profile similar to PCV20 across all doses studied. VAX-24 also demonstrated robust OPA immune responses for all 24 serotypes at all doses studied, confirming the prior VAX-24 study results in adults 50 to 64 years of age. The body of evidence derived from the two VAX-24 adult Phase 2 studies and the VAX-31 adult study validates the potential of the Company’s site-specific, carrier-sparing platform to deliver broad-spectrum PCVs that provide protection against both currently circulating and historically prevalent strains.\n\n\n\n**_PCV Franchise Infant Indication:_**\n\n  * **_Completed Successful Pre-Investigational New Drug (IND) Meeting with FDA Regarding VAX-31 Pediatric Development Program_**** _:_** In August 2024, the Company successfully completed a pre-IND meeting with the FDA regarding the pediatric clinical program for VAX-31. Vaxcyte received written feedback from the FDA supporting the initiation of a pediatric study that proceeds directly into infants, an approach consistent with the infant clinical program currently underway for VAX-24. This approach provides a streamlined clinical path for the company to deliver VAX-31, a potentially best-in-class PCV, to the pediatric population, which represents the largest portion of the pneumococcal vaccine market in the United States.

The Company is developing broad-spectrum conjugate and novel protein vaccines to prevent or treat bacterial infectious diseases. VAX-31 is a Phase 3-ready 31-valent, carrier-sparing PCV being developed for the prevention of IPD in adults and infants and is the broadest-spectrum PCV candidate in the clinic today. VAX-24, the Company’s 24-valent PCV candidate, is designed to cover more serotypes than any infant PCV on-market and is currently being evaluated in a Phase 2 infant study. Both VAX-31 and VAX-24 are designed to improve upon the standard-of-care PCVs by covering the serotypes in circulation that are responsible for a significant portion of IPD and are associated with high case-fatality rates, antibiotic resistance and meningitis, while maintaining coverage of previously circulating strains that are currently contained through continued vaccination practice.\n\nVaxcyte is re-engineering the way highly complex vaccines are made through modern synthetic techniques, including advanced chemistry and the XpressCF™ cell-free protein synthesis platform, exclusively licensed from Sutro Biopharma, Inc. Unlike conventional cell-based approaches, the Company’s system for producing difficult-to-make proteins and antigens is intended to accelerate its ability to efficiently create and deliver high-fidelity vaccines with enhanced immunological benefits. Vaxcyte’s pipeline also includes VAX-A1, a prophylactic vaccine candidate designed to prevent Group A Strep infections; VAX-PG, a therapeutic vaccine candidate designed to slow or stop the progression of periodontal disease; and VAX-GI, a vaccine candidate designed to prevent Shigella. Vaxcyte is driven to eradicate or treat invasive bacterial infections, which have serious and costly health consequences when left unchecked.

These statements include, but are not limited to, statements related to the potential benefits of VAX-24 and VAX-31, including breadth of coverage, the ability to deliver potentially best-in-class PCVs, and improve upon the standard-of-care and set a new standard for immunogenicity; the process and timing of anticipated future development of Vaxcyte’s vaccine candidates; the initiation of VAX-31 adult Phase 3 studies and an infant Phase 2 study, and the timing of such studies and their data readouts; the timing and availability of data for the VAX-24 infant Phase 2 study; the ability to maintain continued positive momentum across the PCV franchise; the potential of the Company’s site-specific, carrier-sparing platform; the demand for Vaxcyte’s vaccine candidates; Vaxcyte’s ability to establish global commercial manufacturing capacity for its PCV candidates; and other statements that are not historical fact.

Both VAX-31 and VAX-24 are designed to improve upon the standard-of-care PCVs by covering the serotypes in circulation that are responsible for a significant portion of IPD and are associated with high case-fatality rates, antibiotic resistance and meningitis, while maintaining coverage of previously circulating strains that are currently contained through continued vaccination practice.\n\nVaxcyte is re-engineering the way highly complex vaccines are made through modern synthetic techniques, including advanced chemistry and the XpressCF™ cell-free protein synthesis platform, exclusively licensed from Sutro Biopharma, Inc. Unlike conventional cell-based approaches, the Company’s system for producing difficult-to-make proteins and antigens is intended to accelerate its ability to efficiently create and deliver high-fidelity vaccines with enhanced immunological benefits. Vaxcyte’s pipeline also includes VAX-A1, a prophylactic vaccine candidate designed to prevent Group A Strep infections; VAX-PG, a therapeutic vaccine candidate designed to slow or stop the progression of periodontal disease; and VAX-GI, a vaccine candidate designed to prevent Shigella. Vaxcyte is driven to eradicate or treat invasive bacterial infections, which have serious and costly health consequences when left unchecked.\n\n**Contacts:**\n\nPatrick Ryan, Executive Director, Corporate CommunicationsVaxcyte, Inc.415-606-5135media@vaxcyte.com\n\nJennifer Zibuda, Senior Director, Investor RelationsVaxcyte, Inc.860-729-8902investors@vaxcyte.com\n\n![News Release image](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/NmIwMzhiYzgtYjE1Ni00NWU5LWIyYTctNjgxMGViNzc0ZjcyLTEyMDczNzc=/tiny/Vaxcyte-Inc-.png)\n\n![](/sites/g/files/knoqqb94206/themes/site/nir_pid3643/client/assets/images/Vaxcyte-white.svg)\n\n![](/sites/g/files/knoqqb94206/themes/site/nir_pid3643/client/images/Great-Place-to-Work.png)\n\n© 2024 Vaxcyte.
