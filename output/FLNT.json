(NASDAQ: FLNT), a partner monetization and customer acquisition solutions leader, today reported financial results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nDon Patrick, Fluent’s Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"During the third quarter we continued to accelerate our shift in focus and revenue mix to Fluent’s Commerce Media Solutions, previously referred to as our Syndicated Performance Marketplaces. This strategic shift represents a significant opportunity for our business, as a growing number of media owners and advertisers are turning to commerce media to maximize the impact of their digital advertising initiatives.\n\nMr. Patrick continued, “Commerce media enhances customer monetization by using first party data to interact with customers across the entire purchasing experience, and according to BCG estimates, experts are predicting commerce media will account for over 25% of digital media spending by 2026. Fluent is uniquely positioned to address this shifting demand with a comprehensive suite of solutions that address the numerous high volume verticals including ticketing, retail, quick-service restaurants, and more. Since its launch in early 2023, revenue generated from Commerce Media Solutions has grown year over year at a triple digit pace, with $10.4 million in revenue generated for the current quarter at 33% gross profit (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) margin and 33.7% media margin as a percentage of revenue, and a current annual revenue run rate of over $50 million1. This growth is supported by 14 years of deep industry experience with our owned and operated marketplaces where we have driven successful customer acquisition for our media partners and advertisers and built a robust database of first-party customer data that is a key differentiator for us in the market.\"\n\nMr. Patrick concluded, \"We are intently focused on improving our operational performance to deliver enhanced value for our shareholders, and with our visibility today, we are targeting double digit consolidated revenue growth and enhanced profitability in 2025. We’re encouraged by the opportunities we’re seeing in the marketplace and while Fluent has faced some difficult headwinds during this fiscal year, we continue to believe that we are positioning the Company for long-term growth and value generation as we drive a strategic shift to the high-growth commerce media market.\"\n\n**Third Quarter Financial Highlights**\n\n  * Revenue of $64.5 million, a decrease of 3%, compared to $66.2 million in Q3 2023 \n    * Owned and Operated revenue decreased 18% to $43.5 million compared to $53.1 million in Q3 2023 as the company executed its shift in focus and revenue mix to higher margin Commerce Media Solutions.

The Company calculates Annual Revenue Run Rate as follows:\n\n  * Media partners within Commerce Media Solutions with an active contract are assessed and assigned an annual media volume estimate based on the active term of the contract and the monetization rate at the end of the reporting period. The Company considers a media partner contract to be active when the contractual term commences (the \"start date\") until its right to serve the partner’s commerce traffic ends. Even if the contract with the customer is executed before the start date, the contract will not count toward Annual Revenue Run Rate until the media partner’s right to receive the benefit of the services has commenced.\n\n\n  * As Annual Revenue Run Rate includes only contracts that are active at the end of the reporting period, it does not reflect assumptions or estimates regarding new business. For contracts expiring within the 12-months after the period-end calculation date, Annual Revenue Run Rate does reflect expectations of renewal.\n\n\n  * The Company’s Commerce Media Solutions platform provides the technology to effectively monetize the partner’s media by placing relevant ads at a contracted moment of consumer engagement. Although from inception to date, improvements in the platform’s AI-powered technology have consistently driven increased rates of monetization, for the purpose of Annual Revenue Run Rate, the Company assumes a consistent monetization level to that as measured on each media partner at the end of the reporting period.\n\n\n\nThe way the Company measures Annual Run Rate may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies and should not be viewed as a projection of future revenue.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nFluent, Inc. will host a conference call on Thursday, November 14, 2024, at 4:30 PM ET to discuss its 2024 third quarter financial results.

release:\n\nMedia margin is defined as that portion of gross profit (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) reflecting the variable costs paid for media and related expenses and excluding non-media cost of revenue. Gross profit (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) represents revenue minus cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization). Media margin is also presented as percentage of revenue.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss), excluding (1) income taxes, (2) interest expense, net, (3) depreciation and amortization, (4) share-based compensation expense, (5) loss on early extinguishment of debt, (6) accrued compensation expense for Put/Call Consideration, (7) goodwill impairment, (8) impairment of intangible assets, (9) loss (gain) on disposal of property and equipment, (10) fair value adjustment of convertible notes, (11) acquisition-related costs, (12) restructuring and other severance costs, and (13) certain litigation and other related costs.\n\nAdjusted net income (loss) is defined as net income (loss), excluding (1) share-based compensation expense, (2) loss on early extinguishment of debt, (3) accrued compensation expense for Put/Call Consideration, (4) goodwill impairment, (5) impairment of intangible assets, (6) loss (gain) on disposal of property and equipment, (7) fair value adjustment of convertible notes, (8) acquisition-related costs, (9) restructuring and other severance costs, and (10) certain litigation and other related costs. Adjusted net income (loss) is also presented on a per share (basic and diluted) basis.\n\nBelow is a reconciliation of media margin from gross profit (exclusive of depreciation and amortization), which we believe is the most directly comparable GAAP measure, for the Company.\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,**| **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n(In thousands, except percentages)| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nRevenue| $| 64,516| $| 66,239| $| 189,216| $| 225,638  \nLess: Cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)| 48,861| 50,148| 142,318| 167,960  \n**Gross profit (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)**|  $| 15,655| $| 16,091| $| 46,898| $| 57,678  \nGross profit (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) % of revenue| 24| %| 24| %| 25| %| 26| %  \nNon-media cost of revenue(1)| 2,505| 3,229| 9,066| 9,510  \n**Media margin**|  $| 18,160| $| 19,320| $| 55,964| $| 67,188  \nMedia margin % of revenue| 28.1| %| 29.2| %| 29.6| %| 29.8| %  \n  \n(1) Represents the portion of cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) not attributable to variable costs paid for media and related expenses.\n\nBelow is a reconciliation of media margin from gross profit (exclusive of depreciation and amortization), which we believe is the most directly comparable GAAP measure, for Commerce Media Solutions.\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,**| **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**(In thousands, except percentages)**| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nRevenue| $| 10,363| $| 2,348| $| 24,032| $| 3,534  \nLess: Cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)| 6,931| 2,098| 16,487| 3,974  \n**Gross profit (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)**|  $| 3,432| $| 250| $| 7,545| $| (440|  )  \n**Gross profit (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) % of revenue**|  33| %| 11| %| 31| %| (12| %)  \nNon-media cost of revenue(1)| 56| 16| 161| 19  \n**Media margin**|  $| 3,488| $| 266| $| 7,706| $| (421|  )  \n**Media margin % of revenue**|  33.7| %| 11.3| %| 32.1| %| (11.9| %)  \n  \n(1) Represents the portion of cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) not attributable to variable costs paid for media and related expenses.\n\nBelow is a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA from net loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which we believe is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,**| **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n(In thousands)| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \n**Net loss**|  $| (7,944| )| $| (33,627| )| $| (25,847| )| $| (61,319| )  \nIncome tax expense (benefit)| (35| )| (1,243| )| 98| 551  \nInterest expense, net| 1,281| 936| 3,711| 2,420  \nDepreciation and amortization| 2,369| 2,658| 7,507| 8,112  \nShare-based compensation expense| 460| 961| 1,490| 2,958  \nLoss on early extinguishment of debt| —| —| 1,009| —  \nGoodwill impairment| —| 29,705| 1,261| 55,405  \nImpairment of intangible assets| —| —| 980| —  \nFair value adjustment of Convertible Notes, with related parties| 2,810| —| 2,810| —  \nAcquisition-related costs(1)| 443| 516| 1,250| 1,701  \nRestructuring and other severance costs| 545| (24| )| 1,821| 456  \nCertain litigation and other related costs| —| (1,624| )| —| (5,982| )  \n**Adjusted EBITDA**|  $| (71| )| $| (1,742| )| $| (3,910| )| $| 4,302  \n  \n(1) Balance includes compensation expense related to non-competition agreements and earn-out expense incurred as a result of business combinations.

The earn-out expense was $30 and ($21) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $167 and $89 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nWe present media margin, media margin as a percentage of revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income (loss), and adjusted net income (loss) per share as supplemental measures of our financial and operating performance because we believe they provide useful information to investors. More specifically:\n\nMedia margin, as defined above, is a measure of the efficiency of the Company’s operating model. We use media margin and the related measure of media margin as a percentage of revenue as primary metrics to measure the financial return on our media and related costs, specifically to measure the degree by which the revenue generated from our digital marketing services exceeds the cost to attract the consumers to whom offers are made through our services. Media margin is used extensively by our management to manage our operating performance, including evaluating operational performance against budgeted media margin and understanding the efficiency of our media and related expenditures. We also use media margin for performance evaluations and compensation decisions regarding certain personnel.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA, as defined above, is another primary metric by which we evaluate the operating performance of our business, on which certain operating expenditures and internal budgets are based and by which, in addition to media margin and other factors, our senior management is compensated. The first three adjustments represent the conventional definition of EBITDA, and the remaining adjustments are items recognized and recorded under U.S. GAAP in particular periods but might be viewed as not necessarily coinciding with the underlying business operations for the periods in which they are so recognized and recorded. These adjustments include certain litigation and other related costs associated with legal matters outside the ordinary course of business. We consider items one-time in nature if they are non-recurring, infrequent or unusual and have not occurred in the past two years or are not expected to recur in the next two years, in accordance with SEC rules. There were no adjustments for one-time items in the periods presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n\nAdjusted net income (loss), as defined above, and the related measure of adjusted net income (loss) per share excludes certain items that are recognized and recorded under U.S. GAAP in particular periods but might be viewed as not necessarily coinciding with the underlying business operations for the periods in which they are so recognized and recorded. We believe adjusted net income (loss) affords investors a different view of the overall financial performance of the Company than adjusted EBITDA and the U.S. GAAP measure of net income (loss).\n\nMedia margin, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income (loss), and adjusted net income (loss) per share are non-GAAP financial measures with certain limitations regarding their usefulness. They do not reflect our financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Accordingly, these metrics are not indicative of our overall results or indicators of past or future financial performance. Further, they are not financial measures of profitability and are neither intended to be used as a proxy for the profitability of our business nor to imply profitability. The way we measure media margin, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted net income (loss) may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies and may not be identical to corresponding measures used in our various agreements.\n\n**Contact Information:** Investor RelationsFluent, Inc.InvestorRelations@fluentco.com \n\n![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/NWU5ZmFhYTEtNzAwMC00ODE0LTljMmUtNzY4ODcyYTM0YzY2LTEwOTMyNzI=/tiny/Fluent-Inc-.png)\n\n## Receive IR Updates\n\nSign up to our email alerts\n\n[ SUBSCRIBE ](/contact-us/email-alerts)\n"
