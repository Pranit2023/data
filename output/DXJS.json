Overview\nCORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY AT WISDOMTREE\nCorporate responsibility is embedded throughout our business, which we believe benefits employees, stockholders\nand other stakeholders. We are proud to have built a diverse and inclusive workforce across gender, race, age and\nability, including in our leadership teams and boards of directors.\nYou can access WisdomTree’s Corporate Governance documents at:\nhttps://ir.wisdomtree.com/corporate-governance/governance-documents\nPRI In 2019, we became a signatory of the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (“PRI”) and\ncontinue to maintain our signatory status\nWomen’s Initiative Network We established a Women’s Initiative Network (“WIN”) in 2019 designed to\nempower women in our organization and showcase our commitment to equity in the workforce\nCorporate Responsibility Report We published our first Corporate Responsibility Report in 2020, which\nprovides transparency into the different ways that WisdomTree incorporates corporate responsibility into\nour business\nDiversity, Equity & Inclusion We established an employee-led Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (“DEI”) Council\nin 2021 to foster a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace culture in support of WisdomTree’s DEI vision\n© 2024 WisdomTree, Inc.

Governance\nCORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY GOVERNANCE\nWisdomTree has established a global committee and jurisdictional working groups to drive sustainability initiatives\nacross our business, with oversight from the WT Board of Directors (the “Board”) and our executive management team.\nThe Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board reviews and provides oversight of the Company’s strategy,\ninitiatives and policies concerning corporate responsibility, including a quarterly review of the Company’s human rights\npolicy and consideration of environmental, health and safety, and social matters, and makes recommendations to the\nBoard regarding the Company’s sustainability initiatives and relevant public disclosures. The executive management\nteam provides guidance and direction on the implementation of sustainability initiatives through WisdomTree’s Global\nSustainability Committee.\nOur Global Sustainability Committee is comprised of leaders throughout the firm and is responsible for developing\nand implementing WisdomTree’s corporate sustainability strategy across the Company.\nBoard of Directors\nThe Nominating and Governance Committee reviews and provides oversight and makes recommendations\nto the Board regarding our sustainability initiatives\nExecutive Management\nProvides guidance and direction on the implementation of sustainability initiatives through\nthe Global Sustainability Committee and jurisdictional working groups\nGlobal Sustainability Committee\nDevelops and implements our sustainability strategy across the Company\n© 2024 WisdomTree, Inc. All Rights Reserved.\nWisdomTree 2023 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY 7\n2. Governance (continued)\nWISDOMTREE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\nThe Board sets high standards for employees, officers and directors. Implicit in this philosophy is the importance of\nsound corporate governance. It is the Board’s duty to serve as a prudent fiduciary for stockholders and to oversee the\nmanagement of the Company’s business. To this end, the Board has established an Audit Committee, a Compensation\nCommittee and a Nominating and Governance Committee, each of which operates pursuant to a charter adopted by\nthe Board.\nThe Board has developed Corporate Governance Guidelines that serve to promote effective governance of\nWisdomTree. These guidelines include but are not limited to:\n+ Standards for Board composition, leadership, term and independence\n+ Conflicts of interest\n+ Compensation\n+ Annual Board and Committee evaluations\nUN PRINCIPLES FOR RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT\nSince February 2019, WisdomTree has been a signatory of the\nUnited Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (“PRI”).\nFounded in 2005, the PRI is a United Nations-supported network that encourages asset managers and other\ninstitutional investors to engage with corporations on environmental, social and governance issues to create a more\nsustainable global financial system and support long-term investment value.\n© 2024 WisdomTree, Inc. All Rights Reserved.\nWisdomTree 2023 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY 8\n3. Third-Party Service Providers\nSERVICE PROVIDER CODE OF CONDUCT\nWisdomTree is committed to conducting its business activities in a socially responsible and ethical manner and we\nexpect our service providers to act in the same manner. Similar to WisdomTree, the service providers that are most\ncritical to our business are primarily financial and professional services companies that have fairly low environmental\nimpacts. WisdomTree is dedicated to ensuring that its service providers are committed to maintaining the highest\nof ethical standards as it relates to their employees and sustainability initiatives. We expect each service provider to\nhave implemented a robust corporate responsibility program, and we incorporate the review of all such programs\ninto our standard due diligence process. On an ongoing basis, we review the policies of our most critical service\nproviders to ensure they continue to meet these high ethical standards. To date, we have not found any service\nproviders to be non-compliant.\nAt a minimum, WisdomTree expects primary service providers to:\n+ hold themselves to the highest ethical standards and act with integrity at all times;\n+ fully comply with all applicable laws and regulations within their respective industries and jurisdictions,\nincluding with regard to fair competition and anti-trust, bribery and corruption, employee wages and working\nhours, the use of child or forced labor, and involvement with human trafficking and slavery across their supply\nchains;\n+ provide a safe work environment for their employees and treat all employees and suppliers with dignity and\nrespect; and\n+ disclose any potential conflicts of interest in relation to the business they conduct with WisdomTree.\n© 2024 WisdomTree, Inc. All Rights Reserved.\nWisdomTree 2023 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY 9\n4. Culture of Compliance\nCOMPLIANCE\nWisdomTree is proud of its robust compliance program. It is WisdomTree’s policy to comply with all applicable\ngovernmental laws, rules and regulations. Each employee is responsible for adhering to the standards and restrictions\nimposed by those laws, rules and regulations, including those relating to accounting and auditing matters.\nCOMPLIANCE TRAINING FOR EMPLOYEES\nWisdomTree requires all new employees to attend a compliance training session with a Compliance Officer. The\ntraining covers all material aspects of WisdomTree’s policies and procedures, including the Code of Ethics. The Code\nof Ethics is a document that sets forth the standard of conduct for employees, including, among other things, the\nsafeguarding of material, non-public information, the avoidance of conflicts of interest, complying with applicable\nfederal securities laws and promptly reporting any violations of the Code of Ethics. Thereafter, at least annually,\nemployees are required to attest that they have read and understood all employee-related applicable policies and\nprocedures. These requirements are mandatory; non-attendance/non-completion may result in disciplinary action\nand, ultimately, loss of employment.\nCertain WisdomTree employees are designated as Access Persons because of their job function/title or their access\nto certain information. Access Persons are subject to additional compliance requirements, including pre-clearing\ncertain personal security trades with the Compliance Department before execution.\nWisdomTree employees in Europe who hold Certification Functions or are Senior Managers under the Senior\nManagers and Certification Regime are required to undergo fitness and probity testing on an annual basis to ensure\nthey remain competent to hold client dealing functions at the Company.\nAll European employees are required to complete continuous professional development hours each year alongside\ntheir compliance training. This requirement is 10 or 15 hours, depending on their jurisdiction in Europe.\nTo help reinforce WisdomTree’s commitment to shared values and to keep integrity, teamwork and excellence at the\nforefront, WisdomTree conducts training sessions in order to educate employees on impending regulatory changes,\ncertain compliance policies and procedures, and industry best practices, as they arise. For example, on an annual\nbasis, WisdomTree provides unconscious bias and other training for all employees, including leaders and managers,\nto assist in addressing potential personal biases that they may have when considering new hires and advancement of\nexisting employees. WisdomTree continuously explores other training opportunities and needs within the Company.\n© 2024 WisdomTree, Inc. All Rights Reserved.\nWisdomTree 2023 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY 10\n4. Culture of Compliance (continued)\nEMPLOYEE POLICIES & PROCEDURES\nWisdomTree employees are required to adhere to strict policies and procedures to ensure they act with the highest\nethical and business standards:\n+ Code of Business Conduct and Ethics: This policy governs the expectations for the conduct of our employees.\nAt the time of hire and annually thereafter, WisdomTree employees are required to certify that they have read,\nunderstand and agree to comply with the Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.\n+ Whistleblower Policy: WisdomTree has an established Whistleblower Policy that enables employees to report\ninstances of non-compliance on a named or anonymous basis (see additional information in the Whistleblower\nPolicy section below).\n+ Political Contributions Policy: This policy sets out the parameters and reporting requirements for employee\ncontributions to political organizations and campaigns for U.S.-based employees.\nBUSINESS CONTINUITY AND DISASTER RECOVERY\nAt WisdomTree, ensuring the continued operation of our business in the event of a significant business disruption\nor disaster is critical to us and our investors. To that end, WisdomTree has established a formal Business Continuity\nPlan (the “BCP”), which is designed to address unexpected events or significant business disruptions and to comply\nwith all applicable federal securities laws and other applicable laws or regulations to ensure preparedness during\nand following an unexpected event or significant business disruption. The BCP provides a structure and necessary\noperational details so that employees, the executive team, management, business operations and technical teams\ncan respond appropriately in the event of any disruption that could impact critical business functions. The BCP is\ndesigned to assess any situation and identify the potential impact on any critical business functions of WisdomTree,\nenabling us to recover and restore business operations as quickly as possible, continue to provide an acceptable level\nof services during any prolonged disruption, protect our books and records, and preserve fund shareholder services.\n© 2024 WisdomTree, Inc. All Rights Reserved.\nWisdomTree 2023 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY 11\n4. Culture of Compliance (continued)\nCYBERSECURITY\nWisdomTree’s cybersecurity risk management approach is based on emerging best practices for protecting against\ncyber threats—namely, the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. The NIST Cybersecurity Framework2 defines the set of\npeople, process and technology activities required to assess and mitigate cybersecurity risk. These activities are\nmapped to a set of specific technical security controls and cybersecurity policies and are applied to information\nassets3 based on their business criticality and level of risk.\nOur cybersecurity risk management policies and procedures include processes for the identification, assessment\nand treatment through mitigation, transfer, avoidance and/or acceptance of cybersecurity risks, and are designed\nto address cybersecurity risks identified by external auditors and assessors, threat intelligence providers, internal\nstakeholders, vulnerability management programs, and security management programs.\nAs part of our cybersecurity risk management program, WisdomTree uses external service providers, where appropriate,\nto assess, test or otherwise assist with aspects of our security controls. Additionally, as a public company, we are\nsubject to Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) requirements and must undergo independent audits of Information Technology\nGeneral Controls (ITGC) in support of Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICFR). These audits assess key\ninformation security and cybersecurity risks in the environment that may affect the confidentiality, integrity and\navailability of financial reporting systems and data.\nWisdomTree also conducts employee training and awareness programs that include periodic and ongoing\nassessments in an effort to drive adoption and awareness of cybersecurity processes and controls. On an annual\nbasis, employees are trained to identify potential cybersecurity threats so that they are better able to protect the\nCompany and colleagues from such risks. In addition, WisdomTree carries an information security risk insurance\npolicy that covers information security breaches.\nOur cybersecurity risk management program and related operations and processes are directed by our Chief\nInformation Officer (“CIO”), and the Board’s Audit Committee, which is 100% independent, oversees WisdomTree’s\nmanagement of cybersecurity risks. Pursuant to its charter, the Audit Committee is responsible for discussing\ncybersecurity-related risks with management and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such\nrisks, including our risk assessment and risk management policies. The CIO regularly reports to the Audit Committee\non our cybersecurity risks, and the chair of the Audit Committee reports on these discussions to the full Board. In\naddition, the CIO provides periodic reports to our Board.\nTo date, WisdomTree has not experienced any information security breaches. Accordingly, WisdomTree has not\nincurred any expenses from information security breaches or from related penalties and settlements to date.\n2 National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cyber Framework: http://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/\n3 An information asset is any data stored in company systems that is used or transformed by business processes.\n© 2024 WisdomTree, Inc. All Rights Reserved.\nWisdomTree 2023 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY 12\n4. Culture of Compliance (continued)\nPOLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS\nPolitical contributions by corporations to candidates are regulated, and may be prohibited, by the election laws of\nthe applicable jurisdiction. Accordingly, it is WisdomTree’s policy to not use “Company” funds to make contributions\nfor political purposes where such contributions are not permitted by the laws of the applicable jurisdiction. Any such\ncontributions, where permitted, must be reviewed and approved by the Chief Legal Officer (“CLO”) in advance.\nIn 2023, WisdomTree did not make any corporate political contributions, other than membership dues to trade\nassociations.\nIn addition, U.S.-based employees of WisdomTree must follow the procedures and reporting requirements of\nthe Company’s Political Contributions Policy when making personal political contributions, which includes the\nrequirement to pre-clear any such contributions with the Company’s Compliance Department.\nWHISTLEBLOWER POLICY\nIn order to maintain the highest standards of business conduct and ethics regarding its accounting standards and\ndisclosures, internal accounting controls, audit practices, and compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations,\nWisdomTree has established a formal Whistleblower Policy.\nIf employees have concerns or complaints related to compliance policies and procedures or applicable laws, or if\nthey believe that a potential compliance violation has occurred or is occurring, relating to WisdomTree, they may\nsubmit the complaint or concern directly to the applicable Chief Compliance Officer (“CCO”), CLO or other designated\nofficers of WisdomTree under the Whistleblower Policy, as applicable. Alternatively, employees can make an\nanonymous submission through the Company’s compliance management portal or send their complaint or concern\nto the mailing address and e-mail address maintained for the receipt of any accounting or auditing concerns or to\nthe Company’s outside legal counsel. WisdomTree’s European employees have the option to submit whistleblowing\nnotifications to the relevant regulator if they feel that concerns cannot be raised internally.\nAll complaints or concerns submitted will be treated seriously and with the utmost care, promptly reviewed by the\napplicable CCO, CLO or other designated officers and, if applicable, such other business area(s) as may be affected\nby such complaints or concerns and brought to the attention of other members of senior management and/or the\napplicable board of directors for further review or action. Each review will be conducted in a confidential manner to\nthe fullest extent possible, consistent with the need to conduct an adequate review.\nWisdomTree will not discharge, demote, suspend, threaten, harass or in any manner retaliate or discriminate against\nany employee, who in good faith, reports concerns regarding the Company’s accounting, internal accounting controls,\nfinancial statements, or auditing or compliance matters.\nTo date, no employee whistleblower complaints have been made.\n© 2024 WisdomTree, Inc. All Rights Reserved.\nWisdomTree 2023 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY 13\n4. Culture of Compliance (continued)\nANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING\nAlthough a formal anti-money laundering (“AML”) program requirement has not been established for U.S. registered\ninvestment advisors such as WTAM, we have adopted an AML policy and program for our U.S. ETF business as a best\npractice. The U.S. AML policy identifies an AML Compliance Officer who is responsible for overseeing, implementing,\nmonitoring and enforcing all aspects of the AML policy.\nGiven our business structure, the AML function is performed for our U.S. ETF business by our transfer agent State\nStreet Bank & Trust Company and our distributor, Foreside Fund Services, LLP (referred to collectively as the “AML\nservice providers”). The AML Compliance Officer oversees these AML service providers on an ongoing basis consistent\nwith the AML policy and procedures, including ensuring that each AML service provider subject to the USA Patriot\nAct has established written anti-money laundering compliance programs reasonably designed to comply with all\nrelevant anti-money laundering laws, including the USA Patriot Act. The AML Compliance Officer receives a quarterly\nAML certification from each AML service provider attesting to the effectiveness of its procedures and notifications of\nany AML issues that occurred during the period.\nFurther, WisdomTree Digital Assets presents a major addition to the Company’s overall AML compliance responsibilities\nand potential liability. Unlike WTAM and the U.S. ETF business, WisdomTree Digital Assets sells products directly to\nconsumers. This obligates WisdomTree Digital Assets to develop an AML program that fully complies with the U.S.\nBank Secrecy Act, certain related state laws, and the economic sanctions program administered by the Office of\nForeign Assets Control (“OFAC”). As a result, WisdomTree Digital Assets has developed an AML program that has:\n+ appropriate policies and procedures, including controls to detect and report unusual or suspicious activity, to\ncomply with the relevant regulation under the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act;\n+ designated an AML Compliance Officer for WisdomTree Digital Assets;\n+ an independent test (audit) of the AML compliance function on an at least annual basis; and\n+ appropriate subject matter-related training.\nIn addition, WisdomTree Digital Assets has created an appropriate OFAC compliance program. All customers are\nscanned against the relevant sanctions list at account opening and ongoing. Vendors and U.S. based employees of\nWisdomTree Digital Assets are included in the screening program.\nIn Europe, WisdomTree is obligated, under legal and regulatory requirements, to adopt effective and adequate\nprocedures to detect and prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. Our Europe AML policies and procedures\nextend across our European business and also consider the implications and potential risks of any third parties and\nservice providers. Under our Europe AML policy, WisdomTree has a Money Laundering Reporting Officer, who is\nresponsible for overseeing, implementing, monitoring, and enforcing all aspects of the AML policy. The Company’s\ncompliance function supports these efforts. Policy reviews are undertaken on a periodic basis with reporting to\nsenior management, the boards of directors of WisdomTree UK Ltd and WisdomTree Ireland Ltd, and the WT Board.\n© 2024 WisdomTree, Inc. All Rights Reserved.\nWisdomTree 2023 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY 14\n4. Culture of Compliance (continued)\nANTI-BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION\nWisdomTree has established policies to demonstrate its commitment to preventing bribery and corruption and\nestablishing a zero-tolerance approach in all parts of the organization’s business operation. These policies are overseen\nby the Board and executive management team.\nWisdomTree aims to limit its exposure to bribery by:\n+ setting out clear policies that prohibit bribery and corruption for WisdomTree’s operations;\n+ training all employees so that they can recognize and avoid bribery offenses or suspicious activity;\n+ encouraging employees to be vigilant and to report any suspicion of bribery, providing them with suitable channels\nof communication and ensuring sensitive information is treated appropriately; and\n+ taking appropriate action against any individual(s) involved in bribery.\nTo date, no fines have been imposed on, and no associated settlements have been entered into, by WisdomTree relating\nto bribery or corruption violations.\nTHIRD-PARTY OVERSIGHT\nWisdomTree’s U.S. ETF business uses third-party sub-advisers and other service providers to perform various back-office\nservices, including trading, investment management, distribution and administrative activities, and has agreements\nin place for all such relationships. All sub-advisers have a fiduciary duty to manage all investor accounts in a fair and\nequitable manner, and all third-party service providers must comply with all applicable rules and regulations regarding\ntrading, investment management and administrative activities.\nEach department head is responsible for conducting initial and ongoing due diligence relative to the services provided by\nthe sub-advisers and/or third-party service providers as it relates to their specific functions and operations. Any issues that\npresent business or compliance concerns are brought to the attention of the appropriate member of senior management\nand/or the CCO. The CCO receives quarterly and/or annual due diligence questionnaires from each sub-adviser that detail\nthe sub- adviser’s compliance with applicable securities laws as well as other activities as they relate to the ongoing\nmaintenance of WisdomTree’s and the sub-adviser’s compliance programs. Certain WisdomTree employees also receive\nreports that detail the internal control environment specifics and whether any deficiencies exist that require remediation.\nIn addition, WisdomTree has established a Risk Management Committee in the U.S. and a Risk and Compliance Committee\nin Europe. Both committees oversee relevant risks both inside and outside the Company including any heightened or\nchanged risks as they relate to independent third-party service providers. The Risk Management Committee consists of\nmembers of senior management, including all department heads, and WisdomTree’s CCO serves as the chairperson. The\nRisk and Compliance Committee consists of members of senior management, compliance teams and certain department\nheads; the Head of Compliance in Europe serves as the chairperson. Both committees generally meet on a quarterly basis.\nWisdomTree Digital Assets maintains a separate third-party oversight (vendor management) program. The process\nmirrors that of our U.S. ETF business with a similar escalation to the Risk Management Committee and a separate Risk\nCommittee maintained by WisdomTree Digital Assets. The relevant federal and state regulators require certain vendor\nmanagement processes, including an OFAC check and documentation of testing.\n© 2024 WisdomTree, Inc.

We pride ourselves on the\ndiversity of our employee base globally and are committed to offering employment to the best possible candidates\nregardless of whether they require sponsorship. Notably, WisdomTree Europe boasts employees from 20 different\nnationalities that speak 17 languages and are based throughout multiple countries, including the U.K., Italy, Ireland,\nFinland, France, Germany and Sweden.\nThe Board’s corporate governance guidelines specify that when considering director candidates, the Nominating and\nGovernance Committee should:\n+ take reasonable steps to ensure the Board’s overall composition complies with applicable law regarding\ndiversity matters, including with respect to the number of female directors and directors from unrepresented\ncommunities on the Board and to include qualified candidates having diversity inclusive of gender, race,\nethnicity, age, gender identity, gender expression and sexual orientation, in the pool of candidates to be\nconsidered by the Nominating and Governance Committee for recommendation to the Board; and\n+ actively seek out highly qualified women and people of color as nominees.\nConsistent with our corporate governance guidelines, since 2021, six highly qualified women have joined and\nare currently serving on our Board: Smita Conjeevaram (January 2021), Lynn S. Blake (May 2022), Daniela Mielke\n(September 2022), Shamla Naidoo (June 2023), Tonia Pankopf (June 2023) and Rilla Delorier (August 2023).\nWisdomTree Board of Directors Gender and Demographic Background\nGender Demographic Background\n(as of date of this report) (as of date of this report)\nMale, Multiracial,\n33% 11%\nAsian,\n11%\nFemale, White,\n67% 78%\n© 2024 WisdomTree, Inc.

Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (continued)\nDEI COUNCIL\nAt WisdomTree, we envision a future of investment excellence driven by a commitment to continuously strengthen our\ndiverse, equitable and inclusive workplace culture. Our Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Council (“DEI\nCouncil”), formed in 2021, is comprised of senior leaders and employees from both the U.S. and\nEurope and provides oversight and guidance in connection with the implementation of programs\ndesigned to foster a culture where every employee thrives, leveraging diverse perspectives and\ninclusive practices. For example, in 2023, the DEI Council held training sessions on understanding\nneurodiversity, implicit bias and embedding inclusion in feedback, roundtables on success\nand failure, and financial literacy workshops for employees and secondary school students. The DEI Council also\npromoted awareness days and months across the firm including with respect to black history, women’s history, pride,\nmental health and men’s health.\nWOMEN’S INITIATIVE NETWORK\nWisdomTree’s Women’s Initiative Network, or WIN, is a global employee-led network that is designed to provide:\n+ opportunities and support from all genders for women at WisdomTree;\n+ career development and professional training opportunities; and\n+ female empowerment and leadership within the organization.\nSince its inception in 2019, WIN has held numerous global events, including panel discussions on women in the\nworkforce featuring WisdomTree employees and notable guest speakers, interactive seminars on topics including\nnegotiation skills, workshops and coaching sessions to enhance confidence to speak up, and various roundtable\nforums and in-person and virtual social gatherings to promote connectivity and increase engagement. WIN also\nproduces regular internal “spotlight” newsletters to increase visibility and raise the profile of our female employees.\nIn addition, through WIN’s mentorship program, WIN members of all genders are connected with firm leaders who\ncan help them achieve their career development goals.\n© 2024 WisdomTree, Inc.

Our incentive compensation program has been designed to reward our employees for their individual\nperformance as well as the Company’s performance and includes various quantitative metrics and qualitative\nresults that incentivize growth. We believe a key factor in our success has been and continues to be fostering an\nentrepreneurial culture where our employees act and think like our owners. As such, we believe that equity awards\nare an important part of our employees’ overall compensation package and that incentivizing our employees with\nequity aligns the interests of our employees with our stockholders.\nWe also offer a wide array of benefits including:\n+ generous healthcare coverage;\n+ employee retirement program—in the U.S., 50% of employee 401(k) contributions are matched;\n+ unlimited paid time off for U.S. employees;\n+ additional Wellness Days for U.S. employees, which are scheduled office closures around major market holidays;\n+ 8 weeks of paid sabbatical leave after 10 years of service with WisdomTree;\n+ life insurance and short- and long-term disability benefits;\n+ an Educational Assistance Program;\n+ paid parental leave for both parents;\n+ travel insurance;\n+ a stipend for mobile phone and home office supplies;\n+ discounted gym memberships and a “sweat equity” exercise reimbursement plan;\n+ CPR and first aid training;\n+ coverage for holistic medicine and pet insurance;\n+ virtual yoga, wellness and meditation sessions; and\n+ volunteer opportunities.\n© 2024 WisdomTree, Inc.

All Rights Reserved.\nWisdomTree 2023 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY 19\n6. Employee Experience (continued)\nEMPLOYEE WELLNESS, HEALTH AND SAFETY\nThe wellbeing of our employees is a primary focus. We are continuously evolving and refining how we work best to achieve\nindividual, team and Company goals. To that end, we have embraced a Work Smart philosophy that transcends physical work\nsettings, with a focus on optimizing productivity, efficiency and effectiveness of our work. Time in the office generally is not\nprescribed, and team leaders are empowered to determine how their teams work best, based on their roles, with employees\nremaining accountable for achieving individual, team and Company outcomes. To foster employee wellbeing and a healthy\nwork-life balance, we offer numerous wellness programs including meditation and yoga classes, health webinars, a weekly\nwellness newsletter and access to mental health professionals and other resources. Leveraging technology, we enhance\nthe employee experience through digital wellness platforms, facilitating remote access to health and wellbeing resources.\nWe also offer paid vacation (unlimited in the U.S.) and sick leave policies to provide employees additional flexibility, and\nour U.S. employees enjoy additional Wellness Days, which are scheduled office closures around major market holidays\nfor employees to collectively disconnect and rejuvenate. We support employees with their information technology needs,\nprovide a monthly stipend to cover remote work-related business expenses and provide guidance for managers to ensure\nthat employees remain connected and maintain physical, mental and emotional wellbeing.\nIn keeping with Work Smart, we now maintain a smaller office footprint globally to better align with the number of\nemployees expected to collaborate in person on any given day, while providing a space for employees to work and\nsocialize. As the safety and security of our employees who choose to work in our office space are of critical importance, we\nhave selected office buildings with robust security procedures, fire safety, and sanitation and health practices, and we offer\nvarious voluntary and mandatory safety training sessions.\nEMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT\nWe believe engaging our employees is key to fostering new ideas and driving commitment and productivity. We\ncommunicate frequently and transparently with our employees through a variety of communication methods, including\nan annual global virtual offsite where senior leaders review the firm’s prior-year accomplishments and articulate the\nobjectives for the coming year, and each department presents its respective prior-year accomplishments and current-year\nobjectives, monthly regional and quarterly global town halls, and firmwide weekly emails championing the team’s work.\nWe also seek feedback from our employees through annual engagement surveys and follow-up pulse surveys on various\ntopics. In addition, we provide opportunities for employees to participate in volunteer and charitable events.\nWe also believe it is important to celebrate employee and Company accomplishments. In 2023, we celebrated our fourth\nannual Team Alpha Awards to mark significant events and successes and to recognize employees who led those successes\nwhile exhibiting extraordinary teamwork and demonstrating strong character. Over 50 nominations were submitted and\nnarrowed down by a selection committee. The winners received a modest incentive compensation award, the opportunity\nto donate to a charity of their choice and to recognize other employees who assisted them.\nThe success of our employee engagement efforts is demonstrated by our employee retention rate of approximately\n93.4% in 2023. We also achieved overall positive results from our 2023 global employee engagement survey, with a 99%\nparticipation rate. Additionally, in the U.S., we were named a 2023 Best Places to Work in Money Management by Pensions\n& Investments for the fourth consecutive year and seventh year since the award was created. We ranked second within\nthe category for managers with 100–499 employees, the second consecutive year earning a ranking among the top five\nemployers. In the U.K., we were also named Best Workplace for medium-sized companies for a fourth consecutive year and\na 2023 Best Workplace for Women for medium-sized companies by Great Place to Work.\n© 2024 WisdomTree, Inc.

Community Investment\nCOMMUNITY SERVICE AT WISDOMTREE\nWisdomTree encourages employees to be active members of the community and to give back through a variety of\nprograms. In addition, WisdomTree selects charities each month to receive a donation, with a focus on support and\nDEI-related charities (e.g., MLK Day of Service, Black History Month, International Women’s Day, Earth Day, Mental\nHealth, PRIDE). In our London office, we support a program that matches our employees with local charities and social\nenterprises to provide business guidance and support to become more efficient, effective and sustainable organizations.\nWisdomTree has several programs and initiatives in place to encourage our workforce to give back, including:\n+ Charitable events: WisdomTree hosts employee events to raise money for charitable organizations throughout\nthe year, such as charity game nights and fitness challenges. We also offer unique volunteer and charity fundraising\nopportunities for our employees. For example, our London-based employees joined in in the World’s Largest\nCoffee morning for Macmillan Cancer Support.\n+ Clean the World: We worked with this organization to build 1,000 hygiene kits comprised of toiletry items and\ndonated them to a local New York City-based shelter.\n+ GradBag: In 2023, WIN members volunteered with GradBag, a charitable organization whose mission is to support\nunderserved college-bound students and to advance sustainability. WIN volunteers helped unload supplies and\nstage a shopping area for lightly used dorm room essentials for redistribution to incoming students in-need.\n+ Malala Fund: We work with the Malala Fund, which advocates for girls’ education and works for a world where\nevery girl can learn and lead, helping bolster girls’ secondary education globally.\n+ Movember: In November, several WisdomTree employees grew moustaches as a symbol of Movember, which is a\nmonth used to promote men’s health across the world. WisdomTree employees raised more than £2,000 through\na series of events that included hosting a comedy night, running, swimming and other activities. The donations will\nbe used to tackle testicular and prostate cancer as well as men’s mental health issues, which are often shied away\nfrom but affect men in our community.\n+ Paid Volunteer Days: Employees are offered paid time off to volunteer at a charitable organization of their choice.\n+ Refuge: In Europe, WisdomTree is raising money to support Refuge, the largest domestic abuse organization in the\nU.K. On any given day, our services support thousands of women and their children, helping them to overcome the\nphysical, emotional, financial and logistical impacts of abuse and rebuild their lives, free from fear.\n+ Schools Initiative: As part of its aim to amplify access to opportunities, the DEI Council has engaged with\nvarious high schools to provide financial literacy and exposure to roles within the financial service industry to\nunrepresented/underprivileged groups.\n+ Team Alpha Awards: On an annual basis, WisdomTree celebrates the Team Alpha Awards to mark significant\nevents and successes and to recognize employees who led those successes while exhibiting extraordinary\nteamwork and demonstrating strong character. In addition to their modest compensation award, winners are\ngiven the opportunity to donate to a charity of their choice. This incentive has resulted in charitable donations of\nmore than $30,000 per year.\n© 2024 WisdomTree, Inc. All Rights Reserved.\nWisdomTree 2023 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY 21\n8. Environment\nCLIMATE AWARENESS STATEMENT\nWisdomTree considers its impact on the environment to be low. Due to the nature of our business, WisdomTree has\na relatively light carbon footprint and does not generate hazardous waste or emit meaningful levels of greenhouse\ngases.\nHowever, we acknowledge the threat of climate change on the environment and recognize that it is imperative to use\nour position as a global platform to implement positive change so that we may offset any negative impact. To that\nend, WisdomTree seeks to operate a more sustainable business through various initiatives, including, but not limited\nto, an organization-wide commitment to sustainability efforts and becoming a signatory to the PRI.\nGOING GREEN AT WISDOMTREE\nWisdomTree strives to maintain an environmentally friendly workplace and we encourage our employees to avoid\nwaste where possible.\nWisdomTree currently employs a Work Smart philosophy that transcends physical work settings, with a focus on\noptimizing productivity, efficiency and effectiveness of our work. Time in the office is generally not prescribed,\nand team leaders are empowered to determine how their teams work best, based on their roles, with employees\nremaining accountable for achieving individual, team and Company outcomes. In keeping with this approach, we\nmaintain a smaller office footprint globally to better align with the number of employees expected to collaborate in\nperson on any given day, which we believe will make us more efficient and sustainable over the long run.\nCARBON OFFSETTING IN EUROPE\nThrough carbon offsetting, our European operations have been carbon neutral since 2019. Partnering with an\norganization called Carbon Footprint, we calculate and offset our carbon emissions through Verified Carbon Service\nprojects with a positive environmental impact, such as planting native trees, investing in carbon reduction projects,\nhelping disadvantaged communities and providing wildlife habitats.\nWe are proud to be supporting a new project to offset 2022 emissions, Zoba Anseba Community Safe Water Project.\nThe Zoba Anseba Community Safe Water Project supports the provision of safe water using borehole technology to\nhundreds of households in the Zoba Anseba district of Eritrea.

Despite a challenging market environment, we continued to deliver value to our stakeholders.\n\nIn Q3 2024, we achieved record assets under management (AUM), reaching approximately $113 billion. This AUM growth helped us expand adjusted operating margins by over 800 basis points to 37.3%, while adjusted earnings per share grew by 80% compared to Q3 last year. Additionally, recent strategic capital actions, including the repurchase of all of our outstanding Series A Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock from ETFS Capital Limited and additional common stock, underscores our commitment to delivering shareholder value.\n\nWhat excites me most, however, is the foundation we’re building for the future. WisdomTree always has been about more than just strong financial performance—we’ve consistently pushed boundaries to stay ahead of the curve. Nearly 20 years ago, we pioneered self-indexing and alpha-generating ETFs. Today, we’re continuing to innovate in areas like tokenization, which I believe will continue to transform the financial landscape.\n\nA key driver of our recent growth has been our models business, which you may have heard me discuss before. We’ve seen strong demand for flexible, efficient portfolio solutions, and in the coming weeks, we’ll expand access to 85,000 advisors, up from 70,000. Engagement is growing steadily, with over 2,500 advisors actively using at least one model. By deepening these relationships, we’re enhancing asset retention and creating more predictable revenue streams—momentum that we expect to continue.\n\nAt the same time, we’re making significant progress in tokenization, which I believe is a major growth driver for the future. We’re leading the way in this space with two platforms—WisdomTree Prime® and WisdomTree Connect™. WisdomTree Prime, our direct-to-retail platform, is available to about 80% of the U.S. population and more states are on the horizon. This platform offers features like dynamic spending from already-live money market fund balances and we plan to continue adding enhancements to the platform in the months ahead.\n\nOn the institutional side, WisdomTree Connect, our business-to-business platform, is now live and enables clients to interact with WisdomTree-issued tokens across supported blockchains. This is a pivotal development in our tokenization strategy, opening up new opportunities for businesses to engage with tokenized products in entirely new ways.\n\nOur token issuance platform, which powers both WisdomTree Prime and WisdomTree Connect, provides additional opportunities. The platform allows us to tokenize a wide range of products, either for our own use or on behalf of others. This vertical integration provides a competitive advantage as we scale and innovate in blockchain-enabled finance, and I believe it will contribute meaningfully to our growth in the years to come.\n\nFinally, this month, we celebrate our 10-year anniversary in Europe. Since establishing our European presence in 2014, we have experienced remarkable growth and have become a trusted resource for investors across the continent. Over the last decade, we have grown in Europe to more than $30 billion in AUM and over 100 employees, and we’re proud to be a trusted partner to our European clients. It’s amazing to think we launched 10 years ago, but a decade is just the beginning.\n\nLooking ahead, I remain very optimistic. WisdomTree is well positioned to capitalize on the evolving financial landscape. Our traditional global ETF business is thriving, our tokenization strategy is gaining momentum, and our disciplined execution continues to drive strong financial results. While the market has its challenges, we are building a foundation for sustainable, long-term growth—and I’m excited for what’s next.\n\n**Archive**\n\n[Q2 2024](https://www.wisdomtree.com/executive-message-2024-q2) [Q1 2024](https://www.wisdomtree.com/executive-message-2024-q1) [Q4 2023](https://www.wisdomtree.com/executive-message-2023-q4) [Q3 2023](https://www.wisdomtree.com/executive-message-2023-q3) [Q2 2023](https://www.wisdomtree.com/executive-message-2023-q2) [Q1 2023](https://www.wisdomtree.com/executive-message-2023-q1) [Q4 2022](https://www.wisdomtree.com/executive-message-2022-q4) [Q3 2022](https://www.wisdomtree.com/executive-message-2022-q3) [Q2 2022](https://www.wisdomtree.com/executive-message-2022-q2)\n\n**Restricted Content**\n\nThis content is intended for **Financial Professionals only**.

In this role, he oversees WisdomTree’s digital asset, crypto and blockchain initiatives. These initiatives include crypto asset management products, tokenization and WisdomTree’s digital wallet offering, WisdomTree Prime. Previously, he served as Head of Strategy and Emerging Technologies for WisdomTree. Prior to WisdomTree, he worked in investment banking for Bank of America Merrill Lynch covering a range of financial services companies. Will serves on the Board of Directors of Securrency, Inc., a technology company focused on blockchain-based financial services infrastructure. He graduated cum laude from Harvard University. \n\nFrom the start, our vision with WisdomTree Prime® has been to build a personal finance app that merges saving, spending, and investing, bringing tokenization and blockchain-enabled finance to the center of a user’s financial life. In July 2023, WisdomTree Prime went live in app stores for customers in 21 states. The app provided a curated investing and trading experience to our early customers in a blockchain native environment. So, a good start, but we knew we had more work to do across multiple dimensions to bring WisdomTree Prime to our ultimate vision and to make it available to more people in the U.S.Since that announcement, we have made great progress along those lines. Below are some key updates on where WisdomTree Prime is today:\n\n  * WisdomTree Prime is available in **41 states** representing **75% of the U.S. population**.\n  * WisdomTree received a trust company charter by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The trust company charter is the most distinguished authorization in the digital assets landscape, and, through this new entity, we will provide products to customers as part of the WisdomTree Prime ecosystem.\n  * Digital Assets – available for **24/7/365 trading** and near-instant settlement1: \n    * WisdomTree Gold Token, a token representing title to physical gold\n    * Bitcoin\n    * Ether\n  * Digital Funds – tokenized SEC registered mutual funds†– representing: \n    * Equities\n    * Fixed Income\n    * Asset allocation funds, including strategies based on our collaboration with Professor Jeremy Siegel*\n    * Government money market fund\n  * Full money movement capabilities, with the ability to deposit and withdraw via both initiated and received ACH transactions, enabled via Plaid. Since launch, we now offer higher deposit limits (for example, up to $10,000 per day for initiated deposits as compared to $4,000 per day) and instant deposit.2\n  * We launched the WisdomTree Prime Visa Debit Card, which allows users to spend using their available WisdomTree Prime balance wherever Visa® is accepted. The card is available both digitally and physically for users through WisdomTree Prime. Initially, a customer’s available spend balance will be based on their WisdomTree Dollar Token holdings. Over time, we anticipate making additional digital assets and digital funds available to use for spending with the debit card.\n\n\n\nWe’re proud of the progress we are making. A lot of people talk about bringing blockchain to daily financial services – we believe we are actually doing it, providing tangible use cases for this technology. But most importantly, we think this has the potential to improve our customers’ financial lives, and we’re looking forward to hearing from you as you use the app. Please send us any ideas or feedback to feedback@wisdomtreeprime.com, and you can always reach us for support in the app or at support@wisdomtreeprime.com.\n\nDownload WisdomTree Prime here: <https://app.wisdomtreeprime.com/owuo/fp4pkhkp>\n\n1Near-instant settlement means that as soon as a user’s trade is confirmed it is also settled. For example, when the WisdomTree Gold Token is purchased, the user will immediately have the WisdomTree Gold Token in their account upon trade confirmation (as opposed to a delayed settlement process).2 [What are the limits on depositing funds? – WisdomTree (wisdomtreeprime.com)](https://support.wisdomtreeprime.com/hc/en-us/articles/9733177559067-What-are-the-limits-on-depositing-funds)\n\n**PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AVAILABLE VIA WISDOMTREE PRIME: NOT FDIC INSURED | NO BANK GUARANTEE | NOT A BANK DEPOSIT | MAY LOSE VALUE | NOT SIPC PROTECTED | NOT INSURED BY ANY GOVERNMENT AGENCY**\n\nThe products and services available through the WisdomTree Prime app are not endorsed, indemnified or guaranteed by any regulatory agency. \n\nFor informational purposes only. Not intended as investment advice, a solicitation or offer to buy or sell any security, financial product, digital asset, commodity, or service. Investing involves risk, including loss of principal. \n\n**Digital assets (e.g., bitcoin and ether) are considered to be highly speculative, involve a high degree of risk and have the potential for loss of the entire investment.** Digital assets are subject to a number of risks, including price volatility. Transactions in digital assets may be irreversible, and accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable. Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the state, federal, or international level may adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange and value of virtual currency. \n\nThe WisdomTree Gold Token is a digital token recorded on the blockchain representing electronic document of title to physical gold. The price of gold does fluctuate and may be affected by numerous factors including supply and demand, the global financial markets and other political, financial, or economic events, which may negatively impact gold prices and the value of a WisdomTree Gold Token. \n\nA blockchain is an open, distributed ledger that digitally records transactions in a verifiable and immutable (i.e., permanent) way using cryptography. A distributed ledger is a database in which data is stored in a decentralized manner. Cryptography is a method of storing and transmitting data in a particular form so that only those for whom it is intended can read and process it. A blockchain stores transaction data in “blocks” that are linked together to form a “chain”, and hence the name blockchain. Blockchain technology is a relatively new and untested technology, with little regulation. Blockchain systems could be vulnerable to fraud, particularly if a significant minority of participants colluded to defraud the rest. Potential risks also include vulnerability to theft, or inaccessibility, and future regulatory developments could affect its viability. \n\nReferences to “save” generally refers to a user’s ability to select one or more highly liquid, relatively low risk cash management solutions and references to “spend” generally refers to a user’s ability to designate one or more digital asset(s) and/or other assets to be sold, or to sell one or more digital asset(s) with near instant settlement, to fund a debit card purchase. Spending, paying bills and making purchases require actions to be taken in the discretion of the user which require user actions outside of the domain or functionality of the app and which rely on third parties, including third parties for which the user will need to have a separate relationship. \n\nThe WisdomTree Prime digital wallet and digital asset services are offered through WisdomTree Digital Movement, Inc. (NMLS ID: 2372500) (“WDM”) and WisdomTree Digital Trust Company, LLC, in select U.S. jurisdictions and may be limited where prohibited by law (each entity, as applicable, “WisdomTree Digital”). WisdomTree Digital Trust Company, LLC is chartered as a limited purpose trust company by the New York State Department of Financial Services to engage in virtual currency business. WisdomTree Digital is not a bank and does not itself take deposits. Demand deposit accounts made available to you as a WisdomTree Prime user are provided by Stride Bank N.A., Member FDIC. Digital assets held in WisdomTree Digital accounts are not legal tender and are not covered by FDIC protections. The WisdomTree Prime Visa Debit card is issued by Stride Bank N.A., Member FDIC, pursuant to a license from Visa USA Inc. \n\n**WisdomTree Digital Funds – Important Information:**\n\n**Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the Digital Funds before investing. To obtain a prospectus containing this and other important information, please visit**[**https://www.wisdomtree.com/investments**](https://www.wisdomtree.com/investments)**. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.**\n\n**You could lose money by investing in the Money Market Fund. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the Fund is not a bank account and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund’s adviser is not required to reimburse the Fund for losses, and you should not expect that the adviser will provide financial support to the Fund at any time, including during periods of market stress.**\n\nThere are risks associated with investing, including possible loss of principal. Blockchain technology is a relatively new and untested technology, with little regulation. Potential risks include vulnerability to fraud, theft, or inaccessibility, and future regulatory developments affect its viability. Funds focusing investments on certain sectors increases their vulnerability to any single economic or regulatory development, which may result in greater share price volatility. U.S. Treasury obligations may provide relatively lower returns than those of other securities. Changes to the financial condition or credit rating of the U.S. government may cause the value to decline. TIPS can provide a hedge against inflation, as the inflation adjustment feature helps preserve the purchasing power of the investment. Because of this inflation adjustment feature, inflation protected bonds typically have lower yields than conventional fixed rate bonds and will likely decline in price during periods of deflation, which could result in losses. Securities with floating rates can be less sensitive to interest rate changes than securities with fixed interest rates, but may decline in value and negatively impact a Fund’s NAV, particularly if changes in prevailing interest rates are more frequent or sudden than the rate changes for floating rates notes, which can only occur periodically. Fixed income securities are subject to interest rate, credit, inflation, and reinvestment risks. Generally, as interest rates rise, the value of fixed-income securities falls. Cybersecurity attacks affecting a Fund’s third-party service providers, the App, blockchain network, or the issuers of securities in which the Fund invests may subject the Fund to many of the same risks associated with direct cybersecurity breaches. \n\n† Although WisdomTree Transfers, Inc., the Fund’s transfer agent, will maintain the official record of share ownership in book-entry form, the ownership of a Digital Fund’s shares will also be recorded – or digitized – on the Stellar or other blockchains. In order to facilitate the use of blockchain technology, a potential shareholder must have a blockchain wallet. WisdomTree Digital Movement, Inc. (“WisdomTree Digital”, as further described below) provides a hosted Stellar-based wallet through the mobile application, WisdomTree Prime. Through the app, Digital Fund investors may purchase, hold, sell or transfer their shares. WisdomTree Securities, Inc., an affiliate of WisdomTree Transfers and WisdomTree Digital, facilitates the ability for Digital Fund investors on an “application-way” basis to purchase or sell Digital Fund shares through the app. Brokerage commissions apply. \n\n* The WisdomTree Siegel Digital Funds leverage insights from Professor Jeremy J.
