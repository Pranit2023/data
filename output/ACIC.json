Having so many associates impacted by the storms, we understand the requirement for, and expectation of, exceptional customer service. Two of American Coastal’s core values are collaboration and resiliency, and I am proud that our associates embody these values in the wake of devastating storms that impacted so many.\n\nOur performance this quarter reflects these core values and the strength of our underwriting discipline and the focus on protecting American Coastal from outsized exposure. We continue reporting increased returns on equity and combined ratios lower than 60%. For the third quarter, our total revenue was $82.1 million, a 56% increase year-over-year.”\n\n**Return on Equity and Core Return on Equity**\n\nThe calculations of the Company's return on equity and core return on equity are shown below.\n\n($ in thousands)| **Three Months Ended**| **Nine Months Ended**  \n---|---|---  \n**September 30,**| **September 30,**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nIncome from continuing operations, net of tax| $| 27,669| $| 15,015| $| 70,451| $| 67,824  \nReturn on equity based on GAAP income from continuing operations, net of tax(1)| 55.3%| 177.9%| 46.9%| 267.9%  \nIncome (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax| $| 450| $| (4,447)| $| 321| $| 227,803  \nReturn on equity based on GAAP income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax(1)| 0.9%| (52.7)%| 0.2%| NM  \nConsolidated net income| $| 28,119| $| 10,568| $| 70,772| $| 295,627  \nReturn on equity based on GAAP net income (1)| 56.2%| 125.2%| 47.1%| NM  \nCore income| $| 26,934| $| 15,513| $| 70,935| $| 74,484  \nCore return on equity (1)(2)| 53.8%| 183.8%| 47.3%| 294.2%  \n(1) Return on equity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is calculated on an annualized basis by dividing the net income or core income for the period by the average stockholders' equity for the trailing twelve months.  \n(2) Core return on equity, a measure that is not based on GAAP, is calculated based on core income, which is reconciled on the first page of this press release to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure.

Of this income, $27.7 million is attributable to continuing operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $12.7 million from net income of $15.0 million for the same period in 2023. Quarter-over-quarter revenues increased, driven by a decrease in ceded premiums earned, an increase in net investment income and unrealized gains on equity securities. This was offset by increased expenses quarter-over-quarter, driven by an increase in policy acquisition costs and general and administrative expenses, as described below. In addition, the Company's provision for income taxes increased as a result of increased income before taxes quarter-over-quarter. The Company's income from discontinued operations, also contributed to this change in net income, increasing $4.9 million quarter-over-quarter, as the deconsolidation of the Company's former subsidiary, United Property and Casualty Insurance Company (\"UPC\") is not impacting the Company in 2024.\n\nThe Company's total gross written premium remained relatively flat, decreasing by $1.0 million, or 1.0%, to $93.0 million for the third quarter of 2024, from $94.0 million for the third quarter of 2023. The breakdown of the quarter-over-quarter changes in both direct written and assumed premiums by state and gross written premium by line of business are shown in the table below.\n\n($ in thousands)| **Three Months EndedSeptember 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **Change $**| **Change %**  \n**Direct Written and Assumed Premium by State**  \nFlorida| $| 93,016| $| 93,965| $| (949)| (1.0)%  \nNew York| —| —| —| —  \nTotal direct written premium by state| 93,016| 93,965| (949)| (1.0)  \nAssumed premium| —| 21| (21)| (100.0)  \nTotal gross written premium by state| $| 93,016| $| 93,986| $| (970)| (1.0)%  \n**Gross Written Premium by Line of Business**  \nCommercial property| $| 93,016| $| 93,986| $| (970)| (1.0)%  \nPersonal property| —| —| —| —  \nTotal gross written premium by line of business| $| 93,016| $| 93,986| $| (970)| (1.0)%  \n  \nLoss and LAE increased by $2.0 million, or 20.4%, to $11.8 million for the third quarter of 2024, from $9.8 million for the third quarter of 2023. Loss and LAE expense as a percentage of net earned premiums decreased 3.7 points to 15.8% for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 19.5% for the third quarter of 2023. Excluding catastrophe losses and reserve development, the Company's gross underlying loss and LAE ratio for the third quarter of 2024 would have been 5.1%, unchanged from the third quarter of 2023.\n\nPolicy acquisition costs increased by $7.3 million, or 53.7%, to $20.9 million for the third quarter of 2024, from $13.6 million for the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to a decrease in reinsurance commission income attributable to the change in our quota share reinsurance cession rate from 40% to 20% effective June 1, 2024. This was partially offset by increased management fees attributable to our commercial property premiums.\n\nOperating and underwriting expenses remained unchanged at $2.1 million for both the third quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $2.2 million, or 36.7%, to $8.2 million for the third quarter of 2024, from $6.0 million for the third quarter of 2023, driven by increased overhead costs such as amortization of capitalized software and salaries.\n\n**IIC Results Highlights**\n\nNet income attributable to IIC totaled $450 thousand for the third quarter of 2024 compared to a net loss of $642 thousand for the third quarter of 2023. Drivers of the quarter-over-quarter increase included: an increase in net premiums earned of $1.5 million, driven by an increase in gross premiums earned of $1.3 million, while ceded premiums earned remained relatively flat, decreasing $182 thousand. Expenses also remained relatively flat, with a net increase of $179 thousand, driven by an increase in loss and LAE incurred of $506 thousand, which was driven by current year non-catastrophe losses, offset primarily by a decrease in operating and underwriting expenses of $390 thousand. IIC's remaining expenses remained relatively flat quarter-over-quarter.\n\n**Reinsurance Costs as a Percentage of Gross Earned Premium**\n\nReinsurance costs as a percentage of gross earned premium in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 were as follows:\n\n**2024**| **2023**  \n---|---  \nNon-at-Risk| (0.5)%| (0.2)%  \nQuota Share| (16.2)%| (31.5)%  \nAll Other| (36.8)%| (36.4)%  \nTotal Ceding Ratio| (53.5)%| (68.1)%  \n  \nCeded premiums earned related to the Company's catastrophe excess of loss contracts remained relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. The Company's utilization of quota share reinsurance coverage resulted in less excess of loss coverage needed for the 2023-2024 catastrophe year; however, the cost savings associated with this reduction in necessary coverage were offset by rate increases on catastrophe excess of loss coverage for the same period. This utilization of quota share reinsurance coverage increased the Company's ceding ratio overall during 2023. Effective June 1, 2024, the Company decreased its quota share reinsurance coverage from 40% to 20%, lowering the Company's quota share ceding ratio and overall ceding ratio.\n\nReinsurance costs as a percentage of gross earned premium in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 for IIC, captured within discontinued operations, were as follows:\n\n**IIC**  \n---  \n**2024**| **2023**  \nNon-at-Risk| (2.5)%| (2.8)%  \nQuota Share| —%| —%  \nAll Other| (21.9)%| (27.9)%  \nTotal Ceding Ratio| (24.4)%| (30.7)%  \n  \n**Investment Portfolio Highlights**\n\nThe Company's cash, restricted cash and investment holdings increased from $311.9 million at December 31, 2023 to $571.1 million at September 30, 2024. This increase is driven by positive cash flows from operations. The Company's cash and investment holdings consist of investments in U.S. government and agency securities, corporate debt and investment grade money market instruments. Fixed maturities represented approximately 84.2% of total investments at September 30, 2024 compared to 89.4% of total investments at December 31, 2023. The Company's fixed maturity investments had a modified duration of 2.3 years at September 30, 2024, compared to 3.4 years at December 31, 2023.\n\n**Book Value Analysis**\n\nBook value per common share increased 49.0% from $3.61 at December 31, 2023, to $5.38 at September 30, 2024. Underlying book value per common share increased 41.8% from $3.97 at December 31, 2023 to $5.63 at September 30, 2024. An increase in the Company's retained earnings as a result of net income in the first nine months of 2024, drove the increase in the Company's book value per share.

A replay of the webcast will be available shortly after the event concludes.\n\n**_About American Coastal Insurance Corporation_**\n\nAmerican Coastal Insurance Corporation ([amcoastal.com](http://amcoastal.com)) is the holding company of the insurance carrier, American Coastal Insurance Company, which was founded in 2007 for the purpose of insuring Condominium and Homeowner Association properties, and apartments in the state of Florida. American Coastal Insurance Company has an exclusive partnership for distribution of Condominium Association properties in the state of Florida with AmRisc Group ([amriscgroup.com](http://amriscgroup.com)), one of the largest Managing General Agents in the country specializing in hurricane-exposed properties. American Coastal Insurance Company has earned a Financial Stability Rating of “A”, \"Exceptional\" from Demotech, and maintains an “A-” insurance financial strength rating with a Stable outlook by Kroll. ACIC maintains a ‘BB+’ issuer rating with a Stable outlook by Kroll.\n\n**Contact Information:**  \n---  \nAlexander Baty  \nVice President, Finance & Investor Relations, American Coastal Insurance Corp.  \ninvestorrelations@amcoastal.com  \n(727) 425-8076  \nKarin Daly  \nInvestor Relations, Vice President, The Equity Group  \nkdaly@equityny.com  \n(212) 836-9623  \n  \n**Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures**\n\nThe Company believes that investors' understanding of ACIC's performance is enhanced by the Company's disclosure of the following non-GAAP measures. The Company's methods for calculating these measures may differ from those used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.\n\n**Net income (loss) excluding the effects of amortization of intangible assets, income (loss) from discontinued operations, realized gains (losses) and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net of tax (core income (loss))** is a non-GAAP measure that is computed by adding amortization, net of tax, to net income (loss) and subtracting income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, realized gains (losses) on the Company's investment portfolio, net of tax, and unrealized gains (losses) on the Company's equity securities, net of tax, from net income (loss). Amortization expense is related to the amortization of intangible assets acquired, including goodwill, through mergers and, therefore, the expense does not arise through normal operations. Investment portfolio gains (losses) and unrealized equity security gains (losses) vary independent of the Company's operations. The Company believes it is useful for investors to evaluate these components both separately and in the aggregate when reviewing the Company's performance. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is net income (loss). The core income (loss) measure should not be considered a substitute for net income (loss) and does not reflect the overall profitability of the Company's business.\n\n**Core return on equity** is a non-GAAP ratio calculated using non-GAAP measures. It is calculated by dividing the core income (loss) for the period by the average stockholders’ equity for the trailing twelve months (or one quarter of such average, in the case of quarterly periods). Core income (loss) is an after-tax non-GAAP measure that is calculated by excluding from net income (loss) the effect of income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, non-cash amortization of intangible assets, including goodwill, unrealized gains or losses on the Company's equity security investments and net realized gains or losses on the Company's investment portfolio. In the opinion of the Company’s management, core income (loss), core income (loss) per share and core return on equity are meaningful indicators to investors of the Company's underwriting and operating results, since the excluded items are not necessarily indicative of operating trends. Internally, the Company’s management uses core income (loss), core income (loss) per share and core return on equity to evaluate performance against historical results and establish financial targets on a consolidated basis. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is return on equity. The core return on equity measure should not be considered a substitute for return on equity and does not reflect the overall profitability of the Company's business.\n\n**Combined ratio excluding the effects of current year catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development (underlying combined ratio)** is a non-GAAP measure, that is computed by subtracting the effect of current year catastrophe losses and prior year development from the combined ratio. The Company believes that this ratio is useful to investors, and it is used by management to highlight the trends in the Company's business that may be obscured by current year catastrophe losses and prior year development. Current year catastrophe losses cause the Company's loss trends to vary significantly between periods as a result of their frequency of occurrence and severity and can have a significant impact on the combined ratio. Prior year development is caused by unexpected loss development on historical reserves. The Company believes it is useful for investors to evaluate these components both separately and in the aggregate when reviewing the Company's performance. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is the combined ratio. The underlying combined ratio should not be considered as a substitute for the combined ratio and does not reflect the overall profitability of the Company's business.\n\n**Net loss and LAE excluding the effects of current year catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development (underlying loss and LAE)** is a non-GAAP measure that is computed by subtracting the effect of current year catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development from net loss and LAE. The Company uses underlying loss and LAE figures to analyze the Company's loss trends that may be impacted by current year catastrophe losses and prior year development on the Company's reserves. As discussed previously, these two items can have a significant impact on the Company's loss trends in a given period. The Company believes it is useful for investors to evaluate these components both separately and in the aggregate when reviewing the Company's performance. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is net loss and LAE. The underlying loss and LAE measure should not be considered a substitute for net loss and LAE and does not reflect the overall profitability of the Company's business.\n\n**Book value per common share, excluding the impact of accumulated other comprehensive loss (underlying book value per common share),** is a non-GAAP measure that is computed by dividing common stockholders' equity after excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), by total common shares outstanding plus dilutive potential common shares outstanding. The Company uses the trend in book value per common share, excluding the impact of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), in conjunction with book value per common share to identify and analyze the change in net worth attributable to management efforts between periods. The Company believes this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors because it eliminates the effect of interest rates that can fluctuate significantly from period to period and are generally driven by economic and financial factors that are not influenced by management. Book value per common share is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Book value per common share, excluding the impact of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), should not be considered a substitute for book value per common share and does not reflect the recorded net worth of the Company's business.\n\n**Discontinued Operations**\n\nOn May 9, 2024, the Company entered into the Sale Agreement with Forza Insurance Holdings, LLC (\"Forza\") in which ACIC will sell and Forza will acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding stock of the Company's subsidiary, IIC. In addition, on February 27, 2023, the Florida Department of Financial Services was appointed as receiver of the Company's former subsidiary, UPC. As such, prior year financial results and Consolidated Balance Sheet components have been reclassified to reflect continuing and discontinued operations appropriately.\n\n**_Forward-Looking Statements_**\n\n_Statements made in this press release, or on the conference call identified above, and otherwise, that are not historical facts are “forward-looking statements”. The Company believes these statements are based on reasonable estimates, assumptions and plans. However, if the estimates, assumptions, or plans underlying the forward-looking statements prove inaccurate or if other risks or uncertainties arise, actual results could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements. These statements are made subject to the safe-harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and may be identified by their use of words such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” \"endeavor,\" \"project,\" “believe,” \"plan,\" “anticipate,” “intend,” “could,” “would,” “estimate” or “continue” or the negative variations thereof or comparable terminology. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially may be found in the Company's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, in the “Risk Factors” section in the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and, except as required by applicable law, the Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements._\n\n**Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income**  \n---  \n _In thousands, except share and per share amounts_  \n**Three Months Ended**| **Nine Months Ended**  \n**September 30,**| **September 30,**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nREVENUE:  \nGross premiums written| $| 93,016| $| 93,986| $| 507,066| $| 507,449  \nChange in gross unearned premiums| 67,162| 63,791| (31,168)| (61,860)  \nGross premiums earned| 160,178| 157,777| 475,898| 445,589  \nCeded premiums earned| (85,692)| (107,513)| (275,400)| (232,670)  \nNet premiums earned| 74,486| 50,264| 200,498| 212,919  \nNet investment income| 6,110| 2,087| 15,474| 6,225  \nNet realized investment gains (losses)| (3)| 4| (124)| (6,787)  \nNet unrealized gains on equity securities| 1,543| 177| 1,542| 792  \nTotal revenues| $| 82,136| $| 52,532| $| 217,390| $| 213,149  \nEXPENSES:  \nLosses and loss adjustment expenses| 11,774| 9,822| 39,525| 39,968  \nPolicy acquisition costs| 20,942| 13,606| 44,476| 62,298  \nOperating expenses| 2,115| 2,081| 6,492| 6,962  \nGeneral and administrative expenses| 8,174| 6,011| 26,987| 21,036  \nInterest expense| 3,067| 2,718| 9,212| 8,156  \nTotal expenses| 46,072| 34,238| 126,692| 138,420  \nIncome before other income| 36,064| 18,294| 90,698| 74,729  \nOther income (loss)| 453| (237)| 2,074| 1,157  \nIncome before income taxes| 36,517| 18,057| 92,772| 75,886  \nProvision for income taxes| 8,848| 3,042| 22,321| 8,062  \nIncome from continuing operations, net of tax| $| 27,669| $| 15,015| $| 70,451| $| 67,824  \nIncome (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax| 450| (4,447)| 321| 227,803  \nNet income| $| 28,119| $| 10,568| $| 70,772| $| 295,627  \nOTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME:  \nChange in net unrealized gains (losses) on investments| 7,529| (2,761)| 7,404| (698)  \nReclassification adjustment for net realized investment losses (gains)| 3| (2)| 124| 6,806  \nIncome tax benefit related to items of other comprehensive income (loss)| —| —| —| —  \nTotal comprehensive income| $| 35,651| $| 7,805| $| 78,300| $| 301,735  \nWeighted average shares outstanding  \nBasic| 48,066,358| 43,301,388| 47,742,744| 43,220,084  \nDiluted| 49,521,246| 44,142,693| 49,255,071| 43,888,665  \nEarnings available to ACIC common stockholders per share  \nBasic  \nContinuing operations| $| 0.58| $| 0.34| $| 1.48| $| 1.57  \nDiscontinued operations| 0.01| (0.10)| 0.01| 5.27  \nTotal| $| 0.59| $| 0.24| $| 1.49| $| 6.84  \nDiluted  \nContinuing operations| $| 0.56| $| 0.34| $| 1.43| $| 1.54  \nDiscontinued operations| 0.01| (0.10)| 0.01| 5.19  \nTotal| $| 0.57| $| 0.24| $| 1.44| $| 6.73  \nDividends declared per share| $| —| $| —| $| —| $| —  \n**Consolidated Balance Sheets**  \n---  \n _In thousands, except share amounts_  \n**September 30, 2024**| **December 31, 2023**  \nASSETS  \nInvestments, at fair value:  \nFixed maturities, available-for-sale| $| 278,373| $| 138,387  \nEquity securities| 25,950| —  \nOther investments| 26,392| 16,487  \nTotal investments| $| 330,715| $| 154,874  \nCash and cash equivalents| 183,147| 138,930  \nRestricted cash| 57,251| 18,070  \nAccrued investment income| 3,359| 1,767  \nProperty and equipment, net| 7,300| 3,658  \nPremiums receivable, net| 18,630| 45,924  \nReinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid losses| 147,065| 340,820  \nCeded unearned premiums| 199,426| 155,301  \nGoodwill| 59,476| 59,476  \nDeferred policy acquisition costs| 43,166| 21,149  \nIntangible assets, net| 6,518| 8,548  \nOther assets| 13,284| 36,718  \nAssets held for sale| 74,537| 77,143  \nTotal Assets| $| 1,143,874| $| 1,062,378  \nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY  \nLiabilities:  \nUnpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses| $| 173,322| $| 347,738  \nUnearned premiums| 307,325| 276,157  \nReinsurance payable on premiums| 122,597| —  \nPayments outstanding| 4,479| 706  \nAccounts payable and accrued expenses| 75,525| 74,783  \nOperating lease liability| 23| 739  \nOther liabilities| 2,960| 672  \nNotes payable, net| 148,937| 148,688  \nLiabilities held for sale| 49,124| 44,130  \nTotal Liabilities| $| 884,292| $| 893,613  \nCommitments and contingencies  \nStockholders' Equity:  \nPreferred stock, $0.0001 par value;

PETERSBURG, Fla., Oct. 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- American Coastal Insurance Corporation (Nasdaq Ticker: ACIC) (“the Company”, “American Coastal” or “ACIC”) the insurance holding company of American Coastal Insurance Company (“AmCoastal”), announced estimated hurricane losses for the 2024 third and fourth quarters. The Company also expects to release its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, on Wednesday, November 6, 2024, after the close of the market, and will conduct its quarterly conference call at 5:00 p.m. ET.\n\n**2024 Third Quarter Update:**\n\nThe Company estimates net current accident quarter catastrophe losses incurred stemming from Hurricanes Debby and Helene in the third quarter of 2024 to be approximately $3.8 million, net of tax impacts. $2.4 million of this impact from Helene is retained by AmCoastal, with $1.4 million being retained by the Company’s captive reinsurance entity. The Company does not expect losses from Debby or Helene to reach the excess of loss layers of AmCoastal’s reinsurance program and expects to deliver positive net income for the third quarter of 2024.\n\n**2024 Fourth Quarter Update:**\n\nThe Company estimates net current accident quarter catastrophe losses incurred stemming from Hurricane Milton in the fourth quarter of 2024 to be approximately $16.2 million, net of tax impacts. $7.9 million of this impact from Milton is retained by AmCoastal, with $8.3 million being retained by the Company’s captive reinsurance entity. The Company also expects to incur approximately $13 million of reinstatement premiums that will be amortized as ceded premiums earned over the remaining eight month coverage period, from October 2024 through May 2025.\n\n“Hurricanes Helene and Milton were severe storms with devastating impact, and our primary focus is on servicing our policyholders. ACIC’s underwriting discipline and robust reinsurance program serve to protect AmCoastal’s balance sheet and reduce volatility from the active Atlantic hurricane season. We estimate a gross loss between $150 and $200 million from Milton, leaving 100 percent of AmCoastal’s $1.26 billion occurrence based reinsurance tower available for subsequent catastrophe events. With AmCoastal’s reinsurance tower fully intact and a lower $10.3 million retention on potential second and third events, net of tax impacts, the Company remains strongly positioned for the remainder of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, and is expected to remain profitable in the fourth quarter, despite Milton’s impact,” said Brad Martz, President of American Coastal.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Conference Call Details:**\n\nThe conference call will include live remarks followed by a question and answer (Q&A) session. Interested parties are invited to participate in the conference call and should dial-in 10 minutes before the conference call is scheduled to begin.\n\nWednesday, November 6, 2024 – 5:00 p.m. ET\n\nParticipant Dial-In Numbers:\n\nUnited States: 877-445-9755International: 201-493-6744\n\nTo listen to the conference call via webcast, please visit the Company [website](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=VrGmL1IWBsbA9bXeHZENXhIRzHYkyB7FCxS_qo2GciMHGUjpDWCTzsG49iV9ThPJY66EgOmAUH_B1wHf29n6ZDoRhx8w6nWYw_vT8PQnkn36KcbJCKPC6VvDhqErEG1N) and click on the webcast link at the top of the page or click [here](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ocZ2IeVkoXTa6LRXpyoPcGD-Hop6tMJSzzbjWZtcNY_fg6hA-r-XrIdOxm4muEUSj6fniALTYQhc92VAHCZC769smIgRf7ijGkqoTKTrOrfgjmUekcBYJhSRj4NxnEwQ-IifABvMqNPMUIQV_7kkmg==).
