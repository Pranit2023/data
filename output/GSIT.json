(Nasdaq: GSIT)**, developer of the Gemini® Associative Processing Unit (APU) for AI and high-performance parallel computing (HPPC) and a leading provider of high-performance memory solutions for the networking, telecommunications, and military markets, today announced its receipt of a Phase I SBIR contract in the 23.5 cohort by AFWERX. Under this contract, GSI Technology will perform a feasibility study to adapt, modify, and enhance its commercially proven Gemini® APU to propel Air and Space Force computing at the edge.\n\nGSI Technology is proud to announce its partnership with the United States Air and Space Force, embarking on a mission to explore high-performance edge processing. At the heart of this collaboration is the Gemini® APU, a dual-purpose compute-in-memory chip meticulously crafted to unleash the potential of various AI applications, including inference and high-performance computing workloads. While the APU is well suited for data center applications, its exceptional power efficiency will allow GSI to pursue this remarkable capability to the edge as well. Notably, the APU’s integral radiation tolerance, makes it an ideal solution for Space Force missions, where reliability is paramount. With this partnership, GSI Technology is driving the next generation of edge processing innovation, combining cutting-edge technology and unwavering dedication to delivering exceptional performance and resilience.\n\n\"We are honored to have been awarded this SBIR contract and look forward to collaborating with the United States Air and Space Force,\" said Lee-Lean Shu, Chairman and CEO of GSI Technology. \"We are confident that our expertise in high-performance computing and memory solutions, coupled with our Gemini® APU, will help address the challenges associated with processing at the edge.\"\n\nThis contract is a significant milestone for GSI Technology, further cementing its reputation as a reliable and innovative technology partner for the military and other government agencies. GSI Technology looks forward to continuing to deliver cutting-edge solutions that meet the unique needs of its customers.\n\n**ABOUT AFWERX**\n\nAFWERX is a [United States Air Force](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=145GVBGzj2YOng0N7y8S4aJFPEUSX2dRIU8fCBTMFZwfwa35zd-gqaz42XzlgGI1ckJ1h0wt37NHmt64-pHEV5OU10dk5Vc9wBzpH732lD0H5VDRsXAPteIZ-ZbrrJbOhu9anLv6EJ0clzm-aUcT0A==) program with the goal of fostering a culture of innovation within the service. Encompassing a number of programs supported with relatively small amounts of funding, the initiative is intended to circumvent bureaucracy and engage new entrepreneurs in Air Force programs. \n\n**ABOUT GSI TECHNOLOGY**\n\nFounded in 1995, GSI Technology, Inc. is a leading provider of semiconductor memory solutions. The Company recently launched radiation-hardened memory products for extreme environments in space and the Gemini® Associative Processing Unit (APU), a memory-centric design that delivers significant performance advantages for diverse AI applications. The Gemini APU architecture removes the I/O bottleneck between the processors and memory arrays by performing massive parallel searches directly in the memory array where data is stored. The novel architecture delivers performance-over-power ratio improvements compared to CPU, GPU, and DRAM for applications like image detection, speech recognition, e-commerce recommendation systems, and more. Gemini is an ideal solution for edge applications with a scalable format, small footprint, and low power consumption where rapid, accurate responses are critical.
