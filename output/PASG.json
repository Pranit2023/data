(Nasdaq: PASG), a clinical stage genetic medicines company focused on improving the lives of patients with neurodegenerative diseases, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 and provided recent business highlights.\n\n“This quarter, we’ve made important strides in advancing our PBFT02 gene therapy program,” said Will Chou, M.D., president and chief executive officer of Passage Bio. “Execution of our ongoing upliFT-D trial for FTD-_GRN_ remains our core priority, and we are pleased to share that 4 patients in Cohort 2 have been enrolled, with patient dosing progressing as planned. We remain on track to share 12-month Cohort 1 and interim Cohort 2 data in the first half of 2025, which will strengthen our understanding of the therapeutic potential of PBFT02. Furthermore, our presentations of preclinical and positive interim safety and biomarker data at key scientific conferences underscore the potential of PBFT02 to be a market leading progranulin-raising therapy. Our commitment to disciplined execution and a strong balance sheet strategically position us to achieve several key milestones over the coming quarters.”\n\n**Recent Highlights**\n\n  * **Sustained enrollment progress****in global Phase 1/2 upliFT-D trial of PBFT02 for the treatment of patients with****FTD-****_GRN_****:** The company has enrolled 4 patients in Cohort 2, which will continue to evaluate Dose 1 of PBFT02, and patient dosing is underway and advancing as planned. With this momentum, the company remains on track to report 12-month data from Cohort 1 and interim data from Cohort 2 in 1H25.\n  * **Presented encouraging interim data from Cohort 1 patients in upliFT-D trial of PBFT02 for FTD-****_GRN_****at the ISFTD2024 and CTAD conferences:** The company presented [updated safety and biomarker data](https://www.passagebio.com/investors-and-news/press-releases-and-statements/news-details/2024/Passage-Bio-to-Present-Positive-Interim-Data-from-Cohort-1-Patients-with-FTD-GRN-in-upliFT-D-Study-at-14thInternational-Conference-on-Frontotemporal-DementiasISFTD2024/default.aspx) from Cohort 1 patients in the upliFT-D trial during an oral presentation at the International Conference on Frontotemporal Dementias (ISFTD2024) conference in September and a poster session at the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer’s Disease conference (CTAD) in October. The data showed that PBFT02 produced consistent and durable increases in CSF PRGN expression in all treated Cohort 1 patients, with elevated levels maintained for up to one-year post-treatment. Furthermore, PBFT02 continued to exhibit a favorable safety profile in all patients who received the enhanced immunosuppression regimen, with no serious adverse events or clinically significant immune responses observed.\n  * **Presented preclinical and interim clinical data for PBFT02 in FTD-****_GRN_****at the ESGCT conference:** In October, the company delivered an oral presentation highlighting [preclinical data](https://www.passagebio.com/investors-and-news/press-releases-and-statements/news-details/2024/Passage-Bio-Presents-Preclinical-and-Interim-Clinical-Data-for-PBFT02-in-FTD-GRN-at-the-European-Society-of-Gene--Cell-Therapy-ESGCT-31st-Annual-Conference/default.aspx) for PBFT02 at the European Society of Gene & Cell Therapy (ESGCT) conference. The presentation reviewed the robust preclinical findings informing vector and dose selection and demonstrated the positive effects of elevating progranulin levels _in vivo._ Preclinical non-human primate (NHP) data found the AAV1 vector achieved superior human progranulin levels in the CSF compared to AAV5 and AAVhu68 (an AAV9 variant). Additionally, a dose escalation study in _Grn_ knockout mice showed that PBFT02 improved lysosomal histopathology and reduced neuroinflammation in brain regions impacted by FTD pathology with evidence suggesting that the greatest pathological benefit was associated with the highest PGRN levels in the CSF. An NHP biodistribution study also showed that intra-cisterna magna (ICM) administration of PBFT02 resulted in widespread vector distribution in the brain and spinal cord.\n  * **Appointed Tom Kassberg to the company’s board of directors** : In September, the company announced the appointment of Tom Kassberg, Chief Business Officer and Executive Vice President at Ultragenyx, to its board of directors and his appointment to the Audit Committee. Mr. Kassberg brings extensive experience in corporate development and strategic planning to the company, having successfully led multiple business development and alliance management initiatives that advanced late-stage gene therapies for rare diseases.\n\n\n\n**Anticipated Upcoming Milestones:**\n\n**FTD-****_GRN_**\n\n  * Report 12-month Cohort 1 and interim Cohort 2 data in 1H 2025\n  * Seek regulatory feedback on pivotal trial design in 2H 2025\n\n\n\n**FTD-****_C9orf72_**\n\n  * Initiate dosing of FTD-_C9orf72_ patients in 1H 2025\n\n\n\n**ALS**\n\n  * Obtain regulatory feedback on the pathway to treating amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients with PBFT02 in 2H 2024\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * **Cash Position:** Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $84.8 million as of September 30, 2024, as compared to $132.8 million as of September 30, 2023. The company expects current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, together with the remaining initial payments from our out-licensing agreements with GEMMA Biotherapeutics, to fund operations to the end of Q2 2026.\n  * **Research and Development (R &D) Expenses: **R&D expenses were $8.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $15.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n  * **General and Administrative (G &A) Expenses**: G&A expenses were $7.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $8.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n  * **Net Loss** : Net loss was $19.3 million, or $0.31 per basic and diluted share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a net loss of $27.1 million, or $0.49 per basic and diluted share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n\n\n\n**About Passage Bio**\n\nPassage Bio (Nasdaq: PASG) is a clinical stage genetic medicines company on a mission to improve the lives of patients with neurodegenerative diseases.

(Nasdaq: PASG), a clinical stage genetic medicines company focused on improving the lives of patients with neurodegenerative diseases, today announced the company delivered preclinical and interim clinical data as part of an oral presentation at the European Society of Gene & Cell Therapy (ESGCT) 31st Annual Congress being held October 22-25, 2024, in Rome, Italy.\n\n**Details of the oral presentation are below:**\n\n**Abstract Title:**|  Non-clinical and early clinical development of PBFT02, an AAV gene therapy for frontotemporal dementia with _GRN_ mutations (FTD-_GRN_)  \n---|---  \n**Session:**|  7d: CNS gene therapy  \n**Date & Time**:| Thursday, October 24 from 9:00 a.m.-11:00 a.m. CEST (3:00 a.m.-5:00 a.m. ET)  \n**Presenter:**|  Sue Browne, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer  \n  \nToday's oral presentation at ESGCT outlined the robust preclinical data generated in the development of PBFT02, including studies that informed vector and dose selection and demonstrated the positive effects of elevating progranulin levels _in vivo_. Additionally, the presentation highlighted interim safety and biomarker data from the upliFT-D clinical trial, which validate the preclinical findings and position PBFT02 as a potential best-in-class progranulin-raising therapy.\n\n“We are excited to share a detailed overview of the preclinical studies that support our PBFT02 program and informed our clinical development strategy,” said Will Chou, M.D., president and chief executive officer of Passage Bio. “These strong preclinical results gave us confidence in choosing the AAV1 vector and ICM administration as a differentiated approach to administer our gene therapy to patients in our ongoing upliFT-D clinical study. It’s also encouraging to see these preclinical findings translate into the clinic, with interim PBFT02 data demonstrating a well-tolerated safety profile and consistent, durable increases in CSF progranulin levels. We remain committed to advancing PBFT02 in FTD and look forward to exploring its therapeutic potential in additional neurodegenerative diseases that could benefit from elevated progranulin levels.”\n\n**Data Summary**\n\n  * Capsid comparison study in non-human primates (NHPs) showed the AAV1 vector achieved superior human PGRN levels in the CSF as compared to AAV5 and AAVhu68 (an AAV9 variant) following intra-cisterna magna (ICM) administration\n  * Dose escalation study in _Grn_ knockout mice showed PBFT02 improved lysosomal histopathology and reduced neuroinflammation throughout the brain following intra-CSF delivery, including evidence suggesting that higher levels of PGRN may provide additional benefits\n  * NHP biodistribution study showed ICM administration of PBFT02 achieved high levels of gene distribution throughout the nervous system, including vector delivery to the cortical and sub-cortical brain regions affected in FTD, and to the spinal cord\n  * PBFT02 was well tolerated in NHPs, and ICM administration resulted in dose-dependent PGRN elevations in NHP CSF\n  * Interim safety and biomarker data from the upliFT-D clinical study demonstrated that Dose 1 of PBFT02 was generally well-tolerated after ICM administration and led to consistent, durable increases in levels of CSF progranulin in all treated Cohort 1 patients, with elevated CSF progranulin levels sustained up to 12 months post-administration\n\n\n\nAdditional details on the meeting can be found at the [ESGCT 31st Annual Congress website](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=3sPEmMh0tXIoZaS7er13ktlcRTJW0i4XBuM26I30CPHN1wFDVrA2hCAb32jAhqkgrkBd169LGEilVpEavEMxfPB2u5F6SAjuPzL04GHAn0-HVGWc2q5rNFDsPTDrZz4H), and a copy of the oral presentation deck will be available on the Investor [Events and Presentations](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=lZSnXzXqfRo95TWg3zszGx5DA30XTb81KDEcYMot79wp-8U-mwhHtlZWRck3bVhN_0aUm_zBqPet8Bs-pbJFMT-le3IAqQW6yXdz8nNWmc13Qt8XCSqs_SbN6WUW8lhMKDAYZHZ38cW177klTSZgyXihsj6EMAcmS_OY9MEZjg_jkNQjxwHHYfnl9cMbYxx9) page of the Passage Bio corporate website.\n\n**About PBFT02**\n\nPBFT02 utilizes an AAV1 viral vector to deliver, through ICM administration, a functional  _GRN_ gene that encodes for PGRN. This vector construct and delivery approach aim to elevate PGRN levels in the central nervous system to alter the course of neurodegenerative diseases. Interim clinical data from the upliFT-D Phase 1/2 study in FTD-_GRN_ participants shows that ICM administration of PBFT02 resulted in robust PGRN elevations in the CSF.\n\nThe potential clinical benefit of PBFT02 is supported by extensive preclinical studies. In non-human primates, a single ICM administration of PBFT02 led to broad vector distribution throughout the CNS, and robust, dose-dependent elevations in PGRN levels in CSF. An NHP study also demonstrated that AAV1 was particularly proficient at transducing ependymal cells. In a murine FTD model, PBFT02 administration improved lysosomal function and reduced neuroinflammation.\n\n**About Passage Bio**\n\nPassage Bio (Nasdaq: PASG) is a clinical stage genetic medicines company on a mission to improve the lives of patients with neurodegenerative diseases.

Business\nOverview\nWe are a clinical stage genetic medicines company on a mission to improve the lives of patients with\nneurodegenerative diseases. Our primary focus is the development and advancement of cutting-edge, one-time\ngene therapies designed to target the underlying pathology of these conditions. We believe we have developed a\ndifferentiated approach to developing treatments for central nervous system, or CNS, disorders that allows us to\nselect and advance product candidates with a higher probability of technical and regulatory success.\nOur lead clinical product candidate, PBFT02, seeks to elevate progranulin levels to restore lysosomal function\nand slow disease progression across a variety of neurodegenerative diseases. PBFT02 utilizes an adeno-associated\nvirus, or AAV1, capsid to deliver a functional granulin gene, or GRN, encoding progranulin, or PGRN, to the\nbrain via intra cisterna magna, or ICM, administration. The lead indication for PBFT02 is frontotemporal dementia,\nor FTD, caused by progranulin deficiency, or FTD-GRN. We believe this clinical product candidate has the potential\nto provide patients with significantly improved outcomes given the rigorous capsid and transgene selection process, and\nour chosen route of ICM administration, which provides the potential for enhanced benefits due to widespread vector\ndelivery to the brain and spinal cord and an improved safety profile compared with systemic administration due to the\nlower doses required.\nWe are currently studying PBFT02 in FTD-GRN, for which there are currently no approved disease-modifying therapies.\nIn addition to the continued clinical development of PBFT02 to treat FTD-GRN, we intend to pursue PBFT02 in\nadditional adult neurodegenerative diseases where we believe increasing PGRN levels could provide benefit. Third-party\npreclinical studies have shown that increased PGRN levels reduce the pathologic accumulation of TAR DNA binding\nprotein 43, or TDP-43. TDP-43 pathology is a hallmark of multiple neurodegenerative conditions, including FTD due to\nmutations in the C9orf72 gene, or FTD-C9orf72, approximately 95% of sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS,\nand approximately 50% of sporadic FTD. Additionally, we believe restoration of PGRN has the potential to modulate\nAlzheimer’s disease, or AD, in patients that are carriers of the GRN rs5848 single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP.\nIndividuals with this polymorphism have reduced PGRN levels and are at an increased risk for AD. In the second half of\n2024, we expect to obtain regulatory feedback on the clinical pathway to treating FTD-C9orf72 and ALS patients with\nPBFT02.\nWe have a research collaboration with the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania’s, or Penn’s, Gene Therapy\nProgram, or GTP, headed by Dr. James Wilson, a leader in the genetic medicines field. Our research collaboration with\nGTP provides us with access to one of the premier research institutions in the world for the discovery and\npreclinical development of genetic medicine product candidates. We are purposefully focusing on neurodegenerative\ndiseases for which we believe our genetic medicine approach provides distinct technical advantages based on decades of\nresearch by GTP. GTP conducts rigorous discovery and preclinical studies to identify promising product candidates.\nUnder our research collaboration, we have exclusive development and global commercial rights to product candidates\nfor certain rare monogenic and certain non-rare, non-monogenic, or large, CNS disorders, subject to certain\nlimitations. We also have access to platform technologies related to development of novel capsids, toxicity reduction\ntechnologies, and optimization approaches for delivery and formulation for product candidates in the CNS indications\nthat we select. We have progressed four product candidates sourced from our research collaboration with GTP to\nthe clinical stage of development and have eight remaining options to license additional programs from GTP until\nAugust 2026.\nIn December 2023, we announced updated strategic priorities, which include: continuing clinical development of\nPBFT02 to treat FTD-GRN; pursuing PBFT02 in additional adult neurodegenerative diseases, including FTD-C9orf72,\nALS and AD; continuing the Huntington’s disease preclinical program being executed through our collaboration with\nGTP; and pursuing potential out-licensing opportunities for clinical-stage pediatric programs in GM1 gangliosidosis, or\nGM1, Krabbe disease, and metachromatic leukodystrophy, or MLD.\n6\nOur pipeline\nWe have assembled a portfolio of gene therapy product candidates with the potential to address multiple\nneurodegenerative diseases. Our development programs consist of:\n* 8 additional CNS pipeline license options remain; 3 license options were previously exercised, and rights were subsequently returned to the University of Pennsylvania.\n† US/EU prevalence per third-party sources\nPBFT02 for the treatment of FTD-GRN\nWe are currently developing PBFT02, which utilizes an AAV1 capsid to deliver a functional copy of GRN encoding for\nPGRN, for the treatment of FTD-GRN. FTD-GRN is an inheritable form of FTD in which patients have mutations in the\nGRN gene, causing a deficiency in PGRN. PGRN is a complex and highly conserved protein thought to have multiple\nroles in cell homeostasis, neurodevelopment, and inflammation. Evidence suggests that PGRN deficiency in FTD and\nother neurodegenerative disorders may contribute to lysosomal dysfunction.\nCurrently, there are no disease-modifying therapies approved for the treatment of FTD-GRN. Based on findings in\npreclinical studies, we believe that PBFT02 may provide FTD-GRN patients with significantly improved outcomes. We\nselected the AAV1 capsid and ICM administration for PBFT02 because this approach led to extensive and robust\nexpression of human PGRN throughout the brain and spinal cord of non-human primates, or NHPs, and due to the higher\nPGRN levels in cerebral spinal fluid, or CSF, achieved using AAV1 as compared with other serotypes tested. ICM\nadministration of AAV1 to NHPs resulted in supraphysiologic CSF levels of human PGRN when compared with CSF\nlevels in healthy human subjects, and in excess of levels achieved in NHPs with AAVhu68 or AAV5. We have an active\nIND from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and approved clinical trial authorizations, or CTAs, in\nmultiple countries for PBFT02. We are conducting our upliFT-D trial, an international, multi-center, open-label, single-\narm Phase 1/2 clinical trial of PBFT02 in patients with a diagnosis of symptomatic FTD-GRN.\nWe reported initial safety and biomarker data from three patients in Cohort 1 of our upliFT-D trial in December of 2023.\nIn this trial, Dose 1 of PBFT02 treatment resulted in supraphysiologic levels of CSF PGRN with concentrations ranging\nfrom 10.7 to 17.3 ng/mL at 30 days post-treatment (n=3), exceeding the range found in healthy adult controls of 3.3 to\n8.2 ng/mL (n=61). In the first patient to reach 6-months post PBFT02 administration, CSF PGRN remained at\nsupraphysiologic levels with a concentration of 27.3 ng/mL. By contrast, following PBFT02 treatment plasma PGRN\nlevels were unaltered, remaining similar to baseline concentrations and below levels found in healthy adult controls\nthroughout the available follow-up period across all three patients.\nAs previously reported, Patient 1, who received a low level of immunosuppression (60 mg oral prednisone daily for 60\ndays), per the initial trial protocol, experienced two serious adverse events, or SAEs, that were both asymptomatic and\n7\nlikely consistent with an immune response. Following Patient 1, the protocol was amended to increase the steroid\nregimen. Dose 1 of PBFT02 was generally well-tolerated in patients 2 and 3, who received an enhanced steroid regimen\n(1,000 mg IV methylprednisolone on days 1-3 followed by 60 mg oral prednisone for 60 days). In these two patients, no\nSAEs were reported, all treatment emergent adverse events, or AEs, were mild to moderate in severity, and there was no\nevidence of a clinically significant immune response, hepatotoxicity, or safety-related imaging findings in either patient.\nIn all three patients, there was no evidence of dorsal root ganglion toxicity, as measured by nerve conduction studies,\nand no complications were observed related to the intra-cisterna magna administration procedure. We intend to treat two\nadditional patients at Dose 1 in Cohort 1, with no required delay between these patients, to further study the safety and\npharmacodynamic effects of PBFT02 at this dose.\nWe expect to initiate dosing of Cohort 2 FTD-GRN patients in the upliFT-D trial in the first half of 2024, report six-\nmonth safety and biomarker data from Cohort 1 patients in the second half of 2024, and report 12-month follow-up data\nfrom Cohort 1 patients and initial safety and biomarker data from Cohort 2 patients in the first half of 2025.\nThe FDA has granted Orphan Drug Designation, or ODD, and Fast Track Designation to PBFT02 for the treatment of\nFTD-GRN and the European Commission granted Orphan designation for PBFT02.\nPBFT02 for the treatment of FTD-C9orf72 and ALS\nWe intend to pursue PBFT02 in additional adult neurodegenerative diseases where we believe supraphysiologic PGRN\nlevels could provide benefit. This approach stems from PGRN’s pleiotropic cellular effects including the regulation of\nmicroglial activation and lysosomal function, and in particular its potential to ameliorate TDP-43 pathology. TDP-43 is a\nribonucleic acid / deoxyribonucleic acid, or RNA/DNA, binding protein that normally resides in the nucleus where it\nregulates gene expression, RNA splicing, RNA trafficking, and mRNA turnover. Cytoplasmic TDP-43 pathology is a\nhallmark of multiple neurodegenerative conditions including FTD-GRN, FTD-C9orf72, approximately 95% of sporadic\nALS, and approximately 50% of sporadic FTD. In these disorders, hyperphosphorylated TDP-43 accumulates in the\ncytoplasm of cell bodies and dendritic processes of neurons and glia, suggesting that loss of TDP-43's normal nuclear\nfunction contributes to the neurodegenerative process.\nThe potential for benefit of increased PGRN in disorders with TDP-43 pathology has been demonstrated by third-party\npreclinical studies in mice and zebrafish which showed that increased PGRN levels reduced TDP-43 pathology and\nassociated toxicities. We anticipate that elevating neuronal PGRN levels in diseases with TDP-43 pathology may\nprovide significant benefits to patients.\nWe expect to obtain regulatory feedback on the clinical pathway to treating FTD-C9orf72 and ALS patients with\nPBFT02 in the second half of 2024.\nPBFT02 for the treatment of AD\nWe believe that elevating PGRN levels has the potential to improve the course of AD in patients who carry the GRN\nrs5848 single nucleotide polymorphism, or GRN SNP. The GRN SNP is associated with reduced PGRN levels and is\npresent within approximately 30% of the population. Its presence has been shown to confer an increased risk for AD\nonset. Within symptomatic AD patients, GRN SNP carriers not only have lower levels of PGRN, but also higher levels\nof CSF tau, which correlates with increased AD pathology in the brain and more rapid disease progression. Third party\npreclinical studies in animal models have demonstrated that low levels of PGRN may exacerbate AD pathology and,\nconversely, high levels of PGRN may reduce AD pathology.\nWe plan to initiate preclinical studies in AD to extend these initial observations.\nOther Clinical Product Candidates\nWe have three additional clinical product candidates, PBGM01, PBKR03 and PBML04. In order to reduce operating\nexpenses, we have stopped further clinical development and are pursuing out-licensing opportunities for these product\ncandidates.\n8\nPBGM01\nPBGM01 utilizes a proprietary, next-generation AAVhu68 capsid to deliver to the brain and peripheral tissues a\nfunctional GLB1 gene encoding β-galactosidase (or β-gal) for infantile GM1. Infantile GM1 is the most common and\nsevere form of GM1, in which patients have mutations in the GLB1 gene that produce little or no residual β-gal enzyme\nactivity. β-gal is an enzyme that catalyzes the first step in the natural degradation of GM1 ganglioside as well as other\nglycan substrates. Reduced β-gal activity results in the accumulation of toxic levels of GM1 ganglioside in neurons\nthroughout the brain, causing rapidly progressive neurodegeneration, with a life expectancy of two to ten years.\nCurrently, there are no disease-modifying therapies approved for the treatment of GM1. Early onset infantile GM1 is\ncharacterized by onset in the first 6 months of life, while late onset infantile GM1 is characterized by onset between 6\nand 24 months.\nWe have an active IND from the FDA and approved CTAs in multiple countries for PBGM01 to support our Imagine-1\ntrial, a two-part international, multi-center, open-label, single-arm Phase 1/2 clinical trial of PBGM01 in patients with a\ndiagnosis of early and late infantile GM1.\nPart 1 of the Imagine-1 trial is a dose escalation study exploring three doses of PBGM01 in six cohorts of GM1 patients,\nthree with early infantile GM1 and three with late infantile GM1, and is currently ongoing. We have completed dosing of\nthe initial two dose levels, cohorts 1 to 4, and began dosing of our third and highest dose level in the fifth cohort, for late\ninfantile GM1, and sixth cohort, for early infantile GM1. To date, the safety data showed that PBGM01 was well\ntolerated with no SAEs related to study treatment and no evidence of dorsal root ganglion toxicity or complications\nrelated to the ICM injection. In both, early and late infantile GM1 patients, we observed a dose-dependent increase in β-\ngal activity in the CSF coupled with a dose-dependent decrease in CSF levels of GM1 ganglioside. Furthermore, at the\nsecond dose level, GM1 ganglioside achieved normal adult levels at one-year post-dose.\nIn December 2023, we announced that we have paused enrollment of additional patients into the Imagine-1 trial and that\nwe are pursuing potential out-licensing opportunities for this asset.\nPBKR03\nPBKR03 utilizes a proprietary, next-generation AAVhu68 capsid to deliver to the brain and peripheral tissues a\nfunctional GALC gene encoding the hydrolytic enzyme galactosylceramidase to treat Krabbe disease. Krabbe disease is\nan autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease caused by mutations in the GALC gene, which provides instructions\nfor making an enzyme called galactosylceramidase, which breaks down certain fats, including galactosylceramide and\npsychosine. This results in the accumulation of galactolipids such as psychosine, resulting in widespread death of\nmyelin-producing cells in the CNS and in the peripheral nervous system, or PNS. We currently have an active IND from\nthe FDA. Our GALax-C trial, an international, multi-center, open-label, single-arm Phase 1/2 clinical trial of PBKR03 in\npatients with a diagnosis of infantile Krabbe disease, was terminated and we have stopped further clinical development\nof PBKR03, in order to reduce operating expenses, and are pursuing potential out-licensing opportunities for this asset.\nPBML04\nPBML04 utilizes a proprietary, next-generation AAVhu68 capsid to deliver to the brain and peripheral tissues a\nfunctional arylsulfatase A gene, or ARSA, encoding the ARSA enzyme, to treat Metachromatic Leukodystrophy, or\nMLD. MLD is a rare, autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease caused by mutations in the ARSA gene, resulting in\nlittle or no functional activity of the ARSA enzyme, which is essential for the degradation of sphingolipid cerebroside-3-\nsulfate, or sulfatide. When the ARSA enzyme is lacking, sulfatides accumulate in lysosomal storage deposits in\nmicroglia, oligodendrocytes, and Schwann cells, leading to widespread demyelination. Our preclinical data in ARSA-/-\nmice and in NHPs support the ability of PBML04 administration into CSF to result in dose-dependent increases in brain\nand CSF levels of functional human ARSA enzyme, leading to improved biochemical, histopathological, behavioral, and\nsurvival endpoints, and with no safety or toxicity signs up to the highest tested dose in NHPs. In April 2022, we\nsubmitted an IND for PBML04 to support clinical development in MLD. On May 20, 2022, the FDA cleared our IND\napplication for PBML04, which supports PBML04-001, a multi-center, open-label, single-arm clinical trial of PBML04\n9\nin patients with a diagnosis of late onset infantile MLD. We have not initiated clinical development of PBML04, in order\nto reduce operating expenses, and are pursuing potential out-licensing opportunities for this asset.\nResearch Programs\nWe have one unnamed preclinical research program through our license agreement with GTP, which is exploring\nmultiple potential treatment targets for Huntington’s disease.\nBeyond this program, through our research collaboration with GTP, we also have the option to license programs for\neight additional new indications in CNS diseases along with certain rights and licenses to new gene therapy technologies\ndeveloped by GTP, such as novel capsids, toxicity reduction technologies, and approaches to optimize delivery and\nformulation.\nOther Research Programs\nWe have a preclinical research program, PBAL05, under our license agreement with Penn for patients with ALS who\nhave a gain-of-function mutation in the C9orf72 gene. We also have a program under our exploratory research program\nwith GTP for Temporal Lobe Epilepsy, or TLE. In order to reduce operating expenses, we have paused development of\nboth of these programs.\nOur Strategy\nWe are a genetic medicines company on a mission to improve the lives of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. Our\nprimary focus is the development and advancement of cutting-edge, one-time therapies designed to target the underlying\npathology of these conditions.\nTo achieve our vision, we have assembled a world-class team whose members have decades of collective\nexperience in drug development and commercialization. We leverage this experience as we strive to develop\ntreatments that benefit patients with neurodegenerative conditions and their families. Patients are considered in every\ndecision we make.\nKey elements of our strategy include:\n• Focus on neurodegenerative indications for which we can have a transformative impact on patients’\nlives. We believe that genetic medicines have the potential to significantly change the course of\nneurodegenerative diseases and to transform patients’ lives, by providing patients with one-time disease\nmodifying treatments for life-threatening conditions with limited or no approved treatment options.\n• Advance PBFT02 for the treatment of FTD-GRN. Based on the initial clinical data for PBFT02 in FTD-\nGRN, we are prioritizing the execution of the ongoing upliFT-D study, with the goal of advancing this program\nto the registrational phase. We believe this clinical product candidate has the potential to provide patients with\nsignificantly improved outcomes, given our initial observations of supraphysiologic CSF PGRN levels in\npatients after PBFT02 administration and the improvements in pathology seen in preclinical studies at these\nPGRN levels.\n• Broaden the application of PBFT02 by exploring its potential in additional neurodegenerative\nindications. Based on initial clinical data for PBFT02 in FTD-GRN and evidence supporting progranulin’s role\nin neurodegeneration, we are exploring the therapeutic potential of PBFT02 in multiple diseases, including\nFTD-C9orf72, ALS and AD. We believe that our differentiated approach of advancing one genetic medicine\ncandidate to treat multiple indications is a cost-effective strategy due to shared research and development costs,\nstreamlined regulatory processes, and the opportunity for diversified revenue streams.\n• Extend existing and establish new relationships with patients and patient advocacy groups. Patients\nare at the core of what we do. We have been engaging with patients, their families, and their advocacy\n10\ngroups since our inception and have acquired an intimate understanding of how we can positively impact\ntheir lives. These relationships deeply inform us as we develop and ultimately seek to commercialize our\nproduct candidates. We also have agreements with third-party providers to offer genetic testing and\ncounseling to adults who have been diagnosed with FTD at no cost to the patient.\n• Continue to leverage our robust manufacturing capabilities. We believe the quality, reliability and\nscalability of our genetic medicine manufacturing techniques and know-how will be a critical advantage\nto our long-term success. We have established robust in-house analytical and process development\noperations to support ongoing and future manufacturing operations. We have also advanced our\nmanufacturing and testing technology platforms and our in-house laboratory is equipped with state-of-\nthe-art analytical capabilities for assay development and validation, clinical product testing, and process\nand product development to support viral vector manufacturing. We also have the internal manufacturing\nand quality expertise to oversee external manufacturing and supply chain operations provided by third\nparty strategic relationships, such as Catalent Maryland, a unit of Catalent, Inc., or Catalent. We believe\nCatalent is capable of producing enough supplies to support our planned clinical trials and initial commercial\nlaunch of our current clinical product candidate, if approved.\n• Continue to leverage our existing collaboration with GTP and selectively enter into new discovery\nrelationships with premier research institutions. We will continue to leverage our well-established\nrelationship with GTP and explore other potential collaborations to build or advance our pipeline,\ncontingent on the prioritization of operating expenses. We will look to nurture our genetic medicine\ntechnology capabilities by keeping abreast of advances in next-generation capsid development, promoter\nselection, transgene design, gene silencing and gene editing, which will help us to engineer optimal\nproduct profiles to address life-threating CNS disorders.\nGenetic Medicine Background\nEach person’s genetic material, or genome, consists of DNA in sequences of genetic code called genes. The DNA in the\nhuman genome contains approximately three billion nucleotide base pairs, and small changes, or mutations, routinely\noccur in the base pairs. A mutation in a single gene can alter the amount or activity of the protein expressed by the gene,\ncausing deformities and disease. Currently, there are estimated to be over 10,000 diseases caused by a genetic\nabnormality in a single gene, which are also known as monogenic diseases. One gene therapy approach is to introduce\ninto cells a new, fully functional version of a defective or missing gene. This approach is the basis for our FTD-GRN\nprogram. In addition, gene therapy can also be applied to correct dysfunctional biological pathways that are not\nnecessarily inherited or associated with one defective gene. This approach aims to reduce the expression of pathological\nproteins or increase the production of corrective biological targets. This is the basis for our programs that target\nconditions such as FTD-C9orf72, ALS, and AD.\nThe development of molecular therapeutics to modulate human gene expression and correct disease-causing genetic\ndefects had its advent several decades ago, and with advances in science and a deeper understanding of human genetics\nit has expanded to include a broad range of genetic medicines with the potential to modulate gene expression through\ndiverse molecular mechanisms.\nThese transformative genetic medicines include gene therapy (delivery of an external gene to replace the normal\nfunction of a defective gene), gene silencing (delivery of a DNA or RNA-based therapeutic that modulates the\ntranscription or translation of an injurious gene product), gene editing (delivery of a DNA or RNA-based therapeutic that\ncorrects the expression of targeted genes) and combinations of these therapeutic modalities. We believe that this\nexpanded molecular biological tool box will provide new therapeutics with the potential to deliver highly potent and safe\ninterventions across a diverse set of CNS diseases, offering several advantages, including:\n• Potential to treat most diseases of genetic etiology. Theoretically, it should be possible to design and\ndeliver a genetic medicine to correct the expression of any human protein whose presence, absence or\nactivity causes disease.\n• Potential to target mechanisms that have not been effectively or safely modulated by traditional\nsmall molecule or protein-based therapeutics. The inherent specificity of genetic medicines for unique\n11\nnucleic acid sequences can provide a high therapeutic index resulting from high potency and the potential\nto deliver adequate doses while avoiding off-target safety liabilities.\n• Efficient delivery of transformative therapeutics. Because genetic medicines are designed to deliver a\nlong-standing effect following a single administration, a single dose of these therapeutics has the\npotential to provide clinical benefits for many years.\nGenetic medicines can be designed to mitigate challenges faced by other approaches in the development of\ntherapeutics for the CNS. CNS disorders are among the most devastating in their impact on patients and their\nfamilies. These disorders are generally life-threatening to patients. There is a significant need for genetic\nmedicines that can target these disorders. Our lead clinical program, upliFT-D, is focused on a rare, monogenic\nCNS disorder, FTD-GRN, because it offers a compelling opportunity for the effective application of a genetic\nmedicine, by correcting the progranulin deficiency that results from disease-causing mutations in the GRN gene.\nWe are also exploring the potential for our progranulin gene therapy candidate, PBFT02, to target other degenerative\ndisorders, such as FTD-C9orf72, ALS, and AD, where increasing progranulin levels in the central nervous system could\nprovide benefit.\nOur Approach\nThe field of genetic medicine is rapidly expanding and we believe we have developed a differentiated approach to\ndeveloping treatments for CNS disorders that allows us to select and advance product candidates with a higher-\nprobability of technical and regulatory success. Our gene therapy product candidates use AAV, a small, non-\npathogenic virus that is genetically engineered to function as a delivery vehicle, or vector. In our current clinical\nprograms, the AAV is administered to a patient to introduce a healthy copy of a gene, or the transgene, to the\ncells in a process referred to as transduction. Our current approaches use AAVs to deliver a wild type transgene to\neither (i) restore expression of a fully functional version of a mutated gene or to (ii) overexpress a gene product. The\ncomponents of an AAV gene therapy vector include the therapeutic gene that makes up the DNA payload, or the\ntransgene, the outer viral shell that encloses the DNA payload, or the capsid, and any promotors added to the\nvector to boost expression of the transgene. The AAV is often described by the serotype, or strain, of the vector.\nThe core tenets of our approach include a rigorous process for selecting product candidates, mitigation of early\ndevelopment risk through relationships with leading researchers and academic institutions, and mitigation of\nclinical development risk through deep relationships with patient advocacy groups, key opinion leaders and\npractitioners. Together, these relationships allow us to directly benefit from decades of collective experience, the\nlatest technologies and contemporary perspectives from patients.\nIn selecting our product candidates, we are focusing initially on optimizing transduction and expression of\ntransgenes in the indication-specific target tissues. This involves prioritizing the following principles: selection of\nthe route of administration to maximize transgene biodistribution; selection of capsid, transgene and promoter to\noptimize efficiency of transduction and expression; leveraging biological mechanisms such as cross-correction to\nmaximize availability of transgene product to target cells; and the effective use of biomarkers to assess treatment\neffects on transduction, transgene expression and on disease pathophysiology.\n• Optimal route of administration: Identifying the optimal route of administration for AAV gene therapy\nis critical to achieving safe and effective levels of transgene expression in the targeted location in the\nCNS. The optimal route of administration for CNS treatments should also leverage the immuno-\nprivileged aspects of the CNS to reduce the potential for deleterious effects of neutralizing antibodies, or\nNAbs, on the biodistribution of AAV capsids. We evaluate preclinical study outcomes and other data to\ndecide the preferred route of administration on a program-by-program basis. For our clinical stage product\ncandidates, we believe that ICM administration is the optimal route of administration as compared to\nother potential delivery mechanisms due to its potential to provide widespread biodistribution to the brain\nand spinal cord. Further, when compared with systemic and other intra-thecal administration routes, we can\nachieve comparable protein expression at lower dosages, and thereby also lower the potential for toxicities.\nThe potential for an impact from NAbs is also reduced.\n12\n• Capsid, transgene, and promoter selection: For each clinical program, we conduct rigorous studies to\nselect the capsid, transgene, and promoter to use for our product candidate. We identify the optimal AAV\ngene therapy for each of our indications depending on the target indication, our goal of CNS and/or PNS\ntransduction, and the target brain regions and cell types. Typically, we compare multiple capsids in NHPs\nto identify the capsid best suited for each program.\n• Cross-correction: Our existing clinical-stage product candidate exploits the cross-correction mechanism\nby which secreted gene product from transduced cells is taken up by non-transduced neurons. We believe\nthis cross-correction mechanism can help overcome the limits of vector biodistribution and CNS\ntransduction inefficiency that are characteristic of other genetic medicine approaches, and will ultimately\ndrive clinical benefit.\n• Effective use of biomarkers: Our development program targets must have measurable, predictive\nbiomarkers to inform early and efficient clinical development decisions. These include biomarkers to\nconfirm achievement of target levels of transduction and gene expression, one or more downstream\npharmacodynamic biomarkers to demonstrate positive functional effects on pathways involved in disease\netiology, and disease activity and progression biomarkers to demonstrate effects on disease course.\nWe have a strategic research collaboration with GTP, which provides us with access to differentiated discovery\ntechnology and expertise and informs the basis of our product candidate selections and subsequent development.\nOur collaboration with GTP allows us to choose programs that have been, or will be, validated through extensive\ntesting in preclinical disease models. Once selected, we collaborate with GTP on further preclinical optimization\nof our product candidates, to optimize aspects including vector choice, transgene construct and route of\nadministration. We typically evaluate in NHPs the transduction efficiency and biodistribution of diverse capsids\nto select the capsid best suited for the targeted indication. GTP also works to optimize the delivery approach for\neach product candidate by balancing biodistribution, efficacy, safety, host immunity, and ease of administration.\nWe believe that the gene therapy preclinical expertise provided by GTP, including the use of NHP models for\nvector screening and toxicology, improves the probability of technical and regulatory success for our\ncollaborative pipeline programs.\nOur Product Candidates – PBFT02\nWe are currently developing PBFT02, which utilizes an AAV1 capsid to deliver a functional copy of GRN\nencoding for PGRN for the treatment of FTD-GRN. We also intend to pursue PBFT02 in additional adult\nneurodegenerative diseases where we believe increased PGRN levels could provide benefit.\nPBFT02 for the treatment of FTD-GRN\nFTD is one of the more common causes of early-onset dementia, occurring in patients with a median age of 55 years.\nFTD presents as a rapidly progressive clinical syndrome and causes impairment in behavior, language, and executive\nfunction. Changes in personal and social conduct occur in early stages of the disease, including loss of inhibition, apathy,\nsocial withdrawal, hyperorality and ritualistic compulsive behaviors. These symptoms are severely disabling and may\nlead to misdiagnosis as a psychological or emotionally based problem, or, in the elderly, be mistaken for withdrawal or\neccentricity. FTD progresses to immobility and loss of speech and expression. Survival averages eight years after onset\nof symptoms.\nIn approximately 5% to 10% of individuals with FTD, the disease is caused by mutations in the GRN gene,\ncausing a deficiency of progranulin. PGRN is a complex and highly conserved protein that binds to multiple cell\nmembrane receptors to generate diverse intracellular effects, including anti-inflammatory effects, growth factor and\nregenerative activity, and importantly, improvement in lysosomal activity. In FTD-GRN, PGRN deficiency leads to\nlysosomal and microglial dysfunction, TDP-43 pathology, and ultimately neurodegeneration.\nThere are no disease modifying therapies approved for the treatment of FTD. Anti-depressants have been shown\nto manage some behavioral symptoms. Based on third-party data analytics and available literature, we estimate\nthe prevalence of FTD-GRN deficiency in the United States and Europe is approximately 18,000.\n13\nIndication selection\nThe development of PBFT02 in FTD-GRN is facilitated by the following:\n• Cross-correction: Following treatment with PBFT02, overexpressing PGRN in a subset of cells in the\nCNS could provide a source of secreted protein that could be taken up by surrounding cells, resulting in\nthe potential for cross-correction and broad restoration of neuronal lysosomal function across the entire\nbrain.\n• Biomarkers: There are known biomarkers in FTD-GRN that are measurable and available to assist in\ndrug development.\no Pharmacodynamic biomarker. PGRN is a secreted protein that can be measured in the CSF and\nplasma, and it has been shown to be reduced in the CSF of human GRN mutation carriers.\no Disease progression biomarkers. We expect to be able to use recent progress in the\nidentification of clinical disease progression biomarkers for FTD, including plasma, CSF,\nneuroimaging and retinal biomarkers, to facilitate clinical development by enabling early\ndetection of treatment effects on disease pathophysiology.\n• Preclinical Validation: In our preclinical studies in GRN knockout mice, or GRN -/- mice,\nintracerebroventricular, or ICV, administration of PBFT02 resulted in increased levels of PGRN in the\nCNS and CSF, with resolution of lysosomal storage pathology. ICM administration in NHPs, which do\nnot have the disease phenotype, resulted in robust increases in PGRN levels in CNS and CSF.\nOur Product Candidate\nWe are developing PBFT02 to treat patients affected with FTD-GRN, via a single ICM administration. PBFT02 is a gene\ntherapy that utilizes an AAV1 viral vector to deliver a modified DNA encoding the GRN gene to a patient’s cells. The\ngoal of this vector construct and delivery approach is to provide higher levels of PGRN to the CNS to overcome the\nprogranulin deficiency in GRN mutation carriers, who have reduced CSF PGRN levels ranging from 30% to 50% of\nthose observed in normal, mutation non-carriers. A higher level of CSF PGRN makes more PGRN available to bind to\ncell membrane receptors.\nWe selected the AAV1 capsid and ICM administration route due to the widespread and robust expression of the human\nPGRN transgene observed throughout the brain and spinal cord in NHP studies. Following ICM AAV1 administration in\nNHPs, levels of human PGRN in the CSF achieved supraphysiologic levels compared to those measured in healthy\nhuman CSF, and exceeded PGRN levels observed in NHPs that received AAV5 or AAVhu68 serotypes by greater than\nfive times.\nPreclinical studies\nPBFT02 was selected as our development candidate following preclinical proof of concept studies in adult NHPs, which\nevaluated the expression of human PGRN protein in the CSF after ICM administration of four different vector\nconstructs. The AAV1.hPGRN vector construct produced supraphysiological levels of PGRN that were greater than five\ntimes higher than the AAVhu68.hPGRN and AAV5.hPGRN vectors tested, as shown below. ICM AAV1 did not\nstrongly transduce the liver or significantly elevate levels of circulating PGRN, which may reduce the potential for\nunknown peripheral effects of PGRN.\n14\nComparison of Vector Serotypes: Production of Human PGRN-protein in CSF of NHPs Following ICM-\nAAV Administration of Human GRN Gene.\nTwo adult rhesus macaques per treatment received ICM AAV.hPGRN High dose, 3.0 x 1013 GC / 3.3 x 1011 GC/g brain) on study day 0.\nShading: Reference range for healthy adult controls’ PGRN levels in CSF (n = 61) (Passage Bio data).\nIn a separate NHP study, rhesus macaques were necropsied 28 days after administration of AAV1 and AAVhu68 vectors\nexpressing a green fluorescent protein, or GFP, reporter gene, to examine differential transduction. Ependymal cell\ntransduction was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in multiple brain regions. As shown in the figure below,\ntransduction of the ependymal cells (as shown by density of darkened ependymal cells) was substantially higher in the\nanimal treated with AAV1 (48%, n=1) as compared to the animals treated with AAVhu68 (1-2%, n=2). In all other CNS\ncell types, AAV1 and AAVhu68 demonstrated similar transduction efficiency.\nEpendymal Cell Transduction in NHPs Following ICM Delivery of AAV1 or AAVhu68 Vectors Expressing GFP\nRepresentative sections showing GFP immunohistochemistry in ependymal cell layers, from rhesus macaques following ICM administration of\nAAVhu68.GFP or AAV1.GFP. Scale bars = 5 mm\nBased on the results from the NHP vector comparison studies, we selected AAV1 as the capsid for our PBFT02 product.\n15\nThe efficacy of the AAV1 vector was assayed in a dose-ranging study in GRN -/- mice. PBFT02 was administered via\nICV delivery at one of four ascending doses or vehicle to adult mice at an age when lipofuscin deposition (a marker of\nlysosomal dysfunction), lysosomal enzyme abnormalities, and neuroinflammation were present in brain regions involved\nin FTD-GRN pathophysiology. In this study, human PGRN expression in the CSF increased in a dose-dependent manner\nfollowing PBFT02 administration. Transgene expression led to improvements in histopathologic and enzymatic changes\nin key brain regions in the mice, including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus. The improvements included\na reduction in the accumulation of lipofuscin and reduced neuroinflammation (as shown in the thalamus in the figure\nbelow), and elevated lysosomal hexosaminidase activity.\nPBFT02 Improved Lysosomal Dysfunction and Inflammation in a Mouse Model of Granulin Deficiency\nMarkers of lysosomal dysfunction (lipofuscin autofluorescence) and inflammation (CD68 immunohistochemistry) in the thalamus of Grn -/- mice 90\ndays after PBFT02 administration. Staining in brain sections of PBFT02-treated Grn -/- mice was compared with vehicle-treated WT and Grn -/- mice.\nBoth markers were elevated in Grn -/- mice at the time of treatment (baseline). Data are mean +/- standard error of the mean, or SEM. *p < 0.05, **p\n< 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test. Abbreviations: -/-, gene knockout; ANOVA,\nanalysis of variance; CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; ICV, intra-cerebroventricular; SEM, standard error of the mean; WT, wild type.\nNHP Toxicology Study\nA 90-day GLP compliant toxicology study was conducted in NHPs to assess the safety, tolerability,\nbiodistribution and excretion profile of PBFT02 following ICM administration at three dose levels. No blood or\nCSF abnormalities related to PBFT02 administration were observed except for asymptomatic, mild, and transient\nincreases in CSF leukocytes in the majority of animals. PBFT02 was shown to be well-tolerated at all doses\nevaluated and no adverse effects were detected on body weight or clinical, neurological, or behavioral signs.\nVector distributed to the CSF and high levels of gene transfer were detected in the brain, spinal cord and dorsal\nroot ganglia, or DRG, at day 90. The quantity of vector genomes detected in CNS tissues was generally dose-\ndependent, as shown in the figure below.\n16\nVector Biodistribution 90 Days After ICM Administration of PBFT02 to NHPs\nTissues were collected at necropsy from adult NHPs 90 days after a single ICM administration of PBFT02 at doses indicated (n=3/group) and from\nvehicle- (ITFFB-) treated NHPs (n=2) as a control. Each bar represents mean PBFT02 vector genomes detected per μg of DNA. Error bars represent\nthe SEM. Dashed line represents limit of detection of assay.\nPBFT02 was also shown to reach significant concentrations in the peripheral blood, liver and spleen. PBFT02\nvector DNA was detectable in urine and feces five days post-administration and was undetectable within 60 days.\nHuman PGRN was detectable in CSF and serum in all animals by 7 to 14 days after PBFT02 administration,\npeaking between days 14 to 28. Responses were generally dose dependent and resulted in supraphysiologic PGRN\nlevels after the two highest doses. Expression declined by day 60, correlating with the appearance of antibodies\nagainst the human transgene product, which are not expected to develop in haploinsufficient patients with FTD-\nGRN.\nDose Dependent Effects of PBFT02 on CSF level of Progranulin in NHPs\nAdult rhesus macaques received ICM PBFT02 (n = 3/dose) or vehicle (n =2) on study day 0. CSF was sampled 14 days post-dose\n17\nMild to minimal grade transient degeneration of DRG, trigeminal root ganglia, or TRG, and associated sensory nerve\naxonopathy, were observed in NHPs after all PBFT02 dose groups. These histopathologic observations were not linked\nwith any clinical or neurological abnormalities in any animals up to 90 days’ post-dose. One PBFT02-treated animal\nexhibited a peripheral nerve conduction impairment in the median nerve, evident from bilateral reductions in sensory\nnerve action potential, or SNAP, amplitudes on day 28 and day 90, that appeared to be treatment related as severe axon\nloss and endoneurial fibrosis were detected at necropsy. PBFT02-induced SNAP changes and sensory neuron\ndegeneration were not associated with any clinical or neurological abnormalities in any animals up to 90 days post-dose.\nClinical development\nOur clinical development plan is to treat FTD-GRN patients with a single dose of PBFT02 via ICM administration. Our\ninitial clinical trial is focused on symptomatic FTD patients who have the GRN mutation and, if successful, we plan to\nexpand into presymptomatic stage of disease.\nWe have initiated our upliFT-D trial, an international, multi-center, open-label, single-arm Phase 1/2 clinical trial of\nPBFT02 in patients with a diagnosis of symptomatic FTD-GRN. This trial is a two-cohort dose-escalation trial, with\nthree to five subjects per cohort, and with a potential for a third higher-dose cohort, if considered necessary based on the\nresults of the first two cohorts. The dose for Cohort 1 (3.3x1010 genome copies/gm brain weight) exceeds the minimum\neffective dose in the GRN knockout mouse model, with possible escalation to a higher dose (up to 1.1x1011 genome\ncopies/gm brain weight); however, the dose for Cohort 2 has not yet been determined. The primary endpoint of the trial\nis to assess safety and tolerability over 60 months. To better understand the clinical significance of the peripheral nerve\nfindings in NHPs, we implemented clinical monitoring, consisting of both nerve conduction studies and neurological\nexams focused on sensory and peripheral nerve function. Secondary endpoints are to assess change from baseline to 24\nmonths on biomarkers, including CSF and plasma PGRN levels, biomarkers of lysosomal function, neurodegeneration\nand disease progression, and on clinical outcomes as measured by the Clinical Dementia Rating plus National\nAlzheimer’s Coordinating Center with Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration, or CDR® plus NACC FTLD, and other\nneurocognitive assessments. Interim analyses are planned for certain biomarkers starting at one month post dosing and\nfor clinical outcomes beginning at one year post dosing. The independent data monitoring committee, or IDMC, will\nreview 30-day biomarker data and 60-day safety data for each subject in a cohort. We have an ongoing dialogue with\nIDMC regarding dose selection for Cohort 2 and will make this decision in consultation with the IDMC. All subjects\nwill be evaluated over two years for safety and efficacy, followed by an additional 36 months of long-term follow-up.\nClinical development results\nWe reported initial safety and biomarker data from three patients in Cohort 1 in December of 2023. Dose 1 of PBFT02\ntreatment resulted in supraphysiologic levels of CSF PGRN with concentrations ranging from 10.7 to 17.3 ng/mL at 30\ndays post-treatment (n=3), which is greater than 2 to 3-fold higher than the mean CSF PGRN levels observed in healthy\nadult controls (mean 4.8 ng/mL; median 4.7 ng/mL; range 3.3 to 8.2 ng/mL; n=61). In the first patient to reach six\nmonths post PBFT02 administration, CSF PGRN remained at supraphysiologic levels with a concentration of 27.3\nng/mL. The results exceeded our expectations based on what was observed in preclinical NHP studies.\n18\nCSF Progranulin Levels Following Administration of PBFT02 Dose 1\nShading: Reference range for healthy adult controls’ PGRN levels in CSF (3.28 – 8.15 ng/mL, n = 61) (Passage Bio data)\nCSF= Cerebrospinal Fluid\nCSF Progranulin Concentration (ng/mL) Following Administration of PBFT02 Dose 1\nD30 = day 30 post-dose; D180 = day 180 post-dose; N/A = not available\nICM administration of PBFT02 has not been demonstrated to alter circulating PGRN levels. Plasma PGRN levels were\nsimilar to baseline concentrations and remained below levels found in healthy adult controls throughout the available\nfollow-up period across all three patients. Thus, it appears that PGRN levels were increased only in the central nervous\nsystem, where elevated levels have the potential to correct the neurodegeneration associated with PGRN\nhaploinsufficiency.\n19\nPlasma Progranulin Levels Following Administration of PBFT02 Dose 1\nShading: Lower limit of normal of reference range for healthy adult controls’ PGRN levels in plasma (91.6 – 372.4\nng/mL, n = 56) (Passage Bio data)\nAs previously reported, Patient 1, who received a low level of immunosuppression (60 mg oral prednisone daily for 60\ndays), per the initial trial protocol, experienced two SAEs during week eight that were both asymptomatic and likely\nconsistent with an immune response. The SAEs included hepatotoxicity, as manifest by an increase in liver function\ntests, and venous sinus thrombosis. Notably, the increase in liver function tests was not associated with an increase in\ntotal or direct bilirubin levels, and quickly resolved following treatment with IV methylprednisolone. Patient 1 declined\nfurther treatment and withdrew consent for the trial at week 10, and no additional follow-up is available.\nFollowing Patient 1, the protocol was amended to increase the steroid regimen to include 1,000 mg IV\nmethylprednisolone on days 1-3 followed by 60 mg oral prednisone for 60 days post treatment, as well as additional\nsafety monitoring.\nWith this modified immunosuppression regiment, Dose 1 of PBFT02 was generally well-tolerated in patients 2 and 3,\nwho received the enhanced steroid regimen (1,000 mg IV methylprednisolone on days 1-3 followed by 60 mg oral\nprednisone for 60 days). In these two patients, no SAEs were reported, all treatment emergent adverse events, or AEs,\nwere mild to moderate in severity, and there was no evidence of a clinically significant immune response, hepatotoxicity,\nor safety related imaging findings in either patient. In all three patients, there was no evidence of dorsal root ganglion\ntoxicity, as measured by nerve conduction studies, and no complications were observed related to the ICM\nadministration procedure.\n20\nThe table below summarizes the safety data as of February 14, 2024 for the three patients treated with PBFT02 Dose 1.\nSafety and Tolerability of Initial Three Patients Treated with PBFT02 Dose 1\n1 Day minus one refers to the day prior to dosing.\n2 Days 14-21 LFT elevations were mild and self-resolved; days 51-55 LFT elevations: ALT 16x upper limit of normal (ULN), AST 4x ULN,\nalkaline phosphatase 2x ULN, GGT 10x ULN; total bilirubin was normal. Resolving with methylprednisolone at time of patient study\nwithdrawal.\nLFT: liver function test; SAE: serious adverse event\nIn December 2023, we announced our plans to treat two additional patients at Dose 1, with no required delay between\nthese patients, to further study the safety and pharmacodynamic effects of PBFT02 at this dose.\nWe expect to initiate dosing of Cohort 2 FTD-GRN patients in the upliFT-D trial in the first half of 2024, report six-\nmonth safety and biomarker data from Cohort 1 patients in the second half of 2024, and report 12-month follow-up data\nfrom Cohort 1 patients and initial safety and biomarker data from Cohort 2 patients in the first half of 2025.\nAs our clinical data matures, we are planning for continued interactions with regulatory authorities to align on\ndesign of the confirmatory study and appropriate pathway to submission of a Biologics License Application, or\nBLA, and regulatory approval for commercialization in the United States and internationally.\nRegulatory designations and Clinical Trial Approvals\nWe have an active IND from the FDA and approved CTAs in multiple countries for PBFT02, which allows us to\nproceed with our upliFT-D trial, an international, multi-center, open-label, single-arm Phase 1/2 clinical trial of PBFT02\nin patients with a diagnosis of symptomatic FTD-GRN.\nThe FDA has granted ODD and Fast Track Designation to PBFT02 for the treatment of FTD-GRN and the European\nCommission granted Orphan designation for PBFT02.\nPBFT02 for the treatment of FTD-C9orf72 and ALS\nPreclinical data suggests that increased neuronal PGRN may reduce TDP-43 pathology, which is a hallmark of\nmultiple neurodegenerative conditions. This includes FTD-C9orf72 and approximately 95% of sporadic ALS,\nwhich are indications that we are actively pursuing. TDP-43 is a ribonuclear protein with multiple transcriptional\nand post-transcriptional functions. In TDP-43 pathology disorders, hyperphosphorylated TDP-43 abnormally\n21\naccumulates in the cytoplasm of cell bodies and dendritic processes of neurons and glia, rather than its typical\nlocalization in the nucleus. Neuronal dysfunction and degeneration have been linked with loss of TDP-43’s\nnormal nuclear functions and with toxicity of insoluble cytoplasmic TDP-43.\nThird-party preclinical studies demonstrated that TDP-43 pathology and associated toxicities may be reduced by\nincreasing PGRN levels. The potential for a beneficial effect of PGRN in TDP-43-associated neurodegenerative\ndisorders has been shown in mice and zebrafish. In a transgenic mouse model expressing human mutant TDP-43,\noverexpression of PGRN reduced cytoplasmic accumulation of insoluble TDP-43, reduced axonopathy in the\nspinal cord, and slowed disease progression, leading to prolonged survival. In zebrafish models in which mutant\nTDP-43 expression induced motor neuron degeneration, depleting PGRN expression resulted in worsened\naxonopathy. In contrast, overexpression of PGRN rescued the TDP-43-associated motor neuron degeneration in\nthe zebrafish. Following from these animal model observations, we postulate that elevating neuronal PGRN levels\nin diseases with TDP-43 pathology may provide significant benefits to patients.\nWe expect to obtain regulatory feedback on the clinical pathway to treating FTD-C9orf72 and sporadic ALS patients\nwith PBFT02 in the second half of 2024.\nPBFT02 for the treatment of AD\nWe believe that elevating PGRN levels has the potential to improve the course of AD in patients who are carriers\nof the GRN SNP. The GRN SNP is associated with reduced PGRN levels. It is present within approximately 30%\nof the population where its presence confers an increased risk for AD onset. Within AD patients, presence of the\nGRN SNP and reduced PGRN levels translates into more rapid disease progression. This is accompanied by\nhigher levels of CSF tau, which correlate with increased AD pathology in the brain. Third party preclinical\nstudies in animal models have demonstrated that low levels of PGRN may exacerbate AD pathology and,\nconversely, high levels of PGRN may reduce AD pathology. We plan to initiate preclinical studies in AD to\nextend these initial observations.\nPBFT02 Clinical Supply\nThrough our manufacturing partners, we have manufactured the PBFT02 clinical supply to support completion of the\nongoing Phase 1/2 clinical study in FTD-GRN as well as initiate dosing in one additional indication.\nOther Active Research Programs\nWe have a program in collaboration with GTP to develop a genetic medicine to treat Huntington’s disease. This program\nis currently in the discovery stage. Beyond this, through our research collaboration with GTP, we also have the option to\nlicense programs for eight additional CNS indications.\nManufacturing\nGene therapy manufacturing is a critical factor in the successful development and commercialization of novel genetic\nmedicines. To that end, we have established internal chemistry, manufacturing and control, or CMC, capabilities to\nsupport our vector manufacturing and production platform, and we have a relationship with Catalent, a contract\ndevelopment and manufacturing organization, or CDMO, for our manufacturing needs.\nWe utilize a production platform approach with HEK293 mammalian cells as the substrate, triple plasmid transient\ntransfection and single-use fixed-bed iCELLis® bioreactor system for the manufacture of our AAV product candidates.\nWe are using a well-characterized production platform that has been used for both commercial and clinical AAV\nproducts and product candidates. We believe our approach will enable rapid development, control of product quality and\nregulatory compliance.\nWe believe that our internal CMC capabilities provide a strategic advantage. In 2021, we built a state-of-the-art\nlaboratory in the Princeton West Innovation Campus, which enabled us to internalize all major CMC laboratory\n22\ncapabilities, including analytical development, process development, and quality control testing. With our strong\ntechnical expertise, we are constantly exploring new ways to improve the manufacturing process for gene therapy\nproducts. Through internal efforts, we have developed leading-edge, robust analytical methods and an enhanced\nmanufacturing platform that can be leveraged across our clinical and pre-clinical pipeline. In this regard, we have filed\ntwo patent applications on new methods to improve the manufacturing of our products. Additionally, we have\nestablished the necessary internal technical and scientific expertise to manage the external operations for clinical and\ncommercial manufacturing.\nGTP currently provides us with preclinical and toxicology research-grade vector supplies, while Catalent\nprovides us with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, AAV clinical supplies for our clinical trials. The\nproduction processes for PBFT02 and for the three clinical stage product candidates for which we have stopped\nclinical development, PBGM01, PBKR03 and PBML04, have been scaled up to cGMP standards at Catalent’s\nfacility. Clinical materials for each of these candidates have been successfully manufactured.\nWe have an amended and restated collaboration agreement with Catalent that governs our relationship with\nCatalent for the supply of cGMP capacity. Access to cGMP manufacturing capacity gives us the ability to meet\nproduction requirements for our current and future clinical trials. We also have an amended and restated\ndevelopment services and clinical supply agreement, and together with the amended and restated collaboration\nagreement, the Amended Catalent Agreements, with Catalent to support clinical scale manufacturing for our gene\ntherapy product candidates. The Amended Catalent Agreements establish a limited exclusive relationship between\nus and Catalent for the manufacture of bulk drug substance and drug product for PBFT02 and PBGM01 programs.\nThe limited exclusive relationship under the Amended Catalent Agreements converts to a non-exclusive\nrelationship (i) in the event Catalent fails to meet certain performance standards and (ii) following certain\nconditional events related to the divestiture by us of either PBFT02 or PBGM01, in which case, if such events\noccur, we would pay Catalent certain fees. In addition, in the event of certain transactions, we may terminate the\nAmended Catalent Agreements for convenience with respect to such products, in which case, we would pay to\nCatalent a certain termination fee.\nWe believe that our manufacturing capabilities provide us with the advantages of better control of drug\ndevelopment timelines, improved control of vector supply for a portfolio of clinical assets and improved control\nof product quality through the improvements of the manufacturing platform.\nWe also anticipate that we will continue to make significant investments to further optimize our manufacturing\ncapabilities and platforms to produce high-quality, cost-effective AAV vectors and we will continue to make\ninvestments in process and analytical sciences, internally or with third parties, to evaluate and develop\nmanufacturing process improvements that may increase the productivity and efficiency of our manufacturing\nplatform processes.\nCompetition\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including the genetic medicines field, are characterized by\nrapidly changing technologies, competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. We are aware of\nseveral companies focused on developing gene therapies in various indications as well as several companies\naddressing methods for modifying genes and regulating gene expression. We may also face competition from\nlarge and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic research institutions, government\nagencies and public and private research institutions with genetic medicine and other therapeutic approaches.\nFor the treatment of FTD, there are no approved disease-modifying therapies. We consider our most direct\ncompetitors with respect to PBFT02 for the treatment of FTD-GRN to be Alector, Inc. (partnered with\nGlaxoSmithKline), which is conducting a Phase 3 clinical trial with a humanized anti-human sortilin monoclonal\nantibody for FTD-GRN, and Prevail Therapeutics Inc. (now part of Eli Lilly & Co), which is conducting a Phase\n1/2 clinical trial for a gene therapy treatment for FTD-GRN. AviadoBio began enrolling their Phase 1/2 gene\ntherapy trial in patients with FTD-GRN in the second half of 2023. Additional companies, including Kyowa Kirin\nCo., Ltd. and QurAlis Therapeutics, are conducting preclinical research using gene therapy approaches to treat\npatients with FTD-GRN. Denali Therapeutics Inc. in partnership with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited\n23\nis conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical trial for their recombinant progranulin protein in addition to their oral EIF2a\nmodulator already in a Phase 1 clinical trial. VesperBio began Phase 1 enrollment for a small molecule sortilin\nantagonist program targeting FTD-GRN in the fourth quarter of 2023. We are also aware of other therapeutic\napproaches in preclinical development that may target FTD-GRN patients.\nMany of our potential competitors, alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial,\ntechnical and other resources than we do, such as larger research and development, clinical, marketing and\nmanufacturing organizations. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may\nresult in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of competitors. Our commercial\nopportunity could be reduced or eliminated if competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer,\nmore effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any product\ncandidates that we may develop. Competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products\nmore rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong\nmarket position before we are able to enter the market, if ever. Additionally, new or advanced technologies\ndeveloped by our competitors may render our current or future product candidates uneconomical or obsolete, and\nwe may not be successful in marketing our product candidates against competitors.\nLicense Agreement\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\nWe have a research, collaboration and licensing agreement with Penn, as amended, or the Penn Agreement, for\nresearch and development collaborations and exclusive license rights to patents for certain products and\ntechnologies. Under the Penn Agreement, we have the option to obtain exclusive licenses to, and to fund, certain\nresearch relating to the preclinical development of selected products in research programs in rare monogenic CNS\nindications. We have eight remaining options available to commence additional licensed programs for CNS\nindications until August 3, 2026.\nThe Penn Agreement includes an exploratory research program to identify targets and early product candidates in\ncertain agreed upon non-monogenic, non-rare, or large, CNS indications. The initial term of the exploratory\nresearch program is three years, or until August 2024, which term can be extended by mutual agreement. During\nsuch term, we will have an exclusive right of first negotiation to include additional targets to the exploratory\nresearch program in the agreed upon large CNS indications. Under the exploratory research program, we will\nhave the right to further develop and commercialize any gene therapy product candidates specific for those\nselected targets that arise from the exploratory research programs by exercising one of our remaining eight\noptions. We currently do not have any active exploratory research programs.\nIf we were to exercise any of the remaining options, we would owe Penn a non-refundable aggregate fee of $1.0\nmillion per product indication, with $0.5 million due upfront and another $0.5 million fee owed upon a further\ndevelopmental milestone.\nWe also fund discovery research conducted by Penn through August 3, 2026 and will receive exclusive rights,\nsubject to certain limitations, to platform technologies resulting from the discovery research for our products\ndeveloped with GTP, such as novel capsids, toxicity reduction technologies and delivery and formulation\nimprovements. This funding commitment for the discovery research is $5.0 million annually, paid in quarterly\nincrements of $1.3 million through June 2026.\nThe Penn Agreement requires that we make payments of up to (i) $16.5 million per product candidate for rare,\nmonogenic disorders in the aggregate and (ii) $39.0 million per product candidate in the aggregate arising from\nthe exploratory program for large CNS indications. Each payment will be due upon the achievement of specific\ndevelopment milestone events by such licensed product for a first indication, reduced development milestone\npayments for the second and third indications and no development milestone payments for subsequent\nindications. In addition, on a product-by-product basis, we are obligated to make up to $55.0 million in sales\nmilestone payments on each licensed product based on annual sales of the licensed product in excess of defined\nthresholds.\n24\nUpon successful commercialization of a product using the licensed technology, we are obligated to pay to Penn,\non a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis, tiered royalties (subject to customary\nreductions) in the mid-single digits on annual worldwide net sales of such licensed product. In addition, we are\nobligated to pay to Penn a percentage of sublicensing income, ranging from the mid-single digits to low double\ndigits, for sublicenses under the Penn Agreement. The agreement will expire on a licensed product-by-licensed\nproduct and country-by-country basis upon the later of (i) the expiration of the last valid claim of the licensed\npatent rights that covers the exploitation of such licensed product in such country, and (ii) the expiration of the\nroyalty period. In addition, we will pay a tiered transaction fee of 1-2% of the net proceeds upon certain change\nof control events.\nPenn will notify us of any patented manufacturing methods developed by GTP during the specified research term, and\nwe have the option to obtain a non-exclusive license under those patent rights controlled by Penn for our licensed\nproducts.\nIn addition to the exclusive licenses granted to us, on a CNS indication-by-indication basis, Penn has agreed that GTP\nwill not collaborate with any commercial third party to develop another gene therapy product for the same indication\nuntil two years after the earlier of the filing of the IND or the clearance of the IND for a licensed product in such\nindication. Under the licensed Penn patent rights, Penn retains the right to conduct (and to authorize non-commercial\nthird parties to conduct) certain educational, research, clinical and patient care activities.\nUnder the Penn Agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, obtain regulatory\napproval for, and commercialize at least one licensed product for each of the licensed indications for prophylactic,\ndiagnostic and therapeutic uses in humans. We may satisfy this obligation by achieving, for each licensed product,\ncertain diligence events by a specified achievement date, which dates may be extended under certain circumstances.\nPursuant to the agreement, Penn will be responsible for preclinical development activities, including all IND-enabling\nnon-clinical studies and research grade manufacturing, and other collaborative activities set forth in the plan for the\nfunded research, and we will be responsible for regulatory strategy and operations, clinical development, cGMP\nmanufacture and commercialization of all licensed products.\nIntellectual Property\nOur commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary and/or intellectual\nproperty protection in the United States and other countries for our current product candidates and future\nproducts, as well as our core technologies, including our manufacturing know-how. We strive to protect and\nenhance the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the\ndevelopment of our business by seeking, maintaining, and defending our intellectual property, whether developed\ninternally or licensed from third parties. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological\ninnovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the field\nof gene therapy. Additionally, we intend to rely on regulatory protection afforded through rare drug designations,\ndata exclusivity and market exclusivity as well as patent term extensions, where available.\nCurrently, our patent protection consists of patents and patent applications that (i) we have in-licensed from Penn\nunder the Penn Agreement for our product candidates in our licensed indications and (ii) we own solely based on\ninternally developed processes for manufacturing our products.\nThe in-licensed patent applications are directed to new AAV capsids and certain defined variants, to recombinant\nAAV viruses, or rAAVs, capable of delivering certain genes into human cells to treat monogenic diseases of the\nCNS, to methods of treating those monogenic diseases with rAAV, as well as certain aspects of our\nmanufacturing capabilities and related technologies. Our in-licensed patent portfolio currently includes:\n• two patent families with claims directed to rAAV for use in treating FTD. The first patent family\nincludes applications pending in fourteen jurisdictions, including the U.S., Argentina, Brazil, Canada,\nChina, Europe, Israel, Japan, and Korea. Any patents that may issue from applications in this family are\nexpected to expire on February 21, 2040, absent any term adjustments or extensions. The second patent\nfamily includes applications in sixteen jurisdictions, including the U.S., Argentina, Taiwan, Brazil,\n25\nCanada, China, Europe, Israel, Japan and Korea. Any patents that may issue from applications in this\nfamily are expected to expire on August 26, 2041, absent any term adjustments or extensions;\n• a patent family with patents granted in the U.S., Europe, and South Africa and applications pending in\nthe U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions with claims directed to rAAVs having an AAVhu68 capsid. We\nexclusively licensed this patent family for licensed products within our rare, monogenic field of use\nindications. Patents that have issued or may issue from applications in this family are expected to expire\non February 27, 2038, absent any term adjustments or extensions;\n• two patent families with claims directed to an rAAV containing a coding sequence of human β-gal for\nuse in treating GM1. The first patent family includes pending applications in fourteen jurisdictions,\nincluding the U.S., Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Israel, Japan, and Korea. Any patents that\nmay issue from applications in this family are expected to expire on September 30, 2039, absent any term\nadjustments or extensions. The second patent family includes applications pending in sixteen\njurisdictions, including the U.S., Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Israel, Japan, and Korea.\nAny patents that may issue from applications in this family are expected to expire on February 1, 2041,\nabsent any term adjustments or extensions;\n• two patent families with claims directed to rAAV for use in treating Krabbe. The first patent family includes\npending applications in fifteen jurisdictions, including the U.S., Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China,\nEurope, Israel, Japan, and Korea. Any patents that may issue from applications in this family are expected to\nexpire on February 26, 2040, absent any term adjustments or extensions. The second patent family includes\npending applications in sixteen jurisdictions, including the U.S., Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China,\nEurope, Israel, Japan, and Korea. Any patents that may issue from applications in this family are expected to\nexpire on May 11, 2041, absent any term adjustments or extensions; and,\n• two patent families with claims directed to rAAV for use in treating MLD. The first patent family includes\napplications pending in fifteen jurisdictions, including the U.S., Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe,\nIsrael, Japan, and Korea. Any patents that may issue from applications in this family are expected to expire on\nMay 24, 2040, absent any term adjustments or extensions. The second patent family includes applications\npending in Argentina and Taiwan, and a patent cooperation treaty, or PCT, application. Any patents that may\nissue from applications in this family are expected to expire on January 10, 2043, absent any term adjustments\nor extensions. We also have options under the Penn Agreement to add additional intellectual property to our\nexisting license, as described in the section “License Agreement”.\nThe term of individual patents may vary based on the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents\nissued from applications filed in the United States are effective for 20 years from the earliest effective non-\nprovisional filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of\nthe term effectively lost as a result of FDA regulatory review period. The restoration period cannot be longer than\nfive years and the total patent term, including the restoration period, must not exceed 14 years following FDA\napproval. The duration of patents outside of the United States varies in accordance with provisions of applicable\nlocal law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective national filing date.\nIn addition to patents and patent applications that we license, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop\nand maintain our competitive position. For example, significant aspects of our AAV manufacturing capabilities\nand gene therapy technology are based upon trade secrets and know-how. However, trade secrets can be difficult\nto protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, and obtain and maintain control and/or\nownership of certain technologies, in part, through confidentiality agreements and invention assignment\nagreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and commercial partners. We also\nseek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data, trade secrets and know-how, including by\nimplementing measures intended to maintain the physical security of our premises and the physical and electronic\nsecurity of our information technology systems.\nOur ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products may\ndepend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these\nactivities. With respect to our owned or licensed intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will issue\n26\nwith respect to any of the pending patent applications to which we own or license rights or with respect to any\npatent applications that we or our licensors may file in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our licensed\npatents or any patents that may be issued in the future to us or our licensors will be commercially useful in\nprotecting our product candidates and methods of manufacturing the same. Moreover, we may be unable to obtain\npatent protection for certain of our product candidates generally, as well as with respect to certain indications.\nSee the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” for a more comprehensive\ndescription of risks related to our intellectual property.\nGovernment Regulation and Product Approval\nThe processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions,\nalong with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities,\nrequire the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.\nFDA Approval Process\nIn the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food,\nDrug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDC Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among\nother things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling,\npromotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export\nof pharmaceutical products. Biological products used for the prevention, treatment, or cure of a disease or\ncondition of a human being are subject to regulation under the FDC Act, except the section of the FDC Act which\ngoverns the approval of New Drug Applications, or NDAs. Biological products, such as gene therapy products,\nare approved for marketing under provisions of the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, via a BLA. However, the\napplication process and requirements for approval of BLAs are very similar to those for NDAs. Failure to comply\nwith applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions,\nsuch as clinical hold, FDA refusal to file NDA/BLAs and to approve pending NDAs or BLAs, warning or untitled\nletters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions,\nfines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.\nBiological product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the United States\ntypically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an IND which must\nbecome effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to\nestablish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought.\nSatisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required\nmay vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease.\nPreclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal\nstudies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical\ntests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including Good Laboratory Practices. The results of\npreclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including\ninformation about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-\nterm preclinical tests, such as tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity in animals, may continue after the\nIND is submitted. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the\ncommencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND\nwithin this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. Clinical trials involve the\nadministration of the investigational biologic to subjects, including healthy volunteers or patients under the\nsupervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal\nregulations; (ii) in compliance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, an international standard meant to protect the\nrights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; as well\nas (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the\neffectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. subjects and subsequent protocol\namendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.\nThe FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other\nsanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA regulations or\n27\npresents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial subjects. The trial protocol and informed consent information for\nsubjects in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, for approval. An IRB\nmay also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply\nwith the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions if it believes that the subjects are subject to\nunacceptable risk.\nClinical trials to support BLAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the\nphases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the biologic into subjects, the product is tested to\nassess safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated\nwith drug exposure, and to obtain early evidence of a treatment effect if possible. Phase 2 usually involves trials\nin a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug or biologic for a particular indication,\ndetermine optimal dose and regimen, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound\ndemonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, generally Phase 3\ntrials are undertaken to obtain additional information about clinical effects and confirm efficacy and safety in a\nlarger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate\nthe overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug or biologic and to provide adequate information for the labeling of\nthe product. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to\ndemonstrate the safety and efficacy of the drug or biologic.\nIn addition, the manufacturer of an investigational drug in a Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trial for a serious or life-\nthreatening disease is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and\nresponding to requests for expanded access to such investigational drug.\nAfter completion of the required clinical testing, a BLA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of\nthe BLA is required before marketing and distribution of the product may begin in the United States. The BLA\nmust include the results of preclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the\nproduct’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting a BLA is\nsubstantial. The submission of most BLAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee. Under an\napproved BLA, the applicant is also subject to an annual program fee. These fees typically increase annually. A\nBLA for a drug that has been designated as an orphan drug is not subject to an application fee, unless the BLA\nincludes an indication for other than a rare disease or condition. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of a BLA\nto determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the Agency’s determination that it is\nadequately organized and sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for\nfiling, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals to complete the\nreview of BLAs. Most applications are classified as Standard Review products that are reviewed within ten\nmonths of the date the FDA accepts the BLA for filing; applications classified as Priority Review are reviewed\nwithin six months of the date the FDA accepts the BLA for filing. A BLA can be classified for Priority Review\nwhen the FDA determines the biologic product has the potential to treat a serious or life-threatening condition\nand, if approved, would be a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to available therapies.\nThe review process for both standard and priority reviews may be extended by the FDA for three or more\nadditional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information\nalready provided in the BLA submission.\nThe FDA may also refer applications for novel biologic products, or biologic products that present difficult\nquestions of safety or efficacy, to be reviewed by an advisory committee—typically a panel that includes\nclinicians, statisticians and other experts—for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the BLA\nshould be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but generally\nfollows such recommendations. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical\nsites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the\nbiologic product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with cGMPs is\nsatisfactory and the BLA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the biologic is safe, pure, potent and\neffective in the claimed indication.\nAfter the FDA evaluates the BLA and completes any clinical and manufacturing site inspections, it issues either\nan approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in\nthe BLA submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to\n28\nreconsider the application for approval. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s\nsatisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to\nreviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. An approval\nletter authorizes commercial marketing and distribution of the biologic with specific prescribing information for\nspecific indications. As a condition of BLA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation\nstrategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the biologic outweigh the potential risks to patients. A\nREMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure a\nproduct’s safe use, or ETASU. An ETASU can include, but is not limited to, special training or certification for\nprescribing or dispensing the product, dispensing the product only under certain circumstances, special\nmonitoring, and the use of patient-specific registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the\npotential market and profitability of the product. Moreover, the FDA may require substantial post-approval\ntesting and surveillance to monitor the product’s safety or efficacy.\nOnce granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or\nproblems are identified following initial marketing. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved\nBLA, including changes in indications, product labeling, manufacturing processes or facilities, require\nsubmission and FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement before the change can be implemented. A BLA\nsupplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the\nFDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing BLA supplements as it does in reviewing BLAs.\nAdditional Standard for Gene Therapy Products\nIn addition to the regulations discussed above, there are a number of additional standards that apply to clinical\ntrials involving the use of gene therapy. FDA has issued various guidance documents regarding gene therapies,\nwhich outline additional factors that FDA will consider at each of the above stages of development and relate to,\namong other things: the proper preclinical assessment of gene therapies; the CMC information that should be\nincluded in an IND application; the proper design of tests to measure product potency in support of an IND or\nBLA application; and measures to observe delayed adverse effects in subjects who have been exposed to\ninvestigational gene therapies when the risk of such effects is high. For instance, FDA usually recommends that\nsponsors observe all surviving subjects who receive treatment using gene therapies that are based on adeno-\nassociated virus vectors in clinical trials for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events for a minimum\n5-year period. FDA does not require the long-term tracking to be complete prior to its review of the BLA.\nOrphan Drug Designation\nUnder the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant Orphan Drug Designation to biological products intended to\ntreat a rare disease or condition—generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in\nthe United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable\nexpectation that the cost of developing and making a product available in the United States for such disease or\ncondition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan Drug Designation must be requested before\nsubmitting a BLA. After the FDA grants Orphan Drug Designation, the identity of the biological product and its\npotential orphan disease use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan Drug Designation does not convey any\nadvantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first BLA applicant to\nreceive FDA approval for a particular active moiety to treat a particular disease with FDA Orphan Drug\nDesignation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product in the\napproved indication. For large molecule drugs, including gene therapies, sameness is determined based on the\nprincipal molecular structural features of a product. As applied to gene therapies, the FDA has recently issued\nfinal guidance in which it stated it generally intends to consider certain key features, such as the transgenes\nexpressed by the gene therapy and the vectors used to deliver the transgene, to be principal molecular structural\nfeatures. With regard to vectors, the FDA generally intends to consider whether two vectors from the same viral\nclass are the same or different on a case-by-case basis. The FDA does not intend to consider minor differences\nbetween transgenes and vectors to be different principal molecular structural features. When two gene therapy\nproducts express the same transgene and have or use the same vector, determining whether two gene therapies are\nthe same drug may also depend on additional features of the final gene therapy product, such as regulatory\nelements and the cell type that is transduced (for genetically modified cells). In such cases, the FDA generally\nintends to determine whether two gene therapy products are different on a case-by-case basis. During the seven-\n29\nyear marketing exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market a biological\nproduct containing the same principal molecular structural features for the same indication, except in limited\ncircumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. A product\ncan be considered clinically superior if it is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care.\nOrphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biological product for the\nsame disease or condition, or the same biological product for a different disease or condition. Among the other\nbenefits of Orphan Drug Designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA user fee.\nRare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher Program\nUnder the Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher program, the FDA may award a priority review\nvoucher to the sponsor of an approved marketing application for a product that treats or prevents a rare pediatric\ndisease. The voucher entitles the sponsor to priority review of one subsequent marketing application. A voucher\nmay be awarded only for an approved rare pediatric disease product application. A rare pediatric disease product\napplication is an NDA or BLA for a product that treats or prevents a serious or life-threatening disease in which\nthe serious or life-threatening manifestations primarily affect individuals aged from birth to 18 years; in general,\nthe disease must affect fewer than 200,000 such individuals in the U.S.; the NDA or BLA must be deemed\neligible for priority review; the NDA or BLA must not seek approval for a different adult indication (i.e., for a\ndifferent disease/condition); the product must not contain an active ingredient that has been previously approved\nby the FDA; and the NDA or BLA must rely on clinical data derived from studies examining a pediatric\npopulation such that the approved product can be adequately labeled for the pediatric population. Before NDA or\nBLA approval, the FDA may designate a product in development as a product for a rare pediatric disease.\nTo receive a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher, a sponsor must notify the FDA, upon submission of\nthe NDA or BLA, of its intent to request a voucher. If the FDA determines that the NDA or BLA is a rare\npediatric disease product application, and if the NDA or BLA is approved, the FDA will award the sponsor of the\nNDA or BLA a voucher upon approval of the NDA or BLA. The FDA may revoke a rare pediatric disease priority\nreview voucher if the product for which it was awarded is not marketed in the U.S. within 365 days of the\nproduct’s approval. The voucher, which is transferable to another sponsor, may be submitted with a subsequent\nNDA or BLA and entitles the holder to priority review of the accompanying NDA or BLA. The sponsor\nsubmitting the priority review voucher must notify the FDA of its intent to submit the voucher with the NDA or\nBLA at least 90 days prior to submission of the NDA or BLA and must pay a priority review user fee in addition\nto any other required user fee. The FDA must take action on an NDA or BLA under priority review within six\nmonths of receipt of the NDA or BLA.\nOn December 27, 2020, the Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher program was reauthorized as part of\nthe Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 allowing a product that is designated as a product for a rare pediatric\ndisease prior to September 30, 2024 to be eligible to receive a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher upon\napproval of a qualifying NDA or BLA prior to September 30, 2026. It is unclear whether this program will\ncontinue to be reauthorized beyond the current sunset date in September 2024.\nFast Track Designation and Priority Review\nThe FDA is required to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs that are intended for the\ntreatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and which\ndemonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track Designation may be\ngranted for products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is\nno effective treatment and preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs\nfor the condition. Fast track Designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is\nbeing studied. Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a fast track program, may be\neligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review.\nPriority review may be granted for products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and,\nif approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies.\nThe FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application designated for priority\nreview in an effort to facilitate the review.\n30\nDisclosure of Clinical Trial Information\nSponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including biological products, are required to register and\ndisclose certain clinical trial information on the website www.clinicaltrials.gov. Information related to the\nproduct, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators, and other aspects of a clinical trial\nare then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical\ntrials after completion. Disclosure of the results of clinical trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to\ntwo years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain\nknowledge regarding the progress of clinical development programs as well as clinical trial design.\nAdditional Controls for Biologics\nTo help reduce the increased risk of the introduction of adventitious agents, the PHSA emphasizes the importance\nof manufacturing controls for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The PHSA also provides\nauthority to the FDA to immediately suspend biologics licenses in situations where there exists a danger to public\nhealth, to prepare or procure products in the event of shortages and critical public health needs, and to authorize\nthe creation and enforcement of regulations to prevent the introduction or spread of communicable diseases\nwithin the United States.\nAfter a BLA is approved, the product may also be subject to official lot release as a condition of approval. As part\nof the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product\nbefore it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer\nsubmits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the lot\nmanufacturing history and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA may also\nperform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before allowing the\nmanufacturer to release the lots for distribution. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the\nregulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products. As with drugs, after\napproval of a BLA, biologics manufacturers must address any safety issues that arise, are subject to recalls or a\nhalt in manufacturing, and are subject to periodic inspection after approval.\nBiosimilars\nThe Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, creates an abbreviated approval pathway\nfor biological products shown to be highly similar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference\nbiological product. Biosimilarity sufficient to reference a prior FDA-approved product requires that there be no\ndifferences in conditions of use, route of administration, dosage form, and strength, and no clinically meaningful\ndifferences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency.\nBiosimilarity must be shown through analytical trials, animal studies, and a clinical trial or trials, unless the\nSecretary of Health and Human Services waives a required element. A biosimilar product may be deemed\ninterchangeable with a previously approved product if it meets the higher hurdle of demonstrating that it can be\nexpected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple\ntimes, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered\nwithout increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic.\nThe first biosimilar product was approved by the FDA in 2015, and the first interchangeable product was\napproved in 2021.\nA reference biologic is granted 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure, or BLA approval, of the\nreference product, and no application for a biosimilar can be submitted for four years from the date of licensure\nof the reference product. The first biologic product submitted under the biosimilar abbreviated approval pathway\nthat is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against a finding of\ninterchangeability for other biologics for the same condition of use for the lesser of (i) one year after first\ncommercial marketing of the first interchangeable biosimilar, (ii) 18 months after the first interchangeable\nbiosimilar is approved if there is no patent challenge, (iii) eighteen months after resolution of a lawsuit over the\npatents of the reference biologic in favor of the first interchangeable biosimilar applicant, or (iv) 42 months after\nthe first interchangeable biosimilar’s application has been approved if a patent lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-\nmonth period.\n31\nPost-Approval Requirements\nOnce a BLA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA\nclosely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of biologics, including standards and regulations for\ndirect-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and\npromotional activities involving the Internet. Biologics may be marketed only for the approved indications and in\naccordance with the provisions of the approved labeling.\nAdverse event reporting and submission of periodic safety summary reports are required following FDA approval\nof a BLA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, and surveillance\nto monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict\nthe distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, biological product manufacture, packaging, and\nlabeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Biologic manufacturers and certain of\ntheir subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies.\nRegistration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the\nagency inspects a biologic product’s manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly,\nmanufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to\nmaintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product\nrecalls if a company fails to comply with required regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial\nmarketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.\nOther U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements\nIn the United States, biotechnology company activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal,\nstate and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare &\nMedicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS (e.g.,\nthe Office of Inspector General and the Office for Civil Rights), the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, and\nindividual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. The laws biotechnology\ncompanies may have to comply with include the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the\nfederal false claims laws, the privacy and security provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and\nAccountability Act, or HIPAA, and similar state laws, each as amended, as applicable.\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and\nwillfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in\ncash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, recommending or arranging for the\npurchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare\nprograms. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The Anti- Kickback\nStatute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and\nprescribers, purchasers, and/or formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and\nregulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are\ndrawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing,\npurchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor.\nFailure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor\ndoes not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement\nwill be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances.\nPractices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe\nharbor. In addition, the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors are subject to change.\nAdditionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and\nAffordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively\nthe ACA, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the\nstatute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA codified case\nlaw that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute\nconstitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act (discussed below).\n32\nThe civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is\ndetermined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows\nor should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.\nFederal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any person\nor entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to, or approval by, the\nfederal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement\nmaterial to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud\nEnforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property\npresented to the U.S. government. In addition, manufacturers can be held liable under the civil False Claims Act\neven when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission\nof false or fraudulent claims. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these\nlaws for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the\ncustomers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false\nclaims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus generally\nnon-reimbursable, uses and purportedly concealing price concessions in the pricing information submitted to the\ngovernment for government price reporting purposes.\nHIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting\nto execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or\npromises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program,\nincluding private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick,\nscheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection\nwith the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute, a\nperson or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to\nhave committed a violation.\nAlso, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed\nunder Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.\nData privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which business is\nconducted may also be applicable. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and\nClinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes requirements relating to the privacy,\nsecurity and transmission of individually identifiable health information. HIPAA requires covered entities to limit\nthe use and disclosure of protected health information to specifically authorized situations, and requires covered\nentities to implement security measures to protect health information that they maintain in electronic form.\nAmong other things, HITECH made HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to business associates,\nindependent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in\nconnection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil\nmonetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business\nassociates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in\nfederal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing\nfederal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified\ncircumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus\ncomplicating compliance efforts.\nAdditionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act within the ACA, and its implementing regulations,\nrequire that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is\navailable under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) report\nannually to CMS information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to\nphysicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), physician assistants,\ncertain types of advanced practice nurses, and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or\ndesignated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and\ninvestment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.\n33\nCommercial distribution of products requires compliance with state laws that require the registration of\nmanufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states,\nmanufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no\nplace of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to\nestablish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and\nothers to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain.\nIn addition, several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to\nestablish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on\nsales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as\nto prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to\npharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales\nand marketing practices. Certain local jurisdictions also require drug manufacturers to report information related\nto payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures.\nSales and marketing activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair\ncompetition laws. Violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other\ngovernmental regulations may result in penalties, including without limitation, significant civil, criminal and/or\nadministrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government programs,\nsuch as Medicare and Medicaid, imprisonment, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual\nwhistleblowers in the name of the government, refusal to enter into government contracts, oversight monitoring,\ncontractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings.\nCoverage, Pricing and Reimbursement\nSignificant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which\nregulatory approval is obtained. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for\nwhich regulatory approval is received for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party\npayors provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. In the United States,\nthird-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, private managed care providers, health insurers\nand other organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a\nproduct may be separate from the process for setting the price of a product or for establishing the reimbursement\nrate that such a payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an\napproved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a\nparticular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity\nand reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to questioning their\nsafety and efficacy. Expensive pharmaco-economic studies may need to be conducted in order to demonstrate the\nmedical necessity and cost-effectiveness of product candidates, in addition to the costs required to obtain the\nFDA approvals. Product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s\ndecision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved.\nFurther, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also\nprovide coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable the\nmaintenance of price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development.\nDifferent pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the European Union, or EU,\ngovernments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and\ncontrol of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some\njurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a\nreimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may\nrequire the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to\ncurrently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but\nmonitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become very intense. As a\nresult, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries,\ncross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.\nThe marketability of any product candidates for which regulatory approval is received for commercial sale may\nsuffer if the government and other third-party payors fail to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement. In\n34\naddition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and is expected to continue to increase the\npressure on healthcare pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time.\nEven if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which regulatory\napproval is received, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.\nHealthcare Reform\nHealthcare reforms that have been adopted, and that may be adopted in the future, could result in further\nreductions in coverage and levels of reimbursement for pharmaceutical products, increases in rebates payable\nunder U.S. government rebate programs and additional downward pressure on pharmaceutical product prices.\nHealthcare reform proposals recently culminated in the enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, which\nwill eliminate, beginning in 2025, the coverage gap under Medicare Part D by significantly lowering the enrollee\nmaximum out-of-pocket cost and requiring manufacturers to subsidize, through a newly established manufacturer\ndiscount program, 10% of Part D enrollees’ prescription costs for brand drugs below the out-of-pocket maximum,\nand 20% once the out-of-pocket maximum has been reached. The IRA will also allow HHS to directly negotiate\nthe selling price of a statutorily specified number of drugs and biologics each year that CMS reimburses under\nMedicare Part B and Part D. Only high-expenditure single-source biologics that have been approved for at least\n11 years (seven years for drugs) can qualify for negotiation, with the negotiated price taking effect two years after\nthe selection year. Negotiations for Medicare Part D products begin in 2024 with the negotiated price taking\neffect in 2026, and negotiations for Medicare Part B products begin in 2026 with the negotiated price taking\neffect in 2028. In August 2023, HHS announced the ten Medicare Part D drugs and biologics that it selected for\nnegotiations, and by October 1, 2023, each manufacturer of the selected drugs signed a manufacturer agreement\nto participate in the negotiations. HHS will announce the negotiated maximum fair prices by September 1, 2024,\nand this price cap, which cannot exceed a statutory ceiling price, will come into effect on January 1, 2026. A drug\nor biological product that has an orphan drug designation for only one rare disease or condition will be excluded\nfrom the IRA’s price negotiation requirements, but loses that exclusion if it has designations for more than one\nrare disease or condition, or if is approved for an indication that is not within that single designated rare disease\nor condition, unless such additional designation or such disqualifying approvals are withdrawn by the time CMS\nevaluates the drug for selection for negotiation. The IRA also imposes rebates on Medicare Part B and Part D\ndrugs whose prices have increased at a rate greater than the rate of inflation. The IRA permits the Secretary of\nHHS to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years.\nManufacturers that fail to comply with the IRA may be subject to various penalties, some significant, including\ncivil monetary penalties. The IRA also extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance\ncoverage in ACA marketplaces through plan year 2025. These provisions are taking effect progressively starting\nin 2023, although they may be subject to legal challenges. For example, the provisions related to the negotiation\nof selling prices of high-expenditure single-source drugs and biologics have been challenged in multiple lawsuits.\nThus, while it is unclear how the IRA will be implemented, it will likely have a significant impact on the\npharmaceutical industry and the pricing of our products and product candidates. It is unclear to what extent other\nstatutory, regulatory, and administrative initiatives will be enacted and implemented in the future.\nEmployees and Human Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had 58 full-time employees. From time to time, we also retain independent\ncontractors to support our organization. Of these employees, 17 held Ph.D., Pharm.D. or M.D. degrees, and 36\nwere engaged in research, development and technical operations. All of our employees are based in the United\nStates. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements,\nand we believe our relationship with our employees is good.\nOur Mission and Our Employees\nAt Passage Bio, our mission is to improve the lives of patients with neurodegenerative diseases, while also\nbuilding strong relationships with the communities we serve. We embrace collaboration, discipline and\nefficiency, while welcoming fresh ideas and stimulating personal development. We align our core values with our\nmission statement, which is outlined below:\n• Put Patients First\n35\no We place the health and safety of our patients at the center of every decision we make\no We value the voice of our patient communities; we listen and we learn\no We are driven to improve patients’ lives; they are relying on us\n• Commit to Excellence\no We apply leading-edge science and technology to develop gene therapies for our patients\no We strive to be the best in everything we do\no We embrace diversity and inclusion as essential to the success of our company\no We have an unrelenting focus on quality\n• Make an Impact\no We act with a sense of urgency; patients are waiting\no We are nimble and adaptable in driving toward our goals\no We approach every day with courage and tenacity\n• Act with Integrity\no We communicate openly, honestly and respectfully with each other\no We make decisions based on what’s right\no We are accountable for our actions\no We care about our community and strive to be good citizens\n• Succeed Together\no We are all part of the solution and help each other be successful\no We innovate by challenging the status quo, taking appropriate risk and encouraging diversity of\nthought\no We value and foster collaboration, both internally and with our external partners\no We work hard and find ways to make it fun\nOur Commitment to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\nWe are committed to creating and maintaining a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace where all of our\nemployees can thrive in an environment that values differences, provides equal opportunities and embraces\ndifferent backgrounds and perspectives. We treat all individuals with respect and dignity and provide all of our\nemployees with fair treatment based on merit. By embracing diversity and inclusion, we create an organization\ncommitted to working together to develop innovative solutions in support of our mission. Our core values include a\ncommitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion, and we have embraced them as integral parts of our business strategy.\nOur Compensation and Benefits\nWe view our employees as one of our most valuable assets in serving our mission. We compete in the highly\ncompetitive biotechnology industry, and attracting, retaining and developing a diverse group of talented\nemployees is crucial to our strategy and our ability to compete effectively. We are committed to the development\nand retention of our workforce to support our research, clinical operations, manufacturing and regulatory efforts.\nThere currently is a shortage of skilled individuals with substantial experience discovering, developing and\nmanufacturing genetic medicines, which is likely to continue. As a result, competition for these individuals is\nintense and the turnover rate can be high. We face substantial competition among numerous companies and\nacademic institutions for individuals with these skills.\nGiven the highly competitive nature of our industry and the importance of recruitment and retention to our\nsuccess, we strive to provide our employees with what we believe is a very competitive and comprehensive total\nrewards package of compensation, benefits and services. This package includes competitive market pay,\nhealthcare benefits for employees and family members, life insurance benefits, short and long-term disability\nbenefits, generous paid time off benefits, parental leave, bereavement leave, flexible work schedules, a 5%\nemployer match of employee contributions to our sponsored retirement plans, and an annual stipend for\n36\nemployees to spend on professional development. Additionally, we also offer every full-time employee the\nbenefit of equity ownership in our Company through our equity plans.\nThe compensation and benefits program is governed by our board of director’s Compensation Committee.\nSpecifically, the Compensation Committee, with advice from an independent executive compensation consulting\nfirm, determines compensation for the Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers, which includes an\nevaluation of market rates for all components of compensation.\nOur Compensation Committee and an independent executive compensation consulting firm also evaluate and\nrecommend the framework of compensation and benefit plans, as it relates to discretionary non-equity incentive\nplans and equity incentive plans, for non-executive officers. For non-executive officers, we utilize a third-party\nresource to evaluate market rates for base compensation.\nLegal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, we may be involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business.\nWe are currently a defendant in litigation with a former employee in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County\n(Commerce Division), or the Court, relating to a claim of breach of contract and violation of the Pennsylvania Wage\nPayment and Collection Law. The plaintiff claims that, pursuant to an alleged settlement agreement reached on\nFebruary 3, 2020, we agreed to issue plaintiff 150,000 shares of our common stock and that such shares would not be\nsubject to the reverse stock split implemented by us in connection with our initial public offering on February 14, 2020.\nThe plaintiff’s claim is for an amount in the mid-single digit millions of dollars. We disagree with the allegations that\nthere was ever a binding settlement agreement or that any shares would not be subject to the reverse stock split, and we\nbelieve the plaintiff’s claim is without merit. In October 2023, the Court denied both the Company’s and the plaintiff’s\nmotions for summary judgement and therefore we anticipate that this matter will go to trial in 2024. We intend to\nvigorously defend against these claims, and believe we have strong arguments to prevail in the litigation. There can be\nno assurance that we will prevail on our claims.\nOther than the above, we are not presently a party to any legal proceedings that, in the opinion of management, could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us due\nto defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, negative publicity and reputational harm, and other\nfactors.\nCorporate Information\nWe were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in July 2017 under the name Passage Bio, Inc.

Risk Factors\nRISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Before making your decision to invest in shares\nof our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with\nthe other information contained in this annual report, including our financial statements and the related notes\nand “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”. The risks and\nuncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are\nunaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that affect us. We\ncannot assure you that any of the events discussed below will not occur. These events could have a material\nand adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. If that were to\nhappen, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nWe are a clinical stage genetic medicines company with a history of operating losses, and we may not achieve or\nsustain profitability. We anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. Our limited\noperating history may make it difficult for you to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future\nviability.\nWe are a clinical stage genetic medicines company with a limited operating history on which to base your investment\ndecision. Biotechnology product development is a highly speculative undertaking and involves a substantial degree of\nrisk. Our operations to date have been limited primarily to staffing our company, business planning, raising capital,\nentering into collaboration and vendor agreements for conducting preclinical research and clinical development activities\nfor our product candidates, and performing clinical development activities and manufacturing clinical supply. All of our\nproduct candidates are in the clinical development stage, have been stopped from further clinical development in order to\nreduce operating expenditures, or are in the preclinical or discovery stage. We have no products approved for\ncommercial sale and have not generated any revenue from commercial product sales, and we will continue to incur\nsignificant research and development and other expenses related to our clinical development and ongoing operations. We\nhave funded our operations to date through proceeds from sales of our convertible preferred stock, and public offerings,\nand do not expect to receive revenue for many years, if ever.\nWe have incurred net losses since our inception in 2017. We incurred net losses of $102.1 million and $136.1 million for\nthe year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of\n$594.5 million. Substantially all of our operating losses have resulted from expenses incurred in connection with our\nresearch and development programs, acquiring the rights to our product candidates, and from general and administrative\nexpenses associated with our operations. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses over\nthe next several years and for the foreseeable future as we intend to continue to conduct research and development,\nclinical testing, regulatory compliance activities, manufacturing activities, and, if any of our product candidates is\napproved, sales and marketing activities that, together with anticipated general and administrative expenses, will likely\nresult in us incurring significant losses for the foreseeable future. Our prior losses, combined with expected future losses,\nhave had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders’ equity and working capital.\nWe expect that it will be several years, if ever, before we have a commercialized product. We anticipate that our\nexpenses will increase substantially if, and as, we:\n• advance our product candidates from the preclinical or discovery stage to the clinical development stage;\n• advance our clinical product candidates into later stage clinical development;\n• seek regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;\n• hire additional clinical, quality control, regulatory, manufacturing, scientific and administrative personnel;\n• expand our operational, financial and management systems and increase personnel, including personnel to\nsupport our clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization efforts;\n• expand or build our internal manufacturing capabilities;\n38\n• maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; and\n• incur additional legal, accounting or other expenses in operating our business, including the additional\ncosts associated with operating as a public company.\nIn addition, as a new business, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other\nknown and unknown factors.\nWe have never generated revenue from product sales and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe have no products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue from commercial product sales.\nTo become and remain profitable, we must develop and eventually commercialize product candidates with significant\nmarket potential, which will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities. These activities can include\ncompleting preclinical studies and initiating and completing clinical trials of our product candidates, obtaining marketing\napproval for these product candidates, manufacturing, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement from government\nand third-party payors, marketing, distributing, and selling those products that are approved and satisfying any post\nmarketing requirements. We may never succeed in any or all of these activities and, even if we do, we may never\ngenerate revenues that are significant or large enough to achieve profitability. Because of the numerous risks and\nuncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or\namount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve profitability.\nEven if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.\nOur failure to become and remain profitable would decrease the value of our company and could impair our ability to\nraise capital, maintain our research and development efforts, expand our business or continue our operations. A decline\nin the value of our company also could cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\nWe will need to raise additional funding before we can expect to become profitable from any potential future sales of\nour products. This additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Failure to obtain this\nnecessary capital when needed may force us to delay, limit, or terminate our product development efforts or other\noperations.\nWe will require substantial future capital in order to complete planned and future preclinical and clinical development\nfor our portfolio of product candidates and potentially commercialize these product candidates, if approved. If our\nproduct portfolio progresses into later stage clinical trials, or our current preclinical product candidates progress into the\nclinical trial stage, we expect our spending levels to significantly increase in connection with our continued clinical trial\nactivities and production of our clinical product candidates’ supply. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any\nof our product candidates, we expect to incur significant expenses related to product sales, medical affairs, marketing,\nmanufacturing and distribution. Furthermore, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public\ncompany. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing\noperations. Our ability to raise additional funds also depends on general financial, economic and market conditions as\nwell as other factors, including financial institutions that may experience insolvency or financial distress similar to that\nexperienced by both Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in March 2023, over which we may have no or limited\ncontrol. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on acceptable terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce or\neliminate certain of our licensing activities, our research and development programs or other operations.\nOur operations have consumed significant amounts of cash since inception. As of December 31, 2023, our cash, cash\nequivalents and marketable securities were $114.3 million. We expect that our existing cash, cash equivalents and\nmarketable securities will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the fourth\nquarter of 2025. However, we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and our operating\nplan may change as a result of factors currently unknown to us. As a result, we could deplete our capital resources\nsooner than we currently expect.\n39\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n• the scope, timing, progress and results of discovery, preclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical\ntrials for our product candidates;\n• the expenses of manufacturing our product candidates for clinical trials and in preparation for marketing\napproval and commercialization;\n• the extent to which we enter into collaborations or other arrangements with additional third parties in order\nto further develop our product candidates;\n• the expenses of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our\nintellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims;\n• the expenses and fees associated with the discovery, acquisition or in-license of additional product\ncandidates or technologies;\n• our ability to establish collaborations on favorable terms, if at all;\n• the expenses required to scale up our clinical, regulatory and manufacturing capabilities;\n• the expenses of future commercialization activities, if any, including establishing sales, marketing,\nmanufacturing and distribution capabilities, for any of our product candidates for which we receive\nmarketing approval;\n• the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from government and third-party payors for our\nproduct candidates for which we receive marketing approval; and\n• revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates, should any of our product\ncandidates receive marketing approval.\nAccordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives, which may not\nbe available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. We may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or\nstrategic considerations, even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. If adequate\nfunds are not available to us on a timely basis or on terms acceptable to us, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or\nterminate preclinical studies, clinical trials or other development activities for one or more product candidates or\ndiscovery stage programs or delay, limit, reduce or terminate our establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or\nother activities that may be necessary to commercialize any product candidates, if approved.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish\nrights to our technologies or product candidates.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a\ncombination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and marketing, distribution or\nlicensing arrangements. We do not have any committed external source of funds. To the extent that we raise additional\ncapital through the sale of equity or securities convertible into equity, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the\nterms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common\nstockholder. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants\nlimiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, selling or licensing our assets,\nmaking capital expenditures or declaring dividends.\nIf we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing\narrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams,\nresearch programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to\nraise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed or on terms acceptable to us, we may be required\nto delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to\ndevelop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\n40\nRisks Related to Product Development and Regulatory Approval\nPBFT02 is currently our sole clinical stage product candidate and we may not be able to successfully develop and\ncommercialize PBFT02.\nWe are currently dependent on the potential development of a single clinical product candidate, PBFT02. We are still\ndeveloping our sole clinical product candidate, and PBFT02 cannot be marketed or sold in the United States or in foreign\nmarkets until regulatory approval has been obtained from the FDA or applicable foreign regulatory agencies. The\nprocess of obtaining regulatory approval is expensive and time consuming. The FDA and foreign regulatory authorities\nmay never approve PBFT02 for sale and marketing, and even if PBFT02 is ultimately approved, regulatory approval\nmay be delayed or limited in the United States or in other jurisdictions. Even if we are authorized to sell and market\nPBFT02 in one or more markets, there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully market PBFT02 or that\nPBFT02 will achieve market acceptance sufficient to generate profits. If we are unable to successfully develop and\ncommercialize PBFT02 due to failure to obtain regulatory approval for PBFT02, to successfully market PBFT02, to\ngenerate profits from the sale of PBFT02, or due to other risk factors outlined in this report, it would have material\nadverse effects on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are early in our development efforts. Our business is dependent on our ability to advance our current and future\nproduct candidates through preclinical studies and clinical trials, obtain marketing approval and ultimately\ncommercialize them. If we are unable, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially\nharmed.\nWe are early in our clinical development efforts and our clinical product candidates are in early phase clinical trials.\nAdditionally, we have a portfolio of programs that are in different stages of preclinical development and some may never\nadvance to clinical stage development. Our ability to generate product revenue, which we do not expect will occur for\nmany years, if ever, will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of our product\ncandidates, which may never occur. We currently generate no revenue from sales of any product and we may never be\nable to develop or commercialize a marketable product.\nEach of our programs and product candidates will require additional preclinical and/or clinical development, regulatory\napproval in multiple jurisdictions, obtaining manufacturing supply, capacity and expertise, building a commercial\norganization or successfully outsourcing commercialization, substantial investment and significant marketing efforts\nbefore we generate any revenue from product sales. Our product candidates must be authorized for marketing by the\nFDA, or certain other ex-U.S. regulatory agencies before we may commercialize our product candidates.\nThe clinical and commercial success of our product candidates will depend on several factors, including the following:\n• timely and successful completion of preclinical studies, including toxicology studies, biodistribution\nstudies, biocompatibility studies and minimally efficacious dose studies in animals, where applicable;\n• effective INDs or comparable foreign applications that allow commencement of our planned clinical trials\nor future clinical trials for our product candidates;\n• successful enrollment and completion of clinical trials, including under the international current Good\nClinical Practices, or cGCPs, and current Good Laboratory Practices, or GLPs;\n• positive results from our current and future clinical programs that support a finding of safety and\neffectiveness and an acceptable benefit-risk profile of our product candidates in the intended populations;\n• receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;\n• establishment of arrangements with third-party manufacturers or our own facilities for clinical supply and,\nwhere applicable, commercial manufacturing capabilities;\n• establishment and maintenance of patent and trade secret protection or regulatory exclusivity for our\nproduct candidates;\n• commercial launch of our product candidates, if approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others;\n• acceptance of the benefits and use of our product candidates, including method of administration, if and\nwhen approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;\n41\n• effective competition with other therapies;\n• establishment and maintenance of healthcare coverage and adequate reimbursement and patients’\nwillingness to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of such coverage and adequate reimbursement;\n• establishment of a physician training system and network for administration of our product candidates by\nadministration into the ICM;\n• enforcement and defense of intellectual property rights and claims; and\n• maintenance of a continued acceptable safety, tolerability and efficacy profile of our product candidates\nfollowing approval.\nIf we do not succeed in one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays\nor an inability to successfully commercialize our product candidates, which would materially harm our business. If we\nare unable to advance our product candidates to clinical development, obtain regulatory approval and ultimately\ncommercialize our product candidates, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially\nharmed.\nPreclinical and clinical development involve a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome. We may\nincur additional expenses or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development\nand commercialization of our current product candidates or any future product candidates.\nAll of our product candidates are in clinical or preclinical development and their risk of failure is high. We also rely on\nthird-parties, and currently primarily GTP, for our preclinical and IND-enabling studies. It is impossible to predict when\nor if any of our product candidates will receive regulatory approval. To obtain the requisite regulatory approvals to\ncommercialize any product candidates, we must demonstrate through extensive preclinical studies and lengthy, complex\nand expensive clinical trials that our product candidates are safe and effective in humans. For example, our IND for\nPBGM01 for the treatment of GM1, for which, in order to reduce operating expenses, we have stopped further clinical\ndevelopment and are exploring out-licensing opportunities for this asset, was initially placed on clinical hold. Even\nthough the FDA removed the clinical hold on the IND for PBGM01, other future product candidates may be subject to\nclinical holds in the future. Clinical testing can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. We\nwill rely on contract laboratories and other third parties, or our CROs, for the clinical development of our clinical\nproduct candidates. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. The results of preclinical studies and\nearly clinical trials or early cohorts of our clinical trials of our product candidates, including early biomarker data, may\nnot be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials or later cohorts of our clinical trials. Early clinical trials and in\nparticular initial cohorts of early clinical trials often enroll significantly fewer patients than later stage clinical trials or\nlater cohorts of the same clinical trial and may not be as predictive as larger trials. We may be unable to establish clinical\nendpoints that applicable regulatory authorities would consider clinically meaningful or come to agreement on other\naspects of clinical trial design. Moreover, a clinical trial can fail at any stage of testing. Differences in trial design\nbetween early-stage clinical trials and later-stage clinical trials make it difficult to extrapolate the results of earlier\nclinical trials to later clinical trials. Moreover, clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses,\nand many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in clinical trials have\nnonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their products. A number of companies in the biotechnology industry\nhave suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or to unfavorable safety profiles,\nnotwithstanding promising results in earlier trials. There is typically a high rate of failure of product candidates\nproceeding through clinical trials. Most product candidates that commence clinical trials are never approved as products\nand there can be no assurance that any of our future clinical trials will ultimately be successful or support clinical\ndevelopment of our current or any of our future product candidates.\nWe or our collaborators may experience delays in initiating or completing clinical trials. We or our collaborators also\nmay experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, any future clinical trials that we could conduct that\ncould delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize our clinical product candidates or any\nfuture product candidates, including:\n• regulators, such as the FDA, may place our clinical trials on clinical hold;\n• institutional review boards, or IRBs, the FDA or ethics committees may not authorize us or our\ninvestigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n42\n• we may experience delays in reaching, or fail to reach, agreement on acceptable terms with prospective\ntrial sites and prospective CROs the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary\nsignificantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n• clinical trial sites deviating from trial protocol or dropping out of a trial;\n• novel therapies, such as gene therapies with less well-characterized safety profiles, may require slower or\nmore staggered early clinical trial enrollment to adequately assess safety data;\n• clinical trials of any product candidates may fail to show safety or efficacy, produce negative or\ninconclusive results and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional preclinical\nstudies or clinical trials or we may decide to abandon product development programs;\n• the number of subjects required for clinical trials of any product candidates may be larger than we\nanticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate or subjects may drop out of\nthese clinical trials or fail to return for post-treatment follow up at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n• our third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual\nobligations to us in a timely manner, or at all, or may deviate from the clinical trial protocol or drop out of\nthe trial, which may require that we add new clinical trial sites or investigators;\n• we may elect to, or regulators, IRBs, or ethics committees may require that we or our investigators,\nsuspend or terminate clinical research or trials for various reasons, including noncompliance with\nregulatory requirements or a finding that the participants in our trials are being exposed to unacceptable\nhealth risks;\n• the related expenses of clinical trials of any of our product candidates may be greater than we anticipate;\n• the quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product\ncandidates may be inadequate to initiate or complete a given clinical trial;\n• our inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of our product candidates for use in clinical trials;\n• reports from clinical testing of other therapies may raise safety or efficacy concerns about our product\ncandidates;\n• our failure to establish an appropriate safety profile for a product candidate based on clinical or preclinical\ndata for such product candidate as well as data emerging from other molecules in the same class as our\nproduct candidate; and\n• the FDA or ex-U.S. regulatory agencies may require us to submit additional data such as long-term\ntoxicology studies or impose other requirements before permitting us to initiate a clinical trial.\nPatient enrollment, a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials, is affected by many factors including: the size and\nnature of the patient population; the number and location of clinical sites we enroll; the proximity of patients to clinical\nsites; the eligibility and exclusion criteria for the trial; the design of the clinical trial; the inability to obtain and maintain\npatient consents; the risk that enrolled participants will drop out before completion; and competing clinical trials and\nclinicians’ and patients’ perceptions as to the potential advantages of the product candidate being studied in relation to\nother available therapies, including any new drugs or therapeutic biologics that may be approved for the indications\nbeing investigated by us. Furthermore, we expect to rely on our collaborators, CROs and clinical trial sites to ensure the\nproper and timely conduct of our future clinical trials, including the patient enrollment process, and we have limited\ninfluence over their performance. Additionally, we could encounter delays if treating physicians encounter unresolved\nethical issues associated with enrolling patients in future clinical trials of our product candidates in lieu of prescribing\nexisting treatments that have established safety and efficacy profiles. For example, treating physicians with eligible\npatients for our FTD trial may instead elect to use alternative treatment approaches from our competitors, if such\ncompetitors are to receive regulatory approval in advance of our program, in lieu of enrolling in our clinical trial.\nWe could also encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by us, the IRBs of the institutions in which\nsuch trials are being conducted, or the FDA or other regulatory authorities, or if a clinical trial is recommended for\nsuspension or termination by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee for such trial. A suspension or termination\nmay be imposed due to a number of factors, including: failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory\nrequirements or our clinical protocols; inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA or other\nregulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold; unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects;\nfailure to demonstrate a benefit from using a product or treatment; failure to establish or achieve clinically meaningful\ntrial endpoints; changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions; or lack of adequate funding to continue\n43\nthe clinical trial. Clinical studies may also be delayed or terminated as a result of ambiguous or negative interim results.\nMany of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also\nultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates. Further, the FDA or other regulatory\nauthorities may disagree with our clinical trial design and our interpretation of data from clinical trials, or may change\nthe requirements for approval even after they have reviewed and commented on the design for our clinical trials.\nOur product development expenses will increase if we experience delays in clinical testing or marketing approvals. We\ndo not know whether any of our clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on\nschedule, or at all. Significant clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the\nexclusive right to commercialize our product candidates and may allow our competitors to bring products to market\nbefore we do, potentially impairing our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and harming our\nbusiness and results of operations. Any delays in our clinical development programs may harm our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations significantly.\nSuccess in early preclinical studies or clinical trials may not be indicative of results obtained in later preclinical\nstudies and clinical trials.\nConducting preclinical testing is a lengthy, time-consuming and expensive process. The length of time of such testing\nmay vary substantially according to the type, complexity and novelty of the program, and often can be several years or\nmore per program. Delays associated with programs for which we are conducting preclinical testing and studies may\ncause us to incur additional operating expenses. We may experience unexpected or adverse results in our ongoing or\nfuture clinical trials. We will be required to demonstrate through adequately designed and executed clinical trials that our\nproduct candidates are safe and effective, with a favorable benefit-risk profile, for use in their target indications before\nwe can seek regulatory approvals for their commercial sale. Our initial clinical trials have started with relatively small\ncohorts before expanding in size in subsequent cohorts. If safety issues arise in an early cohort, we may be delayed or\nprevented from subsequently expanding into larger trial cohorts. Earlier gene therapy clinical trials conducted by others\nalso utilized AAV vectors. However, these studies should not be relied upon as evidence that our planned clinical trials\nwill succeed. Trial designs and results from previous trials are not necessarily predictive of our future clinical trial\ndesigns or results, and initial positive results we may observe may not be confirmed upon full analysis of the complete\ntrial data. In addition, the positive results we have observed for our product candidates in preclinical animal models may\nnot be predictive of our future clinical trials in humans. Our product candidates may also fail to show the desired safety\nand efficacy in later stages of clinical development even if they successfully advance through initial clinical trials.\nPreliminary, topline or interim data from our clinical trials that we or our partners announce or publish from time to\ntime may change as more patient data become available and are subject to audit and verification procedures that\ncould result in material changes in the final data.\nFrom time to time, we have made, and may continue to make, public preliminary, topline or interim data from our\nclinical trials, including preliminary biomarker data. Preliminary or topline data from clinical trials remain subject to\naudit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary or\ntopline data that were previously made public. Interim data from clinical trials that we may complete are also subject to\nthe risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as subject enrollment continues and more data\nbecome available. As a result, preliminary, topline and interim data should be viewed with caution until the final data are\navailable. Adverse differences between preliminary, topline or interim data and final data could significantly harm our\nreputation and business prospects.\nIf we do not achieve our projected development goals in the time frames we announce and expect, the\ncommercialization of our products may be delayed.\nFrom time to time, we estimate the timing of the accomplishment of various scientific, clinical, regulatory,\nmanufacturing and other product development goals, which we sometimes refer to as milestones. These milestones may\ninclude the commencement or completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials, the release of data from such studies\nand the submission of regulatory filings, including IND submissions. From time to time, we may publicly announce the\nexpected timing of some of these milestones. All of these milestones are, and will be, based on a variety of assumptions.\n44\nThe actual timing of these milestones can vary significantly compared to our estimates, in some cases for reasons beyond\nour control. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, any future clinical trials that we\nconduct that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize our product candidates.\nGene therapy is a novel technology, which makes it difficult to predict the time and cost of product candidate\ndevelopment and subsequently obtaining regulatory approval. Currently, only a limited number of gene therapy\nproducts have been approved in the United States and in foreign countries.\nOur current product candidates are based on gene therapy technology and our future success depends on the successful\ndevelopment of this novel therapeutic approach. The regulatory requirements that govern any novel gene therapy\nproduct candidates we develop are not entirely clear and are subject to change. The clinical study requirements of the\nFDA and ex-U.S. regulatory agencies and the criteria these regulators use to determine the safety and efficacy of a\nproduct candidate vary substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use and market of the\npotential products. The regulatory approval process for novel product candidates such as ours may be more expensive\nand take longer than for other, better known or extensively studied product candidates. Further, as we are developing\nnovel treatments for diseases in which there is little clinical experience with new endpoints and methodologies, there is\nheightened risk that the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory bodies may not consider the clinical trial endpoints to\nprovide clinically meaningful results, and the resulting clinical data and results may be more difficult to analyze. To\ndate, only a limited number of gene therapy products have been approved in the United States and foreign countries,\nwhich makes it difficult to determine how long it will take or how much it will cost to obtain regulatory approvals for\nour product candidates in the United States or other jurisdictions. Further, approvals by ex-U.S. regulatory agency may\nnot be indicative of what the FDA may require for approval, or vice versa.\nOur product candidates may cause undesirable and unforeseen side effects, which could delay or prevent their\nadvancement into clinical trials or regulatory approval, limit the commercial potential or result in significant negative\nconsequences.\nWhile new AAV vectors have been developed to reduce side effects previously reported in third-party gene therapy\ntreatments, gene therapy is still a relatively new approach to disease treatment and additional adverse side effects could\ndevelop. There also is the potential risk of delayed adverse events following exposure to gene therapy products due to\npersistent biologic activity of the genetic material or other components of products used to carry the genetic material.\nFor example, in our clinical study for PBKR03, for which, in order to reduce operating expenses, we have stopped\nfurther clinical development and are exploring out-licensing opportunities for this asset, a patient experienced a grade 4\nserious adverse event of acute communicating hydrocephalus. Additional possible adverse side effects that could occur\nwith treatment with gene therapy products include an immunologic reaction early after administration which, while not\nnecessarily adverse to the patient’s health, could substantially limit the effectiveness of the treatment. For example, in\nprevious third-party clinical trials involving AAV vectors for gene therapy, some subjects experienced the development\nof a T-cell immune response, whereby after the vector is within the target cells, the cellular immune response system\ntriggers the removal of transduced cells by activated T-cells. Other recent clinical trials involving high doses of AAV\nvectors have also resulted in liver damage and death. Further, following administration of any AAV vector, patients are\nlikely to develop neutralizing antibodies specific to the vector administered. Other preclinical studies have suggested that\nhigh dosages of AAV administration may result in toxicity due to degeneration of the dorsal root ganglia. Preliminary\nresults of our NHP toxicology studies for our PBGM01 and PBFT02 product candidates have demonstrated trigeminal\nganglia and dorsal root ganglia toxicity. Based on these results, and if our vectors demonstrate a similar effect in other\nprograms, we may decide or be required to perform additional preclinical studies or to halt or delay further clinical\ndevelopment of our product candidates.\nIn addition to side effects caused by the product candidate, the administration process or related procedures also can\ncause adverse side effects. Each of our clinical product candidates are expected to utilize ICM administration. While this\nmethod of administration has been available for decades, its use for therapies is relatively new, no therapies are currently\napproved using ICM administration, and it may be perceived as having greater risk than more common methods of\nadministration, such as intravenous injection. If any such adverse events occur, our clinical trials could be suspended or\nterminated. If we cannot demonstrate that any adverse events were not caused by the drug or administration process or\n45\nrelated procedures, the FDA or ex-U.S. regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of, or deny\napproval of, our product candidates for any or all targeted indications. Even if we are able to demonstrate that all future\nserious adverse events are not product related, such occurrences could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled\npatients to complete the trial. Moreover, if we elect, or are required, to not initiate, delay, suspend or terminate any\nfuture clinical trial of any of our product candidates, the commercial prospects of such product candidates may be\nharmed and our ability to generate product revenues from any of these product candidates may be delayed or eliminated.\nAny of these occurrences may harm our ability to develop other product candidates, and may harm our business,\nfinancial condition and prospects significantly.\nAdditionally, if any of our product candidates receives marketing approval, the FDA could require us to adopt a Risk\nEvaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh its risks, which may\ninclude, among other things, a Medication Guide outlining the risks of the product for distribution to patients and a\ncommunication plan to health care practitioners. Furthermore, if we or others later identify undesirable side effects\ncaused by our product candidate, several potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n• regulatory authorities may suspend or withdraw approvals of such product candidate;\n• regulatory authorities may require additional warnings in the labeling;\n• we may be required to change the way a product candidate is administered or conduct additional clinical\ntrials;\n• we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and\n• our reputation may suffer.\nAny of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly.\nAdverse public perception of genetic medicines may negatively impact regulatory approval of, and/or demand for, our\npotential products.\nRegulatory approval of and/or demand for our potential products will depend in part on public acceptance of the use of\ngenetic medicine for the prevention or treatment of human diseases. Public attitudes may be influenced by claims that\ngenetic medicines are unsafe, unethical or immoral, and consequently, our products may not gain the acceptance of the\npublic or the medical community. Adverse public attitudes may adversely impact our ability to enroll clinical trials.\nMoreover, our success will depend upon physicians prescribing, their patients being willing to receive, and third-party\npayors being willing to cover and reimburse for, treatments that involve the use of product candidates we may develop.\nThere have been several significant adverse side effects reported in genetic medicine treatments in the past. For example,\nin 1999, there was public backlash against gene therapy following the death of a clinical trial subject in a gene therapy\nclinical trial that utilized an adenovirus vector. It was later discovered that adenoviruses could generate an extreme\nimmune system reaction that can be life threatening. Dr. Wilson, our Chief Scientific Advisor, was a co-investigator of\nthe 1999 trial while he was Director of the Institute for Human Gene Therapy of Penn. Serious adverse events in our\nclinical trials, or other clinical trials involving gene therapy by us or our competitors, even if not ultimately attributable\nto the relevant product candidates, and the resulting publicity, could result in increased government regulation,\nunfavorable public perception and potential regulatory delays in the clinical testing or approval of our product\ncandidates.\nAs an organization, we have limited experience designing and implementing clinical trials and we have never\nconducted pivotal clinical trials. Failure to adequately design a trial, or incorrect assumptions about the design of the\ntrial, could adversely affect the ability to initiate the trial, enroll patients, complete the trial, or obtain regulatory\napproval on the basis of the trial results, as well as lead to increased or unexpected costs.\nThe design and implementation of clinical trials is a complex process. As an organization, we have limited experience\ndesigning and implementing clinical trials, and we may not successfully or cost effectively design and implement\nclinical trials that achieve our desired clinical endpoints efficiently, or at all. A clinical trial that is not well designed may\ndelay or even prevent initiation of the trial, can lead to increased difficulty in enrolling patients, may make it more\ndifficult to obtain regulatory approval for the product candidate on the basis of the study results, or, even if a product\n46\ncandidate is approved, could make it more difficult to commercialize the product successfully or obtain reimbursement\nfrom third-party payors. Additionally, a trial that is not well designed could be inefficient or more expensive than it\notherwise would have been, or we may incorrectly estimate the related expenses to implement the clinical trial, which\ncould lead to a shortfall in funding.\nCertain disorders we seek to treat have low incidence and prevalence, and it may be difficult to identify patients with\nthese disorders, which may lead to delays in enrollment for our trials or slower commercial revenue if approved.\nGenetically defined disorders generally, and especially those for which certain of our current product candidates are\ntargeted, have low incidence and prevalence. For example, we estimate the prevalence of FTD-GRN deficiency in the\nUnited States and Europe is approximately 18,000. This could be a significant obstacle to the timely recruitment and\nenrollment of a sufficient number of eligible patients into our trial. Further, we expect to rely in part on our relationships\nwith patient advocacy groups to assist in identifying eligible patients, and any deterioration of those relationships could\nimpede our ability to successfully enroll patients. Patient enrollment may be affected by other factors including:\n• the severity of the disease under investigation;\n• design of the study protocol;\n• the eligibility criteria for the trial;\n• the perceived risks, benefits and convenience of administration of the product candidate being studied;\n• our efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials;\n• the availability of other clinical trials being conducted for the same indication;\n• the patient referral practices of physicians; and\n• the proximity and availability of clinical trial sites to prospective patients.\nOur inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients with these diseases for our planned clinical trials, including FTD-\nGRN, would result in significant delays and could require us to not initiate or abandon one or more clinical trials\naltogether. Enrollment delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates,\nwhich would cause the value of our company to decline and limit our ability to obtain additional financing.\nAdditionally, our projections of the number of people who have these disorders, including FTD-GRN, are based on\nestimates, including third-party analyses commissioned by us. The total addressable market opportunity for our product\ncandidates will ultimately depend upon, among other things, the final approved product labeling for each of our product\ncandidates, if our product candidates are approved for sale in our target indications, acceptance by the medical\ncommunity and patient access, drug pricing and reimbursement. The number of patients globally may turn out to be\nlower than expected, patients may not be otherwise amenable to treatment with our products, or new patients may\nbecome increasingly difficult to identify or gain access to, all of which would adversely affect our results of operations\nand our business. Our products may potentially be dosed on a one-time basis, which means that patients who enroll in\nour clinical trials may not be eligible to receive our products on a commercial basis if they are approved, leading to\nlower revenue potential.\nEven if we complete the necessary clinical trials, we cannot predict when, or if, we will receive regulatory approval to\ncommercialize a product candidate and the approval may be for a more narrow indication than we seek.\nPrior to commercialization, our product candidates must be approved by the FDA pursuant to a BLA in the United States\nand by similar ex-U.S. regulatory authorities. The process of obtaining marketing approvals, both in the United States\nand abroad, is expensive and takes many years, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon a\nvariety of factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. Failure to obtain\nmarketing approval for a product candidate will prevent us from commercializing the product candidate. We have not\nreceived approval to market any of our product candidates from regulatory authorities in any jurisdiction. Our company\ndoes not have experience in submitting and supporting the applications necessary to gain marketing approvals. Securing\nmarketing approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to\nregulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate’s safety and efficacy. Securing\nmarketing approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and\ninspection of manufacturing facilities by, the regulatory authorities. Our product candidates may not be effective, may be\n47\nonly moderately effective or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics\nthat may preclude our obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use. Regulatory authorities have\nsubstantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data are\ninsufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. In addition, varying interpretations\nof the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent marketing approval of a product\ncandidate.\nApproval of our product candidates may be delayed or refused for many reasons, including the following:\n• the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of\nour clinical trials, including the methods for collecting and analyzing data, the statistical analysis plan, and\nthe lack of a concurrent control arm or a decision to use external or historical controls;\n• the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may not agree that the efficacy endpoints used in our\nclinical trials are appropriate to establish clinical benefit in the intended populations;\n• we may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory\nauthorities that our product candidates are safe and effective for any of their proposed indications;\n• development of products for ultra rare diseases may involve the use of natural history data as an external\ncontrol. We may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory\nauthorities that the control arm(s) are adequate to establish the safety and/or effectiveness of our product\ncandidates;\n• the results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or\ncomparable foreign regulatory authorities for approval;\n• we may be unable to demonstrate to the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities a durable\nresponse to our product candidates;\n• we may be unable to demonstrate that our product candidates’ clinical and other benefits outweigh their\nsafety risks;\n• the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from\npreclinical programs or clinical trials;\n• the data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates may not be sufficient to support the\nsubmission of a BLA or other comparable submission in foreign jurisdictions or to obtain regulatory\napproval in the United States or elsewhere;\n• the facilities of the third-party manufacturers with which we contract may not be adequate to support\napproval of our product candidates;\n• the approval policies or regulations of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may\nsignificantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval; and\n• even if our product candidates meet their safety and efficacy endpoints in clinical trials, the regulatory\nauthorities may not complete their review processes in a timely manner, or we may not be able to obtain\nregulatory approval. Additional delays may result if an FDA Advisory Committee or other regulatory\nauthority recommends non-approval or restrictions on approval. In addition, we may experience delays or\nrejections based upon additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action, or\nchanges in regulatory authority policy during the period of product development, clinical trials and the\nreview process.\nRegulatory authorities also may approve a product candidate for more limited indications than requested or they may\nimpose significant limitations in the form of narrow indications, warnings or REMS. These regulatory authorities may\nrequire precautions or contra indications with respect to conditions of use or they may grant approval subject to the\nperformance of costly post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, regulatory authorities may not approve the product\nlabeling claims that are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our product candidates. Any of\nthe foregoing scenarios could materially harm the commercial prospects for our product candidates and materially and\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nFurther, the regulatory authorities may require concurrent approval of a companion diagnostic device. For our product\ncandidates, it may be necessary to use FDA-cleared or FDA-approved diagnostic tests to diagnose patients or to assure\n48\nthe safe and effective use of product candidates in trial subjects. The FDA refers to such tests as in vitro companion\ndiagnostic devices. The FDA has issued guidance describing the agency’s current thinking about the development and\nregulation of in vitro companion diagnostic devices. The final guidance articulates a policy position that, when an in\nvitro diagnostic device is essential to the safe and effective use of a therapeutic product, the FDA generally will require\napproval or clearance of the diagnostic device at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product. At this\npoint, it is unclear how the FDA will apply this policy to our current or future gene therapy product candidates. Should\nthe FDA deem genetic tests used for diagnosing patients for our therapies to be in vitro companion diagnostics requiring\nFDA clearance or approval, we may face significant delays or obstacles in obtaining approval of a BLA for our product\ncandidates.\nThe FDA and ex-U.S. regulatory agencies have demonstrated caution in their regulation of gene therapy treatments.\nEthical and legal concerns about gene therapy and genetic testing may result in additional regulations or restrictions\non the development and commercialization of our product candidates, which may be difficult to predict.\nThe FDA and ex-U.S. regulatory agencies at both the federal and state level in the United States, U.S. congressional\ncommittees, and foreign governments, have expressed interest in further regulating the biotechnology industry, including\ngene therapy and genetic testing. Any such further regulation may delay or prevent commercialization of some or all of\nour product candidates.\nRegulatory requirements in the United States and abroad governing gene therapy products have changed frequently and\nmay continue to change in the future. In addition to the FDA, the Institutional Biosafety Committee and IRB of each\ninstitution at which we conduct our planned clinical trials, would need to review the proposed clinical trial to assess the\nsafety of the trial. Within the FDA, the Office of Tissues and Advanced Therapies, within the Center for Biologics\nEvaluation and Research, or CBER, consolidates the review of gene therapy and related products, and the Cellular,\nTissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee advises CBER on its review. Adverse developments in clinical trials of\ngene therapy products conducted by others may cause the FDA or other oversight bodies to change the requirements for\napproval of any of our product candidates.\nThese regulatory review committees and advisory groups and the new guidelines they promulgate may lengthen the\nregulatory review process, require us to perform additional studies or trials, increase our development costs, lead to\nchanges in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization of our product\ncandidates or lead to significant post-approval limitations or restrictions. As we advance our product candidates, we will\nbe required to consult with these regulatory and advisory groups and comply with applicable guidelines. If we fail to do\nso, we may be required to delay or discontinue development of such product candidates. These additional processes may\nresult in a review and approval process that is longer than we otherwise would have expected. Delays as a result of an\nincreased or lengthier regulatory approval process or further restrictions on the development of our product candidates\ncan be costly and could negatively impact our ability to complete clinical trials and commercialize our current and future\nproduct candidates in a timely manner, if at all.\nChanges in funding for the FDA and other government agencies could hinder their ability to hire and retain key\nleadership and other personnel, or otherwise prevent new products and services from being developed or\ncommercialized in a timely manner, which could negatively impact our business.\nThe ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including\ngovernment budget and funding levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and\nstatutory, regulatory, and policy changes. In addition, government funding of other government agencies that fund\nresearch and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable.\nDisruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new drugs to be reviewed and/or\napproved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. For example, over the last\nseveral years, including for 35 days beginning on December 22, 2018, the U.S. government has shut down several times\nand certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, have had to furlough critical FDA employees and stop important\nactivities. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely\nreview and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n49\nFailure to obtain marketing approval in foreign jurisdictions would prevent our product candidates from being\nmarketed abroad and will limit our ability to realize their full market potential.\nIn order to eventually market any of our product candidates in any particular foreign jurisdiction, we must establish and\ncomply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis regarding safety and\nefficacy. Approval by the FDA in the United States, if obtained, does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in\nother countries or jurisdictions. In addition, clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory\nauthorities in other countries, and regulatory approval in one country does not guarantee regulatory approval in any other\ncountry. Approval processes vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and validation and\nadditional administrative review periods. Seeking foreign regulatory approval could result in difficulties and costs for us\nand require additional preclinical studies or clinical trials which could be costly and time-consuming. Regulatory\nrequirements can vary widely from country to country and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in\nthose countries. The foreign regulatory approval process involves all of the risks associated with FDA approval. In\naddition, gene therapy products are considered genetically modified organism, or GMO, products and are regulated as\nsuch in each country. Designation of the type of GMO product and subsequent handling and disposal requirements can\nvary across countries and is variable throughout the European Union. Addressing each specific country requirement and\nobtaining approval to commence a clinical trial in these countries could result in delays in starting, conducting, or\ncompleting a clinical trial. We do not have any product candidates approved for sale in any jurisdiction, including\ninternational markets, and we do not have experience in obtaining regulatory approval in international markets and\nexpect to rely on third-party consultants. If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements in international markets or to\nobtain and maintain required approvals, or if regulatory approvals in international markets are delayed, our target market\nwill be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our products will be unrealized.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to build a pipeline of additional product candidates.\nOur business model is centered on developing therapies for patients with CNS disorders by establishing focused\nselection criteria to select, develop and advance product candidates that we believe will have a high probability of\ntechnical and regulatory success through development into commercialization. We may not be able to continue to\nidentify and develop new product candidates in addition to the pipeline of product candidates that we have established\nthrough our collaboration with GTP. Even if we are successful in continuing to build our pipeline, the potential product\ncandidates that we identify may not be suitable for clinical development. For example, they may be shown to have\nharmful side effects or other characteristics that indicate that they are unlikely to be drugs that will receive marketing\napproval and achieve market acceptance. If we do not successfully develop and commercialize product candidates based\nupon our approach, we will not be able to obtain product revenue in future periods, which likely would result in\nsignificant harm to our financial position and adversely affect our stock price.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties\nWe currently rely on our collaboration with GTP, for many aspects of our preclinical research and development\nprograms, including for discovering, preclinically developing and conducting IND-enabling studies for our clinical\nproduct candidates and our near-term future pipeline of product candidates. Failure or delay of GTP to fulfill all or\npart of its obligations to us under the agreement, a breakdown in collaboration between the parties or a complete or\npartial loss of this relationship could materially harm our business.\nOur collaboration with GTP has been critical to the development of our current clinical pipeline. We entered into an\namended and restated Research, Collaboration & License Agreement in May 2020, as subsequently amended, or the\nPenn Agreement, with GTP to discover and develop certain AAV vector based therapeutics, and the products developed\nunder such collaboration currently represent all of our product pipeline and research programs. We currently rely on\nGTP for preclinical research and development capabilities for new product candidates. Pursuant to the Penn Agreement,\nGTP is responsible for discovery, preclinical development activities, including IND-enabling non-clinical studies and\nresearch grade manufacturing, and other collaborative activities set forth in the plan for the funded research. Either party\nhas the right in certain circumstances to terminate the collaboration pursuant to the terms of the Penn Agreement. If GTP\ndelays or fails to perform its obligations under the Penn Agreement, disagrees with our interpretation of the terms of the\n50\ncollaboration or our discovery plan or terminates our existing agreement, our future pipeline of product candidates could\nbe significantly adversely affected and our prospects will be materially harmed.\nThe term of the research funding portion of the Penn Agreement, under which we have the ability to acquire exclusive\nrights to additional gene therapy products for CNS indications, expires in August 2026. In addition, the discovery\nprogram, under which we have rights to new technologies for our product candidates is currently also set to expire in\nAugust 2026. The term of the exploratory research program in large indications expires in August 2024. If we seek to\nextend or alter the terms of our collaboration, we will need to negotiate a new or amended agreement, which may not be\navailable to us on equally favorable terms, if at all. GTP has also entered into collaborations with third parties, including\ncertain of our competitors, addressing targets and disease indications outside the scope of our collaboration. As a result,\nGTP may have competing interests with respect to their priorities and resources. We may have disagreements with GTP\nwith respect to the interpretation of the Penn Agreement, use of resources or otherwise that could cause our relationship\nwith GTP to deteriorate. As a result, GTP may reduce their focus on, and resources allocated to, our programs,\npotentially delaying or terminating our ability to advance product candidates through preclinical studies. Additionally, if\nDr. Wilson were to leave GTP or to otherwise no longer be meaningfully involved with us, our preclinical research and\ndevelopment capabilities may be substantially reduced.\nFurther, under the Penn Agreement, GTP is primarily responsible for prosecuting and maintaining our licensed\nintellectual property, and it may fail to properly prosecute, maintain or defend such intellectual property. In such event,\nif we are unable to otherwise maintain or defend such intellectual property, we could face the potential invalidation of\nthe intellectual property or be subjected to litigation or arbitration, any of which would be time-consuming and\nexpensive. To enforce the licensed intellectual property rights under the Penn Agreement, we will need to coordinate\nwith GTP, which could slow down or hamper our ability to enforce our licensed intellectual property rights. In such\nevent, we could face increased competition that could materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials and rely on them to perform other tasks\nfor us. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or comply\nwith regulatory requirements, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product\ncandidates and our business could be substantially harmed.\nAlthough we have recruited a team that has experience with clinical trials, as a company we have limited experience in\nconducting clinical trials. Moreover, we currently rely on third-parties, currently primarily GTP, for our discovery and\ncertain of our preclinical research and will continue to rely upon medical institutions, clinical investigators, and CROs to\nconduct clinical trials for our product candidates. We expect to rely heavily on these parties for execution of preclinical\nand clinical trials for our product candidates and control only certain aspects of their activities. If these parties reduce the\nlevels of efforts and resources to our product candidate activities, prioritize work with a competitor of ours or if a dispute\nwere to arise between us and these parties, they may not meet our expected deadlines or provide us with sufficient\nmaterials for our regulatory filings. Nevertheless, we will be responsible for ensuring that each of our preclinical and\nclinical trials is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal and regulatory requirements and scientific\nstandards and our reliance on CROs will not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. For any violations of laws and\nregulations during the conduct of our preclinical studies and clinical trials, we could be subject to warning letters or\nenforcement action that may include civil penalties up to and including criminal prosecution.\nWe, GTP, and our CROs will be required to comply with regulations, including cGCPs for conducting, monitoring,\nrecording and reporting the results of preclinical and clinical trials to ensure that the data and results are scientifically\ncredible and accurate and that the trial patients are adequately informed of the potential risks of participating in clinical\ntrials and their rights are protected. These regulations are enforced by the FDA, the Competent Authorities of the\nMember States of the European Economic Area and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for any drugs in clinical\ndevelopment. The FDA enforces cGCP regulations through periodic inspections of clinical trial sponsors, principal\ninvestigators, and trial sites. If we or our CROs fail to comply with applicable cGCPs, the clinical data generated in our\nclinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to\nperform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that, upon\ninspection, the FDA will determine that any of our future clinical trials will comply with cGCPs. In addition, our clinical\ntrials must be conducted with product candidates produced in accordance with the requirements in the current Good\n51\nManufacturing Practices, or cGMP regulations. Our failure or the failure of our CROs to comply with these regulations\nmay require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process and could also subject us to\nenforcement action.\nAlthough we currently design and intend to continue designing our planned clinical trials for our product candidates, for\nthe foreseeable future CROs will conduct all of our planned clinical trials. As a result, many important aspects of our\ndevelopment programs, including their conduct and timing, will be outside of our direct control. Our reliance on third\nparties to conduct future preclinical studies and clinical trials will also result in less day-to-day control over the\nmanagement of data developed through preclinical studies and clinical trials than would be the case if we were relying\nentirely upon our own staff.\nIf any of our relationships with these third-party CROs terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with\nalternative CROs. If CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected\ndeadlines, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to\nthe failure to adhere to our clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, any preclinical studies or\nclinical trials with which such CROs are associated with may be extended, delayed or terminated. In such cases, we may\nnot be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates. As a result, our\nfinancial results and the commercial prospects for our product candidates in the subject indication could be harmed, our\ncosts could increase and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials. If those third parties do not perform as contractually required,\nfail to satisfy legal or regulatory requirements, miss expected deadlines or terminate the relationship, our\ndevelopment program could be delayed with potentially material and adverse effects on our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe rely on third-party clinical investigators, CROs, clinical data management organizations and consultants to assist or\nprovide the design, conduct, supervision and monitoring of clinical trials of our product candidates. Because we rely and\nintend to rely on these third parties and will not have the ability to conduct all clinical trials independently, we will have\nless control over the timing, quality and other aspects of clinical trials than we would have had we conducted them on\nour own. These investigators, CROs and consultants will not be our employees and we will have limited control over the\namount of time and resources that they dedicate to our programs. These third parties may have contractual relationships\nwith other entities, some of which may be our competitors, which may draw time and resources from our programs. The\nthird parties with which we may contract might not be diligent, careful or timely in conducting our clinical trials,\nresulting in the clinical trials being delayed or unsuccessful.\nIf we cannot contract with acceptable third parties on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or if these third parties do\nnot carry out their contractual duties, satisfy legal and regulatory requirements for the conduct of preclinical studies or\nclinical trials or meet expected deadlines, our clinical development programs could be delayed and otherwise adversely\naffected. In all events, we will be responsible for ensuring that each of our preclinical studies and clinical trials are\nconducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial as well as applicable legal and\nregulatory requirements. The FDA generally requires preclinical studies to be conducted in accordance with GLPs and\nclinical trials to be conducted in accordance with cGCPs, including for designing, conducting, recording and reporting\nthe results of preclinical studies and clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and\nthat the rights, integrity and confidentiality of clinical trial participants are protected. Our reliance on third parties that\nwe do not control will not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements. Any adverse development or delay in our\npreclinical studies or clinical trials as a result of our reliance on third parties could have a material and adverse effect on\nour business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIf any of our relationships with these third-party CROs or others terminate, we may not be able to enter into alternative\narrangements or to do so on commercially reasonable terms. Switching or adding additional CROs involves additional\ncost and requires management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO begins\nwork. As a result, delays may occur, which can materially adversely impact our ability to meet our desired clinical\ndevelopment timelines.\n52\nWe may in the future enter into collaborations with other third parties for the discovery, development and\ncommercialization of our product candidates. If any of our current or future collaborators cease development efforts\nunder our collaboration agreements, or if any of those agreements are terminated, these collaborations may fail to\nlead to commercial products and we may never receive milestone payments or future royalties under these\nagreements.\nWe may in the future enter into third-party collaborations for research, development and commercialization of other\ntherapeutic technologies or product candidates. Biotechnology companies are our likely future collaborators for any\nmarketing, distribution, development, licensing or broader collaboration arrangements.\nWith any future collaboration agreements, we expect to have limited control over the amount and timing of resources\nthat our collaborators dedicate to the development or commercialization of our product candidates. Moreover, our ability\nto generate revenues from these arrangements will depend on our collaborators’ abilities to successfully perform the\nfunctions assigned to them in these arrangements.\nOur potential future collaborations involving our product candidates may pose the following risks to us:\n• collaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to\nthese collaborations;\n• collaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of our product candidates or may elect\nnot to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on preclinical studies or\nclinical trial results, changes in the collaborators’ strategic focus or available funding, or external factors\nsuch as an acquisition that diverts resources or creates competing priorities;\n• collaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a\nclinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new\nformulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n• collaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or\nindirectly with our product candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely\nto be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive\nthan ours;\n• collaborators with marketing and distribution rights to one or more products may not commit sufficient\nresources to the marketing and distribution of such product or products;\n• collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our\nproprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our\nintellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to litigation or potential liability;\n• collaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to\nlitigation, indemnification obligations and potential liability;\n• disputes may arise between the collaborators and us that result in the delay or termination of the research,\ndevelopment or commercialization of our product candidates or that result in costly litigation or arbitration\nthat diverts management attention and resources; collaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may\nresult in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable\nproduct candidates;\n• if a present or future collaborator of ours were to be involved in a business combination, the continued\npursuit and emphasis on our product development or commercialization program under such collaboration\ncould be delayed, diminished or terminated; and\n• collaboration agreements may restrict our right to independently pursue new product candidates.\nAs a result of the foregoing, any future collaboration agreements may not lead to development or commercialization of\nour product candidates in the most efficient manner or at all. If a collaborator of ours were to be involved in a business\ncombination, the continued pursuit and emphasis on our product development or commercialization program could be\ndelayed, diminished or terminated. Any failure to successfully develop or commercialize our product candidates\npursuant to our current or any future collaboration agreements could have a material and adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n53\nMoreover, to the extent that any of our existing or future collaborators were to terminate a collaboration agreement, we\nmay be forced to independently develop our product candidates and research programs, including funding preclinical\nstudies or clinical trials, assuming marketing and distribution costs and maintaining and defending intellectual property\nrights, or, in certain instances, abandon product candidates altogether, any of which could result in a change to our\nbusiness plan and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may not be successful in finding additional collaborators for continuing development of certain of our product\ncandidates or successfully commercializing or competing in the market for certain indications.\nWe may decide to pursue collaborations with additional pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for the\ndevelopment and potential commercialization of some of our product candidates. In particular, we recently announced\nthat we are pursuing potential out-licensing opportunities for our pediatric portfolio of clinical programs including GM1,\nKrabbe, and MLD. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Any new collaboration may be\non terms that are not optimal for us, and we may not be able to maintain any new collaboration if, for example,\ndevelopment or approval of a product candidate is delayed, sales of an approved product candidate do not meet\nexpectations or the collaborator terminates the collaboration. In addition, a significant number of recent business\ncombinations among large pharmaceutical companies has resulted in a reduced number of potential future collaborators.\nWhether we reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of\nthe collaborator’s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed\ncollaborator’s evaluation of a number of factors. Those factors may include the design or results of clinical trials, the\nlikelihood of approval by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States, the potential market for the\nsubject product candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such product candidate to patients,\nthe potential of competing drugs, the existence of uncertainty with respect to our ownership of technology, which can\nexist if there is a challenge to such ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge and industry and market\nconditions generally. The collaborator may also consider alternative product candidates or technologies for similar\nindications that may be available to collaborate on and whether such a collaboration could be more attractive than the\none with us for our product candidate. The terms of any additional collaborations or other arrangements that we may\nestablish may not be favorable to us.\nWe may also be restricted under existing collaboration agreements from entering into future agreements on certain terms\nwith potential collaborators. Collaborations are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document. In addition,\nthere have been a significant number of recent business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have\nresulted in a reduced number of potential future collaborators.\nWe may not be able to negotiate additional collaborations on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are\nunable to do so, we may have to curtail the development of the product candidate for which we are seeking to\ncollaborate, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay its\npotential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and\nundertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to\nfund development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional capital, which may not\nbe available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we may not be able to further develop\nour product candidates or bring them to market and generate product revenue.\nWe may have conflicts with our collaborators that could delay or prevent the development or commercialization of\nour product candidates.\nWe may have conflicts with our collaborators, including GTP, such as conflicts concerning the interpretation of\npreclinical or clinical data, the achievement of milestones, the interpretation of contractual obligations, payments for\nservices, development obligations or the ownership of intellectual property developed during our collaboration. If any\nconflicts arise with any of our collaborators, such collaborator may act in a manner that is adverse to our best interests.\nAny such disagreement could result in one or more of the following, each of which could delay or prevent the\ndevelopment or commercialization of our product candidates, and in turn prevent us from generating revenues:\nunwillingness on the part of a collaborator to pay us milestone payments or royalties we believe are due to us under a\ncollaboration, which could require us to raise additional capital; uncertainty regarding ownership of intellectual property\n54\nrights arising from our collaborative activities, which could prevent us from entering into additional collaborations;\nunwillingness by the collaborator to cooperate in the development or manufacture of the product, including providing us\nwith product data or materials; unwillingness on the part of a collaborator to keep us informed regarding the progress of\nits development and commercialization activities or to permit public disclosure of the results of those activities; initiating\nof litigation or alternative dispute resolution options by either party to resolve the dispute; or attempts by either party to\nterminate the relevant agreement.\nWe may in the future seek to engage in strategic transactions to acquire or in-license new products, product\ncandidates or technologies. If we are unable to successfully complete, or realize the benefits from, such transactions it\nmay adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize product candidates, impact our cash position, increase\nour expenses and present significant distractions to our management.\nFrom time to time, we may consider strategic transactions, such as additional collaborations, acquisitions of companies,\nasset purchases, joint ventures and in-licensing of new products, product candidates or technologies that we believe will\ncomplement or augment our existing business. If we acquire assets with promising markets or technologies, we may not\nbe able to realize the benefit of acquiring such assets if we are not able to successfully integrate them with our existing\ntechnologies. We may encounter numerous difficulties in developing, testing, manufacturing and marketing any new\nproducts resulting from a strategic acquisition that delay or prevent us from realizing their expected benefits or\nenhancing our business.\nWe cannot assure you that following any such strategic transaction, we will achieve the expected synergies to justify the\ntransaction. For example, such transactions may require us to incur non-recurring or other charges, increase our near-\nand long-term expenditures and pose significant integration or implementation challenges or disrupt our management or\nbusiness. These transactions would entail numerous operational and financial risks, including exposure to unknown\nliabilities, disruption of our business and diversion of our management’s time and attention in order to manage a\ncollaboration or develop acquired products, product candidates or technologies, incurrence of substantial debt or dilutive\nissuances of equity securities to pay transaction consideration or costs, higher than expected acquisition or integration\ncosts, write-downs of assets or goodwill or impairment charges, increased amortization expenses, difficulty and cost in\nfacilitating the transaction or combining the operations and personnel of any acquired business, impairment of\nrelationships with key suppliers, manufacturers or customers of any acquired business due to changes in management\nand ownership and the inability to retain key employees of any acquired business.\nAccordingly, although there can be no assurance that we will undertake or successfully complete any transactions of the\nnature described above, any transactions that we do complete may be subject to the foregoing or other risks and would\nhave a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Conversely,\nany failure to enter any strategic transaction that would be beneficial to us could delay the development and potential\ncommercialization of our product candidates and have a negative impact on the competitiveness of any product\ncandidate that reaches market.\nRisks Related to Manufacturing\nGene therapies are novel, complex and difficult to manufacture. We could experience manufacturing problems that\nresult in delays in our development or commercialization programs or otherwise harm our business.\nWe currently rely on third parties to develop, manufacture and test clinical supplies of our product candidates, including\nthe materials used to administer our product candidates. For our initial clinical trials, we rely on the manufacturing\nfacility of Catalent Maryland, a unit of Catalent, Inc., or Catalent, for supply of our product candidates. We have limited\nexperience as a company in developing manufacturing facilities. If or when we decide to construct our own\nmanufacturing facility for long-term commercial market supply, we may face delays in building out a plant, constructing\nnew facilities, transferring technology to the facilities or hiring experts to staff and operate the facilities and,\naccordingly, our production capacity could be limited. We have established internal testing operations supporting our\npreclinical and clinical manufacturing in addition to using external contract testing labs and established analytical\ndevelopment and process development capabilities to support our pipeline. The manufacturing processes used to produce\nour product candidates are complex, novel and have not been validated for commercial use. Many factors could cause\n55\nproduction interruptions, including equipment malfunctions, facility contamination, raw material shortages or\ncontamination, natural disasters, disruption in utility services, human error or disruptions in the operations of our\nsuppliers.\nOur product candidates require processing steps that are more complex than those required for most small molecule\ndrugs. Moreover, unlike small molecules, the physical and chemical properties of a biologic such as ours generally\ncannot be fully characterized. As a result, assays of the finished product may not be sufficient to ensure that the product\nis consistent from lot-to-lot or will perform in the intended manner. Accordingly, we employ multiple steps to control\nthe manufacturing process to assure that the process works consistently and the product candidate is made strictly and\nconsistently in compliance with the process. Problems with the manufacturing process, even minor deviations from the\nnormal process, could result in product defects or manufacturing failures that result in lot failures, low lot yields, product\nrecalls, product liability claims or insufficient inventory. As a result, we may encounter problems achieving adequate\nquantities and quality of clinical-grade materials that meet the FDA or other applicable standards or specifications with\nconsistent and acceptable production yields and costs.\nIn addition, the FDA and ex-U.S. regulatory authorities may require us to submit samples of any lot of any approved\nproduct together with the protocols showing the results of applicable tests at any time. Under some circumstances, the\nFDA or ex-U.S. regulatory authorities may require that we not distribute a lot until the agency authorizes its release.\nSlight deviations in the manufacturing process, including those affecting quality attributes and stability, may result in\nunacceptable changes in the product that could result in lot failures, low lot yields or product recalls. Lot failures, low lot\nyields or product recalls could cause us to delay product launches or clinical trials, which could be costly to us and\notherwise harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe, or our third-party collaborators, also may encounter problems hiring and retaining the experienced scientific,\nquality-control and manufacturing personnel needed to operate our manufacturing processes, which could result in\ndelays in production or difficulties in maintaining compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.\nAny problems in our, or our third-party collaborators’, manufacturing process or facilities could result in delays in our\nplanned clinical trials and increased costs, and could make us a less attractive collaborator for potential partners,\nincluding larger biotechnology companies and academic research institutions, which could limit our access to additional\nattractive development programs. It could also require us to find alternative manufacturing processes, which may be\nunavailable to us on attractive terms, or at all. Problems in our manufacturing process could restrict our ability to meet\npotential future market demand for our products.\nChanges in methods of product candidate manufacturing or formulation may result in additional costs or delay.\nAs product candidates proceed through preclinical studies to late-stage clinical trials towards potential approval and\ncommercialization, it is common that various aspects of the development program, such as manufacturing methods and\nformulation, are altered along the way in an effort to optimize processes and results. Such changes carry the risk that\nthey will not achieve these intended objectives. Any of these changes could cause our product candidates to perform\ndifferently and affect the results of planned clinical trials or other future clinical trials conducted with the materials\nmanufactured using altered processes. Such changes may also require additional testing, FDA notification or FDA\napproval. This could delay completion of clinical trials, require the conduct of bridging clinical trials or the repetition of\none or more clinical trials, increase clinical trial costs, delay approval of our product candidates and jeopardize our\nability to commence sales and generate revenue.\n56\nWe currently rely and expect to continue to rely on third-party manufacturers to produce clinical supply of our\nproduct candidates, and we have not entered into binding agreements with any such manufacturers to support\ncommercialization. The competition for gene therapy contract development, manufacturing and testing services is\nintense. Additionally, these manufacturers do not have experience producing our product candidates at commercial\nlevels and may not achieve the necessary regulatory approvals or produce our product candidates at the quality,\nquantities, locations and timing needed to support commercialization.\nWhile we are in the process of establishing manufacturing capability for certain clinical manufacturing activities, we do\nnot currently plan to independently manufacture most of the material for our planned clinical programs. We currently\nrely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of our preclinical study and planned clinical trial\nmaterials, including the materials used to administer our product candidates and, therefore, we can control only certain\naspects of their activities. The competition for gene therapy contract development, manufacturing and testing is intense.\nReliance on third-party manufacturers may expose us to different risks than if we were to manufacture product\ncandidates ourselves, including but not limited to potential competition from other genetic biotechnology companies for\nthe use of such third-party manufacturers. For example, we currently rely on Catalent to manufacture our clinical supply.\nHowever, following the recently announced acquisition of Catalent by Novo Holdings A/S, we may face delays or other\nrisks to our manufacturing process depending on any changes implemented as result of such transaction.\nWhile we have secured an agreement with Catalent to manufacture clinical supply of our product candidates, we have\nnot yet secured manufacturing capabilities for commercial quantities of our product candidates. To date, while we have a\ncollaboration agreement with Catalent, we have only entered into agreements with such manufacturer to support our\nclinical studies. We may be unable to negotiate binding agreements with the manufacturers to support our potential\ncommercialization activities at commercially reasonable terms. In addition, under our current agreements with Catalent,\n(i) we no longer have exclusive access to the dedicated clean room suite and may not be able to secure future capacity or\nto meet our requirements for future clinical and commercial supply and (ii) we have an exclusive obligation to\nmanufacture certain products with Catalent and therefore we may be unable to work with other third-party\nmanufacturers. As a result, we may be unable to continue to develop and commercialize our products or product\ncandidates.\nBefore any of our third-party manufacturers and suppliers can begin to commercially manufacture our product\ncandidates, including the materials used to administer our product candidates, they must demonstrate to regulatory\nauthorities that the planned chemistry, manufacturing and controls for our gene therapy product candidates meet certain\nrequirements. Manufacturing of product candidates for clinical and commercial purposes must comply with the cGMP\nand applicable ex-U.S. regulatory requirements. The cGMP requirements govern quality control and documentation\npolicies and procedures. Complying with cGMP and ex-U.S. regulatory requirements will require that we expend time,\nmoney and effort in production, recordkeeping and quality control to assure that our product candidates meet applicable\nspecifications and other requirements. Our third-party manufacturers’ also must demonstrate to the FDA and ex-U.S.\nregulators that they can make the product candidate in accordance with the cGMP requirements as part of a pre-approval\ninspection prior to FDA or similar ex-U.S. regulatory approval of the product candidate. Failure to pass a pre-approval\ninspection might significantly delay our ability to begin trials in the respective jurisdiction and FDA and ex-U.S.\nregulatory approval of our product candidates. If any of our third-party manufacturers fail to comply with these\nrequirements, we would be subject to possible regulatory action, which could limit the jurisdictions in which we are\npermitted to sell our products. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially\nharmed.\nIn addition, our third-party manufacturers may fail to comply with cGMP regulations or similar regulatory requirements\noutside the United States. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers, to comply with applicable\nregulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including clinical holds, fines, injunctions, civil penalties,\ndelays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of product candidates or products,\noperating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our\nproduct candidates.\nEven if our third-party manufacturers comply with applicable regulatory requirements, we cannot assure you that they\nwill be able to successfully manufacture additional product candidates at a larger scale in a timely or economical\n57\nmanner, or at all. If they are unable to successfully increase our manufacturing scale or capacity, the development,\ntesting, and clinical trials of our product candidates may be delayed or infeasible, and regulatory approval or commercial\nlaunch of any resulting product may be delayed or not obtained, which could significantly harm our business.\nOur third-party manufacturers and suppliers use biological materials and may use hazardous materials, and any\nclaims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of these materials could be time-consuming or costly.\nOur third-party manufacturers and suppliers may use hazardous materials, including chemicals and biological agents and\ncompounds that could be dangerous to human health and safety or the environment. The operations of our third-party\nmanufacturers and suppliers also produce hazardous waste products. Federal, state, and local laws and regulations\ngovern the use, generation, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and wastes. Compliance with\napplicable environmental laws and regulations may be expensive, and current or future environmental laws and\nregulations may impair our product development efforts. In addition, we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of accidental\ninjury or contamination from these materials or wastes. We do not carry specific biological or hazardous waste insurance\ncoverage, and our property, casualty and general liability insurance policies specifically exclude coverage for damages\nand fines arising from biological or hazardous waste exposure or contamination. Accordingly, in the event of\ncontamination or injury, we could be held liable for damages or be penalized with fines in an amount exceeding our\nresources, and our clinical trials or regulatory approvals could be suspended.\nAny contamination in our third parties’ manufacturing process, shortages of raw materials, labor or reagents or\nfailure of any of our key suppliers to deliver necessary components of our platform could result in delays in our\nclinical development or marketing schedules.\nGiven the nature of biologics manufacturing, there is a risk of contamination. Any contamination could materially\nadversely affect our or our third-party vendor’s ability to produce our gene therapies on schedule and could therefore\nharm our results of operations and cause reputational damage.\nThe raw materials required in our third-party vendors manufacturing processes are derived from biological sources. We\ncannot assure that our third-party vendors have, or will be able to obtain on commercially reasonable terms, or at all,\nsufficient rights to these materials derived from biological sources. Such raw materials are difficult to procure and may\nalso be subject to contamination or recall. A material shortage, contamination, recall, or restriction on the use of\nbiologically derived substances in the manufacture of our product candidates could adversely impact or disrupt the\nclinical and commercial manufacturing of our product candidates, which could materially and adversely affect our\noperating results and development timelines.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers for the supply and manufacture of certain components of our technology. Should our\nability to procure these material components from our suppliers be compromised, our ability to continuously operate\nwould be impaired until an alternative supplier is sourced, qualified and tested, which could limit our ability to produce a\nclinical and commercial supply of our product candidates and harm our business.\nWe depend on third-party suppliers for materials used in the manufacture of our product candidates, and the loss of\nthese third-party suppliers or their inability to supply us with adequate materials could harm our business.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers for certain materials and components required for the production of our product\ncandidates, including the materials used to administer our product candidates. Our dependence on these third-party\nsuppliers and the challenges we may face in obtaining adequate supplies of materials involve several risks, including\nlimited control over pricing, availability, and quality and delivery schedules. There is substantial demand and limited\nsupply for certain of the raw materials used to manufacture gene therapy products. As a small company, our negotiation\nleverage is limited and we are likely to get lower priority than our competitors that are larger than we are. We cannot be\ncertain that our suppliers will continue to provide us with the quantities of these raw materials that we require or satisfy\nour anticipated specifications and quality requirements. Any supply interruption in limited or sole sourced raw materials\ncould materially harm our ability to manufacture our product candidates until a new source of supply, if any, could be\nidentified and qualified. We may be unable to find a sufficient alternative supply channel in a reasonable time or on\ncommercially reasonable terms. Any performance failure on the part of our suppliers could delay the development and\n58\npotential commercialization of our product candidates, including limiting supplies necessary for clinical trials and\nregulatory approvals, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Commercialization\nWe face significant competition in an environment of rapid technological change and the possibility that our\ncompetitors may achieve regulatory approval before us or develop therapies or technologies that are more advanced\nor effective than ours, which may harm our business and financial condition, and our ability to successfully market\nor commercialize our product candidates.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including the genetic medicines field, are characterized by rapidly\nchanging technologies, competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. We are aware of several companies\nfocused on developing gene therapies in various indications as well as several companies addressing methods for\nmodifying genes and regulating gene expression. We may also face competition from large and specialty pharmaceutical\nand biotechnology companies, academic research institutions, government agencies and public and private research\ninstitutions.\nFor the treatment of FTD, there are no approved disease-modifying therapies. We consider our most direct competitors\nwith respect to PBFT02 for the treatment of FTD-GRN to be Alector, Inc. (partnered with GlaxoSmithKline), which is\nconducting a Phase 3 clinical trial with a humanized anti-human sortilin monoclonal antibody for FTD-GRN, and Prevail\nTherapeutics Inc. (now part of Eli Lilly & Co), which is conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical trial for a gene therapy treatment\nfor FTD-GRN. AviadoBio began enrolling their Phase 1/2 gene therapy trial in patients with FTD-GRN in the second\nhalf of 2023. Additional companies, including Kyowa Kiran Co., Ltd. and QurAlis Therapeutics, are conducting\npreclinical research using gene therapy approaches to treat patients with FTD-GRN. Denali Therapeutics Inc. in\npartnership with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited is conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical trial for their recombinant\nprogranulin protein in addition to their oral EIF2a modulator already in a Phase 1 clinical trial. VesperBio began Phase 1\nenrollment for a small molecule sortilin antagonist program targeting FTD-GRN in the fourth quarter of 2023. We are\nalso aware of other therapeutic approaches in preclinical development that may target FTD-GRN patients.\nMany of our potential competitors, alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical,\nand other resources than we do, such as larger research and development, clinical, commercial and manufacturing\norganizations. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more\nresources being concentrated among a smaller number of competitors. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or\neliminated if competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe\nside effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any product candidates that we may develop. Competitors\nalso may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours,\nwhich could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market, if\never. Additionally, new or advanced technologies developed by our competitors may render our current or future product\ncandidates uneconomical or obsolete, and we may not be successful in commercializing our product candidates against\ncompetitors.\nThe commercial success of any of our product candidates will depend upon its degree of market acceptance by\nphysicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community.\nEthical, social and legal concerns about gene therapy could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting our\nproducts. Even with the requisite approvals from the FDA in the United States and other ex-U.S. regulatory authorities,\nthe commercial success of our product candidates will depend, in part, on the acceptance of physicians, patients (which\nincludes caregivers when applicable) and health care payors of gene therapy products in general, and our product\ncandidates in particular, as medically necessary, cost-effective and safe. Any product that we commercialize may not\ngain acceptance by physicians, patients, health care payors and others in the medical community. If these products do not\nachieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenue and may not become\n59\nprofitable. The degree of market acceptance of gene therapy products and, in particular, our product candidates, if\napproved for commercial sale, will depend on several factors, including:\n• the efficacy, durability and safety of such product candidates as demonstrated in clinical trials;\n• the potential and perceived advantages of product candidates over alternative treatments;\n• the cost of treatment relative to alternative treatments;\n• the clinical indications for which the product candidate is approved by the FDA or ex-U.S. regulatory\nauthorities;\n• the willingness of physicians to order genetic testing for potential target patient populations;\n• the willingness of potential patients to have genetic testing and counseling;\n• the willingness of physicians to prescribe new therapies, including therapies using ICM administration;\n• our ability to successfully train neurosurgeons and interventional radiologists in ICM administration of our\nproduct candidates;\n• the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and a therapy with ICM administration;\n• the prevalence and severity of any side effects;\n• product labeling or product insert requirements of the FDA or ex-U.S. regulatory authorities, including any\nlimitations or warnings contained in a product’s approved labeling;\n• relative convenience and ease of administration;\n• the strength of marketing and distribution support;\n• the timing of market introduction of competitive products and the perceptions of such competitive products\ncompared to our products;\n• publicity concerning our products or competing products and treatments;\n• the pricing of our products, particularly as compared to alternative treatments; and\n• sufficient third-party payor coverage and adequate reimbursement from government and third-party payors\nand patients’ willingness to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of such coverage and adequate\nreimbursement.\nEven if a potential product displays a favorable efficacy and safety profile in preclinical studies and clinical trials,\nmarket acceptance of the product will not be fully known until after it is launched.\nIf in the future we are unable to establish U.S. or global sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements\nwith third parties to sell and market our product candidates, we may not be successful in commercializing our\nproduct candidates if they are approved and we may not be able to generate any revenue.\nWe currently do not have a sales team or marketing team for the sales, marketing, and distribution of any of our product\ncandidates that may receive regulatory approval. In order to commercialize any product candidates after approval, we\nmust build on a territory-by-territory basis sales, reimbursement, distribution, managerial and other non-technical\ncapabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services, and we may not be successful in doing so.\nIf our product candidates receive regulatory approval, we may decide to establish an internal sales team with technical\nexpertise and supporting distribution capabilities to commercialize our product candidates, which will be expensive and\ntime-consuming and will require significant attention of our executive officers to manage. Any failure or delay in the\ndevelopment of our internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities would adversely impact the commercialization\nof any of our product candidates that we obtain approval to market.\nWith respect to the commercialization of all or certain of our product candidates, we may choose to collaborate, either\nglobally or on a territory-by-territory basis, with third parties that have direct sales forces and established distribution\nsystems, either to augment our own sales force and distribution systems or in lieu of our own sales force and distribution\nsystems. If we are unable to enter into such arrangements when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, we may not be able\nto successfully commercialize any of our product candidates that receive regulatory approval or any such\ncommercialization may experience delays or limitations. If we are not successful in commercializing our product\ncandidates, either on our own or through collaborations with one or more third parties, our future product revenue will\nsuffer and we may incur significant additional losses.\n60\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on\nproduct candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited financial and managerial resources, we focus on research programs and product candidates that\nwe identify for specific indications. As a result, we may forego or delay the pursuit of opportunities with other product\ncandidates or for other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation\ndecisions may cause us to fail to timely capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our\nspending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates for specific indications may\nnot yield any commercially viable products. The development of our clinical product candidates and ongoing research\nprograms require significant resources. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a\nparticular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing\nor other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development\nand commercialization rights to such product candidate.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection or other necessary rights for our products and technology,\nor if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad or our rights under licensed patents is not\nsufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize products and technology similar or identical to\nours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our products and technology may be adversely affected.\nOur commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary or intellectual property\nprotection in the United States and other countries for our current product candidates and future products, as well as our\ncore technologies, including our manufacturing know-how. We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology,\ninventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business by seeking,\nmaintaining and defending our intellectual property, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also\nrely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop,\nstrengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the field of gene therapy. Additionally, for some of our product\ncandidates, we intend to rely on regulatory protection afforded through rare drug designations, data exclusivity and\nmarket exclusivity as well as patent term extensions, where available.\nCurrently, most of our intellectual property protection consists of patent applications that we have in-licensed from GTP\nunder the Penn Agreement. The in-licensed patent applications are directed to certain new AAV capsids, to recombinant\nAAV viruses, or rAAV, capable of delivering certain genes into human cells to treat disorders of the CNS, to methods of\ntreating those diseases with rAAV, as well as to certain aspects of our manufacturing capabilities and related\ntechnologies. Our intellectual property also includes patent applications that we solely own that cover processes that we\ndeveloped for manufacturing our rAAV products.\nWe also have options under the Penn Agreement to add additional intellectual property to our existing license.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex\nlegal and factual questions, and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. The degree of patent protection\nwe require to successfully compete in the marketplace may be unavailable or severely limited in some cases and may not\nadequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. We cannot provide any assurances\nthat any of our own or licensed patent applications will mature into issued patents, and cannot provide any assurances\nthat any such patents, if issued, will include claims with a scope sufficient to protect our current and future product\ncandidates or otherwise provide any competitive advantage. Additionally, patents can be enforced only in those\njurisdictions in which the patent has issued. Furthermore, patents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, the natural\nexpiration of a patent is generally twenty years after its first nonprovisional U.S. filing. The natural expiration of a patent\noutside of the United States varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but is generally 20 years from\nthe earliest local filing date. Various extensions may be available; however, the life of a patent, and the protection it\naffords, is limited. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product\ncandidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized.\n61\nMoreover, our exclusive license is subject to field restrictions and retained rights, which may adversely impact our\ncompetitive position. Our licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with adequate and continuing patent protection\nsufficient to exclude others from commercializing products similar to our product candidates, including biosimilar\nversions of such products. In addition, the patent portfolio licensed to us is, or may be, licensed to third parties outside\nour licensed field, and such third parties may have certain enforcement rights. Thus, patents licensed to us could be put\nat risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly in litigation filed by or against another licensee or in administrative\nproceedings brought by or against another licensee in response to such litigation or for other reasons.\nOther parties have developed technologies that may be related or competitive to our own and such parties may have filed\nor may file patent applications, or may have received or may receive patents, claiming inventions that may overlap or\nconflict with those claimed in our own patent applications or issued patents. Publications of discoveries in the scientific\nliterature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and in other jurisdictions\nare typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot know with\ncertainty whether the inventors of our own or licensed patents and applications were the first to make the inventions\nclaimed in those patents or pending patent applications, or that they were the first to file for patent protection of such\ninventions. Further, we cannot assure you that all of the potentially relevant prior art relating to our own or licensed\npatents and patent applications has been found. If such prior art exists, it can invalidate a patent or prevent a patent from\nissuing from a pending patent application. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity and commercial value of our patent\nrights cannot be predicted with any certainty. Further, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and\npatent applications is threatened, regardless of the outcome, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to\nlicense, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates.\nIn addition, the patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we or our licensors may not be able to\nfile and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. In addition,\nthe scope of the claims initially submitted for examination may be significantly narrowed by the time they issue, if at all.\nIt is also possible that we or our licensors will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output\nbefore it is too late to obtain patent protection. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to pursue or obtain\nadditional patent protection based on our research and development efforts, or that any such patents or other intellectual\nproperty we generate will provide any competitive advantage. Moreover, we do not have the right to control the\npreparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to control the maintenance of the patents, covering\ntechnology that we license from third parties. Therefore, these patents and applications may not be filed, prosecuted or\nmaintained in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business.\nEven if we acquire patent protection that we expect should enable us to maintain competitive advantage, the issuance of\na patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability. Third parties, including competitors,\nmay challenge the inventorship, scope, validity, or enforceability thereof, which may result in such patents being\nnarrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable. If issued, our own or licensed patents may be challenged in patent offices\nin the United States and international markets, or in court. For example, we may be subject to a third-party submission of\nprior art to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, challenging the validity of one or more claims of our own\nor licensed patents, once issued. Such submissions may also be made prior to a patent’s issuance, precluding the granting\nof a patent based on one of our pending own or licensed patent applications. We may become involved in opposition,\nreexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review, derivation, interference, or similar proceedings in the United\nStates or abroad challenging the claims of patents that we own or have licensed, once issued. Furthermore, patents that\nwe have licensed may be challenged in court, once issued. Competitors may claim that they invented the inventions\nclaimed in such patents or patent applications prior to the inventors of our own or licensed patents, or may have filed\npatent applications before the inventors of our licensed patents did. A competitor may also claim that we are infringing\nits patents and that we therefore cannot practice our technology as claimed under our licensed patent applications and\npatents, if issued. As a result, one or more claims of our own or licensed patents may be narrowed or invalidated. In\nlitigation, a competitor could claim that our patents, if issued, are not valid for a number of reasons. If a court agrees, we\nwould lose our rights to those challenged patents.\nEven if they are unchallenged, our own or licensed patents and pending patent applications, if issued, may not provide us\nwith any meaningful protection or prevent competitors from designing around our patent claims to circumvent our own\nor licensed patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or therapeutics in a non-infringing manner. For\n62\nexample, even if we have a valid and enforceable patent, we may not be able to exclude others from practicing our\ninvention if the other party can show that they used the invention in commerce before our filing date or the other party\nbenefits from a compulsory license. Moreover, a third party may develop a competitive product that provides benefits\nsimilar to one or more of our product candidates but that uses a vector or an expression construct that falls outside the\nscope of our patent protection or license rights. If the patent protection provided by the patents and patent applications\nwe hold or pursue with respect to our product candidates is not sufficiently broad to impede such competition, our ability\nto successfully commercialize our product candidates could be negatively affected, which would harm our business.\nSimilar risks would apply to any patents or patent applications that we may own or in-license in the future.\nIn addition to patent protection, if any of our product candidates are approved by the FDA as a biological product under\na BLA in the United States, we believe the product would qualify for a 12-year period of exclusivity. Other regulatory\nexclusivities may be available, such as Orphan Drug exclusivity, with analogous data, marketing, and orphan\nexclusivities in various foreign countries. However, the scope of such regulatory exclusivities is subject to change, and\nmay not provide us with adequate and continuing protection sufficient to exclude others from commercializing products\nsimilar to our product candidates.\nAll of our current product candidates and research programs are licensed from or based upon licenses from a third -\nparty and are field limited to certain indications. If this license agreement is terminated or interpreted to narrow our\nrights, our ability to advance our current product candidates or develop new product candidates based on these\ntechnologies will be materially adversely affected.\nWe currently rely on licenses and sublicenses from third parties, in particular GTP, and will continue to rely on third\nparties for the research, development, manufacturing and commercialization of our current product candidates. If any of\nour licenses or relationships or any in-licenses on which our licenses are based are terminated or breached, we may:\n• lose our rights to develop and market our current product candidates;\n• lose patent or trade secret protection for our current product candidates;\n• experience significant delays in the development or commercialization of our current product candidates;\n• not be able to obtain any other licenses on acceptable terms, if at all; or\n• incur liability for damages.\nAdditionally, even if not terminated or breached, our intellectual property licenses or sublicenses may be subject to\ndisagreements over contract interpretation which could narrow the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual\nproperty or technology or increase our financial or other obligations.\nIf we experience any of the foregoing, it could have a materially adverse effect on our business and could force us to\ncease operations which could cause you to lose all of your investment.\nIf we breach our license agreements it could have a material adverse effect on our commercialization efforts for our\nproduct candidates.\nIf we breach any of the agreements under which we license the use, development and commercialization rights to our\nproduct candidates or technology from third parties, we could lose license rights that are important to our business. Our\ncurrent clinical product candidates and pipeline are, and our anticipated near term pipeline will be, licensed from GTP.\nUnder the Penn Agreement, we are subject to various obligations, including payment obligations, diligence obligations\nsuch as development and commercialization obligations, as well as potential royalty payments and other obligations. If\nwe fail to comply with any of these obligations or otherwise breach our license agreements, our licensors may have the\nright to terminate the applicable license in whole or in part. Generally, the loss of any one of our current licenses, or any\nother license we may acquire in the future, could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of\noperations.\n63\nLicensing of intellectual property is of critical importance to our business and involves complex legal, business and\nscientific issues. Disputes may arise between us and our licensors regarding intellectual property subject to a license\nagreement, including:\n• the scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues;\n• whether and the extent to which our technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of the\nlicensor that is not subject to the licensing agreement;\n• our right to sublicense patent and other intellectual property rights to third parties under collaborative\ndevelopment relationships;\n• our diligence obligations with respect to the use of the licensed technology in relation to our development\nand commercialization of our product candidates, and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations;\n• the ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property\nby our licensors and us and our partners; and\n• whether and the extent to which inventors are able to contest the assignment of their rights to our licensors.\nIf disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing\narrangements on acceptable terms or at all, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected\nproduct candidates. In addition, if disputes arise as to ownership of licensed intellectual property, our ability to pursue or\nenforce the licensed patent rights may be jeopardized. If we or our licensors fail to adequately protect this intellectual\nproperty, our ability to commercialize our products could suffer.\nOur strategy of obtaining rights to key technologies through in-licenses may not be successful.\nWe seek to expand our product candidate pipeline in part by in-licensing the rights to key technologies. The future\ngrowth of our business will depend in part on our ability to in-license or otherwise acquire the rights to additional\nproduct candidates or technologies. We cannot assure you that we will be able to in-license or acquire the rights to any\nproduct candidates or technologies from third parties on acceptable terms or at all.\nThe in-licensing and acquisition of these technologies is a competitive area, and a number of more established\ncompanies are also pursuing strategies to license or acquire product candidates or technologies that we may consider\nattractive. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash resources and\ngreater clinical development and commercialization capabilities. In addition, companies that perceive us to be a\ncompetitor may be unwilling to license rights to us. Furthermore, we may be unable to identify suitable product\ncandidates or technologies within our area of focus. If we are unable to successfully obtain rights to suitable product\ncandidates or technologies, our business, financial condition and prospects could suffer.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging claims of intellectual property infringement, the outcome of\nwhich would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability and the ability of our collaborators to develop, manufacture, market\nand sell our product candidates and future products and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the\nproprietary rights and intellectual property of third parties. The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are\ncharacterized by extensive and frequent litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. We may in the\nfuture become party to, or threatened with, adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights\nwith respect to our product candidates, future products and technology. Our competitors or other third parties may assert\ninfringement or misappropriation claims against us, alleging that our therapeutics, manufacturing methods, formulations\nor administration methods are covered by their patents. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent\napplications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are pursuing product candidates. For\nexample, a third party previously sent us a letter claiming that the use of our AAVhu68 capsid infringes certain patent\nclaims to which the third party has an exclusive license. While this matter has been resolved and we believe that we\nwould have valid defenses to these and any other such claims; however, if any such claims were ultimately successful,\nwe might require a license to continue to use and sell any product candidates using such AAV vector. Such licenses may\nnot be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\n64\nFurther, we do not know which processes we will use for commercial manufacture of our future products, or which\ntechnologies owned or controlled by third parties may prove important or essential to those processes. Given the vast\nnumber of patents in our field of technology, we cannot be certain or guarantee that we do not or will not infringe\nexisting patents or that we will not infringe patents that may be granted in the future. Many companies have filed, and\ncontinue to file, patent applications related to gene therapy and orphan diseases. Some of these patent applications have\nalready been allowed or issued and others may issue in the future. Since this area is competitive and of strong interest to\npharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, there will likely be additional patent applications filed and additional\npatents granted in the future, as well as additional research and development programs expected in the future.\nFurthermore, because patent applications can take many years to issue, may be confidential for 18 months or more after\nfiling and can be revised before issuance, there may be applications now pending which may later result in issued patents\nthat may be infringed by the manufacture, use, sale or importation of our product candidates or future products. If a\npatent holder believes the manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale or importation of one of our product candidates or future\nproducts infringes its patent, the patent holder may sue us even if we have licensed other patent protection for our\ntechnology. Moreover, we may face patent infringement claims from non-practicing entities that have no relevant\nproduct revenue and against whom our licensed patent portfolio may therefore have no deterrent effect.\nIt is also possible that we have failed to identify relevant third-party patents or applications. For example, applications\nfiled before November 29, 2000 and certain applications filed after that date that will not be filed outside the United\nStates remain confidential until patents issue. Moreover, it is difficult for industry participants, including us, to identify\nall third-party patent rights that may be relevant to our product candidates and technologies because patent searching is\nimperfect due to differences in terminology among patents, incomplete databases and the difficulty in assessing the\nmeaning of patent claims. We may fail to identify relevant patents or patent applications or may identify pending patent\napplications of potential interest but incorrectly predict the likelihood that such patent applications may issue with claims\nof relevance to our technology. In addition, we may be unaware of one or more issued patents that would be infringed by\nthe manufacture, sale, importation or use of a current or future product candidate, or we may incorrectly conclude that a\nthird-party patent is invalid, unenforceable or not infringed by our activities. Additionally, pending patent applications\nthat have been published can, subject to certain limitations, be later amended in a manner that could cover our\ntechnologies, our future products or the manufacture or use of our future products.\nThird parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing intellectual property rights and intellectual\nproperty rights that may be granted in the future. If we were to challenge the validity of an issued U.S. patent in court,\nsuch as an issued U.S. patent of potential relevance to some of our product candidates or future products or manufacture\nor methods of use, we would need to overcome a statutory presumption of validity that attaches to every U.S. patent.\nThis means that in order to prevail, we would have to present clear and convincing evidence as to the invalidity of the\npatent’s claims. There is no assurance that a court would find in our favor on questions of infringement or validity.\nPatent and other types of intellectual property litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions, and their\noutcome is uncertain. If we are found, or believe there is a risk we may be found, to infringe a third-party’s intellectual\nproperty rights, we could be required or may choose to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing and\nmarketing our products and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any such license on commercially\nreasonable terms, or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our\ncompetitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. Without such a license, we could be forced, including by\ncourt order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or product. In addition, we could be found liable for\nmonetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys’ fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent. A\nfinding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our future products or force us to cease some of our\nbusiness operations, which could materially harm our business. Alternatively, we may need to redesign our infringing\nproducts, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. If we lose a foreign patent\nlawsuit alleging our infringement of a competitor’s patents, we could be prevented from marketing our therapeutics in\none or more foreign countries and/or be required to pay monetary damages for infringement or royalties in order to\ncontinue marketing. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information, trade secrets or other intellectual\nproperty of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business. Any of these outcomes would have a\nmaterially adverse effect on our business.\n65\nEven if we are successful in these proceedings, we may incur substantial costs and divert management time and attention\nin pursuing these proceedings, which could have a material adverse effect on us. If we are unable to avoid infringing the\npatent rights of others, we may be required to seek a license, defend an infringement action or challenge the validity of\nthe patents in court, or redesign our future products or processes. Patent litigation is costly and time-consuming, and\nsome of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can\nbecause they have substantially greater resources. We may not have sufficient resources to bring these actions to a\nsuccessful conclusion. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with\nintellectual property litigation or administrative proceedings, there is a risk that some of our confidential information\ncould be compromised by disclosure. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or\nother proceedings could delay our research and development efforts, adversely affect our ability to raise additional\nfunds, and could limit our ability to continue our operations.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position may be\nharmed.\nIn addition to the protection afforded by patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secret protection, unpatented know-how\nand continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our\nproprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our contractors,\ncollaborators, scientific advisors, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our consultants\nand employees. We may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical know-how or other\ntrade secrets by the parties to these agreements, however, despite the existence generally of confidentiality agreements\nand other contractual restrictions. Monitoring unauthorized uses and disclosures is difficult and we do not know whether\nthe steps we have taken to protect our proprietary technologies will be effective. If any of the contractors, collaborators,\nscientific advisors, employees and consultants who are parties to these agreements breaches or violates the terms of any\nof these agreements, we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach or violation. As a result, we could lose our\ntrade secrets. Enforcing a claim that a third-party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets, like patent litigation, is\nexpensive and time-consuming and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States are\nsometimes less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets.\nOur trade secrets could otherwise become known or be independently discovered by our competitors. Competitors could\npurchase our product candidates and attempt to replicate some or all of the competitive advantages we derive from our\ndevelopment efforts, willfully infringe our intellectual property rights, design around our protected technology or\ndevelop their own competitive technologies that fall outside of our intellectual property rights. If any of our trade secrets\nwere to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or\nthose to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If our trade secrets\nare not adequately protected or sufficient to provide an advantage over our competitors, our competitive position could\nbe adversely affected, as could our business. Additionally, if the steps taken to maintain our trade secrets are deemed\ninadequate, we may have insufficient recourse against third parties for misappropriating our trade secrets.\nObtaining and maintaining patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission,\nfee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies and our patent protection could be\nreduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nThe USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural,\ndocumentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. In addition, periodic\nmaintenance fees on issued patents often must be paid to the USPTO and foreign patent agencies over the lifetime of the\npatent. While an unintentional lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in\naccordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in premature abandonment\nor lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant\njurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include,\nbut are not limited to, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure\nto properly legalize and submit formal documents. If we or our licensors fail to maintain the patents and patent\napplications covering our product candidates, we may not be able to stop a competitor from marketing drugs that are the\nsame as or similar to our product candidates, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\n66\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be\nprohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less\nextensive than those in the United States. The requirements for patentability may differ in certain countries, particularly\nin developing countries. Moreover, our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be adversely\naffected by unforeseen changes in foreign intellectual property laws. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do\nnot protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Further, licensing\npartners may not prosecute patents in certain jurisdictions in which we may obtain commercial rights, thereby precluding\nthe possibility of later obtaining patent protection in these countries. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third\nparties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States. Competitors may use our technologies in\njurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and may also export infringing\nproducts to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States.\nThese products may compete with our products and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective\nor sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMost of our in-licensed patent families are pending in major pharmaceutical markets including the United States,\nCanada, Europe, Japan, Korea, and China, as well as other jurisdictions; we will not be able to enforce the patent in any\njurisdictions in which the application has not been filed. Filing, prosecuting and defending patents on product candidates\nin all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and we or our licensor may be unable to predict\nand may fail to seek patent protection in jurisdictions in which protection may ultimately be desired.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in\nforeign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the\nenforcement of patents, trade secrets, and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to\nbiotechnology products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of\ncompeting products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. For example, many foreign countries have\ncompulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. Proceedings to enforce our\npatent rights in foreign jurisdictions, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and\nattention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly\nand our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not\nprevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially\nmeaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to\nobtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property, which could be\nexpensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents, trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property. To counter infringement or\nunauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming and\ndivert the time and attention of our management and scientific personnel. Any claims we assert against perceived\ninfringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their patents, in\naddition to counterclaims asserting that our patents are invalid or unenforceable, or both. The outcome following legal\nassertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. In any patent infringement proceeding, there is a risk that a\ncourt will decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, and that we do not have the right to\nstop the other party from using the invention at issue. There is also a risk that, even if the validity of such patents is\nupheld, the court will construe the patent’s claims narrowly or decide that we do not have the right to stop the other party\nfrom using the invention at issue on the grounds that our patent claims do not cover the invention. An adverse outcome\nin a litigation or proceeding involving our patents could limit our ability to assert our patents against those parties or\nother competitors, and may curtail or preclude our ability to exclude third parties from making and selling similar or\ncompetitive products. Any of these occurrences could adversely affect our competitive business position, business\nprospects and financial condition. Similarly, if we assert trademark infringement claims, a court may determine that the\nmarks we have asserted are invalid or unenforceable, or that the party against whom we have asserted trademark\n67\ninfringement has superior rights to the marks in question. In this case, we could ultimately be forced to cease use of such\ntrademarks.\nEven if we establish infringement, the court may decide not to grant an injunction against further infringing activity and\ninstead award only monetary damages, which may or may not be an adequate remedy. Furthermore, because of the\nsubstantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of\nour confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during litigation. There could also be public\nannouncements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or\ninvestors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of shares of our\ncommon stock. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial or other resources to file and\npursue such infringement claims, which typically last for years before they are concluded. Even if we ultimately prevail\nin such claims, the monetary cost of such litigation and the diversion of the attention of our management and scientific\npersonnel could outweigh any benefit we receive as a result of the proceedings.\nChanges in patent law in the United States and in ex-U.S. jurisdictions could diminish the value of patents in general,\nthereby impairing our ability to protect our product candidates.\nAs is the case with other biotechnology companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property,\nparticularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biotechnology industry involve both technological and legal\ncomplexity, and is therefore costly, time-consuming and inherently uncertain.\nPast or future patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our\npatent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. For example, in March 2013, under the Leahy-\nSmith America Invents Act, or America Invents Act, the United States moved from a “first to invent” to a “first-\ninventor-to-file” patent system. Under a “first-inventor-to-file” system, assuming the other requirements for patentability\nare met, the first inventor to file a patent application generally will be entitled to a patent on the invention regardless of\nwhether another inventor had made the invention earlier. The America Invents Act includes a number of other\nsignificant changes to U.S. patent law, including provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted,\nredefine prior art and establish a new post-grant review system. The effects of these changes are currently unclear as the\nUSPTO continues to promulgate new regulations and procedures in connection with the America Invents Act and many\nof the substantive changes to patent law, including the “first-inventor-to-file” provisions, only became effective in\nMarch 2013. In addition, the courts have yet to address many of these provisions and the applicability of the act and new\nregulations on the specific patents discussed in this filing have not been determined and would need to be reviewed.\nHowever, the America Invents Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the\nprosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents.\nAdditionally, recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain\ncircumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with\nregard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the\nvalue of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts and the USPTO, the\nlaws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new\npatents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future. For example, in the case, Assoc.\nfor Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc., the U.S. Supreme Court held that certain claims to DNA molecules\nare not eligible for patent protection. We cannot predict how future decisions by the courts, the U.S. Congress or the\nUSPTO may impact the value of our patents. Any similar adverse changes in the patent laws of other jurisdictions could\nalso have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may be subject to claims asserting that our employees, consultants, advisors or collaborators have wrongfully\nused or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their current or former employers or claims asserting ownership of or other\nrights to what we regard as our own or licensed intellectual property.\nMany of our employees, consultants or advisors, and the employees, consultants or advisors of our licensors, are\ncurrently, or were previously, employed at or affiliated with universities, hospitals or other biotechnology or\npharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our\n68\nemployees, consultants and advisors do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us,\nwe may be subject to claims that these individuals or we have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade\nsecrets or other proprietary information, of any such individual’s current or former employer. Moreover, some of our\nlicensors, and our or our licensors’ employees, consultants or advisors are or have been affiliated or have a contractual\nrelationship with multiple institutions and companies including our competitors and may have or have had an obligation\nto them. Such institutions and companies could challenge our license rights or our licensors’ intellectual property\nownership rights. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims and we may be obligated to indemnify our\nemployees, consultants, advisors or collaborators in certain instances. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition\nto paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in\ndefending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIn addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the conception or\ndevelopment of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be\nunsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who, in fact, conceives or develops intellectual property\nthat we regard as our own. The assignment of intellectual property rights may not be self-executing or the assignment\nagreements may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims that they may\nbring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property.\nPatent terms may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our product candidates for an adequate\namount of time.\nPatents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, if all maintenance fees are timely paid, the natural expiration of a\npatent is generally 20 years from its earliest U.S. non-provisional filing date. Various extensions may be available, but\nthe life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Even if patents covering our product candidates are obtained,\nonce the patent life has expired, we may be open to competition from competitive products, including generics. Given\nthe amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents\nprotecting our product candidates might expire before or shortly after we or our partners commercialize those candidates.\nAs a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from\ncommercializing products similar or identical to ours.\nIf we do not obtain patent term extension for any product candidates we may develop, our business may be materially\nharmed.\nDepending upon the timing, duration and specifics of any FDA marketing approval of any product candidates we may\ndevelop, one or more of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price\nCompetition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Amendments.\nThe Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent extension term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost\nduring the FDA regulatory review process. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond\na total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent per product may be extended and only those claims\ncovering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. However, even if\nwe were to seek a patent term extension, it may not be granted because of, for example, the failure to exercise due\ndiligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process, the failure to apply within applicable deadlines, the\nfailure to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents, or any other failure to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover,\nthe applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded could be less than we request. If we are unable to\nobtain patent term extension or term of any such extension is less than we request, our competitors may obtain approval\nof competing products following our patent expiration, and our business, financial condition, results of operations, and\nprospects could be materially harmed.\n69\nSome of the intellectual property rights that we have in-licensed were generated through the use of U.S. government\nfunding and are therefore subject to federal regulations such as “march-in” rights, certain reporting requirements,\nand a preference for U.S. based companies. Compliance with such regulations may limit our exclusive rights, and\nlimit our ability to contract with ex-U.S. manufacturers.\nSome of the intellectual property rights we have in-licensed were generated through the use of U.S. government funding\nand are therefore subject to certain federal regulations. As a result, the U.S. government may have certain rights to\nintellectual property embodied in our current or future product candidates pursuant to the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980, or\nBayh-Dole Act, and implementing regulations. These U.S. government rights in certain inventions developed under a\ngovernment-funded program include a non-exclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable worldwide license to use inventions\nfor any governmental purpose. In addition, the U.S. government has the right to require us or our licensors to grant\nexclusive, partially exclusive, or non-exclusive licenses to any of these inventions to a third party if it determines that:\n(i) adequate steps have not been taken to commercialize the invention; (ii) government action is necessary to meet public\nhealth or safety needs; or (iii) government action is necessary to meet requirements for public use under federal\nregulations (also referred to as “march-in rights”). The U.S. government also has the right to take title to these inventions\nif we, or the applicable licensor, fail to disclose the invention to the government and fail to file an application to register\nthe intellectual property within specified time limits. These time limits have recently been changed by regulation, and\nmay change in the future. Intellectual property generated under a government funded program is also subject to certain\nreporting requirements, compliance with which may require us or the applicable licensor to expend substantial resources.\nIn addition, the U.S. government requires that any products embodying the subject invention or produced through the\nuse of the subject invention be manufactured substantially in the United States. The manufacturing preference\nrequirement can be waived if the owner of the intellectual property can show that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts\nhave been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially\nin the United States or that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible. This preference\nfor U.S. manufacturers may limit our ability to contract with ex-U.S. product manufacturers for products covered by\nsuch intellectual property. To the extent any of our current or future intellectual property is generated through the use of\nU.S. government funding, the provisions of the Bayh-Dole Act may similarly apply.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nThe pricing, insurance coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved products is uncertain. Failure to obtain\nor maintain adequate coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates, if approved, could limit our ability to\nmarket those products and decrease our ability to generate product revenue.\nOur clinical product candidates currently target indications with small patient populations. In order for products that are\ndesigned to treat smaller patient populations to be commercially viable, the reimbursement for such products must be\nhigher, on a relative basis, to account for the lack of volume. Accordingly, we will need to implement a coverage and\nreimbursement strategy for any approved product candidate that accounts for the smaller potential market size. If we are\nunable to establish or sustain coverage and adequate reimbursement for any future product candidates from third-party\npayors, the adoption of those products and sales revenue will be adversely affected, which, in turn, could adversely\naffect the ability to market or sell those product candidates, if approved.\nWe expect the cost of a single administration of gene therapy products, such as those we are developing, to be\nsubstantial when and if they achieve regulatory approval. Therefore, we expect that coverage and reimbursement by\ngovernment and private payors will be essential for most patients to be able to afford these treatments. Accordingly,\nsales of any of our product candidates will depend substantially, both domestically and internationally, on the extent to\nwhich the costs of our product candidates will be paid by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and\nsimilar healthcare management organizations, or will be reimbursed by government authorities, private health coverage\ninsurers and other third-party payors. Even if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount may not be high\nenough to allow us to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize a sufficient return on our investment.\nThere is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. In the\nUnited States, the principal decisions about reimbursement for new products are typically made by the Centers for\nMedicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, since\n70\nCMS decides whether and to what extent a new product will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare. Private payors\ntend to follow CMS to a substantial degree. However, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product\ndoes not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. Further, a payor’s decision to provide\ncoverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. It is difficult to\npredict what CMS will decide with respect to reimbursement for novel products such as ours since there is no body of\nestablished practices and precedents for these new products. Reimbursement agencies in Europe may be more\nconservative than CMS.\nOutside the United States, international operations are generally subject to extensive governmental price controls and\nother market regulations, and we believe the increasing emphasis on cost-containment initiatives in Europe, Canada and\nother countries has and will continue to put pressure on the pricing and usage of therapeutics such as our product\ncandidates. In many countries, particularly the countries of the EU, the prices of medical products are subject to varying\nprice control mechanisms as part of national health systems. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental\nauthorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or\npricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of\nour product candidate to other available therapies. In general, the prices of products under such systems are substantially\nlower than in the United States. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and\ncontrol company profits. Additional foreign price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the\namount that we are able to charge for our product candidates. Accordingly, in markets outside the United States, the\nreimbursement for our product candidates may be reduced compared with the United States and may be insufficient to\ngenerate commercially reasonable revenues and profits.\nMoreover, increasing efforts by governmental and third-party payors, in the United States and internationally, to cap or\nreduce healthcare costs may cause such organizations to limit both coverage and level of reimbursement for new\nproducts approved and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our product candidates. We\nexpect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of any of our product candidates due to the trend\ntoward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of certain third-party payors, such as health maintenance\norganizations, and additional legislative changes. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly\nprescription drugs and surgical procedures and other treatments, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high\nbarriers are being erected to the entry of new products into the healthcare market.\nIn addition to CMS and private payors, professional organizations such as the American Medical Association can\ninfluence decisions about reimbursement for new products by determining standards for care. In addition, many private\npayors contract with commercial vendors who sell software that provide guidelines that attempt to limit utilization of,\nand therefore reimbursement for, certain products deemed to provide limited benefit to existing alternatives. Such\norganizations may set guidelines that limit reimbursement or utilization of our product candidates. Even if favorable\ncoverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we or our collaborators receive\nregulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.\nFast Track Designation by the FDA may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process.\nWe have obtained Fast Track Designation for PBFT02 for the treatment of FTD-GRN. We may seek Fast Track\nDesignation for one or more of our other product candidates. If a drug is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-\nthreatening condition and the drug demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for this condition, the\nproduct sponsor may apply for FDA Fast Track Designation. The FDA has broad discretion whether or not to grant this\ndesignation, so even if we believe a particular product candidate is eligible for this designation, we cannot assure you\nthat the FDA would decide to grant it. Even if we do receive Fast Track Designation, we may not experience a faster\ndevelopment process, review or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures. The FDA may withdraw Fast\nTrack Designation if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development\nprogram.\n71\nIf we decide to seek Orphan Drug Designation for some of our product candidates, we may be unsuccessful or may be\nunable to maintain the benefits associated with Orphan Drug Designation, including the potential for supplemental\nmarket exclusivity.\nWe have obtained Orphan Drug Designation for PBFT02 for the treatment of FTD-GRN. We have sought and may\ncontinue to seek Orphan Drug Designation for one or more of our other product candidates, and we may be unsuccessful.\nRegulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the United States and Europe, may designate drugs for relatively\nsmall patient populations as orphan drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug as an orphan drug\nif it is a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a patient population of fewer\nthan 200,000 individuals in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 in the United States where\nthere is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing the drug will be recovered from sales in the United States.\nIn the United States, Orphan Drug Designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as tax advantages and user-fee\nwaivers. Opportunities for grant funding toward clinical trial costs may also be available for clinical trials of drugs for\nrare diseases, regardless of whether the drugs are designated for the orphan use. In addition, if a product that has Orphan\nDrug Designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the\nproduct is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to\nmarket the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances. For large molecule\ndrugs, including gene therapies, sameness is determined based on the principal molecular structural features of a product.\nAs applied to gene therapies, the FDA has recently issued final guidance in which it stated it generally intends to\nconsider certain key features, such as the transgenes expressed by the gene therapy and the vectors used to deliver the\ntransgene, to be principal molecular structural features. With regard to vectors, the FDA generally intends to consider\nwhether two vectors from the same viral class are the same or different on a case-by-case basis. The FDA does not\nintend to consider minor differences between transgenes and vectors to be different principal molecular structural\nfeatures. When two gene therapy products express the same transgene and have or use the same vector, determining\nwhether two gene therapies are the same drug may also depend on additional features of the final gene therapy product,\nsuch as regulatory elements and the cell type that is transduced (for genetically modified cells). In such cases, FDA\ngenerally intends to determine whether two gene therapy products are different on a case-by-case basis.\nAlthough we have obtained Orphan Drug Designation for our clinical product candidates, and even if we obtain Orphan\nDrug Designation for additional product candidates in specific indications, we may not be the first to obtain marketing\napproval of these product candidates for the orphan-designated indication due to the uncertainties associated with\ndeveloping pharmaceutical products. If a competitor with a product that is determined by the FDA to be the same as one\nof our product candidates obtains marketing approval before us for the same indication we are pursuing and obtains\norphan drug exclusivity, our product candidate may not be approved until the period of exclusivity ends unless we are\nable to demonstrate that our product candidate is clinically superior. Even after obtaining approval, we may be limited in\nour ability to market our product. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be limited if we seek\napproval for an indication broader than the orphan-designated indication or may be lost if the FDA later determines that\nthe request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the\nproduct to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. Further, even if we obtain orphan drug\nexclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different\ndrugs with different principal molecular structural features can be approved for the same condition. Even after an orphan\nproduct is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve the same drug with the same principal molecular structural\nfeatures for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is safer, more effective or makes a major\ncontribution to patient care. Orphan Drug Designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time\nof a drug nor gives the drug any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process. In addition, while we may seek\nOrphan Drug Designation for some of our product candidates, we may never receive such designations. Similarly, the\nEuropean Commission may also designate a product as an orphan drug under certain circumstances.\n72\nAny product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval will be subject to extensive post-marketing regulatory\nrequirements and could be subject to post-marketing restrictions or withdrawal from the market, and we may be\nsubject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with\nour product candidates, when and if any of them are approved.\nOur product candidates and the activities associated with their development and potential commercialization, including\ntheir testing, manufacture, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution, are\nsubject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. These requirements include\nsubmissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, cGMPs,\nrequirements relating to manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and\ndocuments, including periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities and requirements regarding the\ndistribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping.\nThe FDA may also impose requirements for costly post-marketing studies or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor\nthe safety or efficacy of any approved product. The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of\ndrugs and biologics to ensure drugs and biologics are marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with\nthe provisions of the approved product labeling. The FDA imposes stringent restrictions on manufacturers’\ncommunications regarding use of their products. If we promote our product candidates beyond their potentially approved\nindications, we may be subject to enforcement action for off-label promotion. Violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and\nCosmetic Act relating to the promotion of prescription drugs may lead to investigations alleging violations of federal and\nstate healthcare fraud and abuse laws, as well as state consumer protection laws.\nIn addition, later discovery of previously unknown adverse events or other problems with our product candidates,\nmanufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may yield various results,\nincluding:\n• restrictions on such product candidates, manufacturers or manufacturing processes;\n• restrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product;\n• restrictions on product distribution or use;\n• requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;\n• warning or untitled letters;\n• withdrawal of any approved product from the market;\n• refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n• recall of product candidates;\n• fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenues;\n• suspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals;\n• refusal to permit the import or export of our product candidates;\n• product seizure; or\n• injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nNon-compliance with European requirements regarding safety monitoring or pharmacovigilance, and with requirements\nrelated to the development of products for the pediatric population, can also result in significant financial penalties.\nSimilarly, failure to comply with requirements regarding the protection of personal information can also lead to\nsignificant penalties and sanctions.\nOur product candidates for which we intend to seek approval may face competition from biosimilars approved\nthrough an abbreviated regulatory pathway\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of\n2010, or the ACA, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA. The\nBPCIA created an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products. The\nabbreviated regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics,\nincluding the possible designation of a biosimilar as interchangeable based on its similarity to an existing reference\n73\nproduct. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be approved by the FDA until 12 years after\nthe original branded product is approved under a BLA. The law is complex and is still being interpreted and\nimplemented by the FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation, and meaning are subject to uncertainty.\nWe believe that if any of our product candidates is approved as a biological product under a BLA, it should qualify for\nthe 12-year period of exclusivity. However, there is a risk that the FDA will not consider any of our product candidates\nto be reference products for competing products, potentially creating the opportunity for biosimilar competition sooner\nthan anticipated. Additionally, this period of regulatory exclusivity does not apply to companies pursuing regulatory\napproval via their own traditional BLA, rather than via the abbreviated pathway. Moreover, an interchangeable\nbiosimilar, once approved, may be substituted under existing law for any one of our reference products in a way that is\nsimilar to traditional generic substitution; any non-interchangeable biosimilar products may also be substituted by a\nhealth care provider but, under existing law, will not be automatically substituted at the pharmacy. The extent of the\nimpact of such substitution will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing.\nFinally, there has been public discussion of potentially decreasing the period of exclusivity from the current 12 years. If\nsuch a change were to be enacted, our product candidates, if approved, could have a shorter period of exclusivity than\nanticipated.\nEnacted and future legislation may affect pricing and third-party payment for our product candidates, may increase\nthe difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our product candidates and may\naffect the prices we may set. The full effect of recent United States healthcare reform and other changes in the\nhealthcare industry, laws, and regulations and in healthcare spending is currently unknown, and the reform and\nother changes may adversely affect our business model.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and\nproposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could, among other things, affect pricing and third-party payment\nfor our product candidates prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-\napproval activities and negatively affect our ability to profitably sell any products for which we obtain marketing\napproval. The commercial potential for our products, if any, could be affected by changes in healthcare spending and\npolicy in the United States and abroad. New laws, regulations, or judicial decisions or new interpretations of existing\nlaws, regulations, or decisions, related to healthcare availability, the method of delivery, or payment for healthcare\nproducts and services could adversely affect our business, operations, and financial condition, if and when we are able to\nobtain marketing approval and commercialize our products.\nThere have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the U.S. federal and state levels that seek to reduce\nhealthcare costs in general and the cost of pharmaceuticals in particular.\nFor example, the Budget Control Act imposed, subject to certain temporary suspension periods, 2% reductions in\nMedicare payments to providers per fiscal year starting April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to\nthe statute, will remain in effect through 2031, unless additional Congressional action is taken. In December 2020, CMS\nissued a final rule implementing significant manufacturer price reporting changes under the Medicaid Drug Rebate\nProgram, including an alternative rebate calculation for a line extension that is tied to the price increases of the original\ndrug, and Best Price reporting related to certain value-based purchasing arrangements. Under the American Rescue Plan\nAct of 2021, effective January 1, 2024, the statutory cap on Medicaid Drug Rebate Program rebates that manufacturers\npay to state Medicaid programs is eliminated. Elimination of this cap may, in some cases, require pharmaceutical\nmanufacturers to pay more in rebates than they receive on the sale of products. It is unclear to what extent these\nregulations or any future legislation or regulations will affect our business, including our ability to generate revenue and\nachieve profitability.\nThere has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed\nproducts, which has resulted in several presidential executive orders, Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted\nfederal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the\nrelationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare, and reform\ngovernment program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. The FDA released a final rule in September 2020\n74\nproviding guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada, and FDA authorized the first\nsuch plan in Florida in January 2024.\nRecently, several healthcare reform initiatives culminated in the enactment of the IRA in August 2022, which allows,\namong other things, HHS to negotiate the selling price of a statutorily specified number of drugs and biologics each year\nthat CMS reimburses under Medicare Part B and Part D. Only high-expenditure single-source biologics that have been\napproved for at least 11 years (7 years for single-source drugs) can qualify for negotiation, with the negotiated price\ntaking effect two years after the selection year. Negotiations for Medicare Part D products begin in 2024 with the\nnegotiated price taking effect in 2026, and negotiations for Medicare Part B products begin in 2026 with the negotiated\nprice taking effect in 2028. In August 2023, HHS announced the ten Medicare Part D drugs and biologics that it selected\nfor negotiations, and by October 1, 2023, each manufacturer of the selected drugs signed a manufacturer agreement to\nparticipate in the negotiations. HHS will announce the negotiated maximum fair prices by September 1, 2024, and this\nprice cap, which cannot exceed a statutory ceiling price, will come into effect on January 1, 2026. A drug or biological\nproduct that has an orphan drug designation for only one rare disease or condition will be excluded from the IRA’s price\nnegotiation requirements, but loses that exclusion if it has designations for more than one rare disease or condition, or if\nis approved for an indication that is not within that single designated rare disease or condition, unless such additional\ndesignation or such disqualifying approvals are withdrawn by the time CMS evaluates the drug for selection for\nnegotiation. The IRA also imposes rebates on Medicare Part B and Part D drugs whose prices have increased at a rate\ngreater than the rate of inflation. In addition, the law eliminates the “donut hole” under Medicare Part D beginning in\n2025 by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost and establishing a new manufacturer\ndiscount program, which requires manufacturers that want their drugs to be covered by Medicare Part D to provide\nstatutorily defined discounts to Part D enrollees. The IRA also extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing\nhealth insurance coverage in ACA marketplaces through plan year 2025. The IRA permits the Secretary of HHS to\nimplement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. Manufacturers that\nfail to comply with the IRA may be subject to various penalties, some significant, including civil monetary penalties.\nThese provisions are taking effect progressively starting in 2023, although they may be subject to legal challenges. For\nexample, the provisions related to the negotiation of selling prices of high-expenditure single-source drugs and biologics\nhave been challenged in multiple lawsuits. Thus, it is unclear how the IRA will be implemented but it will likely have a\nsignificant impact on the pharmaceutical industry and the pricing of our products and product candidates. The adoption\nof restrictive price controls in new jurisdictions, more restrictive controls in existing jurisdictions or the failure to obtain\nor maintain timely or adequate pricing could also adversely impact revenue. We expect pricing pressures will continue\nglobally.\nFurther, at the U.S. state level, legislatures are increasingly enacting laws and implementing regulations designed to\ncontrol pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or reimbursement constraints, discount\nrequirements, marketing cost disclosure and price increase transparency reporting, and programs designed to encourage\nimportation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Additional state and federal healthcare reform measures may be\nadopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare\nproducts and services or otherwise negatively impact our business model.\nOur operations and relationships with customers and third-party payors will be subject to applicable anti-kickback,\nfraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to penalties including criminal\nsanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any\nproduct candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with providers, third-party payors\nand customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may\nconstrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute any\nproduct candidates for which we obtain marketing approval.\nRestrictions under applicable U.S. federal and state healthcare laws and regulations may include the following:\n• the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and\nwillfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind,\n75\nto induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of,\nany good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare\nand Medicaid;\n• federal false claims laws, including the federal False Claims Act, imposes criminal and civil penalties,\nincluding through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly\npresenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or\nfraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the\nfederal government;\n• the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and\ncivil liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme\nto defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n• HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health, or\nHITECH, Act and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual\nterms, on certain types of people and entities with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and\ntransmission of individually identifiable health information;\n• the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act requires applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, devices,\nbiologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the\nChildren’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report payments and other transfers of\nvalue to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors),\nphysician assistants, certain types of advanced practice nurses, and teaching hospitals, as well as certain\nownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family, which includes annual\ndata collection and reporting obligations; and\n• analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may\napply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by\nnon-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers.\nSome state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance\nguidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and may require drug\nmanufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare\nproviders or marketing expenditures. Other state laws require reporting of certain pricing information, including price\nincreases and prices of newly launched drugs. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health\ninformation in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not\npreempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and\nregulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business\npractices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or\nother healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other\ngovernmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative\npenalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion of product candidates from government-funded healthcare programs,\nsuch as Medicare and Medicaid, disgorgement, oversight monitoring, contractual damages, reputational harm,\ndiminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or\nother healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with\napplicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from\ngovernment-funded healthcare programs.\nRisks Related to Employee Matters, Managing Growth and Other Risks Related to Our Business\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified\npersonnel.\nWe are highly dependent on the research and development, clinical and business development expertise of our\nmanagement, scientific and clinical team. We also benefit from the research expertise of Dr. Wilson, our Chief Scientific\nAdvisor. Although we have entered into a consulting agreement with Dr. Wilson, he may terminate his relationship with\n76\nus at any time. Although we have entered into employment letter agreements or employment agreements with our\nexecutive officers, each of them may terminate their employment with us at any time. We do not maintain “key person”\ninsurance for any of our executives or other employees. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including\nscientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and manufacturing strategy. Our\nconsultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or\nadvisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us. If we are unable to continue to attract and\nretain high quality personnel, our ability to pursue our growth strategy will be limited.\nRecruiting and retaining qualified scientific, clinical, manufacturing and, if needed, sales and marketing personnel will\nalso be critical to our success. The loss of the services of our executive officers or other key employees could impede the\nachievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives and seriously harm our ability to\nsuccessfully implement our business strategy. Furthermore, replacing executive officers and key employees may be\ndifficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the\nbreadth of skills and experience required to successfully develop, gain regulatory approval of and commercialize drugs,\nparticularly within the gene therapy space. Competition to hire from this limited pool is intense, and we may be unable\nto hire, train, retain or motivate these key personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous\npharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel. We also experience competition for the hiring of\nscientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions. Failure to succeed in clinical trials may make\nit more challenging to recruit and retain qualified scientific personnel.\nFurther, the reductions in workforce announced in March 2022, November 2022, and July 2023 may also make retention\nof our current personnel both more important and more challenging. These workforce reductions resulted in the loss of\nlonger-term employees, the loss of institutional knowledge and expertise and the reallocation and combination of certain\nroles and responsibilities across the organization, all of which could adversely affect our operations. Given the\ncomplexity of our business, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial\nsystems, manage our facilities and continue to recruit and retain qualified personnel. Given the complexity of our\nbusiness, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems, manage our\nfacilities and continue to recruit and retain qualified personnel.\nWe may be required to expand our manufacturing, development and regulatory capabilities in the future, and as a\nresult, we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nWe may be required to expand our manufacturing, development and regulatory capabilities in the future, which could\nresult in growth to the number of our employees and the scope of our operations, particularly in the areas of\nmanufacturing and clinical strategy, and growing our capability to conduct clinical trials. We may not be able to\neffectively manage the expansion of our operations in the future or recruit and train additional qualified personnel. The\nexpansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert our management and business development\nresources. Any inability to manage growth could delay the execution of our business plans or disrupt our operations.\nOur internal computer systems, or those of our third-party collaborators or other contractors, may fail or suffer\nsecurity breaches and cyber attacks, which could result in a material disruption of our development programs.\nWe believe that we take reasonable steps that are designed to protect the security, integrity and confidentiality of the\ninformation we collect, use, store, and disclose, but inadvertent or unauthorized data access may occur despite our\nefforts. For example, our system protections may be ineffective or inadequate, or we could be impacted by software bugs\nor other technical malfunctions, as well as employee error or malfeasance. Additionally, privacy and data protection laws\nare evolving, and it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our\ndata handling safeguards and practices that could result in fines, lawsuits, and other penalties, and significant changes to\nour or our third-party partners business practices and products and service offerings. To the extent that the measures we\nor our third-party business partners have taken prove to be insufficient or inadequate, we may become subject to\nlitigation, breach notification obligations, or regulatory or administrative sanctions, which could result in significant\nfines, penalties, damages, harm to our reputation or loss of patients. While we have not experienced any material losses\nas a result of any system failure, accident or security breach to date, we have been the subject of certain phishing\nattempts in the past. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material\n77\ndisruption of our development programs and our business operations, whether due to a loss of our trade secrets or other\nproprietary information or other similar disruptions. Additionally, a party who circumvents our security measures could,\namong other effects, appropriate patient information or other proprietary data, cause interruptions in our operations, or\nexpose patients to hacks, viruses, and other disruptions. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or\nfuture clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to\nrecover or reproduce the data. In addition, insurance coverage to compensate for any losses associated with such events\nmay not be adequate to cover all potential losses. The development and maintenance of these systems, controls and\nprocesses is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome\nsecurity measures become increasingly sophisticated.\nTo the extent that any disruption, security breach, or cyber-attack were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or\napplications, or inappropriate disclosure of personal, confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability, our\ncompetitive position could be harmed and the further development and commercialization of our product candidates\ncould be delayed. Depending on the nature of the information compromised, in the event of a data breach or other\nunauthorized access to our patient data, we may also have obligations to notify patients and regulators about the incident,\nand we may need to provide some form of remedy, such as a subscription to credit monitoring services, pay significant\nfines to one or more regulators, or pay compensation in connection with a class-action settlement (including under the\nnew private right of action under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or the CCPA, which is expected to\nincrease security breach litigation). Such breach notification laws continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from one\njurisdiction to another. Complying with these obligations could cause us to incur substantial costs and could increase\nnegative publicity surrounding any incident that compromises patient data. Additionally, the financial exposure from the\nevents referenced above could either not be insured against or not be fully covered through any insurance that we may\nmaintain, and there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability in any of our contracts would be enforceable or\nadequate or would otherwise protect us from liabilities or damages as a result of the events referenced above. Any of the\nforegoing could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to limitation.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had federal net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards of $265.5 million. $0.3 million of\nthe federal NOLs will begin to expire in 2037, if not used prior to that date, and the remainder will carryforward\nindefinitely.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had state NOL carryforwards of $265.5 million, which will begin to expire in 2037, and\nexpire through 2043.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had local NOL carryforwards of $214.5 million, which will begin to expire in 2024, and\nexpire through 2043.\nTo the extent that we continue to generate taxable losses, unused losses will carry forward to offset future taxable\nincome, if any. Under legislative changes made by U.S. federal tax legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts\nand Jobs Act, or the TCJA, U.S. federal net operating losses incurred in 2018 and in future years may be carried forward\nindefinitely, but the ability to utilize such federal net operating losses to offset taxable income is limited to 80% of our\ntaxable income before the deduction for such net operating loss carryovers. It is uncertain if and to what extent various\nstates will conform to the TCJA.\nUnder Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the IRC, if a corporation undergoes\nan “ownership change,” generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-\nyear period, the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax\ncredits) to offset its post-change income and post-change liability may be limited. We have not undertaken a Section 382\nstudy, and it is possible that we have previously undergone one or more ownership changes so that our use of net\noperating losses is subject to limitation. We may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent\nshifts in our stock ownership. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change NOLs to offset\nU.S. federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability\n78\nto us. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of NOLs is suspended or otherwise\nlimited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed.\nU.S. federal income tax reform and changes in other tax laws could adversely affect us.\nTax laws are being re-examined and evaluated globally, and tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions\nof companies. Changes in tax laws and regulations in federal, state, local, and foreign jurisdictions could have material\nadverse impacts on our business, cash flows, operating results, or financial condition, and could materially affect our tax\nobligations and effective tax rate. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act significantly reformed the Internal Revenue\nCode of 1986, as amended, or the Code. This legislation, among other things, included changes to U.S. federal tax rates,\nimposed significant additional limitations on the deductibility of interest and the use of net operating losses generated in\ntax years beginning after December 31, 2017. Beginning in 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act also eliminated the option\nto immediately deduct research and development expenditures and required taxpayers to amortize domestic expenditures\nover five years and foreign expenditures over fifteen years. Changes in corporate tax rates, the realization of net deferred\ntax assets, and the deductibility of expenses under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act or future changes in tax laws could have a\nmaterial impact on the value of our deferred tax assets, could result in significant one-time charges in the current or\nfuture taxable years, and could increase our future U.S. tax expense. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent\nvarious states will conform to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act or any newly enacted federal tax legislation. Changes in tax\nlaws or regulations in the various tax jurisdictions we are subject to that are applied adversely to us or our clients could\nincrease the costs of our products and harm our business.\nAdditionally, we use our best judgment in attempting to quantify and reserve for our tax obligations. However, a\nchallenge by a taxing authority, a limitation on our ability to utilize tax benefits such as carryforwards or tax credits, or a\ndeviation from other tax-related assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,\nor financial condition.\nOur employees, principal investigators, CROs and consultants may engage in misconduct or other improper activities,\nincluding non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our employees, principal investigators, consultants and\ncommercial partners. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional failures to comply with the regulations of\nFDA and ex-U.S. regulators, provide accurate information to the FDA and ex-U.S. regulators, comply with healthcare\nfraud and abuse laws and regulations in the United States and abroad, report financial information or data accurately or\ndisclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, pricing, discounting, sales, marketing and business arrangements in\nthe healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks,\nself-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing,\ndiscounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements.\nSuch misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical studies, which\ncould result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation. We have adopted a code of conduct\napplicable to all of our employees, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the\nprecautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks\nor losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to\ncomply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in\ndefending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the\nimposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and could limit commercialization\nof any product candidates that we may develop.\nWe will face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our product candidates in clinical trials\nand will face an even greater risk if we commercialize any of our product candidates. If we cannot successfully defend\n79\nourselves against claims that our product candidates caused injuries, we could incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of\nmerit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n• decreased demand for any product candidates that we may develop;\n• injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n• initiation of investigations by regulators;\n• withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n• significant time and expenses to defend the related litigation;\n• diversion of management and scientific resources from our business operations;\n• substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n• loss of revenue; and\n• the inability to commercialize any product candidates that we may develop.\nWe currently hold limited product liability insurance coverage. We will need to purchase additional product liability\ninsurance coverage as we expand our clinical trials, and if we commence commercialization of our product candidates.\nInsurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or\nin an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise. A successful product liability claim or series of claims\nbrought against us, could decrease our cash and adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe are subject to U.S. and certain foreign export and import controls, sanctions, embargoes, anti-corruption laws,\nand anti-money laundering laws and regulations. Compliance with these legal standards could impair our ability to\ncompete in domestic and international markets. We can face criminal liability and other serious consequences for\nviolations that can harm our business.\nWe are subject to export control and import laws and regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations,\nU.S. Customs regulations, various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury\nDepartment’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, the U.S.\ndomestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. § 201, the U.S. Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, and other state and\nnational anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in the countries in which we conduct activities. Anti-corruption\nlaws are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees, agents, contractors, and other partners from\nauthorizing, promising, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or anything else of value to\nrecipients in the public or private sector. We may engage third parties for clinical trials outside of the United States, to\nsell our products abroad once we enter a commercialization phase, and/or to obtain necessary permits, licenses, patent\nregistrations, and other regulatory approvals. We have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of\ngovernment agencies or government-affiliated hospitals, universities, and other organizations. We can be held liable for\nthe corrupt or other illegal activities of our employees, agents, contractors, and other partners, even if we do not\nexplicitly authorize or have actual knowledge of such activities. Any violations of the laws and regulations described\nabove may result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties, imprisonment, the loss of export or import\nprivileges, debarment, tax reassessments, breach of contract and fraud litigation, reputational harm, and other\nconsequences.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile and fluctuate substantially, which could result in substantial losses\nfor holders of our common stock.\nOur stock price has been and is likely to continue to be volatile. The stock market in general and the market for\nbiotechnology companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating\nperformance of particular companies. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors,\nincluding:\n• results of preclinical studies or clinical trials of our product candidates or those of our competitors;\n• unanticipated or serious safety concerns related to the use of any of our product candidates;\n80\n• adverse regulatory decisions, including failure to receive regulatory approval for any of our product\ncandidates;\n• the success of competitive drugs or technologies;\n• regulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries applicable to our product\ncandidates;\n• the size and growth of our prospective patient populations;\n• developments concerning our collaborators, our external manufacturers or in-house manufacturing\ncapabilities;\n• inability to obtain adequate product supply for any product candidate for preclinical studies, clinical trials\nor future commercial sale or inability to do so at acceptable prices;\n• developments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents or other proprietary rights;\n• the recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n• the level of expenses related to any of our product candidates or clinical development programs;\n• the results of our efforts to discover, develop, acquire or in-license additional product candidates or drugs;\n• actual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, development timelines or\nrecommendations by securities analysts or publications of research reports about us or our industry;\n• variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n• changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n• market conditions in the biotechnology sector;\n• our cash position or the announcement or expectation of additional financing efforts;\n• health pandemics could adversely impact our business, including our clinical trials and clinical trial\noperations;\n• general economic, industry and market conditions, including rising interest rates, market volatility, a\npotential federal government shutdown and inflation;\n• general economic uncertainty and capital markets disruptions, which has been substantially impacted by\ngeopolitical instability due to the ongoing military conflicts around the world; and\n• other factors, including those described in this “Risk Factors” section, many of which are beyond our\ncontrol.\nOur executive officers, directors, principal stockholders and their affiliates exercise significant influence over our\ncompany, which will limit your ability to influence corporate matters and could delay or prevent a change in\ncorporate control.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our executive officers, directors, beneficial owners of 5% or more of our capital stock and\ntheir respective affiliates beneficially owned shares representing a substantial portion of our capital stock.\nThis group of stockholders may have the ability to control us through this ownership position and may be able to\ndetermine all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, these stockholders may be able to control elections of\ndirectors, amendments of our organizational documents or approval of any merger, sale of assets or other major\ncorporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock\nthat you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders. The interests of this group of stockholders may not\nalways coincide with your interests or the interests of other stockholders and they may act in a manner that advances\ntheir best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders, including seeking a premium value for their common\nstock, and might affect the prevailing market price for our common stock.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, capital\nappreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not currently intend to do so for the\nforeseeable future. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and\nexpansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any\nreturn to stockholders will be limited to the appreciation of stock. Therefore, the success of an investment in shares of\nour common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in value of the stock. We cannot guarantee you that shares\n81\nof our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders have purchased their\nshares.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, our\nability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating\nresults, investors’ views of us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we are required to furnish a report\nby our management on our internal control over financial reporting within our Form 10-K. However, while we remain\neither a small reporting or emerging growth company, we will not be required to include an attestation report on internal\ncontrol over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. Ensuring that we have\nadequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial\nstatements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that will need to be frequently evaluated. Our failure\nto maintain the effectiveness of our internal controls in accordance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business. If we identify one or more material weaknesses, it could result in\nan adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. In\naddition, if we are not able to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on Nasdaq.\nWe expect to hire additional personnel and may utilize external temporary resources to implement, document and\nmodify policies and procedures to maintain effective internal controls. However, it is possible that we may identify\ndeficiencies and weaknesses in our internal controls. If material weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal controls exist\nand go undetected or unremediated, our financial statements could contain material misstatements that, when discovered\nin the future, could cause us to fail to meet our future reporting obligations and cause the price of our common stock to\ndecline.\nWe will continue to incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company and our management will\ncontinue to be required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company, particularly after we are no longer an “emerging growth company,” we will continue to incur\nsignificant legal, accounting and other expenses. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and rules subsequently\nimplemented by the SEC and Nasdaq have imposed various requirements on public companies, including establishment\nand maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and\nother personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these\nrules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-\nconsuming and costly. We are an “emerging growth company” and “smaller reporting company,” and the reduced\ndisclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies and smaller reporting companies may make our\ncommon stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS\nAct. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have\ntotal annual gross revenue of $1.235 billion or more; (ii) December 31, 2025; (iii) the date on which we have issued\nmore than $1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to\nbe a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC, which means the market value of our common stock that is held\nby non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter.\nFor so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we are permitted and intend to rely on exemptions from certain\ndisclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These\nexemptions include:\n• not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-\nOxley Act;\n• not being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company\nAccounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s\nreport providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements;\n82\n• being permitted to present only two years of audited financial statements in addition to any required\nunaudited interim financial statements with correspondingly reduced “Management’s Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” disclosure in this Form 10-K;\n• reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation; and\n• exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and\nshareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nWe may choose to take advantage of some, but not all, of the available exemptions. Even after we no longer qualify as\nan emerging growth company, we may still qualify as a smaller reporting company, which would allow us to take\nadvantage of many of the same exemptions from disclosure requirements, including not being required to comply with\nthe auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and reduced disclosure obligations\nregarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. We cannot predict if investors will find\nour common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock\nless attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be\nmore volatile.\nIn addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition\nperiod for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the\nadoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have\nelected to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will not be\nsubject to the same adoption timelines for new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not\nemerging growth companies.\nWe are also a “smaller reporting company,” meaning that the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than\n$700.0 million and our annual revenue is less than $100.0 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. We\nwill continue to be a smaller reporting company if either (i) the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less\nthan $250.0 million or (ii) our annual revenue is less than $100.0 million during the most recently completed fiscal year\nand the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700.0 million. If we are a smaller reporting\ncompany at the time we cease to be an emerging growth company, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain\ndisclosure requirements that are available to smaller reporting companies. Specifically, as a smaller reporting company\nwe may choose to present only the two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in our Annual Report on\nForm 10-K and, similar to emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies have reduced disclosure\nobligations regarding executive compensation.\nThe exclusive forum provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may\nlimit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of\nour directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation, to the fullest extent permitted by law, provides that the Court of Chancery of the\nState of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for: any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action\nasserting a breach of fiduciary duty; any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General\nCorporation Law, or the DGCL, our restated certificate of incorporation, or our restated bylaws; or any action asserting a\nclaim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum provision does not apply to suits\nbrought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act.\nIt could apply, however, to a suit that falls within one or more of the categories enumerated in the exclusive forum\nprovision and asserts claims under the Securities Act, inasmuch as Section 22 of the Securities Act, creates concurrent\njurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act\nor the rule and regulations thereunder. There is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such provision with\nrespect to claims under the Securities Act, and our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with\nthe federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nIn March 2020, we amended and restated our restated bylaws to provide that the federal district courts of the United\nStates of America will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint\nasserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act, or a Federal Forum Provision. Our decision to adopt a\n83\nFederal Forum Provision followed a decision by the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware holding that such\nprovisions are facially valid under Delaware law. While there can be no assurance that federal or state courts will follow\nthe holding of the Delaware Supreme Court or determine that the Federal Forum Provision should be enforced in a\nparticular case, application of the Federal Forum Provision means that suits brought by our stockholders to enforce any\nduty or liability created by the Securities Act must be brought in federal court and cannot be brought in state court.\nThese choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds\nfavorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits with\nrespect to such claims. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provisions contained in our restated\ncertificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may\nincur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, results\nof operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the DGCL may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. Section 203\nimposes certain restrictions on mergers, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15% or\nmore of our common stock.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may\nbe beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove\nour current management.\nProvisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and our restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger,\nacquisition or other change in control of our company that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions\nin which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares. These provisions could also limit the price that\ninvestors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of\nour common stock. In addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our\nmanagement team, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our\ncurrent management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Among\nother things, these provisions:\n• establish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board are elected at one time;\n• permit only the board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill vacancies on the board;\n• provide that directors may only be removed “for cause” and only with the approval of two-thirds of our\nstockholders;\n• require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and\nrestated bylaws;\n• authorize the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that our board could use to implement a\nstockholder rights plan, also known as a “poison pill”;\n• eliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n• prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a\nmeeting of our stockholders;\n• prohibit cumulative voting; and\n• establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters\nthat can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings.\nMoreover, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL, which prohibits a person who owns in excess\nof 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of\nthe transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or\ncombination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nAny of these provisions of our charter documents or Delaware law could, under certain circumstances, depress the\nmarket price of our common stock.\n84\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe may be subject to securities litigation, which could result in substantial expenses and could divert management\nattention.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile. The stock market in general, and\nNasdaq and biopharmaceutical companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that\nhave often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. In the past, companies\nthat have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation.\nWe may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial\ncosts and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they publish negative evaluations of\nour stock, the price of our stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts\npublish about us or our business. We do not have any control over the analysts or the content and opinions included in\ntheir reports. If one or more of the analysts covering our business downgrade their evaluations of our stock, the trading\nprice of our stock would likely decrease. Even if we do obtain analyst coverage, if one or more of the analysts covering\nour business downgrade their evaluations of our stock, the price of our stock could decline. If one or more of these\nanalysts cease to cover our stock, we could lose visibility in the market for our stock, which in turn could cause our stock\nprice to decline.\nWe are subject to a variety of privacy and data security laws, and our failure to comply with them could harm our\nbusiness.\nWe maintain a large quantity of sensitive information, including confidential business and personal information in\nconnection with the operation of our business, and are subject to laws and regulations governing the privacy and security\nof such information.\nIn the United States, there are numerous federal and state privacy and data security laws and regulations governing the\ncollection, use, disclosure and protection of personal information, including federal and state health information privacy\nlaws, federal and state security breach notification laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws. Each of these\nconstantly evolving laws can be subject to varying interpretations. Additionally, the SEC and many jurisdictions have\nenacted or may enact laws and regulations requiring companies to disclose or otherwise provide notifications regarding\ndata security breaches. For example, the SEC recently adopted cybersecurity risk management and disclosure rules,\nwhich require the disclosure of information pertaining to cybersecurity incidents and cybersecurity risk management,\nstrategy, and governance. In addition, states are constantly adopting new laws or amending existing laws, requiring\nattention to frequently changing regulatory requirements with inconsistent or conflicting standards.\nFor example, California has enacted the CCPA, which became operative on January 1, 2020 and became enforceable by\nthe California Attorney General on July 1, 2020. Additionally, in the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, which\nexpands upon the CCPA, became effective on January 1, 2023. The CCPA and CPRA require covered companies to,\namong other things, provide new disclosures to California users, and affords such users new privacy rights such as the\nability to opt-out of certain sales of personal information and expanded rights to access and require deletion of their\npersonal information, opt-out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their\npersonal information is collected, used, and shared. The CCPA and CPRA provide for civil penalties for violations, as\nwell as a private right of action for security breaches that may increase security breach litigation. Potential uncertainty\nsurrounding the CCPA and CPRA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability, particularly in the event of a\ndata breach, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, including how we use personal information, our\nfinancial condition, the results of our operations or prospects. Virginia’s Consumer Data Protection Act, which took\neffect on January 1, 2023, requires opt-in consent from consumers to acquire and process their sensitive personal\ninformation, which includes information revealing a consumer’s physical and mental health diagnosis and genetic and\nbiometric information that can identify a consumer.\n85\nOther states including Colorado, Connecticut and Utah have passed similar laws, and a number of other states are\nactively considering bills with similar laws. To the extent multiple state-level laws are later introduced, it may require\ncostly and difficult efforts to achieve compliance with such laws that could expose us to fines and penalties for non-\ncompliance.\nIn the European Economic Area, or the EEA, the General Data Protection Regulation or the GDPR, governs the\ncollection, use, disclosure, transfer or other processing of personal data of European persons. Among other things, the\nGDPR imposes requirements regarding the security of personal data and notification of data processing obligations to\nthe competent national data processing authorities, changes the lawful bases on which personal data can be processed,\nexpands the definition of personal data and requires changes to informed consent practices, as well as more detailed\nnotices for clinical trial subjects and investigators. In addition, the GDPR increases the scrutiny of transfers of personal\ndata from clinical trial sites located in the EEA to the United States and other jurisdictions that the European\nCommission does not recognize as having “adequate” data protection laws (sometimes referred to as “third countries”),\nand imposes strict rules subject to substantial fines for breaches and violations (up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of\nour annual worldwide gross revenue). These obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent\nfrom one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other requirements or our practices.\nAdditionally, in the United Kingdom, or U.K., the Data Protection Act contains provisions, including its own\nderogations, for how GDPR is applied in the U.K. We have to continue to comply with the GDPR and also the U.K.’s\nData Protection Act, with each regime having the ability to fine up to the greater of €20 million (£17 million) or 4% of\nglobal turnover.\nAs of January 1, 2024, although effective July 10, 2023, the new EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, or DPF, has been\nrecognized as adequate under EU law to allow transfers of personal data from the EU (as well as the U.K. and\nSwitzerland) to certified companies in the U.S. However, the DPF is likely to face legal challenge at the Court of Justice\nof the European Union which could cause the legal requirements for personal data transfers from the Europe to the U.S.\nto become uncertain once again. We will monitor these legal developments and continue to use best practices to follow\nestablished European legal standards to conduct cross-border transfer of personal data.\nIn addition, while the CJEU upheld the adequacy of the standard contractual clauses (a standard form of contract\napproved by the European Commission as an adequate personal data transfer mechanism, and potential alternative to the\nPrivacy Shield), it made clear that reliance on them alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances. Use of\nthe standard contractual clauses must now be assessed on a case by case basis, taking into account the legal regime\napplicable in the destination country, in particular applicable surveillance laws and rights of individuals. The use of\nstandard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data specifically to the United States remains under review by a\nnumber of European data protection supervisory authorities, along with those of some other EU member states. German\nand Irish supervisory authorities have indicated, and enforced in recent rulings, that the standard contractual clauses\nalone provide inadequate protection for EU-U.S. data transfers. Further, on June 4, 2021 the European Commission\nfinalized new versions of the Standard Contractual Clauses, with the Implementing Decision now in effect as of June 27,\n2021. To comply with the Implementing Decision and the new Standard Contractual Clauses, we may need to implement\nadditional safeguards to further enhance the security of data transferred out of the EEA, conduct data transfer impact\nassessments, and review existing agreements which could increase our compliance costs, expose us to further regulatory\nscrutiny and liability, and adversely affect our business. The new standard contractual clauses apply only to the transfer\nof data outside of the EEA and/or Switzerland and not the United Kingdom, though the U.K.’s Information\nCommissioner’s Officer launched a public consultation on its draft international data transfer agreement in August 2021,\nand subsequently issued a new international data transfer agreement and addendum which we are required to use under\nArticle 46 of the U.K. GDPR when making restricted data transfers outside of the U.K.\nThe GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with\nsupervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the\nGDPR.\nCompliance with these and any other applicable privacy and data security laws and regulations is a rigorous and time-\nintensive process, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data\n86\nprotection rules. If we fail to comply with any such laws or regulations, we may face significant fines and penalties that\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the laws are not\nconsistent, and compliance in the event of a widespread data breach is costly.\nWe generally seek to comply with industry standards and are subject to the terms of our privacy policies and privacy-\nrelated obligations to third parties. We strive to comply with all applicable laws, policies, legal obligations and industry\ncodes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection to the extent possible. However, it is possible that these\nobligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may\nconflict with other rules or our practices. Any failure or perceived failure by us, even if unfounded, to comply with\napplicable privacy and data security laws and regulations, our privacy policies, or our privacy-related obligations to\nusers or other third parties, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personal\ninformation or other sensitive data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation, or public statements\nagainst us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause our users to lose trust in us, which would have an\nadverse effect on our reputation and business.\nAny significant change to applicable laws, regulations or industry practices regarding the use or disclosure of our users’\ndata, or regarding the manner in which the express or implied consent of users for the use and disclosure of such data is\nobtained – or in how these applicable laws, regulations or industry practices are interpreted and enforced by state, federal\nand international privacy regulators – could require us to modify our practices, possibly in a material manner, may\nsubject us to regulatory enforcement actions and fines, and may limit our ability to operate using the data that was\nvoluntarily shared with us.\nUnfavorable global economic conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of\noperations.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy and in the global\nfinancial markets. For example, the global financial crisis caused extreme volatility and disruptions in the capital and\ncredit markets, and, in recent months, the global economy has been impacted by increasing interest rates and inflation.\nLikewise, the capital and credit markets may be adversely affected by the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle\nEast, the possibility of a wider European or global conflict, global sanctions imposed in response thereto, and potential\nrecessions. Moreover, there has been recent turmoil in the global banking system. For example, in March 2023, Silicon\nValley Bank, SVB, was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, which appointed\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC, as receiver. While we did not hold any cash directly at SVB or\nother banking institutions that have since failed, we regularly maintain cash balances at third-party financial institutions\nin excess of the FDIC insurance limit and there is no guarantee that the federal government would guarantee all\ndepositors if such financial institutions were to fail, as they did with SVB depositors, in the event of further bank\nclosures and continued instability in the global banking system. A severe or prolonged economic downturn, such as the\nglobal financial crisis, could result in a variety of risks to our business, including, weakened demand for our product\ncandidates and our ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. A weak or declining\neconomy could also strain our suppliers, possibly resulting in supply disruption, or cause our customers to delay making\npayments for our services. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and we cannot anticipate all of the ways in\nwhich the current economic climate and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business.\nWe or the third parties upon whom we depend may be adversely affected by natural disasters and our business\ncontinuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster.\nNatural disasters could severely disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of\noperations, financial condition and prospects. If a natural disaster, power outage or other event occurred that prevented\nus from using all or a significant portion of our headquarters, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as our\nmanufacturing facilities, or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us\nto continue our business for a substantial period of time. In addition, the long-term effects of climate change on general\neconomic conditions and the pharmaceutical industry in particular are unclear, and may heighten or intensify existing\nrisk of natural disasters. The disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place may prove inadequate in\n87\nthe event of a serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited nature of our\ndisaster recovery and business continuity plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n88\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone\n89\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nWe recognize the critical importance of maintaining the trust and confidence of all of our stakeholders. Our business\ndepends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our information technology systems and those of our third-party\nvendors. Our board of directors is actively involved in oversight of our risk management program, and cybersecurity\nrepresents an important component of our risk management and compliance program.\nOur cybersecurity policies, standards, processes and practices are fully integrated into the Company’s enterprise-wide\nrisk management and compliance program and overseen by the Audit Committee, and are based on recognized\nframeworks established by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the International Organization for\nStandardization and other applicable industry standards. In general, we seek to address cybersecurity risks through a\ncomprehensive, cross-functional approach that is focused on preserving the confidentiality, security and availability of\nthe information that we collect and store by identifying, preventing and mitigating cybersecurity threats and effectively\nresponding to cybersecurity incidents when they occur.\nRisk Management and Strategy\nAs one of the critical elements of the Company’s overall risk management and compliance approach, the Company’s\ncybersecurity program is focused on the following key areas:\nGovernance: The Board’s oversight of cybersecurity risk management is led by the Audit Committee of the\nBoard, which regularly interacts with our Chief Compliance Officer, our Executive Director of IT, and other members of\nmanagement.\nCollaborative Approach: We have implemented a comprehensive, cross-functional approach to identifying,\npreventing and mitigating cybersecurity threats and incidents, while also implementing controls and procedures that\nprovide for the prompt escalation of certain cybersecurity incidents so that decisions regarding the public disclosure and\nreporting of such incidents can be made by management in a timely manner.\nTechnical Safeguards: We deploy technical safeguards that are designed to protect our information systems\nfrom cybersecurity threats, including firewalls, intrusion prevention and detection systems, Security Information and\nEvent Management systems, Extended Detection and Response with 24/7 Security Operations Center, anti-malware\nfunctionality and access controls, which are evaluated and improved through vulnerability assessments and cybersecurity\nthreat intelligence.\nIncident Response and Recovery Planning: We have established and maintain comprehensive incident\nresponse and recovery plans to address our response to a cybersecurity incident, and such plans are tested and evaluated\non a regular basis.\nThird-Party Risk Management: We maintain a risk-based approach to identifying and overseeing\ncybersecurity risks presented by third parties, including vendors, service providers and other external users of our\nsystems, as well as the systems of third parties that could adversely impact our business in the event of a cybersecurity\nincident affecting those third-party systems.\nEducation and Awareness: We provide regular, mandatory training for personnel regarding cybersecurity\nthreats as a means to equip our employees with effective tools to address cybersecurity threats, and to communicate our\nevolving information security policies, standards, processes and practices. We also perform periodic email phishing tests\nto keep cybersecurity awareness top of mind.\n90\nWe engage in the periodic assessment of our policies, standards, processes and practices that are designed to address\ncybersecurity threats and incidents. These efforts include a wide range of activities, including audits, assessments,\nvulnerability testing and other exercises focused on evaluating the effectiveness of our cybersecurity measures and\nplanning. The results of such assessments, audits and reviews are reported to the Audit Committee and the Board, and\nwe adjust our cybersecurity policies, standards, processes and practices as necessary based on the information provided\nby these assessments, audits and reviews.\nGovernance\nThe Board, with leadership from the Audit Committee, oversees our cybersecurity risk management process. The Audit\nCommittee receives regular presentations and reports on cybersecurity risks, which address a wide range of topics\nincluding recent developments, evolving standards, vulnerability assessments, the threat environment, technological\ntrends and information security considerations arising with respect to our peers and third parties. The board of directors\nand the Audit Committee also receive prompt and timely information regarding any cybersecurity incident that meets\nestablished reporting thresholds, as well as ongoing updates regarding any such incident until it has been addressed. On a\nperiodic basis, the board of directors, through the Audit Committee, discuss our approach to cybersecurity risk\nmanagement with the Executive Director of IT.\nOur Executive Director of IT, in coordination with our executive management team, works collaboratively across the\nCompany to implement a program designed to protect our information systems from cybersecurity threats and to\npromptly respond to any cybersecurity incidents in accordance with our incident response and recovery plans. Through\nongoing communications with our entire employee base and appropriate third-party contractors, the Executive Director\nof IT and the management team monitor the prevention, detection, mitigation and remediation of cybersecurity threats\nand incidents in real time, and report such threats and incidents to the Audit Committee when appropriate.\nOur Executive Director of IT has over 28 years of experience in leading IT teams and managing cybersecurity in several\nindustries including biotech, media and consumer products. He has hands-on experience as an IT network engineer and\nsystems administrator, configuring and hardening systems against security threats. In addition, he has previously held\nexecutive-level leadership IT roles. Throughout his career, he has kept abreast of new developments in cybersecurity and\nhas implemented industry standards to secure IT infrastructure and systems. He works closely with the Company’s IT\nmanaged service provider to assess all security incidents and events and escalate as needed.\nNo cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, have materially affected or are\nreasonably likely to affect us, including our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition.\n91\nItem 2. Properties\nOur principal executive office is located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where we lease a total of approximately 37,000\nsquare feet of office space, or the 2005 Market Street Lease Agreement, which commenced in February 2021 and will\nexpire in December 2031, subject to our option to extend the term of the lease by up to two additional five-year terms. In\nAugust 2023 and September 2023, we entered into two sublease agreements, for certain periods of time, which subleased\nsubstantially all of our office space under the 2005 Market Street Lease Agreement.\nOur Philadelphia employee base has substantially transitioned to hybrid and remote working arrangements. To assist our\nhybrid workforce, in February 2024, we entered into a sublease agreement for approximately 16,000 square feet of office\nspace at 1835 Market Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19103. The sublease term is expected to begin in March 2024,\nand continues through August 2025. We have the option to extend the term of the sublease agreement through\nFebruary 28, 2029.\nWe also lease approximately 62,000 square feet of laboratory space at the Princeton West Innovation Campus in\nHopewell, New Jersey. This lease has a 15-year term from the lease commencement date of March 2021. We have the\noption to extend the term of the lease by up to two additional five-year terms.\nWe believe that our facilities are sufficient to meet our current needs and that suitable additional space will be available\nas and when needed.\n92\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, we may be involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business.\nWe are currently a defendant in litigation with a former employee in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County\n(Commerce Division), or the Court, relating to a claim of breach of contract and violation of the Pennsylvania Wage\nPayment and Collection Law. The plaintiff claims that, pursuant to an alleged settlement agreement reached on\nFebruary 3, 2020, we agreed to issue plaintiff 150,000 shares of our common stock and that such shares would not be\nsubject to the reverse stock split implemented by us in connection with our initial public offering on February 14, 2020.\nThe plaintiff’s claim is for an amount in the mid-single digit millions of dollars. We disagree with the allegations that\nthere was ever a binding settlement agreement or that any shares would not be subject to the reverse stock split, and we\nbelieve the plaintiff’s claim is without merit. In October 2023, the Court denied both the Company’s and the plaintiff’s\nmotions for summary judgement and therefore we anticipate that this matter will go to trial in 2024. We intend to\nvigorously defend against these claims, and believe we have strong arguments to prevail in the litigation. There can be\nno assurance that we will prevail on our claims.\nOther than the above, we are not presently a party to any legal proceedings that, in the opinion of management, would\nhave a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us due\nto defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, negative publicity and reputational harm, and other\nfactors.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\n93\nPART II\nItem 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters, and Issuer Purchases of Equity\nSecurities\nMarket Information for Common Stock\nOur common stock has been listed on The Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol “PASG” since February 28,\n2020. Prior to that there was no public trading market for our common stock.\nHolders of Record\nAs of February 28, 2024, there were approximately 24 stockholders of record of our common stock. The actual\nnumber of stockholders is greater than this number of record holders, and includes stockholders who are beneficial\nowners, but whose shares are held in street name by brokers and other nominees. This number of holders of record also\ndoes not include stockholders whose shares may be held in trust by other entities.\nDividend Policy\nWe currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, for use in operation of our business and to fund future growth.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends\nin the foreseeable future. Payment of cash dividends, if any, in the future will be at the discretion of our board of\ndirectors and will depend on then-existing conditions, including our financial condition, operating results, contractual\nrestrictions, capital requirements, business prospects and other factors our board of directors may deem relevant.\nUnregistered Sales of Equity Securities\nNone.\nUse of Proceeds from Registered Securities\nNone.\nPurchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers\nNone.\nItem 6. [Reserved]\nNot Applicable.\n94\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction\nwith our financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K. In addition to historical financial information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-\nlooking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans,\nobjectives, expectations, intentions and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these\nforward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth in the section titled “Risk Factors”\nunder Item 1A above.\nOverview\nWe are a clinical stage genetic medicines company on a mission to improve the lives of patients with neurodegenerative\ndiseases. Our primary focus is the development and advancement of cutting-edge, one-time therapies designed to target\nthe underlying pathology of these conditions.\nWe were incorporated in July 2017 under the laws of the State of Delaware. Since inception, our operations have\nconsisted primarily of conducting preclinical studies, developing licensed technology, conducting clinical trials, and\nmanufacturing clinical supply to support clinical trials. We have incurred recurring losses, the majority of which are\nattributable to research and development activities, and negative cash flows from operations. Historically, we have\nfunded our operations through the sale of convertible preferred stock and public offerings of common stock. Our net\nlosses were $102.1 million and $136.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of $594.5 million. Our primary use of cash is to fund operating\nexpenses, which consist primarily of research and development expenditures, and to a lesser extent, general and\nadministrative expenditures. Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend\nheavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our current or future product\ncandidates. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we\nadvance our product candidates through all stages of development and clinical trials and, ultimately, seek regulatory\napproval. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant\ncommercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution. Our net losses may\nfluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year, depending on the timing of our clinical trials and our\nexpenditures on other research and development activities.\nWe will need to raise substantial additional capital to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy.\nUntil such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we plan to finance our operations\nthrough the sale of equity, debt financings or other capital sources, which may include collaborations with other\ncompanies or other strategic transactions. There are no assurances that we will be successful in obtaining an adequate\nlevel of financing as and when needed to finance our operations on terms acceptable to us or at all. Any failure to raise\ncapital as and when needed could have a negative impact on our financial condition and on our ability to pursue our\nbusiness plans and strategies. If we are unable to secure adequate additional funding, we may have to significantly delay,\nscale back or discontinue the development and commercialization of one or more product candidates or delay our pursuit\nof potential in-licenses or acquisitions.\nIn July 2023, we implemented an organizational restructuring to better align our resources with our previously\nannounced focused research and development strategy and further extend our cash runway. In connection with the\norganizational restructuring, we reduced our workforce by approximately 26 percent, primarily in our CMC group.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $114.3 million. We expect our\nexisting cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital\nexpenditure requirements into the fourth quarter of 2025.\n95\nFinancial Operations Overview\nLicense Agreement\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\nWe have a research, collaboration and licensing agreement with Penn, as amended, or the Penn Agreement, for research\nand development collaborations and exclusive license rights to patents for certain products and technologies. Under the\nPenn Agreement, we have the option to obtain exclusive licenses to, and to fund, certain research relating to the\npreclinical development of selected products in research programs in rare monogenic CNS indications. We have eight\nremaining options available to commence additional licensed programs for CNS indications until August 3, 2026.\nThe Penn Agreement includes an exploratory research program to identify targets and early product candidates in certain\nagreed upon non-monogenic, non-rare, or large, CNS indications. The initial term of the exploratory research program is\nthree years, or until August 2024, which term can be extended by mutual agreement. During such term, we will have an\nexclusive right of first negotiation to include additional targets to the exploratory research program in the agreed upon\nlarge CNS indications. Under the exploratory research program, we will have the right to further develop and\ncommercialize any gene therapy product candidates specific for those selected targets that arise from the exploratory\nresearch programs by exercising one of our remaining eight options. We currently do not have any active exploratory\nresearch programs.\nIf we were to exercise any of the remaining options, we would owe Penn a non-refundable aggregate fee of $1.0 million\nper product indication, with $0.5 million due upfront and another $0.5 million fee owed upon a further developmental\nmilestone.\nWe also fund discovery research conducted by Penn through August 3, 2026 and will receive exclusive rights, subject to\ncertain limitations, to platform technologies resulting from the discovery research for our products developed with GTP,\nsuch as novel capsids, toxicity reduction technologies and delivery and formulation improvements. This funding\ncommitment for the discovery research is $5.0 million annually, paid in quarterly increments of $1.3 million through\nJune 2026.\nThe Penn Agreement requires that we make payments of up to (i) $16.5 million per product candidate for rare,\nmonogenic disorders in the aggregate and (ii) $39.0 million per product candidate in the aggregate arising from the\nexploratory program for large CNS indications. Each payment will be due upon the achievement of specific development\nmilestone events by such licensed product for a first indication, reduced development milestone payments for the second\nand third indications and no development milestone payments for subsequent indications. In addition, on a product-by-\nproduct basis, we are obligated to make up to $55.0 million in sales milestone payments on each licensed product based\non annual sales of the licensed product in excess of defined thresholds.\nUpon successful commercialization of a product using the licensed technology, we are obligated to pay to Penn, on a\nlicensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis, tiered royalties (subject to customary reductions) in\nthe mid-single digits on annual worldwide net sales of such licensed product. In addition, we are obligated to pay to\nPenn a percentage of sublicensing income, ranging from the mid-single digits to low double digits, for sublicenses under\nthe Penn Agreement. The agreement will expire on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis\nupon the later of (i) the expiration of the last valid claim of the licensed patent rights that covers the exploitation of such\nlicensed product in such country, and (ii) the expiration of the royalty period. In addition, we will pay a tiered transaction\nfee of 1-2% of the net proceeds upon certain change of control events.\nCollaboration and Manufacturing and Supply Agreements\nCatalent\nIn June 2019, we entered into a collaboration agreement, or the Collaboration Agreement, with Catalent. As part of the\nCollaboration Agreement, we were required to pay an annual fee for five years ending in 2025 for the exclusive use of a\n96\ndedicated clean room suite, or the Clean Room Suite. In April 2020, we entered into a development services and clinical\nsupply agreement, or the Manufacturing and Supply Agreement, with Catalent to secure clinical scale manufacturing\ncapacity for batches of active pharmaceutical ingredients for our gene therapy product candidates. Under the terms of the\nManufacturing and Supply Agreement, Catalent agreed to manufacture batches of drug product for our gene therapy\nproduct candidates at the Clean Room Suite at a Catalent facility provided for in the Collaboration Agreement. The\nManufacturing and Supply Agreement provided for a term of five years. The Manufacturing and Supply Agreement also\nincluded minimum annual purchase commitments.\nUnder both the Collaboration Agreement and the Manufacturing and Supply Agreement, we had an annual minimum\ncommitment of $10.6 million per year owed to Catalent for five years from November 2020 subject to certain\ninflationary adjustments.\nOn March 31, 2023, we entered into certain letter agreements, the Letter Agreements, amending each of (i) the\nCollaboration Agreement and (ii) the Manufacturing and Supply Agreement, together with the Collaboration Agreement,\nthe Original Catalent Agreements. On November 9, 2023, to supersede and implement the terms of the Letter\nAgreements, we entered into an amended and restated collaboration agreement and an amended and restated\nmanufacturing and supply agreement, together the Amended Catalent Agreements.\nThe Amended Catalent Agreements eliminate the minimum annual purchase obligation and the obligation to pay an\nannual fee for use of the Clean Room Suite, thereby eliminating the annual minimum commitment of $10.6 million per\nyear owed to Catalent through November 2025 under the Original Catalent Agreements. In consideration of this, we\nhave an obligation to make aggregate payments to Catalent of $6.0 million between June 30, 2023 and May 1, 2024.\nThe Amended Catalent Agreements extend the term of the Original Catalent Agreements until November 6, 2030, and\nestablish a limited exclusive relationship between us and Catalent for the manufacture of bulk drug substance and drug\nproduct for our adeno-associated virus delivery therapeutic product candidates for the treatment of FTD and GM1. The\nlimited exclusive relationship under the Amended Catalent Agreements converts to a non-exclusive relationship (i) in the\nevent Catalent fails to meet certain performance standards and (ii) following certain conditional events related to the\ndivestiture by us of either FTD or GM1, in which case, if such events occur, we would pay Catalent certain fees. In\naddition, in the event of certain transactions, we may terminate the Amended Catalent Agreements for convenience with\nrespect to such products, in which case, we would pay to Catalent a certain termination fee.\nImmediately prior to the execution of the Letter Agreements, we had a $5.3 million prepaid asset related to upfront\npayments made to secure the Clean Room Suite. In connection with the Letter Agreements, we no longer have exclusive\naccess to the Clean Room Suite at Catalent and, as a result, we recognized an expense of $5.3 million related to the\nelimination of the prepaid asset during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nWe classified the $11.3 million of expenses, which comprises of $6.0 million in aggregate payments due to Catalent and\nthe $5.3 million elimination of the prepaid asset, as general and administrative expense within the statement of\noperations for the year ended December 31, 2023, as both amounts do not directly relate to the future advancement of\nour research and development programs.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we made payments of $4.0 million under the Amended Catalent Agreements. The remaining\n$2.0 million of aggregate payments due to Catalent under the Amended Catalent Agreements are included in accrued\nexpenses and other current liabilities.\n97\nComponents of Results of Operations\nResearch and Development and Acquired In-Process Research and Development\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred in connection with the development of our\nproduct candidates. These expenses include:\n• expenses incurred to conduct the necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials required to obtain\nregulatory approval, including payments to clinical research organizations, or CROs, and payments to\nGTP for preclinical research and development;\n• personnel expenses, including salaries, benefits and share-based compensation expense for employees\nengaged in research and development functions;\n• expenses incurred under agreements with contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, including\nthe cost of acquiring and manufacturing preclinical study and clinical trial materials;\n• expenses and fees paid to consultants who assist with research and development activities; and\n• expenses incurred at and for our lab facilities, including rent, utilities, depreciation, and maintenance.\nAcquired in-process research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred in obtaining technology licenses\nrelated to technology that has not reached technological feasibility and has no alternative future use.\nWe track outsourced development expenses and other external research and development expenses to specific product\ncandidates on a program-by-program basis, such as expenses incurred under our collaboration with Penn, fees paid to\nCROs, CMOs and research laboratories in connection with our preclinical development, process development,\nmanufacturing and clinical development activities. However, we do not track our internal research and development\nexpenses on a program-by-program basis as they primarily relate to compensation and other expenses which are\ndeployed across multiple projects under development.\nResearch and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical\ndevelopment generally have higher development expenses than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily\ndue to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials.\nWe expect our research and development expenses to remain consistent or decrease in the near future. If our product\ncandidate portfolio progresses into later-stage clinical trials, we expect that our research and development expenses will\nincrease in the future to support our continued research and development activities and production of clinical supply.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses, including salaries, benefits and share-\nbased compensation expense, for employees and consultants in executive, finance, accounting, legal, information\ntechnology, product strategy, quality, regulatory, operations and human resource functions. General and administrative\nexpenses also include corporate facility costs, including rent, utilities, depreciation and maintenance, legal expenses\nrelated to intellectual property, litigation and corporate matters, insurance expense, expenses related to contract\nmodifications or terminations, software expenses, expenses incurred to engage with patient advocacy organizations,\nrecruitment related expenses and expenses for other professional and consulting services. We expect our general and\nadministrative expenses to remain consistent in the near future, after excluding the impacts of the Amended Catalent\nAgreements.\n98\nIf our product candidate portfolio progresses into later-stage clinical trials, we expect that our general and administrative\nexpenses will increase in the future to support our continued research and development activities and potential\ncommercialization efforts. These increases will likely include increased expenses related to the hiring of additional\npersonnel in general and administrative functions, and expenses related to pre-commercialization efforts. If any of our\ncurrent or future product candidates obtain regulatory approval, we expect that we would incur significantly increased\nexpenses associated with building a commercial sales and marketing team.\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nImpairment of long-lived assets consists of non-cash impairment charges recorded to the Company’s assets. The\nCompany reviews long-lived assets, such as the right of use assets or property and equipment, for impairments when\nevents or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. During the year\nended December 31, 2023, we recognized impairment expense in connection with Sublease Agreement A and Sublease\nAgreement B. These impairment expenses represent the proportional allocation of total impairments recognized for the\nasset groups subject to impairment testing in connection with the Company’s sublease agreements.\nOther income (expense), net\nOther income (expense), net consists of interest earned on our cash equivalents and marketable securities, and\namortization of premium and discount on our marketable securities. Additionally, in the year ended December 31, 2023,\nwe recognized other income related to the sale of certain tax credits.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nYear ended\nDecember 31,\n(in thousands) 2023 2022 Change\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development ................. $ 61,419 $ 86,053 $ (24,634)\nAcquired in‑process research and development. — 3,000 (3,000)\nGeneral and administrative ................. 41,580 49,341 (7,761)\nImpairment of long-lived assets ............. 5,390 — 5,390\nLoss from operations .....................

The decrease was primarily due to the following:\n• a decrease of $16.2 million in chemistry, manufacturing and control expenses primarily related to less activity\nin 2023 for external manufacturing expenses and internal lab operations expenses to support production of\nclinical supply, most significantly within our FTD-GRN program;\n• a decrease of $6.9 million in wages and benefits related to reductions in headcount;\n• a decrease of $2.7 million in share-based compensation expense related to reductions in headcount and lower\nfair value of awards granted during the year-ended December 31, 2023;\n• a decrease of $0.9 million in professional fees related to our decision to stop further clinical development of our\nKrabbe and MLD programs; and\n99\n• a decrease of $0.5 million for clinical operations expenses related to our decision in 2022 to stop further clinical\ndevelopment of our Krabbe and MLD programs, partially offset by additional patient enrollment in our FTD-\nGRN and GM1 programs;\nThese decreases were partially offset by:\n• an increase of $2.2 million in Penn expenses. Expenses associated with the Penn Agreement will continue to\nvary from year to year based on our selection and prioritization of preclinical product candidates, the status of\nour preclinical pipeline and timing of preclinical work performed; and\n• an increase of $0.3 million in facility and other expenses.\nAcquired In-Process Research and Development Expenses\nWe did not incur acquired in-process research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023. We\nmade payments under the Penn Agreement for acquired in-process research and development of $3.0 million related to\nthe achievement of development milestones during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by $7.7 million to $41.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023\nfrom $49.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to the following:\n• a decrease of $9.0 million in wages and benefits expenses related to reductions in headcount;\n• a decrease of $5.3 million in share-based compensation expense related to reductions in headcount and lower\nfair value of awards granted during the year-ended December 31, 2023; and\n• a decrease of $4.7 million in professional fees, facilities, and other expenses;\nThese decreases were partially offset by:\n• an increase of $11.3 million related to expenses incurred in conjunction with the Amended Catalent\nAgreements.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded $5.4 million of impairment expenses in connection with\nSublease Agreement A and Sublease Agreement B. The impairment charges consisted of $2.2 million and $3.2 million\nrecorded to the right of use assets and property and equipment, net, respectively. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, we did not record any impairment expense.\nOther Income (Expense), net\nOther income (expense), net increased by $4.0 million to $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 from $2.3\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to the following:\n• an increase of $0.5 million attributable to interest income earned on cash equivalents and marketable securities;\n•\nan increase of $2.8 million attributable to the amortization of premium and discount on our marketable\nsecurities; and\n•\nan increase of $0.7 million related to the sale of certain tax credits during the current year\n100\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $114.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and had an\naccumulated deficit of $594.5 million. We expect our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will\nenable us to fund our operating expense and capital expenditures into the fourth quarter of 2025.\nFunding Requirements\nOur primary use of cash is to fund operating expenses, most significantly research and development expenditures. Cash\nused to fund operating expenses is impacted by the timing of when we pay these expenses, as reflected in the change in\nour outstanding accounts payable, accrued expenses and prepaid expenses.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of\npharmaceutical products, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our operating capital requirements. Our future\nfunding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n• the scope, timing, progress and results of discovery, preclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical\ntrials for our product candidates;\n• the expenses of manufacturing our product candidates for clinical trials and in preparation for marketing\napproval and commercialization;\n• the extent to which we enter into collaborations or other arrangements with additional third parties in order to\nfurther develop our product candidates;\n• the expenses of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual\nproperty rights and defending intellectual property-related claims;\n• the expenses and fees associated with the discovery, acquisition or in-license of additional product candidates\nor technologies;\n• the expenses related to general and administrative functions to support our product candidates;\n• our ability to establish additional collaborations on favorable terms, if at all;\n• the expenses required to scale up our clinical, regulatory and manufacturing capabilities;\n• the expenses of future commercialization activities, if any, including establishing sales, marketing,\nmanufacturing and distribution capabilities, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing\napproval; and\n• revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates, should any of our product\ncandidates receive marketing approval.\nWe will need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements for clinical trials, other research and\ndevelopment expenditures, and business development activities. We currently have no credit facility or committed\nsources of capital. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and\ncommercialization of our product candidates, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and\noperating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical studies.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our operations through a\ncombination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and marketing, distribution or\nlicensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt\nsecurities, existing stockholders’ ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include\nliquidation or other preferences that adversely affect existing stockholders’ rights as common stockholders. Debt\nfinancing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or\nrestricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making acquisitions or capital\nexpenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing,\ndistribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies,\nfuture revenue streams, research programs or drug candidates, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.\n101\nIf we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or other arrangements when needed, we may\nbe required to delay, limit, further reduce or terminate our research, product development or future commercialization\nefforts, or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market\nourselves.\nOn March 5, 2021, we entered into a Sales Agreement, or the Sales Agreement, with Cowen and Company, LLC, or\nCowen, pursuant to which we may, but are not obligated to, offer and sell, from time to time, shares of our common\nstock with an aggregate offering price up to $125.0 million through Cowen, as sales agent. No sales of common stock\nhave been made pursuant to this Sales Agreement to date.\nCash Flows\nThe following table shows a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nYea r ended\nDecember 31,\n(in thousands) 2023 2022\nCash provided by (used in) operating activities .................................... $ (78,264) $ (118,210)\nCash provided by (used in) investing activities..................................... 65,237 25,199\nCash provided by (used in) financing activities .................................... 135 (1,353)\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents................................ $ (12,892) $ (94,364)\nNet Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we used $78.3 million of net cash in operating activities, primarily to fund\nour operations related to the development of our product candidates and related general and administrative support\nactivities. Cash used in operating activities reflected our net loss of $102.1 million, which was partially offset by a net\ndecrease in our operating assets of $5.3 million and net non-cash charges of $18.5 million primarily related to share-\nbased compensation, depreciation and amortization, impairment of long-lived assets, and amortization of premium and\ndiscount, net.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we used $118.2 million of net cash in operating activities, primarily to fund\nour operations related to the development of our product candidates and related general and administrative support\nactivities. Cash used in operating activities reflected our net loss of $136.1 million and a net decrease in our operating\nassets of $8.5 million. This was partially offset by net non-cash charges of $26.4 million primarily related to share-based\ncompensation, depreciation and amortization, and amortization of premium and discount, net.\nNet Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we purchased $129.4 million in marketable securities and had sales and\nmaturities of $194.8 million in marketable securities. Additionally, we used $0.1 million for the purchase of property and\nequipment.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we purchased $157.8 million in marketable securities and had sales and\nmaturities of $188.3 million in marketable securities. Additionally, we used $2.3 million for the purchase of property and\nequipment and we used $3.0 million to purchase technology rights from Penn.\nNet Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we received $0.1 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock\nunder the ESPP.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we received $0.1 million from the exercise of stock options, received $0.3\nmillion in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the ESPP and paid $1.8 million for insurance premiums\nand insurance premium financing expenses under our short-term insurance premium financing arrangement.\n102\nContractual obligations and other commitments\nWe lease approximately 37,000 square feet of office space in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, or the 2005 Market Street\nLease Agreement. The lease will expire in December 2031. We have an option to extend the term of the lease by up to\ntwo additional five-year terms. The aggregate estimated rent payments due over the initial term of the lease is $11.8\nmillion, with rent payments that began in 2022. Sublease Agreement A and Sublease Agreement B do not relieve us\nfrom our primary obligations under the 2005 Market Street Lease Agreement, however, we do expect cash inflows from\nthe agreements to partially offset our future obligations for the duration of the sublease agreements.\nWe lease approximately 62,000 square feet of laboratory space in Hopewell, NJ, or the Laboratory Lease Agreement.\nThe lease will expire in March 2036. The aggregate estimated rent payments due over the initial term of the lease is\napproximately $40.3 million, with rent payments that began in 2021.\nAs a result of the Amended Catalent Agreements, we no longer have an annual minimum commitment of $10.6 million\nper year owed to Catalent through November 2025. As of December 31, 2023, the Company made payments of $4.0\nmillion under the Amended Catalent Agreements. In addition, the Company will make aggregate payments to Catalent\nof $2.0 million between January 1, 2024 and May 1, 2024.\nUnder the Penn Agreement, we agreed to fund discovery research conducted by GTP for five years, which began in May\n2020. Our funding commitment is $5.0 million a year through June 2026.\nThese contractual obligations and commitments are associated with contracts that are enforceable and legally binding\nand that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum services to be used, fixed, minimum or variable price\nprovisions, and the approximate timing of the actions under the contracts. Payments due upon cancellation consisting\nonly of payments for services provided or expenses incurred, including noncancelable obligations of our service\nproviders, up to the date of cancellation are not included as the amount and timing of such payments are not known.\nThe contractual obligations and commitments above do not include any potential milestone or royalty payments that we\nmay be required to make under the Penn Agreement.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial\nstatements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation\nof these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,\nliabilities, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing\nbasis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to long-lived assets and accrued expenses. We\nbase our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and various other factors that are believed to be\nreasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values\nof assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates\nunder different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 3 to our annual financial statements\nincluded elsewhere in this Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to the\njudgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\n103\nLong-Lived Assets\nWe assess long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of\nthe assets or the asset group may not be recoverable. We measure the recoverability of assets that we will continue to use\nin our operations by comparing the carrying value of the asset groups to our estimate of the related total future\nundiscounted net cash flows. If an asset group’s carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash\nflows, the asset group is considered to be impaired.\nIn the event the carrying value exceeds the future undiscounted net cash flows, we estimate the fair values using either\nthe income approach, market approach, or a combination of the two. The income approach is based on the present value\nof future cash flows of each asset group, while the market approach is based on industry and economic conditions,\nincluding estimates on prevailing prices and rates for similar assets. The approaches are asset group specific and may\nincorporate a number of market participant assumptions in assessing fair value including future growth rates, discount\nrates, and market activity. We measure the impairment by comparing the difference between the asset group’s carrying\nvalue and its fair value. Long-lived assets are considered a non-financial asset and are recorded at fair value only if an\nimpairment charge is recognized. Impairments are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of\nidentifiable independent cash flows.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded impairments of long-lived assets (property and equipment and\nright of use assets) of $5.4 million based upon impairment testing in connection with Sublease Agreement A and\nSublease Agreement B.\nActual future net cash flows are uncertain, subject to risks, and may change depending upon several factors, including\nindustry or economic trends. If our estimates of future net cash flows differ from actual future net cash flows, our\nestimates of fair value could materially change. Additionally, future events or changes in circumstances could indicate\nthat the carrying value of our long-lived assets may not be recoverable and lead to future impairments. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, we had property and equipment, net of $15.3 million and right of use assets of $16.9 million\nrecorded on our balance sheet.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred and consist primarily of expenses incurred with GTP, contract\nresearch organizations, contract manufacturing organizations, internal analytical and testing activities, and employee-\nrelated expenses, including salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation.\nWe make estimates of our external accrued research and development expenses, which primarily relates to activities\nperformed by our contract research organizations and contract manufacturing organizations, as of each balance sheet\ndate in our financial statements based on an estimate of progress to completion of specific tasks using facts and\ncircumstances known to us at that time. We determine the estimates by reviewing contracts, vendor agreements and\nchange orders, invoicing to date, reviewing vendor provided supporting documentation and through discussions with our\ninternal personnel and external service providers as to the progress to completion of services and the agreed-upon fee to\nbe paid for such services.\nActual costs and estimates of progress to completion of our contract research organizations and contract manufacturing\norganizations are uncertain, subject to risks and may change depending upon a number of factors, including our\nenrollment levels and status of our clinical trials, and timing of our manufacturing activities. Such estimates are\nuncertain given the level of visibility we have towards the activities of our contract research organizations and contract\nmanufacturing organizations. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the\nestimate, we will adjust the accrual and related expenses accordingly.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 3 to our financial statements found elsewhere in this Form 10-K for a description of recent accounting\npronouncements applicable to our financial statements.\n104\nJOBS Act Accounting Election\nWe are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act.\nUnder the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued\nsubsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies.\nWe have elected to use this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have\ndifferent effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date we (i) are no longer an emerging\ngrowth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act.\nAs a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting\npronouncements as of public company effective dates.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (1) the last day of our first fiscal year (a) in which we\nhave total annual gross revenues of at least $1.235 billion, or (b) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer,\nwhich means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of the prior\nJune 30th, (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior\nthree-year period and (3) December 31, 2025.\nWe are also a “smaller reporting company,” meaning that the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than\n$700.0 million and our annual revenue is less than $100.0 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. We\nmay continue to be a smaller reporting company if either (i) the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less\nthan $250.0 million or (ii) our annual revenue is less than $100.0 million during the most recently completed fiscal year\nand the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700.0 million. If we are a smaller reporting\ncompany at the time we cease to be an emerging growth company, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain\ndisclosure requirements that are available to smaller reporting companies. Specifically, as a smaller reporting company\nwe may choose to present only the two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in our Annual Report on\nForm 10-K and, similar to emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies have reduced disclosure\nobligations regarding executive compensation.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. Our primary exposure to market risk is\ninterest rate sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates, particularly because our\ninvestments are in marketable securities. Our marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and could fall in value\nif market interest rates increase. However, we believe that our exposure to interest rate risk is not significant as the\nmajority of our investments are short-term in duration and due to the low risk profile of our investments, a 10% change\nin interest rates would not have a material effect on the total market value of our investment portfolio. We have the\nability to hold our marketable securities until maturity, and therefore we would not expect our operating results or cash\nflows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a change in market interest rates on our investments.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we held $114.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, all of which\nwas denominated in U.S. dollar assets, and consisting primarily of cash accounts in banking institutions and investments\nin money market funds, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, corporate debt securities, United States, or U.S.,\ngovernment debt securities and U.S. government agency securities.\nWe are exposed to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as a result of entering into\ntransactions denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Due to the uncertain timing of expected payments in\nforeign currencies, we do not utilize any forward exchange contracts. All foreign transactions settle on the applicable\nspot exchange basis at the time such payments are made. For the year ended December 31, 2023, a majority of our\nexpenditures were denominated in U.S. dollars. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign exchange rates during any of the\nperiods presented would not have had a material impact on our financial statements.\nInflation may affect us by increasing our cost of labor, cost of external services, and cost of external goods and raw\nmaterials. We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of\noperations for any period presented herein.\n105\nItem 8.

(the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and\n2022, the related statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years\nthen ended, and the related notes (collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present\nfairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results\nof its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting\nprinciples.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public\nCompany Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the\nCompany in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities\nand Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an\naudit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of\ninternal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,\nwhether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included\nexamining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also\nincluded evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating\nthe overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2019.\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\nMarch 4, 2024\n107\nPassage Bio, Inc.\nBalance Sheets\nDecember 31,\n(in thousands, except share and per share data) 2023 2022\nAssets\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents ........................................... $ 21,709 $ 34,601\nMarketable securities ............................................... 92,585 155,009\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets .............................. 923 926\nPrepaid research and development .................................... 2,742 6,508\nTotal current assets ............................................... 117,959 197,044\nProperty and equipment, net ............................................ 15,295 22,515\nRight of use assets - operating leases ..................................... 16,858 19,723\nOther assets ......................................................... 433 4,267\nTotal assets ...................................................... $ 150,545 $ 243,549\nLiabilities and stockholders’ equity\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable .................................................. $ 1,298 $ 4,065\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities........................... 11,670 11,011\nOperating lease liabilities ............................................ 3,373 3,275\nTotal current liabilities ............................................ 16,341 18,351\nOperating lease liabilities - noncurrent ................................... 22,921 23,832\nTotal liabilities ................................................... 39,262 42,183\nCommitments and contingencies (note 10)\nStockholders’ equity:\nPreferred stock, $0.0001 par value: 10,000,000 shares authorized; no shares\nissued and outstanding at both December 31,2023 and December31,2022 .. — —\nCommon stock, $0.0001 par value: 300,000,000 shares authorized;\n54,944,130 shares issued and outstanding at December 31, 2023 and\n54,614,690 shares issued and outstanding at December31,2022 ........... 5 5\nAdditional paid‑in capital ........................................... 705,789 694,733\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)........................

Nature of Operations\nPassage Bio, Inc., or the Company, a Delaware corporation incorporated in July 2017, is a clinical stage genetic\nmedicines company on a mission to improve the lives of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. The Company’s\nprimary focus is the development and advancement of cutting-edge, one-time therapies designed to target the underlying\npathology of these conditions. The Company has a strategic research collaboration with the Trustees of the University of\nPennsylvania’s, or Penn, Gene Therapy Program, or GTP.\nThrough this collaboration, the Company has developed its lead clinical product candidate, PBFT02, for the treatment of\nfrontotemporal dementia, or FTD, caused by progranulin deficiency, or FTD-GRN, which seeks to elevate progranulin\nlevels to restore lysosomal function and slow disease progression.\n2. Risks and Liquidity\nThe Company has incurred recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and had an\naccumulated deficit of $594.5 million as of December 31, 2023. The Company anticipates incurring additional losses\nuntil such time, if ever, that it can generate significant sales of its product candidates currently in development.\nSubstantial additional capital will be needed by the Company to fund its operations and to develop its product\ncandidates.\nThe Company’s operations have consisted primarily of conducting preclinical studies, developing licensed technology,\nconducting clinical trials, and manufacturing clinical supply to support clinical trials. The Company faces risks\nassociated with early-stage biotechnology companies whose product candidates are in development. Product candidates\ncurrently under development will require significant additional research and development efforts and establishing\nmanufacturing capacity and regulatory approval prior to commercialization. These efforts require significant amounts of\nadditional capital for the Company to complete its research and development, achieve its research and development\nobjectives, defend its intellectual property rights, and recruit and retain skilled personnel, and key members of\nmanagement. Even if the Company’s product development efforts are successful, it is uncertain when, if ever, the\nCompany will realize revenue from product sales.\nThe Company plans to seek additional funding through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, other\ncollaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. The Company may not be able to obtain financing on\nacceptable terms, or at all, and the Company may not be able to enter into strategic alliances or other arrangements on\nfavorable terms, or at all. The terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of the Company’s\nstockholders. If the Company is unable to obtain funding or prospects of funding are unfavorable, the Company could be\nrequired to further delay, reduce or eliminate research and development programs, product portfolio expansion or future\ncommercialization efforts, which could adversely affect its business prospects.\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s\nAbility to Continue as a Going Concern, the Company has evaluated whether there are certain conditions and events,\nconsidered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern\nwithin one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. As of the issuance date of these financial\nstatements, the Company expects that its cash, cash equivalents and marketable debt securities will be sufficient to fund\nits forecasted operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months from the\nissuance date of these financial statements.\n112\nPassage Bio, Inc.\nNotes to Financial Statements (cont.)\n3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles\nin the United States, or GAAP. Any reference in these notes to applicable guidance is meant to refer to GAAP as found\nin the Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, and Accounting Standards Updates promulgated by the Financial\nAccounting Standards Board, or FASB.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and contingent\nliabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Actual\nresults could differ from those estimates.\nEstimates and assumptions are periodically reviewed and the effects of the revisions are reflected in the accompanying\nfinancial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nManagement believes that the carrying amounts of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash equivalents,\nprepaid expenses, and accounts payable, approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of those instruments.\nConcentration of credit risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily\nof cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities. The Company maintains a deposit account in a federally insured\nfinancial institution in excess of federally insured limits. The Company also maintains a money market account in a\nfederally insured financial institution in excess of federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses\nin such accounts and believes it is not exposed to significant risk on its cash and cash equivalents beyond the normal\ncredit risk associated with commercial banking relationships.\nThe Company maintains a portfolio of marketable debt securities, which is diversified to limit exposure related to\ncounterparty risk, industry risk, and security type risk. The Company maintains an investment policy which dictates the\nallocation of funds within its portfolio of marketable debt securities. The Company has not experienced any material\nlosses in such portfolio.\nSegment Information\nOperating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete information is available\nfor evaluation by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources\nand in assessing performance. The Company views its operations and manages its business in one segment.\nCash and cash equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly-liquid investments that have maturities of three months or less when acquired to be\ncash equivalents. Cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023 consisted of money market funds, commercial paper, and\ncorporate debt securities. Cash consists of cash deposits at banking institutions.\n113\nPassage Bio, Inc.\nNotes to Financial Statements (cont.)\nMarketable securities\nThe Company classifies its marketable securities as available-for-sale, which include commercial paper, certificates of\ndeposit, corporate debt securities, United States, or U.S., government debt securities and U.S. government agency\nsecurities with original maturities of greater than three months. These securities are carried at fair market value, with\nunrealized gains and losses reported in comprehensive loss and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within\nstockholders’ equity. Any premium or discount arising at purchase of debt securities is amortized and/or accreted over\nthe term of the security to other income (expense), net. Gains or losses on marketable securities sold are recognized as a\ncomponent of other income (expense), net in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss on the specific\nidentification method. All marketable securities are available for use, as needed, to fund operations and therefore, the\nCompany classifies all marketable securities as current assets within the balance sheet.\nProperty and Equipment, net\nProperty and equipment consists of laboratory equipment, office equipment, computer hardware and software, furniture\nand fixtures, and leasehold improvements and are recorded at cost. Maintenance and repairs that do not improve or\nextend the lives of the respective assets are expensed as incurred. Property and equipment are depreciated on a straight-\nline basis over their estimated useful lives. The Company estimates useful life on an asset by asset basis, which generally\nconsists of three years for computer hardware and software, five years for office equipment, five years for laboratory\nequipment, and seven years for furniture and fixtures. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the\nlease term or the estimated useful life of the asset.\nWhen property is retired or otherwise disposed of, the costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the\nrespective accounts, with any resulting gain or loss recognized concurrently. In the year ended December 31, 2023, the\nCompany recognized losses on disposals of property and equipment of $0.5 million within research and development\nexpenses, compared to none in the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, for impairment when events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, the Company recognized impairment expenses for property and equipment of $3.2 million,\ncompared to none in the year ended December 31, 2022. These impairment expenses represent the proportional\nallocation of total impairments recognized for the asset groups subject to impairment testing in connection with the\nCompany’s sublease agreements, as further described in Note 9.\nLeasing\nThe Company evaluates leases at their inception to determine if they are an operating lease or a finance lease. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, the Company has classified all leases with terms greater than one year, as operating leases.\nThe Company recognizes assets and liabilities for operating leases at their inception, based on the present value of all\npayments due under the lease agreement. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate to determine the present\nvalue of operating leases, which is determined by referencing collateralized borrowing rates for debt instruments with\nterms similar to the respective lease. The Company utilizes the accounting policy election to not separate lease and non-\nlease components and the accounting policy election to not apply the recognition requirement to leases with a term of\ntwelve months or less.\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets, such as right of use assets, for impairment when events or changes indicate the\ncarrying amount of the right of use assets may not be recoverable. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the\nCompany recognized impairment expenses for right of use assets of $2.2 million, compared to none in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. These impairment expenses represent the proportional allocation of total impairments recognized\n114\nPassage Bio, Inc.\nNotes to Financial Statements (cont.)\nfor the asset groups subject to impairment testing in connection with the Company’s sublease agreements, as further\ndescribed in Note 9.\nShare-based compensation\nThe Company measures share-based awards at grant-date fair value and records compensation expense on a straight-line\nbasis over the vesting period of the awards. The Company’s share-based compensation consists of restricted stock units,\nor RSUs, and options to purchase common stock, or stock option awards.\nThe Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value its stock option awards.\nEstimating the fair value of stock option awards requires the input of assumptions, including, the expected term of stock\noptions, and stock price volatility. The assumptions used in estimating the fair value of share-based awards represent\nmanagement's estimate and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. As a result, if\nfactors change and management uses different assumptions, share-based compensation expense could be materially\ndifferent for future awards.\nThe expected term of the stock options is estimated using the “simplified method,” as the Company has limited historical\ninformation from which to develop reasonable expectations about future exercise patterns and post-vesting employment\ntermination behavior for its stock option grants. The simplified method is the midpoint between the vesting period and\nthe contractual term of the option.\nFor stock price volatility, the Company uses a composite of comparable public company data as a basis for its expected\nvolatility to calculate the fair value of option grants. The selection of comparable public company data requires the\napplication of management’s judgement.\nThe Company accounts for forfeitures of RSUs and stock option awards as they occur.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred and consist primarily of expenses incurred with GTP, contract\nresearch organizations, contract manufacturing organizations, internal analytical and testing activities, and employee-\nrelated expenses, including salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation. Management makes estimates of the\nCompany’s external accrued research and development expenses, which primarily relates to contract research\norganizations and contract manufacturing organizations, as of each balance sheet date in the Company’s financial\nstatements based on an estimate of progress to completion of specific tasks using facts and circumstances known to the\nCompany at that time. The Company determines the estimates by reviewing contracts, vendor agreements, change\norders, and through discussions with the Company’s internal clinical personnel and external service providers as to the\nprogress to completion of services and the agreed-upon fee to be paid for such services. If the actual timing of the\nperformance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, the Company will adjust the accrual and related\nexpenses accordingly.\nAcquired In-Process Research and Development\nFees paid to obtain research and development technology licenses are recognized as acquired in-process research and\ndevelopment expense if the research and development technology licensed has not reached technological feasibility and\nhas no alternative future use. For the year ended December 31, 2022, all fees paid to obtain technology licenses were\nrecognized as acquired in-process research and development expense. No fees were paid during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023.\n115\nPassage Bio, Inc.\nNotes to Financial Statements (cont.)\nOther Income (Expense), net\nOther income (expense), net consists of interest earned on the Company’s cash equivalents and marketable securities,\nand amortization of premium and discount on our marketable securities. Additionally, in the year ended December 31,\n2023, the Company recognized other income related to the sale of certain tax credits.\nThe Company recorded $6.3 million to other income (expense), net for the year ended December 31, 2023, which\nconsisted of $5.6 million attributable to interest income and the amortization of premium and discount on the Company’s\nmarketable securities, and $0.7 million related to the sale of certain tax credits.\nThe Company recorded $2.3 million to other income (expense), net for the year ended December 31, 2022, which\nconsisted of $2.3 million attributable to interest income and the amortization of premium and discount on the Company’s\nmarketable securities..\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset-and-liability method as required by FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes\n(ASC 740). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences\nbetween the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and\noperating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates\nexpected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or\nsettled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period\ncorresponding to the enactment date. Under ASC 740, a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not\nall or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized through generating sufficient future taxable income.\nFASB ASC Subtopic 740-10, Accounting for Uncertainty of Income Taxes, (ASC 740-10) defines the criterion an\nindividual tax position must meet for any part of the benefit of the tax position to be recognized in financial statements\nprepared in conformity with GAAP. The Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it\nis more likely than not such tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based solely on the\ntechnical merits of the respective tax position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a tax\nposition should be measured based on the largest benefit having a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon\nultimate settlement with the tax authority. In accordance with the disclosure requirements of ASC 740-10, the\nCompany’s policy on statement of operations classification of interest and penalties related to income tax obligations is\nto include such items as part of total interest income, net, within other income (expense), net.\nNet Loss Per Share\nBasic net loss per share of common stock is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of\ncommon stock outstanding during each period. Diluted loss per share of common stock includes the effect, if any, from\nthe potential exercise or conversion of securities, such as stock options, which would result in the issuance of\nincremental shares of common stock. For diluted net loss per share, the weighted-average number of shares of common\nstock is the same for basic net loss per share due to the fact that when a net loss exists, dilutive securities are not\nincluded in the calculation as the impact is anti-dilutive.\n116\nPassage Bio, Inc.\nNotes to Financial Statements (cont.)\nThe following potentially dilutive securities have been excluded from the computation of diluted weighted-average\nshares of common stock outstanding, as they would be anti-dilutive:\nYear Ended Dec ember 31,\n2023 2022\nStock options ................................................. 9,290,308 11,411,390\nUnvested restricted stock units ................................... 927,000 1,229,166\nEmployee stock purchase plan ................................... 33,520 26,680\n10,250,828 12,667,236\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses\non Financial Instruments, or ASU 2016-13, which replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology under current\nU.S. GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of\nreasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. ASU 2016-13 was subsequently updated by ASU\nNo. 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives\nand Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments, to clarify that entities should include recoveries when estimating\nthe allowance for credit losses. This guidance was effective for the Company starting in fiscal year 2023. The Company\nadopted ASU 2016-13 as of January 1, 2023, which did not have a material impact on its financial statements.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable\nSegment Disclosures, or ASU 2023-07, which expands segment disclosures by requiring disclosure of significant\nsegment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and included within each reported\nmeasure of segment profit or loss, an amount and description of its composition for other segment items, and interim\ndisclosures of a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets. The disclosures required under ASU 2023-07 are also\nrequired for public entities with a single reportable segment. ASU 2023-07 is effective for the Company’s first fiscal\nyear beginning after December 15, 2023 and for interim periods within the Company’s first fiscal year beginning after\nDecember 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2023-07 to have\na material impact on its financial statements or disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax\nDisclosures, or ASU 2023-09, which requires that an entity, on an annual basis, disclose additional income tax\ninformation, primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. The amendments in ASU 2023-09 are\nintended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The amendments in this ASU\nare effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024 with early adoption permitted. The Company is\ncurrently evaluating the impact of this guidance on disclosures.\n117\nPassage Bio, Inc.\nNotes to Financial Statements (cont.)\n4.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Non-Financial Instruments\nFinancial Instruments\nFair value is the price that could be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants. Fair value determination in accordance with applicable accounting guidance requires that a\nnumber of significant judgments be made. Additionally, fair value is used on a nonrecurring basis to evaluate assets for\nimpairment or as required for disclosure purposes by applicable accounting guidance on disclosures about fair value of\nfinancial instruments. Depending on the nature of the assets and liabilities, various valuation techniques and assumptions\nare used when estimating fair value. The carrying amounts of certain of the Company’s financial instruments, including\nprepaid expense and accounts payable are shown at cost, which approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of\nthese instruments. The Company follows the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, for\nfinancial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis. The guidance requires fair value measurements be\nclassified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:\n• Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical,\nunrestricted assets or liabilities.\n• Level 2: Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs which are observable, either directly or\nindirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liabilities.\n• Level 3: Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value\nmeasurement and unobservable (i.e., supported by little or no market activity).\n119\nPassage Bio, Inc.\nNotes to Financial Statements (cont.)\nThe following fair value hierarchy table presents information about the Company’s assets measured at fair value on a\nrecurring basis.

Leases\n2005 Market Street Lease Agreement\nThe Company is party to a lease agreement for office space, or the 2005 Market Street Lease Agreement, in\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania. Under the 2005 Market Street Lease Agreement, the Company leased approximately 37,000\nsquare feet. The 2005 Market Street Lease Agreement commenced in February 2021 and is expected to expire in\nDecember 2031. The Company has an option to extend the term of the 2005 Market Street Lease Agreement by two\nadditional terms of five years each. The Company has an option to early terminate the 2005 Market Street Lease\nAgreement as of April 2029, given notice is provided to the landlord no less than fifteen months prior to April 2029. The\noptional extension and termination terms were not recognized as part of the Company’s measurement of the right of use,\nor ROU, asset and operating lease liability as of December 31, 2023.\nSublease Agreement A\nOn August 7, 2023, the Company entered into a sublease agreement with a counterparty, or Sublessee A, to sublease\napproximately 8,000 square feet of the 2005 Market Street Lease Agreement, or Sublease Agreement A. This sublease\nterm began on November 1, 2023, and continues through March 31, 2029. In the event the Company does not elect its\nearly termination option under the 2005 Market Street Lease Agreement, Sublessee A has an option to extend the\nsublease agreement through November 30, 2031. The base sublease rent is $12,426 per month and increases by 2.75%\nannually through the expiration of the agreement. Additionally, Sublessee A is required to pay the portion of the\ncommon area maintenance expenses, operating expenses and use and occupancy taxes which the Company is required to\npay under the 2005 Market Street Lease Agreement.\nPursuant to ASC 842, the Company concluded the sublease is a separate lease, as the Company was not relieved of the\nprimary obligation under the 2005 Market Street Lease Agreement. The Company continues to account for the 2005\nMarket Street Lease Agreement as a lessee and in the same manner as prior to the execution of Sublease Agreement A.\nThe Company accounted for Sublease Agreement A as the lessor, and concluded the lease qualified as an operating\nlease, as it did not meet the criteria of a sales-type or direct financing lease.\nAs a result of Sublease Agreement A, the Company determined an impairment indicator was present. The Company\ncompared the estimated undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of the asset group, which includes right of use\nassets, leasehold improvements, and other property and equipment allocable to Sublease Agreement A. The Company\nconcluded the carrying value of the asset group was not recoverable as it exceeded the estimated undiscounted cash\nflows. The Company calculated the amount of impairment using a discounted cash flow model to calculate the fair value\nof the asset group which incorporated the net identifiable cash flows for the term of Sublease Agreement A, including an\nestimate for cash flows in the residual period, and an estimated borrowing rate of a market participant subtenant.\n122\nPassage Bio, Inc.\nNotes to Financial Statements (cont.)\nSublease Agreement B\nOn September 29, 2023, the Company entered into a sublease agreement with a counterparty, or Sublessee B, to sublease\napproximately 29,000 square feet of the 2005 Market Street Lease Agreement, or Sublease Agreement B. This sublease\nterm began on March 1, 2024, and continues through August 2026. Sublessee B has an option to extend the term of the\nsublease agreement through March 31, 2029. The base sublease rent is $75,000 per month for the entire term of the\nsublease. Additionally, Sublessee B is required to pay applicable use and occupancy taxes but is not obligated to make\npayments for operating expenses and common area maintenance expenses which the Company is required to pay under\nthe 2005 Market Street Lease Agreement.\nPursuant to ASC 842, the Company concluded the sublease is a separate lease, as the Company was not relieved of the\nprimary obligation under the 2005 Market Street Lease Agreement. The Company continues to account for the 2005\nMarket Street Lease Agreement as a lessee and in the same manner as prior to the execution of the Sublease Agreement\nB. The Company accounted for Sublease Agreement B as the lessor, and concluded the lease qualified as an operating\nlease, as it did not meet the criteria of a sales-type or direct financing lease.\nAs a result of Sublease Agreement B, the Company determined an impairment indicator was present. The Company\ncompared the estimated undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of the asset group, which includes right of use\nassets, leasehold improvements, and other property and equipment allocable to Sublease Agreement B. The Company\nconcluded the carrying value of the asset group was not recoverable as it exceeded the estimated undiscounted cash\nflows. The Company calculated the amount of impairment using a discounted cash flow model to calculate the fair value\nof the asset group which incorporated the net identifiable cash flows for the term of Sublease Agreement B, including an\nestimate for cash flows in the residual period, and an estimated borrowing rate of a market participant subtenant.\nBased on the analyses for Sublease Agreement A and Sublease Agreement B, the Company recognized impairment\nexpense of $5.4 million, including $2.2 million for the right of use assets and $3.2 million for the property and\nequipment during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nLaboratory Lease Agreement\nThe Company is also party to a lease agreement for laboratory space, or the Laboratory Lease Agreement, in Hopewell,\nNew Jersey. The laboratory is focused on state-of-the-art analytical capabilities, assay development and validation, and\nclinical product testing to support both viral vector manufacturing and clinical development. The Laboratory Lease\nAgreement commenced in March 2021 and is expected to expire in March 2036. The Company has an option to extend\nthe term of the Laboratory Lease Agreement by up to two five-year terms.

Commitments and Contingencies\nAmended and Restated Research, Collaboration and License Arrangement with Penn\nThe Company has a research, collaboration and licensing agreement with Penn, as amended, or the Penn Agreement, for\nresearch and development collaborations and exclusive license rights to patents for certain products and technologies.\nUnder the Penn Agreement, the Company has the option to obtain exclusive licenses to, and to fund, certain research\nrelating to the preclinical development of selected products in research programs in rare monogenic central nervous\nsystem, or CNS indications. The Company has eight remaining options available to commence additional licensed\nprograms for CNS indications until August 3, 2026.\nThe Penn Agreement includes an exploratory research program to identify targets and early product candidates in certain\nagreed upon non-monogenic, non-rare, or large, CNS indications. The initial term of the exploratory research program is\nthree years, or until August 2024, which term can be extended by mutual agreement. During such term, we will have an\nexclusive right of first negotiation to include additional targets to the exploratory research program in the agreed upon\nlarge CNS indications. Under the exploratory research program, the Company will have the right to further develop and\ncommercialize any gene therapy product candidates specific for those selected targets that arise from the exploratory\nresearch programs by exercising one of its remaining eight options. The Company currently does not have any active\nexploratory research programs.\nIf the Company were to exercise any of the remaining options, it would owe Penn a non-refundable aggregate fee of $1.0\nmillion per product indication, with $0.5 million due upfront and another $0.5 million fee owed upon a further\ndevelopmental milestone.\nThe Company also funds discovery research conducted by Penn through August 3, 2026 and will receive exclusive\nrights, subject to certain limitations, to platform technologies resulting from the discovery research for the Company’s\nproducts developed with GTP, such as novel capsids, toxicity reduction technologies and delivery and formulation\nimprovements. This funding commitment for the discovery research is $5.0 million annually, paid in quarterly\nincrements of $1.3 million through June 2026.\nThe Penn Agreement requires that the Company make payments of up to (i) $16.5 million per product candidate for rare,\nmonogenic disorders in the aggregate and (ii) $39.0 million per product candidate in the aggregate arising from the\nexploratory program for large CNS indications. Each payment will be due upon the achievement of specific development\nmilestone events by such licensed product for a first indication, reduced development milestone payments for the second\nand third indications and no development milestone payments for subsequent indications. In addition, on a product-by-\nproduct basis, the Company is obligated to make up to $55.0 million in sales milestone payments on each licensed\nproduct based on annual sales of the licensed product in excess of defined thresholds.\nUpon successful commercialization of a product using the licensed technology, the Company is obligated to pay to Penn,\non a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis, tiered royalties (subject to customary\nreductions) in the mid-single digits on annual worldwide net sales of such licensed product. In addition, the Company is\nobligated to pay to Penn a percentage of sublicensing income, ranging from the mid-single digits to low double digits,\nfor sublicenses under the Penn Agreement. The agreement will expire on a licensed product-by-licensed product and\ncountry-by-country basis upon the later of (i) the expiration of the last valid claim of the licensed patent rights that\ncovers the exploitation of such licensed product in such country, and (ii) the expiration of the royalty period. In addition,\nthe Company will pay a tiered transaction fee of 1-2% of the net proceeds upon certain change of control events.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company did not make any payments for acquired in-process research\nand development. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company made payments under the Penn Agreement\nfor acquired in-process research and development of $3.0 million related to the achievement of a development milestone.\n125\nPassage Bio, Inc.\nNotes to Financial Statements (cont.)\nCatalent Agreements\nIn June 2019, the Company entered into a collaboration agreement, or the Collaboration Agreement, with Catalent\nMaryland, a unit of Catalent, Inc., or Catalent. As part of the Collaboration Agreement, the Company was required to\npay an annual fee for five years ending in 2025 for the exclusive use of a dedicated clean room suite, or the Clean Room\nSuite.\nIn April 2020, the Company entered into a development services and clinical supply agreement, or the Manufacturing\nand Supply Agreement, with Catalent to secure clinical scale manufacturing capacity for batches of active\npharmaceutical ingredients for the Company’s gene therapy product candidates. Under the terms of the Manufacturing\nand Supply Agreement, Catalent agreed to manufacture batches of drug product for the Company’s gene therapy product\ncandidates at the Clean Room Suite at a Catalent facility provided for in the Collaboration Agreement. The\nManufacturing and Supply Agreement provided for a term of five years. The Manufacturing and Supply Agreement also\nincluded minimum annual purchase commitments.\nUnder both the Collaboration Agreement and the Manufacturing and Supply Agreement, the Company had an annual\nminimum commitment of $10.6 million per year owed to Catalent for five years from the validation of the Clean Room\nSuite, subject to certain inflationary adjustments.\nOn March 31, 2023, the Company entered into certain letter agreements, the Letter Agreements, amending each of (i) the\nCollaboration Agreement and (ii) the Manufacturing and Supply Agreement, together with the Collaboration Agreement,\nthe Original Catalent Agreements. On November 9, 2023, to supersede and implement the terms of the Letter\nAgreements, the Company entered into an amended and restated collaboration agreement and an amended and restated\nmanufacturing and supply agreement, together the Amended Catalent Agreements.\nThe Amended Catalent Agreements eliminate the minimum annual purchase obligation and the obligation to pay an\nannual fee for use of the Clean Room Suite, thereby eliminating the annual minimum commitment of $10.6 million per\nyear owed to Catalent through November 2025 under the Original Catalent Agreements. In consideration of this, the\nCompany has an obligation to make aggregate payments to Catalent of $6.0 million between June 30, 2023 and May 1,\n2024.\nThe Amended Catalent Agreements extend the term of the Original Catalent Agreements until November 6, 2030, and\nestablish a limited exclusive relationship between the Company and Catalent for the manufacture of bulk drug substance\nand drug product for the Company’s adeno-associated virus delivery therapeutic product candidates for the treatment of\nFTD and GM1. The limited exclusive relationship under the Amended Catalent Agreements converts to a non-exclusive\nrelationship (i) in the event Catalent fails to meet certain performance standards and (ii) following certain conditional\nevents related to the divestiture by the Company of either FTD or GM1, in which case, if such events occur, the\nCompany would pay Catalent certain fees. In addition, in the event of certain transactions, the Company may terminate\nthe Amended Catalent Agreements for convenience with respect to such products, in which case, the Company would\npay to Catalent a certain termination fee.\nImmediately prior to the execution of the Letter Agreements, the Company had a $5.3 million prepaid asset related to\nupfront payments made to secure the Clean Room Suite. In connection with the Letter Agreements, the Company no\nlonger has exclusive access to the Clean Room Suite at Catalent and, as a result, the Company recognized an expense of\n$5.3 million related to the elimination of the prepaid asset during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe Company classified the $11.3 million of expenses, which comprises of $6.0 million in aggregate payments due to\nCatalent and the $5.3 million elimination of the prepaid asset, as general and administrative expense within the statement\nof operations for the year ended December 31, 2023, as both amounts do not directly relate to the future advancement of\nthe Company’s research and development programs.\n126\nPassage Bio, Inc.\nNotes to Financial Statements (cont.)\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company made payments of $4.0 million under the Amended Catalent Agreements. The\nremaining $2.0 million of aggregate payments due to Catalent under the Amended Catalent Agreements are included in\naccrued expenses and other current liabilities.\nLitigation\nIn the normal course of business, the Company from time to time is named as a party to legal claims and actions. The\nCompany records a loss contingency reserve for a legal proceeding when the potential loss is considered probable and\ncan be reasonably estimated. The Company has not recorded any amounts for loss contingencies as of December 31,\n2023.\nThe Company is currently a defendant in litigation with a former employee in the Court of Common Pleas of\nPhiladelphia County (Commerce Division), or the Court, relating to a claim of breach of contract and violation of the\nPennsylvania Wage Payment and Collection Law. The plaintiff claims that, pursuant to an alleged settlement agreement\nreached on February 3, 2020, the Company agreed to issue plaintiff 150,000 shares of its common stock and that such\nshares would not be subject to the reverse stock split implemented by the Company in connection with its initial public\noffering on February 14, 2020. The plaintiff’s claim is for an amount in the mid-single digit millions of dollars. The\nCompany disagrees with the allegations that there was ever a binding settlement agreement or that any shares would not\nbe subject to the reverse stock split, and the Company believes the plaintiff’s claim is without merit. In October 2023,\nthe Court denied both the Company’s and the plaintiff’s motions for summary judgement and therefore the Company\nanticipates that this matter will go to trial in 2024. The Company intends to vigorously defend against these claims, and\nbelieves it has strong arguments to prevail in the litigation. There can be no assurance that the Company will prevail on\nits claims.\nEmployment Agreements\nThe Company has entered into employment agreements with certain key personnel providing for up to 18 months of\nsalary continuation, up to 150% of target annual bonus amounts, and acceleration of vesting in stock-based\ncompensation awards in certain circumstances.\n11. Common Stock\nOn March 5, 2021, the Company entered into a Sales Agreement, or the Sales Agreement, with Cowen and\nCompany, LLC, or Cowen, pursuant to which the Company may, but is not obligated to, offer and sell, from time to\ntime, shares of the Company’s common stock with an aggregate offering price up to $125.0 million through Cowen, as\nsales agent. No sales of common stock have been made pursuant to this Sales Agreement to date.\n12. Share-Based Compensation\nEquity Incentive Plan\nThe Company has three equity incentive plans: the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended, or the 2018 Plan, the 2020\nEquity Incentive Plan, or the Incentive Plan, and the 2021 Equity Inducement Plan, or the Inducement Plan. New awards\ncan only be granted under the Incentive Plan and the Inducement Plan.\nThe total number of shares authorized under the Incentive Plan as of December 31, 2023 was 13,101,661. Additionally,\n3,635,337 shares previously issued under the 2018 Plan which were forfeited are available for issuance under the\nIncentive Plan. As of December 31, 2023, 8,666,526 shares were available for future grants under the Incentive Plan.\nThe number of shares of the Company’s common stock that may be issued pursuant to rights granted under the Incentive\nPlan shall automatically increase on January 1st of each year, commencing on January 1, 2021 and continuing for\nten years, in an amount equal to five percent of the total number of shares of the Company’s common stock outstanding\n127\nPassage Bio, Inc.\nNotes to Financial Statements (cont.)\non December 31st of the preceding calendar year, subject to the discretion of the board of directors to determine a lesser\nnumber of shares shall be added for such year. As a result, the number of shares reserved for issuance under the\nIncentive Plan increased by 2,747,206 and 2,730,735 shares in January 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe Incentive Plan provides for the granting of common stock, incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options,\nrestricted stock awards, and/or stock appreciation rights to employees, directors, and other persons, as determined by the\nCompany’s board of directors. The Company’s stock options awarded to date under the Incentive Plan vest based on a\nrequisite service period, generally over four-year periods, and have a term of ten years.\nThe Inducement Plan was approved by the Company’s board of directors in July 2021. The total number of shares\nauthorized under the Inducement Plan as of December 31, 2023 was 2,500,000, as a result of an increase to the shares\nauthorized for issuance in February 2023. Of this amount, 1,110,300 shares were available for future grants as of\nDecember 31, 2023. The Inducement Plan provides for the granting of nonqualified stock options and restricted stock\nawards to employees hired by the Company, as determined by the Company’s board of directors. The Company’s stock\noptions awarded to date under the Inducement Plan vest based on requisite service period and have a term of ten years.\nThe Company’s restricted stock units awarded to date under the Inducement Plan vest based on requisite service period\nand have a term based on each award agreement.\nThe Company measures share-based awards at their grant-date fair value and records compensation expense on a\nstraight-line basis over the vesting period of the awards. The Company recorded share-based compensation expense in\nthe following expense categories in its accompanying statements of operations for the period presented:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in thousands) 2023 2022\nResearch and development ............ $ 5,554 $ 8,278\nGeneral and administrative ............ 5,367 10,676\n$ 10,921 $ 18,954\nThe following table summarizes stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2023:\nWeighted\nWeighted average\naverage remaining\nNumber of exercise price contractual\nshares per share term (years)\nOutstanding at January 1, 2023 ........................ 11,411,390 $ 9.01 7.1\nGranted ......................................... 3,409,382 1.06\nExercised ........................................ — —\nForfeitures .......................................

Any unvested shares are forfeited upon termination of services. The fair value price of the RSUs is equal to the\nfair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. Compensation expense is recognized on a\nstraight-line basis over the vesting period of the RSUs.\nThe following table summarizes activity related to RSU awards during the year ended December 31, 2023:\nWeighted average\nNumber of shares grant date fair value\nUnvested balance at January 1, 2022 .................... 1,229,166 $ 2.98\nGranted ............................................ 195,000 1.01\nVested .............................................

The ESPP\nauthorizes the issuance of up to 1,981,766 shares of the Company’s common stock. Of this amount, 1,478,155 were\navailable for future grants as of December 31, 2023. The number of shares of the Company’s common stock that may be\nissued pursuant to rights granted under the ESPP shall automatically increase on January 1st of each year and continuing\nfor ten years, in an amount equal to one percent of the total number of shares of the Company’s common stock\noutstanding on December 31st of the preceding calendar year, subject to the discretion of the board of directors to\ndetermine a lesser number of shares shall be added for such year. As a result, on January 1, 2024, subject to the\ndiscretion of the board of directors, the shares authorized for issuance under the ESPP was not increased.\nUnder the ESPP, eligible employees can purchase the Company’s common stock through accumulated payroll\ndeductions at such times as are established by the Compensation Committee. Eligible employees may purchase the\nCompany’s common stock at 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the first day\nof the offering period or on the last day of the offering period. The offering periods under the ESPP have a duration of\nsix months, with periods ending in May and November of each calendar year. Eligible employees may contribute up to\n15% of their eligible compensation. Under the ESPP, a participant may not accrue rights to purchase more than $25,000\nworth of the Company’s common stock for each calendar year in which such right is outstanding or purchase more than\n4,000 shares of the Company’s common stock in any single offering period.\n129\nPassage Bio, Inc.\nNotes to Financial Statements (cont.)\nIn accordance with the guidance in ASC 718-50, Compensation – Stock Compensation, the ability to purchase shares of\nthe Company’s common stock at 85% of the lower of the price on the first day of the offering period or the last day of\nthe offering period (i.e. the purchase date) represents an option and, therefore, the ESPP is a compensatory plan under\nthis guidance. Accordingly, share-based compensation expense is determined based on the option’s grant-date fair value\nas estimated by applying the Black Scholes option-pricing model and is recognized over the withholding period.\n13.

Based upon the historical and anticipated future losses, management\nhas determined that the deferred tax assets do not meet the more-likely-than-not threshold for realizability. Accordingly,\na full valuation allowance has been recorded against the Company’s net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2023 and\n2022. The valuation allowance increased by $20.9 million and $44.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2023\nand 2022, respectively.\nA reconciliation of the federal income tax rate to the Company’s effective tax rate is as follows:\nYea r en ded\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nFederal tax benefit at statutory rate ........................... 21.0% 21.0%\nState tax, net of federal benefit ............................... 5.2 7.5\nChange in state tax rates ....................................

The remaining federal NOL\ncarryforwards were generated subsequent to January 1, 2018, and therefore, are able to be carried forward indefinitely.\nFor state income tax purposes, NOL carryforwards begin expiring in 2037, and expire through 2043.\nFor local income tax purposes related to the city of Philadelphia, NOL carryforwards begin expiring in 2024, and expire\nthrough 2043. NOL carryforwards generated prior to 2022 expire after three years, whereas NOL carryforwards\ngenerated in 2022 and after expire after 20 years.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company also had $10.9 million of federal research and development and $34.5 million\norphan drug tax credit carryforwards that will begin to expire in 2038 and 2040, respectively, unless previously utilized.\nThe NOL and tax credit carryforwards are subject to review and possible adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service\nand state tax authorities. NOL and tax credit carryforwards may become subject to an annual limitation in the event of\ncertain cumulative changes in the ownership interest of significant stockholders over a three-year period in excess of\n50 percent, as defined under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, respectively, as well as similar state\nprovisions. This could limit the amount of tax attributes that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income or\ntax liabilities. The amount of the annual limitation is determined based on the value of the Company immediately prior\nto the ownership change. Subsequent ownership changes may further affect the limitation in future years. The Company\nhas not done an analysis to determine whether or not ownership changes have occurred since inception. Certain state\nNOL carryforwards may also be limited, including Pennsylvania, which limits NOL utilization as a percentage of\napportioned taxable income.\nThe Company will recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of interest income,\nnet. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions and no\namounts have been recognized in the Company’s statement of operations. Tax years from 2020 and after remain subject\nto examination by the taxing jurisdictions. The NOL and tax credit carryforwards remain subject to review until utilized.\n14.

Controls and Procedures\nConclusions Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision of and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer, who is our\nprincipal executive officer, and our interim chief financial officer, who is our principal financial officer, we conducted\nan evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2023, the end of the\nperiod covered by this Annual Report. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as set forth in Rules 13a-15(e) and\n15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, means controls and other\nprocedures of a company that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by\na company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and\nreported, within the time periods specified in the rules and forms promulgated by the SEC. Disclosure controls and\nprocedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be\ndisclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated\nto the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow\ntimely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how\nwell designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management\nnecessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on\nthe evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2023, our chief executive officer and\ninterim chief financial officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at\nthe reasonable assurance level.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.\nInternal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange\nAct as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our chief executive officer and interim chief financial\nofficer and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in\naccordance with U.S. GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n• pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and\ndispositions of our assets;\n• provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and\n• provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or\ndisposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.\nTherefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial\nstatement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the\nrisk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the\npolicies or procedures may deteriorate. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management\nnecessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls\nand procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions\nabout the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated\ngoals under all potential future conditions.\n132\nOur management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and interim chief financial officer, assessed the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making this assessment,\nmanagement used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission\n(COSO) in its Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessment, our management has\nconcluded that, as of December 31, 2023, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting\nfirm regarding internal control over financial reporting. For as long as we remain an “emerging growth company” as\ndefined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business\nStartups Act of 2012, we intend to take advantage of the exemption permitting us not to comply with the requirement\nthat our independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation on the effectiveness of our internal control\nover financial reporting.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation\nrequired by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the three months ended\nDecember 31, 2023, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over\nfinancial reporting.\nItem 9B.
