An inverted yield curve, as the one experienced throughout 2023, resulting\nfrom the Fed moving short-term rates up to the mid 5’s is unusual and largely unkind to\nthe banking industry’s net interest margins. The shape of the curve in 2023 combined\nwith The First National Bank of Long Island’s liability-sensitive Balance Sheet resulted in\na 74-basis point drop in our net interest margin to 2.16% in 2023 from 2.89% in 2022.\nNet income and fully diluted earnings per share for 2023 totaled $26.2 million and $1.16, respectively. The\nCompany’s return on average assets (ROA) was 0.62% and its return on average equity (ROE) was 7.14%. Owing\nprimarily to the aforementioned margin compression, the metrics for 2023 did not match up to the record\n2 First of Long Island Corporation 2023 Annual Report 3\ndispensible letter.

BUSINESS\nGeneral\nThe First of Long Island Corporation (“Registrant”), a one-bank holding company, was incorporated on February 7, 1984 for\nthe purpose of providing financial services through its wholly-owned subsidiary, The First National Bank of Long Island.\nThe consolidated entity is referred to as the \"Corporation,\" and the Bank and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to as\nthe \"Bank.\"\nThe Bank was organized in 1927 as a national banking association under the laws of the United States of America. The Bank\nhas one wholly-owned subsidiary: FNY Service Corp., an investment company. The Bank and FNY Service Corp. jointly\nown another subsidiary, The First of Long Island REIT, Inc., a real estate investment trust.\nAll the financial operations of the Corporation are aggregated in one reportable operating segment. All revenues are attributed\nto and all long-lived assets are located in the United States.\nThe Bank’s revenues are derived principally from interest on loans and investment securities, service charges and fees on\ndeposit accounts and bank-owned life insurance (“BOLI”).\nThe Bank did not commence, abandon or significantly change any of its lines of business during 2023.\nMarkets Served and Products Offered\nThe Bank serves the financial needs of small to middle market businesses, professional service firms, not-for-profits,\nmunicipalities and consumers primarily in Nassau and Suffolk Counties of Long Island, and the boroughs of New York City\n(“NYC”). The Bank has 40 branch locations including 16 branches in Nassau, 16 in Suffolk, five in Queens, two in Brooklyn\nand one in Manhattan. During 2023, the Bank closed one branch in Nassau and relocated two of its branches in Suffolk,\noffering an improved customer experience and modern design. The Bank continues to evaluate the strategic placement of its\nbranch network and invests in digital channels to best serve customer demand both within and beyond its physical locations.\nThe Bank’s loan portfolio is primarily comprised of loans to borrowers on Long Island and in the boroughs of NYC, and its\nreal estate loans are principally secured by properties located in those areas. The Bank’s investment securities portfolio is\ncomprised of direct obligations of the U.S. government and its agencies, obligations of the Small Business Administration\n(\"SBA\"), corporate bonds of large U.S. financial institutions and highly rated obligations of states and political subdivisions.\nThe Bank offers trust, estate, custody and investment services through a partnership with Financial Resources Group, an\naffiliate of LPL Financial (\"LPL\"). The Bank offers residential mortgage loans through a co-marketing referral agreement\nwith Rocket Mortgage®.\nIn addition to its loan, investment and deposit products, the Bank offers a wide array of banking services to its customers\nthrough its branch network, mobile applications and interactive website.\nCompetition\nThe Bank encounters substantial competition in its banking business from numerous other financial services organizations\nthat have offices located in the communities served by the Bank. Principal competitors are large money center, regional and\ncommunity banks located within the Bank’s market area, mortgage brokers, brokerage firms, credit unions and fintech or e-\ncommerce companies. The Bank competes for loans and deposits by offering a high level of customer service, flexible product\nstructures, competitive pricing, convenient locations and maintaining a well-designed website. Cash management tools and\ndigital channels support our loan and deposit offerings.\nInvestment Activities\nThe Bank’s investment policy, as approved by the Asset Liability Committee of the Board (“ALCO”) and supervised by both\nthe ALCO and the Management Asset Liability Committee, is intended to promote investment practices which are both safe\nand sound and in full compliance with applicable regulations. Investment authority is granted and amended as necessary by\nthe Board of Directors or ALCO.\n1\nThe Bank's investment decisions seek to optimize income while keeping both credit and interest rate risk at acceptable levels,\nprovide for the Bank's liquidity needs and provide securities that can be pledged, as needed, to secure deposits and borrowings.\nThe Bank’s investment policy generally limits individual maturities on municipal bonds to 20 years and estimated average\nlives on collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMOs”) and other mortgage-backed securities to ten years. At the time of\npurchase, bonds of states and political subdivisions must generally be rated AA or better, notes of states and political\nsubdivisions must generally be rated MIG-1 (or equivalent), commercial paper must be rated A-1 or P-1, and corporate bonds\nof large U.S. based financial institutions must have a rating of BBB+ or better. In addition, management periodically reviews\nthe creditworthiness of all securities in the Bank’s portfolio other than those issued by the U.S. government or its agencies.\nAny significant deterioration in the creditworthiness of an issuer is analyzed and action is taken if deemed appropriate.\nAt year end 2023 and 2022, there were no holdings of securities of any one issuer, other than the U.S. government and its\nagencies, in an amount greater than 10% of stockholders’ equity.\nThe Bank’s investment portfolio at December 31, 2023 was comprised of available-for-sale (“AFS”) securities\ntotaling $695.9 million and was made up of state and municipal securities of $143.6 million, pass-through mortgage securities\nof $138.6 million, CMOs of $182.3 million, SBA agency obligations of $125.5 million and corporate bonds of $105.9\nmillion. Substantially all the municipal securities are rated AA or better. The pass-through mortgage securities and CMOs\nare issued by Government National Mortgage Association (“GNMA”), Federal National Mortgage Association (“FNMA”)\nand Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“FHLMC”). GNMA is a U.S. government agency and FNMA and FHLMC\nare U.S. government-sponsored agencies. SBA agency obligations are floating rate, government guaranteed securities backed\nby $92.2 million of commercial mortgages and $33.3 million of equipment finance loans at December 31, 2023. The\ncorporate bonds are investment grade securities issued by large U.S. based financial institutions with variable rates that reset\nquarterly based on the ten-year swap rate.\nThe Bank has not engaged in the purchase and sale of securities for the primary purpose of producing trading profits and its\ncurrent investment policy does not allow for such activity.\nLending Activities\nGeneral. The Bank’s lending is subject to written underwriting standards and loan origination procedures, as approved\nby the Loan Committee of the Board (“Loan Committee”) and contained in the Bank’s loan policy. The loan policy allows\nfor exceptions and sets forth specific exception approval requirements. Decisions on loan applications are based on the\nborrower’s credit history, the financial strength of the borrower, estimates of the borrower’s ability to repay the loan and the\nvalue of the collateral and guarantees, if any. All real estate appraisals must meet the requirements of the Financial Institutions\nReform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010\n(“Dodd-Frank Act”), banking agency guidance and, for those loans in excess of $250,000, be reviewed by the Bank’s\nindependent appraisal review function.\nThe Bank’s loan portfolio is primarily comprised of loans to small and middle market businesses, professional service firms,\nreal estate investors and consumers on Long Island and in the boroughs of NYC. The Bank’s range of lending services\nincludes commercial mortgage loans, commercial and industrial loans, SBA loans, construction and land development loans,\nconsumer loans and standby letters of credit. During 2023, the Bank discontinued the origination of residential mortgages.\nCommercial lending is emphasized and supported by increases in credit and lending staff.\nThe Bank makes both fixed and variable rate loans. Variable rate loans reprice primarily with changes in the prime interest\nrate as published in The Wall Street Journal, U.S. Treasury rates and the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”).\nCommercial and Industrial Loans. Commercial and industrial loans include short-term business loans and lines of\ncredit; revolving credit facilities, term and installment loans; common interest realty association (“CIRA”) loans, asset-based\nloans, leveraged loans and small business loans as described hereinafter. Commercial and industrial loans may be secured by\ngeneral business assets, specific equipment, cash and other liquid collateral, or real estate. The Bank makes commercial and\nindustrial loans on a demand basis, short-term basis, installment or revolving basis. Short-term business loans are generally\ndue and payable within one year and should be self-liquidating during the normal course of the borrower’s business cycle.\nLines of credit are reaffirmed annually and generally require an annual cleanup period. Revolving credit facilities, term and\ninstallment loans are usually due and payable within five years. The Bank’s loan policy delineates the minimum required\nguarantee based on specific loan categories.\n2\nCommercial Mortgage Loans. The Bank makes commercial mortgage loans secured by owner-occupied and investment\nproperties, including multifamily properties. Applicants will be considered for approval provided they, as well as any\nguarantors, have satisfactory credit history and can demonstrate the ability to repay through documentation such as financial\nstatements, leases and rent rolls. The Bank obtains independent appraisals in accordance with regulatory requirements and an\nappropriate environmental assessment. All properties are inspected by Bank personnel and/or approved third-party vendors\nbefore closing on the mortgage and annually thereafter for loans over $2.5 million. Properties may also be re-inspected if\nconcerns arise during the Bank’s annual review process described below. Commercial mortgage loans generally mature in\n10 years with amortization schedules ranging between 20 and 30 years. We strive to reprice commercial mortgage loans every\nfive years although pricing may be fixed for longer terms. The Bank will generally not lend more than 75% of appraised\nvalue for investment properties, including multifamily properties.\nConstruction Loans. From time to time, the Bank makes loans to finance the construction of both residential and\ncommercial properties. The maturity of such loans is generally 24 months or less and advances are made as the construction\nprogresses. The advances can require the submission of bills and lien waivers by the contractor, verification by a Bank-\napproved inspector that the work has been performed, and title insurance updates to ensure that no intervening liens have\nbeen placed. The Bank also will consider loans on unimproved land subject to a maximum loan-to-value of 50% and a\nmaximum 10 year term and amortization. Variable rate construction and land development loans are included in commercial\nmortgages on the consolidated balance sheets.\nConsumer Loans and Lines. The Bank makes secured and unsecured consumer loans, establishes revolving overdraft\nlines of credit and issues VISA® credit cards. Consumer loans are generally made on an installment basis over terms not in\nexcess of five years. In reviewing loans and lines for approval, the Bank generally considers the borrower’s ability to repay,\nstability of employment and residence and past credit history.\nSources of Funds\nThe Bank’s primary sources of cash are deposits, maturities and amortization of loans and investment securities, operations\nand borrowings. The Bank uses cash from these and other sources to fund loan growth, purchase investment securities, repay\ndeposits and borrowings, expand and improve its physical facilities and pay cash dividends to the Corporation. The\nCorporation uses dividends from the Bank to pay stockholder dividends, repurchase its common stock and for general\ncorporate purposes.\nThe Bank offers checking and interest-bearing deposit products. The Bank has a variety of business and personal checking\nproducts that differ in minimum balance requirements and fees, if any. Interest-bearing deposit products, which have a wide\nrange of interest rates and terms, consist of negotiable order of withdrawal (“NOW”) accounts, interest on lawyer accounts,\nescrow service accounts, rent security accounts, personal and nonpersonal money market and savings accounts, time deposits\nand individual retirement accounts.\nThe Bank relies primarily on its branch network, customer service, calling programs, lending relationships, referral sources,\ncompetitive pricing and advertising to attract and retain local deposits. The flow of deposits is influenced by general economic\nconditions, changes in interest rates and competition.\nHuman Capital Resources\nWe aspire to provide all employees equal opportunity to realize their maximum potential with the Bank. We are a diverse\nworkplace that encourages open and honest employee comment without retaliation. We seek to attract, recruit and retain a\nworkforce which is reflective of the communities in which we live and work. By encouraging different viewpoints, styles,\nexperiences, cultures, ethnicities, sexual orientations and gender identities, we build a more flexible, creative and competitive\ncorporate culture while remaining socially accountable to our local communities. Using employee feedback, we implemented\ninitiatives to improve communication and enhance employee development opportunities.\nEmployee Profile. At December 31, 2023, we had approximately 288 full time equivalent employees in locations across\nthe New York (\"NY\") metropolitan area. This represents a decrease of 15 employees, or 5.0%, from December 31, 2022 due\nto factors such as reducing branch hours, improving technology and eliminating our residential mortgage sales department.\nTotal Rewards. As part of our compensation philosophy, we believe that we must offer and maintain market competitive\ntotal rewards programs for our employees in order to attract and retain superior talent. In addition to base wages, additional\nprograms include annual equity and/or cash incentive opportunities, a Company matched 401(k) plan, a defined benefit\npension plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings accounts, transit benefits, flexible spending accounts, paid\ntime off, family leave and employee assistance programs.\n3\nHealth and Safety. The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people. Accordingly,\nwe are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our employees. We provide our employees and their families with\naccess to a variety of flexible and convenient health and welfare programs, including benefits that support their physical and\nmental health. We provide tools and resources to help them and their families experience healthier living.\nTraining and Development. We are committed to the ongoing success and development of our employees at every level\nto promote and foster individual and organizational effectiveness. Employees take part in recurring training that covers\nregulatory compliance, cybersecurity, sales and retail strategies and other programs tailored to specific job functions.\nAdditional professional development and leadership training is offered for growth opportunities.\nTalent. A core tenet of maintaining our highly skilled workforce is to foster career opportunities for existing staff while\nactively recruiting seasoned bankers for certain roles. Hiring entry level staff is also important as we prepare for our future.\nThese approaches create loyalty in our employee base while also bringing in new perspectives and ideas to help us grow the\nbusiness, expand our product lines and benefit our customers. We believe a favorable reputation in the marketplace and our\ncorporate headquarters centrally located in Melville on Long Island allows us to attract highly skilled workers. We use internal\nand external resources to identify the best job candidates while encouraging employee referrals for open positions.\nOur performance management framework includes annual reviews, a review of goals achieved and a discussion of future\ngoals and employee development, including training opportunities, and annual merit-based salary adjustments.\nEmployee retention helps us operate efficiently and achieve one of our business objectives, which is being a high-quality,\nefficient provider of financial services. We believe our commitment to core values, prioritizing concern for our employees’\nwell-being, supporting our employees’ career goals, offering competitive wages and providing valuable benefits aids in the\nretention of our employees.\nSupervision and Regulation\nGeneral. The banking industry is highly regulated. Statutory and regulatory controls are designed primarily for the\nprotection of depositors and the banking system, and not for the purpose of protecting shareholders. The following discussion\nis not intended to be a complete list of all the activities regulated by banking laws or of the impact of such laws and regulations\non the Corporation and the Bank. Changes in applicable laws or regulations and their interpretation and application by\nregulatory agencies cannot be predicted and may have a material effect on our business and results of operations.\nAs a registered bank holding company, the Corporation is regulated under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as\namended (“BHC Act”), and subject to inspection, examination and supervision by the Federal Reserve Bank (“FRB”). In\ngeneral, the BHC Act limits the business of bank holding companies to banking, managing or controlling banks, performing\nservicing activities for subsidiaries and engaging in activities that the FRB has determined, by order or regulation, are so\nclosely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto under the BHC Act. The Corporation is also subject to the\ndisclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,\nas amended, as administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Our common stock is listed on the Capital\nMarket tier of the NASDAQ Stock Market (“NASDAQ”) under the symbol “FLIC” and is subject to NASDAQ rules for\nlisted companies.\nAs a national bank, the Bank is subject to regulation and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\n(“OCC”) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). Insured banks, such as the Bank, are subject to extensive\nregulation of many aspects of their businesses. These regulations generally relate to: (1) the nature and amount of loans that\nmay be made by the Bank and the rates of interest that may be charged; (2) types and amounts of other investments;\n(3) branching; (4) anti-money laundering and Office of Foreign Control (\"OFAC\"); (5) permissible activities; (6) reserve\nrequirements; (7) information security and technology; and (8) dealings with officers, directors and affiliates.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act made extensive changes in the regulation of depository institutions and their holding companies. For\nexample, the Dodd-Frank Act created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) as an independent bureau of\nthe FRB. The CFPB has assumed responsibility for the implementation of the federal financial consumer protection and fair\nlending laws and regulations, a function previously assigned to principal federal banking regulators, and has authority to\nimpose new requirements. However, institutions of less than $10 billion in assets, such as the Bank, continue to be examined\nfor compliance with consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations by, and subject to the enforcement authority\nof, their primary federal regulator, although the CFPB has limited back-up authority to examine such institutions.\nBank Holding Company Regulation. The BHC Act requires the prior approval of the FRB for the acquisition by a bank\nholding company of 5% or more of the voting stock or substantially all of the assets of any bank or bank holding company.\n4\nAlso, under the BHC Act, bank holding companies are prohibited, with certain exceptions, from engaging in, or from\nacquiring 5% or more of the voting stock of any company engaging in activities other than (1) banking or managing or\ncontrolling banks, (2) furnishing services to or performing services for their subsidiaries, or (3) activities that the FRB has\ndetermined to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Bank\nholding companies that meet certain criteria specified by the FRB may elect to be regulated as a “financial holding company”\nand thereby engage in a broader array of financial activities including insurance and investment banking.\nPayment of Dividends. The source of the Corporation’s liquidity is dividends from the Bank. Prior approval of the OCC\nis required if the total of all dividends declared by a national bank in any calendar year would exceed the sum of the bank’s\nnet profits for that year and its retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years, less any required transfers to surplus.\nUnder the foregoing dividend restrictions, and while maintaining its “well capitalized” status and absent affirmative\ngovernmental approvals, during 2024 the Bank could declare dividends to the Corporation of approximately $25.1 million\nplus any 2024 net profits retained to the date of the dividend declaration.\nIn addition, the Corporation and the Bank are subject to other regulatory policies and requirements relating to the payment of\ndividends, including requirements to maintain adequate capital above regulatory minimum capital levels. The FRB is\nauthorized to determine under certain circumstances relating to the financial condition of a bank holding company or a bank\nthat the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit payment thereof. FRB guidance sets\nforth the supervisory expectation that bank holding companies will inform and consult with FRB staff in advance of declaring\na dividend that exceeds earnings for the quarter and should inform the FRB and should eliminate, defer or significantly reduce\ndividends if (1) net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that\nperiod, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends, (2) the prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with the\nbank holding company’s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition, or (3) the bank holding\ncompany will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios.\nStock Repurchases. Current FRB regulations provide that a bank holding company that is not well capitalized or well\nmanaged, as such terms are defined in the regulations, or that is subject to any unresolved supervisory issues, is required to\ngive the FRB prior written notice of any repurchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration\nfor repurchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such repurchases or redemptions during\nthe preceding 12 months, will be equal to 10% or more of the company’s consolidated net worth. The FRB may disapprove\nsuch a repurchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice or violate\na law or regulation. FRB guidance generally provides for bank holding company consultation with FRB staff prior to engaging\nin a repurchase or redemption of a bank holding company’s stock, even if a formal written notice is not required.\nTransactions with Affiliates. Federal laws strictly limit the ability of banks to engage in transactions with their affiliates,\nincluding their bank holding companies. Regulations promulgated by the FRB limit the types and amounts of these\ntransactions (including loans due and extensions of credit from their U.S. bank subsidiaries) that may take place and generally\nrequire those transactions to be on an arm’s-length basis. In general, these regulations require that any “covered transactions”\nbetween a subsidiary bank and its parent company or the nonbank subsidiaries of the bank holding company be limited to\n10% of the bank subsidiary’s capital and surplus and, with respect to such parent company and all such nonbank subsidiaries,\nto an aggregate of 20% of the bank subsidiary’s capital and surplus. Further, loans and extensions of credit to affiliates\ngenerally are required to be secured by eligible collateral in specified amounts.\nSource of Strength Doctrine. FRB policy has historically required bank holding companies to act as a source of financial\nand managerial strength to their subsidiary banks. The Dodd-Frank Act codified this policy as a statutory requirement. Under\nthis requirement, the Corporation is expected to commit resources to support the Bank, including at times when the\nCorporation may not be in a financial position to provide such resources. Any capital loans by a bank holding company to\nany of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of such\nsubsidiary banks. In the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a\nfederal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and\nentitled to priority of payment.\nCapital Requirements. As a bank holding company, the Corporation is subject to consolidated regulatory capital\nrequirements administered by the FRB. The Bank is subject to similar capital requirements administered by the OCC.\nThe Corporation and the Bank are subject to the Basel III regulatory capital standards (“Basel III”) issued by the FRB and\nthe OCC. Under the Basel III capital requirements, the Corporation and the Bank are required to maintain minimum ratios of\nTier 1 capital to average assets of 4.00%, Common equity tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets of 4.50%, Tier 1 capital to risk\nweighted assets of 6.00% and Total capital to risk weighted assets of 8.00%. Common equity tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital,\nTotal capital, risk weighted assets and average assets are defined in the Basel III rules. Failure to meet the minimum capital\n5\nrequirements can result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that, if\nundertaken, could have a direct material effect on the financial statements of the Corporation and Bank. The Corporation and\nthe Bank opted to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income components from Tier 1 and Total regulatory capital.\nBasel III also requires the Corporation and the Bank to maintain a capital conservation buffer of 2.50% in order to avoid\nbeing subject to limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments, and discretionary bonus payments to\nexecutive officers. The capital ratio requirements, including the capital conservation buffer, for banks with $250 billion or\nless in total assets are 7.00% for Common equity tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets, 8.50% for Tier 1 capital to risk weighted\nassets and 10.50% for Total capital to risk weighted assets.\nIn accordance with the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, the federal banking agencies\nadopted a final rule whereby financial institutions and financial institution holding companies that have less than $10 billion\nin total consolidated assets and meet other qualifying criteria, including a leverage ratio of greater than 9% (“qualifying\ncommunity banking organizations”), are eligible to opt into a community bank leverage ratio (“CBLR”) framework.\nQualifying community banking organizations that elect to use the CBLR framework and that maintain a leverage ratio of\ngreater than 9% are considered to have satisfied the generally applicable risk-based and leverage capital requirements in the\nagencies’ capital rules and will be considered to have met the well capitalized ratio requirements under the prompt corrective\naction (“PCA”) statutes. The agencies reserved the authority to disallow the use of the CBLR framework by a financial\ninstitution or holding company, based on the risk profile of the organization. On January 1, 2020, the CBLR framework\nbecame effective, and management elected to adopt the alternative framework. As a qualifying community banking\norganization, the Corporation and the Bank may opt out of the CBLR framework in any subsequent quarter by completing\nits regulatory agency reporting using the traditional capital rules.\nThe Corporation’s capital management policy is designed to build and maintain capital levels that exceed regulatory standards\nand appropriately provide for growth. The leverage ratio of the Corporation and the Bank at December 31, 2023 was 10.05%\nand 10.13%, respectively. The Corporation and the Bank elected the optional five-year transition period provided by the\nfederal banking agencies for recognizing the regulatory capital impact of the implementation of the current expected credit\nloss (“CECL”) methodology.\nPCA Regulations. The Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended (“FDIA”), requires that the federal banking agencies\ntake “prompt corrective action” with respect to banks that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The FDIA sets forth\nthe following five capital tiers for purposes of implementing the PCA regulations: “well capitalized,” “adequately\ncapitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized.” As of December 31, 2023,\nthe Bank was well capitalized.\nDeposit Insurance. The FDIC imposes an assessment on financial institutions for deposit insurance. The assessment is\nbased on the FDIC’s statistical model for estimating the institution’s probability of failure over a three-year period and the\ninstitution’s average total assets and average tangible equity. The FDIC periodically adjusts the deposit insurance assessment\nrates, which may raise or lower the cost to an institution of maintaining FDIC insurance coverage.\nThe FDIC may terminate an institution’s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or\nunsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation,\nrule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. Management is not aware of any practice, condition or violation that might\nlead to termination of the Bank’s deposit insurance.\nSafety and Soundness Standards. The FDIA requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to prescribe standards,\nthrough regulations or guidelines, relating to internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan\ndocumentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, stock valuation and\ncompensation, fees and benefits, and such other operational and managerial standards as the agencies deem appropriate.\nGuidelines adopted by the federal bank regulatory agencies establish general standards relating to internal controls and\ninformation systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth,\ncompensation, fees and benefits. In general, the guidelines require appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage\nthe risk and exposures specified in the guidelines. The guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound\npractice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services\nperformed by an executive officer, employee, director or principal stockholder. In addition, the agencies adopted regulations\nthat authorize, but do not require, an agency to order an institution that has been given notice by an agency that it is not\nsatisfying one or more of the safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan. If, after being so notified, an\ninstitution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an acceptable\ncompliance plan, the agency must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing\nother actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution is subject under the PCA provisions of the FDIA. If an\n6\ninstitution fails to comply with such an order, the agency may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose\ncivil money penalties.\nCommunity Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws. The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (“CRA”) requires\ndepository institutions to assist in meeting the credit needs of their market areas consistent with safe and sound banking\npractice. Under the CRA, each depository institution is required to help meet the credit needs of its market areas by providing\ncredit to low- and moderate-income individuals and communities. Depository institutions are periodically examined for\ncompliance with the CRA and are assigned ratings. Banking regulators take into account CRA ratings when considering\napproval of proposed acquisition transactions. The Bank received a “Satisfactory” CRA rating on its most recent CRA\nexamination. The Bank and the Corporation are firmly committed to the practice of fair lending and maintaining strict\nadherence to all federal and state fair lending laws which prohibit discriminatory lending practices.\nOn May 5, 2022, the federal banking agencies released a notice of proposed rulemaking to “strengthen and modernize” the\nCRA regulations and the related regulatory framework. This final rule was codified on October 24, 2023 with an effective\ndate of April 1, 2024. Under the final rule, banks with assets of at least $2 billion as of December 31 in both of the prior two\ncalendar years will be a \"large bank.\" The agencies will evaluate large banks under four performance tests: the Retails Lending\ntest, the Retail Services and Products Test, the Community Development Financing Test and the Community Development\nServices Test. The applicability date for the majority of the provisions in the CRA regulations is January 1, 2026, and\nadditional requirements will be applicable on January 1, 2027. The Bank is committed to comply with the changes, much of\nwhich are programmatic changes that will address technology changes in the banking industry and providing greater clarity,\nconsistency and transparency in the application of the CRA.\nFederal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System (“FHLB System”),\nwhich consists of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks (each a “FHLB”). The FHLB System provides a central credit\nfacility primarily for member banks. As a member of the FHLB of New York (\"FHLBNY\"), the Bank is required to acquire\nand hold shares of capital stock in the FHLB in an amount equal to 4.5% of its borrowings from the FHLB (transaction-based\nstock) plus 0.125% of the total principal amount at the beginning of the year of the Bank’s unpaid residential real estate loans,\ncommercial real estate loans, home equity loans, CMOs and other similar obligations (membership stock). At December 31,\n2023, the Bank was in compliance with the FHLB’s capital stock ownership requirement.\nFinancial Privacy. Federal regulations require the Bank to disclose its privacy policy, including identifying with whom\nit shares “nonpublic personal information,” to its customers at the time the customer establishes a relationship with the Bank\nand annually thereafter. In addition, we are required to provide our customers with the ability to “opt-out” of having the Bank\nshare their nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third parties before we can disclose that information, subject to\ncertain exceptions.\nThe federal banking agencies adopted guidelines establishing standards for safeguarding our customer information. The\nguidelines describe the agencies’ expectation that regulated entities create, implement and maintain an information security\nprogram, which would include administrative, technical and physical safeguards appropriate to the size and complexity and\nthe nature and scope of our activities. The standards set forth in the guidelines are intended to ensure the security and\nconfidentiality of customer records and information, protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or\nintegrity of customer records, and protect against unauthorized access to records or information that could result in substantial\nharm or inconvenience to customers. Additionally, the guidance states that banks, such as the Bank, should develop and\nimplement a response program to address security breaches involving customer information, including customer notification\nprocedures. The Bank has developed such a program.\nAnti-Money Laundering and the USA PATRIOT Act. A major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions\nin recent years has been aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001\n(“Patriot Act”) substantially broadened the scope of U.S. anti-money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant\nnew compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial\njurisdiction of the United States. The U.S. Treasury Department has issued a number of regulations that apply various\nrequirements of the Patriot Act to financial institutions such as the Bank. These regulations impose obligations on financial\ninstitutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and\nterrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers. Certain of those regulations impose specific due diligence\nrequirements on financial institutions that maintain correspondent or private banking relationships with non-U.S. financial\ninstitutions or persons. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money\nlaundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal, financial\nand reputational consequences for the institution. The Bank and the Corporation are firmly committed to maintaining strong\npolicies, procedures and controls to ensure compliance with anti-money laundering laws and regulations and to combat money\nlaundering and terrorist financing. In recent months, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (\"FinCEN\"), a division of\n7\nthe U.S. Treasury Department, has begun to promulgate regulations to establish a national beneficial owner registry for legal\nentities, as mandated under the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (“AMLA”) and the Corporate Transparency Act\n(“CTA”). The AMLA and CTA are included in the National Defense Authorization Act of 2020, passed in December of\n2020. The AMLA and CTA establish a federal beneficial ownership registry, new-and-enhanced Bank Secrecy Act penalties,\nexpands the ability to subpoena foreign banks and creates an expanded whistleblower reward program. On January 1, 2024,\nthe U.S. Department of the Treasury's FinCEN began accepting beneficial ownership information reports as part of the\npromulgated registry.\nOffice of Foreign Assets Control. The OFAC of the U.S. Department of the Treasury administers and enforces economic\nand trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign countries and regimes,\nterrorists, international narcotics traffickers, those engaged in activities related to the proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction, and other threats to the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States. The Bank maintains a\nrisk based OFAC program to screen applicable transactions against the required watchlists. Additionally, the Bank remains\naware of geo-political and high-risk jurisdiction guidance that is released by government agencies periodically.\nLegislative Initiatives and Regulatory Reform. From time to time, various legislative and regulatory initiatives are\nintroduced in Congress and state legislatures, as well as by regulatory agencies. Such initiatives may include proposals to\nexpand or contract the powers of bank holding companies and depository institutions or proposals to change substantially the\nfinancial institution regulatory system. Such legislation could change banking statutes and the operating environment in\nsubstantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or\nexpand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions and other\nfinancial institutions. The Corporation cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted, and, if enacted, the effect\nthat it, or any implementing regulations, would have on our financial condition or results of operations. A change in statutes,\nregulations or regulatory policies applicable to the Corporation could have a material effect on our business.\nAvailability of Reports\nThe Bank maintains a website at www.fnbli.com. The Corporation’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on\nForm 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, amendments to these reports and proxy materials filed with or furnished to the\nSEC pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge through the Bank’s\nwebsite as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. To access these\nreports go to the homepage of the Bank’s website, hover over FLIC and click on “FLIC Investor Relations,” place the cursor\nover “Financial Information” and click on “SEC Filings.” This will bring you to a listing of the Corporation’s reports.\nInformation on our website shall not be considered a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our SEC filings are also\navailable on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe Corporation is exposed to a variety of risks, some of which are inherent in the banking business. The more significant of\nthese are addressed by the Corporation’s written policies and procedures. While management is responsible for identifying,\nassessing and managing risk, the Board of Directors is responsible for risk oversight. The Board fulfills its risk oversight\nresponsibilities largely through its committees. The following provides information regarding material risk factors faced by\nthe Corporation. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Corporation, or that the Corporation currently\ndeems to be immaterial, could also have a material impact on the Corporation’s business, financial condition or results of\noperations.\nEconomic and Market Area\nA worsening of national or local economic conditions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of\noperations.\nDeteriorating economic conditions could significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the value of our loans and\ninvestments, the value of real estate collateral securing our mortgage loans, the financial strength of our borrowers and our\non-going operations, costs and profitability. A recession or slowed economic conditions could lead to decreased consumer\nspending and lower profits, while rising interest rates could increase borrower costs and make it more difficult for companies\nto access capital. Declines in real estate values, sales volumes and employment levels together with increased vacancy rates,\nparticularly in the NY metropolitan area, may result in greater loan delinquencies, increases in our nonperforming, criticized\nand classified assets and a decline in demand for our products and services. These events may cause us to increase our credit\nloss reserves, incur credit losses and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. The majority of\nour loan portfolio is secured by real estate in the NY metropolitan area.\n8\nA concentration of loans in our primary market area may increase the risk of higher nonperforming assets.\nOur success depends primarily on the general economic conditions in Nassau and Suffolk Counties of Long Island, and the\nboroughs of NYC as nearly all of our loans are to customers in these markets. Accordingly, the local economic conditions in\nthese market areas have a significant impact on the ability of our borrowers to repay loans as well as our ability to originate\nnew loans. A decline in real estate values in these market areas would also lower the value of the collateral securing loans on\nproperties in these market areas.\nInflationary pressures and rising prices may affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nInflation rose sharply in 2021, remained elevated through 2022, and the rate of inflation began to moderate in 2023. Inflation\nmay present a significant risk as it can lead to increased costs and reduced purchasing power for consumers. Small to medium-\nsized businesses may be impacted more during periods of high inflation as they are not able to leverage economies of scale\nto mitigate cost pressures compared to larger businesses. Consequently, the ability of our business customers to repay their\nloans may deteriorate, and in some cases this deterioration may occur quickly. Furthermore, a prolonged period of inflation\ncould cause wages and other operating costs to increase. These factors could adversely affect our results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nCompetition within our market area could limit our ability to increase interest-earning assets and noninterest income.\nCompetition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. In our market area, we compete with numerous\ncommercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokers, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, fintech or e-\ncommerce companies, insurance companies and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere.\nSome of our competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have and have greater name\nrecognition and market presence that benefit them in attracting business. In addition, large competitors may be able to price\nloans and deposits more aggressively than we do, and some have recently eliminated certain noninterest income charges such\nas overdraft fees. Furthermore, fintech developments such as peer-to-peer platforms, blockchain and other distributed ledger\ntechnologies have the potential to disrupt the financial services industry and change the way banks do business. Competitive\nforces may limit our ability to increase our interest-earning assets or maintain the current level of noninterest income. Our\nprofitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market area. For additional information see\n“Item 1 – Business – Competition.”\nSevere weather, acts of terrorism and other external events could impact our ability to conduct business.\nWeather-related events have adversely impacted our market area, especially areas located near coastal waters and flood prone\nareas. Such events that may cause significant flooding and other storm-related damage may become more common events in\nthe future. Financial institutions have been, and continue to be, targets of terrorist threats aimed at compromising operating\nand communication systems and the NY metropolitan area remains central targets for potential acts of terrorism. Such events\ncould cause significant damage, impact the stability of our facilities and result in additional expenses, impair the ability of\nour borrowers to repay their loans, reduce the value of collateral securing repayment of our loans, and result in the loss of\nrevenue. While we have established and regularly test disaster recovery procedures, the occurrence of any such event could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition.\nAdditionally, global markets may be adversely affected by natural disasters, the emergence of widespread health emergencies\nor pandemics, cyber attacks or campaigns, military conflict such as the Russia-Ukraine war and conflicts in the Middle East,\nsupply chain disruptions, terrorism or other geopolitical events. Global market fluctuations may affect our business liquidity.\nAlso, any sudden or prolonged market downturn in the U.S. or abroad, resulting from the above factors or otherwise, could\nresult in a decline in revenue and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, including capital and\nliquidity levels.\nInterest Rates and Asset Quality\nDeclines in the value of investment securities, loans and BOLI may result in impairment charges and may adversely affect\nour financial condition and results of operations.\nThere is always the risk that the Bank will be unable to realize the full carrying value of our investment securities, loans and\nBOLI. Fluctuations in the market value of investment securities may be caused by changes in market interest rates, lower\nmarket prices, rating downgrades and limited investor demand. Management periodically reviews the creditworthiness of all\nsecurities in the Bank’s portfolio, other than those issued by the U.S. government or its agencies, and all BOLI carriers. Any\nsignificant deterioration in the creditworthiness of an issuer or carrier will be analyzed and action taken if deemed appropriate.\n9\nIf an investment's value is deemed other-than-temporarily impaired, the Bank must write down the fair value of the debt\nsecurity which may involve a charge to earnings.\nThe credit risk within the Bank’s loan portfolio primarily stems from factors such as changes in the borrower’s financial\ncondition, credit concentrations, changes in collateral values, economic conditions, rent regulation and environmental\ncontamination of properties securing mortgage loans. The Bank’s commercial loans, including those secured by mortgages,\nare primarily made to small and medium-sized businesses. Such loans sometimes involve a higher degree of risk than those\nto larger companies because such businesses may have shorter operating histories, higher debt-to-equity ratios and may lack\nsophistication in internal record keeping and financial and operational controls. In addition, most of the Bank’s loans are\nmade to businesses and consumers on Long Island and in the boroughs of NYC, and a large percentage of these loans are\nmortgage loans secured by properties located in those areas. At December 31, 2023, residential mortgage loans, including\nhome equity lines of credit, amounted to approximately $1.2 billion and comprised approximately 37% of total loans. The\nprimary source of repayment for residential mortgage loans is cash flows from individual borrowers and co-borrowers. At\nDecember 31, 2023, multifamily loans amounted to approximately $857.2 million and comprised approximately 45% of the\nBank’s total commercial mortgage portfolio and approximately 26% of total loans. The primary source of repayment for\nmultifamily loans is cash flows from the underlying properties, which generally involves a greater risk than residential real\nestate loans because of legislation and government regulations involving rent control, rent stabilization and eviction, which\nare outside the control of the borrower or the Bank and could impair the value of the collateral for the loans. Cash flows for\nboth residential mortgage and multifamily loans are dependent on the strength of the local economy.\nEnvironmental impairment of properties securing mortgage loans is always a risk. However, the Bank is not aware of any\nexisting loans in the portfolio where there is environmental pollution originating on or near the mortgaged properties that\nwould materially affect the value of the portfolio.\nChanges in interest rates and the shape of the yield curve could negatively impact our earnings.\nThe Bank’s financial condition and results of operations are subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations and having\nassets and liabilities that have different maturity, repricing and prepayment/withdrawal characteristics. The Bank defines\ninterest rate risk as the risk that the Bank's net interest income and/or economic value of equity (“EVE”) will change when\ninterest rates change.\nIn a period of rising interest rates, the interest income earned on the Bank’s assets may not increase as rapidly as the interest\npaid on its liabilities such as deposits and FHLB advances. The Bank’s cost of funds is expected to increase more rapidly\nthan interest earned on its loan and investment portfolios as its primary source of funds is deposits and FHLB advances with\ngenerally shorter maturities or repricing characteristics than the maturities and repricing characteristics of its loans and\ninvestments. At December 31, 2023, 21.6% of the Bank’s loans and securities reprice or mature within one year. This makes\nthe balance sheet more liability sensitive in the short-term. In addition, in a period of rising interest rates, noninterest-bearing\ndeposits may convert to interest-bearing deposits further increasing the Bank’s funding costs. The current economic\nenvironment, characterized by a high rate of inflation, a pause after a period of rapidly rising interest rates and an inverted\nyield curve, presents significant financial challenges to the Corporation.\nWhen interest rates decline, borrowers may refinance higher rate loans to lower rates causing prepayments on mortgage loans\nand mortgage-backed securities to be elevated. Under those circumstances, the Bank may not be able to reinvest the resulting\ncash flows in new interest-earning assets with rates as favorable as those that prepaid. In addition, subject to the floors\ncontained in many of the Bank’s loan agreements, the Bank’s loans at variable interest rates may adjust to lower rates at their\nreset dates. While lower rates may reduce the Bank’s cost of funds on non-maturity deposits, certificates of deposit (“CDs”)\nand FHLB advances, the cost savings could be somewhat constrained because decreases in the Bank’s funding rates may\noccur more slowly than decreases in yields earned on the Bank’s assets and a significant portion of the Bank’s funding is\ncurrently derived from noninterest-bearing checking deposits and capital. In addition, in a prolonged low interest rate\nenvironment, the Bank’s deposit products could reach an effective floor rate close to zero which would not allow for any\nfurther reduction in its cost of funds.\nChanges in interest rates also affect the value of our interest-earning assets and in particular our securities and loan portfolios.\nGenerally, the value of securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2023, our AFS securities\nportfolio totaled $695.9 million. Unrealized gains and losses on AFS securities are reported as a separate component of\nstockholders’ equity. Therefore, decreases in the fair value of AFS securities resulting from increases in interest rates could\nhave an adverse effect on stockholders’ equity.\nIn addition to the risks arising from changes in interest rates, the shape of the yield curve could create downward pressure on\nnet interest income and net interest margin. In the current flat or inverted yield curve environment, asset growth could\n10\nnegatively impact the Bank’s earnings and/or profitability metrics. As a result, the Bank may be unable to increase earnings,\nor maintain the current level of earnings, until the yield curve steepens.\nThe performance of our multifamily real estate loans could be adversely impacted by regulation.\nMultifamily real estate loans generally involve a greater risk of non-payment and loss than one-to-four family residential real\nestate loans. Repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation of the properties and the sale of such properties\nsecuring the loans. Such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers\ncompared to one-to-four family residential loans. If loans that are collateralized by real estate become troubled and the value\nof the real estate has been significantly impaired, then we may not be able to recover the full contractual amount of principal\nand interest that we anticipated at the time we originated the loan, which could cause us to increase our provision for credit\nlosses and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nAdditionally, legislation and government regulations involving rent control and rent stabilization which are outside the control\nof the borrower or the Bank, could impair the value of the collateral for the loan or the future cash flow of such properties.\nAs an example, on June 14, 2019, the New York State legislature passed the New York Housing Stability and Tenant\nProtection Act of 2019. This legislation represents the most extensive reform of New York State’s rent laws in several decades\nand generally limits a landlord’s ability to increase rents on rent regulated apartments and makes it more difficult to convert\nrent regulated apartments to market rate apartments. As a result, the value of the collateral located in New York State securing\nthe Company’s multifamily loans or the future net operating income of such properties could potentially become impaired\nwhich, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. To date, the Company\nhas not experienced any material negative impacts as a result of this legislation.\nManagement’s estimate of the Allowance for Credit Losses (“ACL” or “allowance”) may not be sufficient and could result\nin increased provisions and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Bank maintains an ACL in an amount believed to be adequate to absorb current expected lifetime credit losses in its loan\nportfolio. The maintenance of the ACL is governed by a board committee approved ACL policy. In arriving at the ACL, an\nindividual evaluation is performed on each loan with disparate risk characteristics or information suggesting that the Bank\nwill be unable to collect all the principal and interest due according to contractual terms. In addition, current expected lifetime\ncredit losses for all other loans in the Bank’s portfolio are determined on a pooled basis using the CECL model and taking\ninto account historical loss experience and numerous quantitative and qualitative factors (“Q-factors”), including current and\nforecasted economic conditions measured by such things as gross domestic product (“GDP”), unemployment levels,\nvacancies, changes in the value of underlying collateral, average growth in loan pools, concentrations of credit, changes in\nlending policies and procedures, experience, ability and depth of lending staff, changes in quality of the loan review function,\nenvironmental risks and loan risk ratings. Because estimating the ACL is highly subjective in nature and involves a variety\nof estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain, there is the risk that management’s estimate may not accurately\ncapture probable lifetime losses in the loan portfolio. The Bank’s allowance may need to be increased based on additional\ninformation that comes to light after the estimate is made, changes in circumstances or a recommendation by bank regulators\nbased on their review of the Bank’s loan portfolio. The impact of one or more of these factors on the Bank’s allowance could\nresult in the need for a significant increase in the Bank’s provision for credit losses and have a material adverse impact on\nthe Bank’s financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulatory Matters\nIf our regulators impose limitations on our commercial real estate lending activities, earnings could be adversely\naffected, and we may face greater risk in our loan portfolio.\nIn 2006, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued joint guidance entitled “Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate\nLending, Sound Risk Management Practices” (the “CRE Guidance”). Although the CRE Guidance did not establish specific\nlending limits, it provides that a bank’s commercial mortgage lending exposure may receive increased supervisory scrutiny\nwhere total non-owner occupied commercial mortgages, including loans secured by apartment buildings, investor commercial\nmortgages and construction and land loans (\"CRE loans\"), represent 300% or more of an institution’s total risk-based capital\nand the outstanding balance of the CRE loan portfolio has increased by 50% or more during the preceding 36 months (\"CRE\ngrowth rate\"). The Company’s CRE loans, equaled 361% of total risk-based capital at December 31, 2023 and the Company's\nCRE growth rate during the 36-month period ended December 31, 2023 was 30.7%. The Company did not meet the combined\nthresholds for increased supervisory scrutiny. However, if our regulators were to impose restrictions on the amount of CRE\nloans we can hold in our portfolio or require higher capital ratios as a result of the level of CRE loans held, our earnings\nwould be adversely affected.\n11\nIf we are limited in our ability to originate loans secured by commercial real estate, we may incur greater risk in our loan\nportfolio. For example, we are and may continue to seek to further increase our growth rate in commercial and industrial\nloans, including both secured and unsecured commercial and industrial loans. Unsecured loans generally involve a higher\ndegree of risk of loss than do secured loans because, without collateral, repayment is wholly dependent upon the success of\nthe borrowers’ businesses and personal guarantees. Secured commercial and industrial loans are generally collateralized by\naccounts receivable, inventory, equipment or other assets owned by the borrower and typically include a personal guaranty\nof the business owner. Compared to real estate, that type of collateral is more difficult to monitor, its value is harder to\nascertain, it may depreciate more rapidly, and it may not be as readily saleable if repossessed. Therefore, we may be exposed\nto greater risk of loss on these credits.\nThe Bank is subject to the CRA and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to material\npenalties.\nThe CRA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose non-\ndiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. With respect to the Bank, the FRB, U.S. Department of Justice\nand other federal and state agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. A successful regulatory\nchallenge to an institution’s performance under the CRA or fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety\nof sanctions, including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions\non mergers and acquisitions activity and restrictions on expansion. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an\ninstitution’s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Such actions could have a material adverse\neffect on the Bank’s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in laws, government regulation and supervisory guidance could have a significant negative impact on our\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nThe Corporation and the Bank are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by, among others, the FRB, OCC and\nFDIC. The FDIC also insures the Bank’s deposits. Regulation and supervision govern the activities in which a bank and its\nholding company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of depositors. Regulatory requirements affect\nvirtually all aspects of the Corporation’s and the Bank’s business, including investment and lending practices, deposit\nofferings and capital levels. The regulators have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement\nactivities, including imposing restrictions on Bank operations and expansion plans, imposing deposit insurance premiums\nand other assessments, setting required levels for the ACL, capital and liquidity, and imposing restrictions on the ability to\npay cash dividends and other capital distributions to stockholders. Changes in laws, regulations and supervisory guidance, or\nthe Corporation’s and the Bank’s compliance with these laws and regulations as judged by the regulators, could have a\nsignificant negative impact on the Corporation’s financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from customers, regulators, investors and other stakeholders with respect\nto our environmental, social and governance practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to new or additional\nrisks.\nCompanies are facing increasing scrutiny from customers, regulators, investors and other stakeholders related to their\nenvironmental, social and governance (\"ESG\") practices and disclosure. Investor advocacy groups, investment funds and\ninfluential investors are also increasingly focused on these practices, especially as they relate to the environment, health and\nsafety, diversity, labor conditions and human rights. Increased ESG related compliance costs could result in increases to our\noverall operational costs. Failure to adapt to or comply with regulatory requirements or stakeholder expectations could\nnegatively impact our reputation, ability to do business with certain partners and our stock price. New government regulations\ncould also result in new or more stringent forms of ESG oversight and expanding mandatory or voluntary reporting, diligence\nand disclosure.\nBusiness Issues\nOur stock price may be negatively impacted by unrelated bank failures and negative depositor confidence in depository\ninstitutions. Further, if we are unable to adequately manage our liquidity, deposits, capital levels and interest rate risk,\nwhich have come under greater scrutiny in light of recent bank failures, it may have a material adverse effect on our\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nOn March 9, 2023, Silvergate Bank, La Jolla, California, announced its decision to voluntarily liquidate its assets and wind\ndown operations. On March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank, Santa Clara, California, was closed by the California Department\nof Financial Protection and Innovation (“DFPI”), on March 12, 2023, Signature Bank, New York, New York, was closed by\nthe New York State Department of Financial Services, and on May 1, 2023, First Republic Bank, San Francisco, California,\n12\nwas closed by the DFPI, and in each case the FDIC was appointed receiver for the failed institution. These banks had elevated\nlevels of uninsured deposits, which may be less likely to remain at the bank over time and a less stable source of funding than\ninsured deposits. These failures have led to volatility and declines in the market for bank stocks and questions about depositor\nconfidence in depository institutions.\nThese events have led to a greater focus by institutions, investors and regulators on the on-balance sheet liquidity of and\nfunding sources for financial institutions, the composition of its deposits, including the amount of uninsured deposits, the\namount of accumulated other comprehensive loss, capital levels and interest rate risk management. If we are unable to\nadequately manage our liquidity, deposits, capital levels and interest rate risk, it may have a material adverse effect on our\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends.\nThe declaration and payment of any dividend is subject to the approval of our Board of Directors and our dividend may be\ndiscontinued or reduced at any time. Our ability to pay cash dividends is limited by restrictions or limitations on our ability\nto obtain sufficient funds through dividends from the Bank. There can be no assurance that the current payout ratio is\nsustainable or that we will be able to declare cash dividends in the future in any particular amounts, or at all. For additional\ninformation, see \"Item 1 - Business - Payment of Dividends.\"\nThe Bank and Corporation may not have sufficient funds or funding sources to meet liquidity demands.\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Bank will not have sufficient funds to accommodate loan growth, meet deposit outflows or\nmake contractual payments on borrowing arrangements. The Bank encounters significant competition for deposits in its\nmarket area from larger banks, various community banks, credit unions and other financial services organizations. This\ncompetition for deposits, particularly in the recent rapidly rising interest rate environment, could result in significant outflows\nand further exert upward pressure on the Bank’s funding costs. In addition, the Bank’s concentration of deposits with certain\ncustomers could limit our ability to favorably reprice deposits and grow net interest income, net interest margin and earnings.\nThe Bank has both internal and external sources of liquidity that can be used to fund loan growth and accommodate deposit\noutflows. The Bank’s primary internal sources of liquidity are overnight investments and maturities and monthly payments\non its investment securities and loan portfolios.\nThe Bank is a member of the FRB of NY (“FRBNY”) and the FHLBNY and has a federal funds line with a commercial bank.\nIn addition to customer deposits, the Bank’s primary external sources of liquidity are secured borrowings from the FHLBNY\nand FRBNY. In addition, the Bank can purchase overnight federal funds under its existing line and the Corporation may raise\nfunds through its Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (“DRIP”). However, the Bank’s FRBNY\nmembership, FHLBNY membership and federal funds line do not represent legal commitments to extend credit to the Bank.\nThe amount that the Bank can potentially borrow is currently dependent on the amount of unencumbered eligible securities\nand loans that the Bank can use as collateral and the collateral margins required by the lenders. The Bank’s borrowing capacity\nmay be adjusted by the FRBNY or the FHLBNY and may take into account factors such as the Bank’s tangible common\nequity ratio, collateral margins required by the lender or other factors. A possible future downgrade of securities and loans\npledged as collateral could also impact the amount of available funding. Regulatory or strategic changes affecting the access\nto and availability of funding from the FHLBNY could adversely impact the Bank’s liquidity.\nThe Corporation relies on dividends from the Bank to fund its operating expenses, dividends to shareholders and repurchases\nof common stock. The OCC restricts the dividends the Bank may pay to the Corporation to its retained net profits for the\npreceding two calendar years plus current year retained net profits. These restrictions may limit the Corporation’s ability to\npay dividends or repurchase shares. In addition, the Corporation may not be successful in raising funds from the issuance of\nits stock under the DRIP or otherwise.\nOur funding sources may prove insufficient to replace deposits at maturity and support our future growth. A lack of\nliquidity could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and result in regulatory limits being\nplaced on the Corporation.\nThe Bank must maintain sufficient funds to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers. Deposits have traditionally\nbeen our primary source of funds for use in lending and investment activities. We also receive funds from loan repayments,\ninvestment maturities and income on other interest-earning assets. While we emphasize the generation of low-cost core\ndeposits as a source of funding, there is strong competition for such deposits in our market area. Additionally, deposit balances\ncan decrease if customers perceive alternative investments as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. Accordingly, as part of\nour liquidity management, we must use a number of funding sources in addition to deposits and repayments and maturities\n13\nof loans and investments, including FHLB advances, federal funds purchased and brokered CDs. Adverse operating results\nor changes in industry conditions could lead to difficulty or an inability to access these additional funding sources.\nOur financial flexibility will be severely constrained if we are unable to maintain access to funding or if adequate financing\nis not available to accommodate future growth at acceptable interest rates. Further, if we are required to rely more heavily on\nmore expensive funding sources to support liquidity and future growth, our revenues may not increase proportionately to\ncover the increased costs. In this case, our operating margins and profitability would be adversely affected. Alternatively, we\nmay need to sell a portion of our securities and/or loan portfolio to raise funds which, depending upon market conditions,\ncould result in us realizing a loss on the sale of such assets. As of December 31, 2023, we had a net unrealized loss of\n$71.9 million on our AFS securities portfolio resulting from the change in the interest rate environment. Investment securities\ntotaled $695.9 million, or 16% of total assets, at December 31, 2023.\nAny decline in available funding could adversely impact our ability to originate loans, invest in securities, pay our expenses,\nor fulfill obligations such as repaying our borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a\nmaterial adverse impact on our liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA lack of liquidity could also attract increased regulatory scrutiny and potential restraints imposed on us by regulators.\nDepending on the capitalization status and regulatory treatment of depository institutions, including whether an institution is\nsubject to a supervisory PCA directive, certain additional regulatory restrictions and prohibitions may apply, including\nrestrictions on growth, restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, restrictions or prohibitions on payment of dividends and\nrestrictions on the acceptance of brokered deposits.\nA decline in the Corporation’s market capitalization could negatively impact the price, trading volume and liquidity of our\ncommon stock.\nThe Corporation’s common stock is included in the Russell 3000 and Russell 2000 Indexes, which are reconstituted annually.\nUpon reconstitution in May 2023, the median market capitalization of the Russell 2000 index was $896.6 million, the\ncapitalization of the largest company in the index was $6.0 billion and the capitalization of the smallest company in the index\nwas $159.5 million. The Corporation’s market capitalization was approximately $299 million on December 31, 2023. If the\nCorporation’s market capitalization falls below the minimum necessary to be included in the indexes at any future\nreconstitution date, the price, trading volume and liquidity of its common stock may be negatively impacted.\nThe Bank’s internal controls and those of its third-party service providers (“TPSPs”) may be ineffective or circumvented,\nresulting in significant financial loss, adverse action by governmental bodies and damaged reputation.\nThe Corporation relies on its system of internal controls and the internal controls of its TPSPs to ensure that transactions are\ncaptured, recorded, processed and reported properly; confidential customer information is safeguarded; and fraud by\nemployees and persons outside the Corporation is detected and prevented. The Corporation’s internal controls and/or those\nof its TPSPs may prove to be ineffective or employees of the Corporation and/or its TPSPs may fail to comply with or override\nthe controls, either of which could result in significant financial loss to the Corporation, adverse action by bank regulatory\nauthorities or the SEC and damage to the Corporation’s reputation.\nThe Bank’s inability to keep pace with technological advances could negatively impact our business, financial condition\nand results of operations.\nThe delivery of financial products and services has increasingly become technology driven. The Bank’s ability to\ncompetitively meet the needs of its customers in a cost-efficient manner is dependent on its ability to keep pace with\ntechnological advances and to invest in new technology as it becomes available. The ability to keep pace with technological\nchange is important, and failure to do so could have a material adverse impact on the Corporation’s business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nThe inability to attract, motivate or retain qualified key personnel could negatively impact our performance.\nThe Corporation’s future success depends in part on the continued service of its executive officers and other key members of\nmanagement and its staff, as well as its ability to continue to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified employees. The loss\nof services of key personnel and our inability to timely recruit or promote qualified replacements could have an adverse effect\non the Bank’s business, operating results and financial condition. Their skills, knowledge of the Bank’s market and years of\nindustry experience may be difficult to replace.\n14\nThe inability to control the risks associated with social media and other internet postings could adversely impact the\nCorporation's business and reputation.\nCustomers, shareholders, employees and outsiders could potentially share sensitive or inaccurate information on social media\nplatforms or engage in behavior that may reflect poorly on the company and lead to adverse impacts on the Corporation’s\nbusiness. While social media activity may provide benefits like increased brand awareness, even positive social media posts\nhave the potential to create controversy and increase the Corporation's risk profile.\nMergers and acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties.\nThe Corporation may in the future pursue mergers and acquisitions opportunities. Mergers and acquisitions involve a number\nof risks and challenges, including the expenses involved; potential diversion of management’s attention from other strategic\nmatters; integration of branches and operations acquired; outflow of customers from the acquired branches; retention of\npersonnel from acquired companies or branches; competing effectively in geographic areas not previously served; managing\ngrowth resulting from the transaction; and dilution in the acquirer's book and tangible book value per share.\nSecurity\nSystem failures, interruptions and security breaches could negatively impact our customers, reputation and results of\noperations.\nThe Bank outsources most of its data processing to TPSPs. If TPSPs encounter difficulties, or if the Bank has difficulty\ncommunicating with them, the Bank’s ability to adequately process and account for customer transactions could be affected,\nand the Bank’s business operations could be adversely impacted. Threats to information security also exist in the processing\nof customer information through TPSPs. The Bank’s website and online banking products have been the target of cyberattacks\nin the past. While the Bank and its TPSPs believe they have successfully blocked attempts to infiltrate the Bank’s systems,\nthere is always the possibility that successful attacks have not yet been identified and future attacks may not be blocked. A\nsignificant cybersecurity incident may be determined to be material insider information and would prohibit corporate insiders\nfrom trading in the Corporation’s stock until appropriate public disclosures are made.\nOpportunistic cyberattacks and malicious financial crimes have been growing globally in number and complexity and\nincrease the cost of technology, compliance and labor. The Bank makes use of logon and user access controls, multifactor\nand out of band authentication, transaction limits, firewalls, antivirus software, intrusion protection monitoring and\nvulnerability scans and conducts independent penetration testing and cybersecurity audits. Bank communications encourage\nemployee and executive awareness of cybersecurity trends.\nThese precautions may not protect our systems from all compromises or breaches of security and there can be no assurance\nthat such events will not occur or that they will be adequately addressed if they do. The Bank carries a cyber liability insurance\npolicy to mitigate the risks of financial loss. However, the occurrence of any systems failure, interruption or breach of security\ncould damage the Bank’s reputation and result in a loss of customers and business, could subject the Bank to additional\nregulatory scrutiny or could expose the Bank to civil litigation and possible financial liability beyond any insurance coverage.\nAny of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s financial condition and results of\noperations.\nRisks associated with cybersecurity could negatively affect our earnings.\nThe financial services industry has experienced an increase in both the number and severity of reported cyberattacks aimed\nat gaining unauthorized access to bank systems as a way to misappropriate assets and sensitive information, corrupt and\ndestroy data, or cause operational disruptions.\nWe have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of security breaches, but such events may still\noccur or may not be adequately addressed if they do occur. Although we rely on security safeguards to secure our data, these\nsafeguards may not fully protect our systems from compromises or breaches.\nWe also rely on the integrity and security of a variety of third-party processors, payment, clearing and settlement systems, as\nwell as the various participants involved in these systems, many of which have no direct relationship with us. Failure by these\nparticipants or their systems to protect our customers’ transaction data may put us at risk for possible losses due to fraud or\noperational disruption.\n15\nOur customers are also the target of cyberattacks and identity theft. Large scale identity theft could result in customers’\naccounts being compromised and fraudulent activities being performed in their name. We have implemented certain\nsafeguards against these types of activities, but they may not fully protect us from fraudulent financial losses.\nThe occurrence of a breach of security involving our customers’ information, regardless of its origin, could damage our\nreputation and result in a loss of customers and business and subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, and could expose us\nto litigation and possible financial liability. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition\nand results of operations.\nWhile our Board of Directors takes an oversight role in cybersecurity risk tolerance, we rely to a large degree on\nmanagement and outside consultants in overseeing cybersecurity risk management.\nOur Board of Directors takes an oversight role in the cybersecurity risk tolerance of the Corporation and all members receive\ncybersecurity training annually. The Board approves information technology policies, including those relative\nto cybersecurity. Furthermore, our Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing all audit findings related to information\ntechnology general controls, internal and external vulnerability, and penetration testing. We also engage outside consultants\nto support our cybersecurity efforts. However, our directors do not have significant experience in cybersecurity risk\nmanagement outside of the Corporation and therefore, its ability to fulfill its oversight function remains dependent on the\ninput it receives from management and outside consultants.\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone.\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\nOur risk management program is designed to identify, assess, and mitigate risks across various aspects of our company,\nincluding but not limited to the following risks: operational, regulatory compliance, reputational, strategic, information\ntechnology, data security and privacy, and market risks such as interest rate, credit, liquidity and price risks. Cybersecurity is\na critical component of this program, given the increasing reliance on technology and potential of cyber threats. Our Board\nof Directors is responsible for risk oversight over all significant risks facing the Corporation and fulfills this responsibility\nmainly through its committees. While our Board of Directors takes an oversight role in cybersecurity risk tolerance, we rely\nto a large degree on management and outside consultants in overseeing cybersecurity risk management. Our Director of\nInformation Security, who reports directly to our Chief Information Officer, is primarily responsible for this cybersecurity\ncomponent and is a member of management's Operational Risk and IT Steering Committees, and regularly attends and\npresents to the Risk Committee of our Board of Directors (\"Risk Committee\").\nOur objective for managing cybersecurity risk is to avoid or minimize the impacts of external threat events or other efforts to\npenetrate, disrupt or misuse our systems or information. The structure of our information security program is designed around\nregulatory guidance, and other industry standards. In addition, we leverage certain industry and government associations,\naudits, and threat intelligence feeds to facilitate and promote program effectiveness.\nWe leverage people, processes, and technology as part of our efforts to manage and maintain cybersecurity controls. We also\nemploy a variety of preventative and detective tools designed to monitor, block, and provide alerts regarding suspicious\nactivity, as well as to report on suspected advanced persistent threats. We have established processes and systems designed\nto mitigate cyber risk, including regular and on-going education and training for employees, preparedness simulations and\ntabletop exercises, and recovery and resilience tests. We engage in regular assessments of our infrastructure, software\nsystems, and network architecture, using internal and third-party specialists. We also maintain a third-party risk management\nprogram designed to identify, assess, and manage risks, including cybersecurity risks, associated with external service\nproviders. We also actively monitor our email gateways for malicious phishing email campaigns and monitor remote\nconnections as a significant portion of our workforce has the ability to work remotely. We leverage internal and external\nauditors and independent external partners to periodically review our processes, systems, and controls, including with respect\nto our information security program, to assess their design and operating effectiveness and make recommendations to\nstrengthen our risk management program.\nWe maintain an Incident Response Plan that provides a documented framework for responding to actual or potential\ncybersecurity incidents, including notification of and escalation to the appropriate team members as well as executive\nmanagement and the Board of Directors. The Incident Response Plan is coordinated through the Director of Information\nSecurity and key members of management. The Incident Response Plan facilitates coordination across multiple departments\nand is evaluated at least annually.\n16\nNotwithstanding our defensive measures and processes, the threat posed by cyberattacks is severe. Our internal systems,\nprocesses, and controls are designed to mitigate loss from cyberattacks. To date, the Corporation has not, to its knowledge,\nexperienced an incident materially affecting or reasonably likely to materially affect the Corporation.\nThe Director of Information Security provides information security updates to the IT Steering Committee and the Risk\nCommittee. Cybersecurity metrics are reported to the IT Steering Committee monthly and to the Risk Committee on a\nquarterly basis. Security training is provided to all staff through targeted training overseen by the Director of Information\nSecurity. All Board members receive cybersecurity training annually.\nThe Board of Directors recognizes the importance of the Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safeguarding\nCustomer Information and has incorporated those elements in its ongoing oversight of the Information Security Program. At\nleast annually, the Director of Information Security and the Chief Risk Officer report to the Risk Committee the overall status\nof the Information Security Program. Any material findings related to the risk assessment, risk management and control\ndecisions, service provider arrangements, results of testing, security breaches or violations are discussed as are management’s\nresponses and any recommendations for program changes.\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nThe Corporation neither owns nor leases any real estate. Office facilities of the Corporation are located at 275 Broadhollow\nRoad, Melville, NY and the Bank’s main branch is located at 10 Glen Head Road, Glen Head, NY in office space leased by\nthe Bank.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Bank owns 19 buildings and leases 30 other facilities, all of which are in Nassau and Suffolk\nCounties of Long Island and the NYC boroughs of Queens, Brooklyn and Manhattan. Included in the leased facilities is one\nbranch location that was closed in 2023 and one closed in 2022 for which the Bank continues to be obligated to make lease\npayments. One owned building is classified as held-for-sale and currently in contract to be sold. The Corporation believes\nthat the remaining physical facilities of the Bank are suitable and adequate at present and are being fully utilized.\nITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nFrom time to time, the Corporation is involved in various legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of its business.\nIn the opinion of management, these legal actions and claims are not expected to have a material adverse impact on the\nCorporation’s financial condition and results of operations.\nITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable.\n17\nPART II\nITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND\nISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nThe Corporation’s common stock trades on the NASDAQ Capital Market tier of the NASDAQ Stock Market under the\nsymbol “FLIC.” At December 31, 2023, there were 765 stockholders of record of the Corporation’s common stock. The\nnumber of stockholders of record includes banks and brokers who act as nominees, each of whom may represent more than\none stockholder. The Corporation declared cash dividends of $0.84 per share for the year ended December 31, 2023,\ncompared to cash dividends declared in 2022 of $0.82 per share. The timing and amount of future dividends are at the\ndiscretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon a number of economic and company-specific factors.\nPerformance Graph\nThe following performance graph compares the Corporation's total stockholder return with the NASDAQ U.S.\nBenchmark, NASDAQ U.S. Benchmark Banks and the ABA Community Bank NASDAQ Indexes over a five-year\nmeasurement period assuming $100 invested on January 1, 2019, and dividends reinvested in the Corporation’s stock. In\n2023, the ABA Community Bank NASDAQ Index was selected to replace the NASDAQ U.S. Benchmark Banks Index as\nwe concluded it more closely reflects the size and characteristics of the Corporation.\nIssuer Purchase of Equity Securities\nThe Corporation has a stock repurchase program under which it is authorized to purchase shares of its common stock from\ntime to time through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or in any other manner that is compliant with\napplicable securities laws.

Net income and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) for 2023 were $26.2 million and $1.16,\nrespectively. Dividends per share increased 2.4% from $0.82 for 2022 to $0.84 for 2023. ROA and ROE for 2023 were 0.62%\nand 7.14%, respectively, compared to 1.11% and 12.13%, respectively, for 2022.\nNet income and EPS for 2023 were $26.2 million and $1.16, respectively, compared to $46.9 million and $2.04, respectively,\nin 2022. The principal drivers of the decreases were declines in net interest income of $28.8 million, or 24.9%, and a loss on\nsale of securities of $3.5 million. These items were partially offset by a decrease in income tax expense of $8.1 million and a\ndecrease in the provision for credit losses of $2.7 million. The decline in net interest income primarily resulted from the\ncurrent rate environment’s impact on the Bank’s liability sensitive balance sheet. Reductions in net income negatively\nimpacted key financial ratios for the year as compared to historical results. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the\nROA was 0.62%, ROE was 7.14%, the net interest margin was 2.16%, and the efficiency ratio was 65.52%.\nOver the second half of 2023, the pace of the decline in the net interest margin slowed considerably. After a 57 basis\npoint reduction in the margin during the first two quarters of 2023, over the final two quarters of 2023 the margin decreased\n17 basis points (\"bps\"). The slowing downward trend in the net interest margin largely resulted from a large portion of the\nwholesale funding and time deposits being repriced to higher market rates by mid-2023 and two balance sheet repositioning\ntransactions in the first quarter of 2023 that helped reduce the Bank’s liability sensitive position. Additionally, as the federal\nfunds rate held steady in the second half of the year, the demand for higher rates from depositors slowed.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, net interest income declined due to an increase in interest expense of $50.1 million\nthat was only partially offset by a $21.3 million increase in interest income. Year over year, the cost of interest-bearing\n19\nliabilities increased 186 bps while the yield on interest-earning assets increased 48 bps. Also contributing to the decline in\nnet interest income was a shift in the mix of funding as average noninterest-bearing deposits decreased $217.9 million while\naverage interest-bearing liabilities increased $221.6 million as depositors took advantage of interest rates not seen in over a\ndecade.\nNoninterest income declined $2.8 million year over year excluding the net gains and losses on sales of securities and the\ndisposition of premises and fixed assets. The primary factor reducing noninterest income for the current year was a $2.3\nmillion decline in the net pension credit, excluding service costs. The remaining difference was related to a payment received\nin 2022 for the conversion of the Bank’s retail broker and advisory accounts to LPL.\nNoninterest expense declined $3.0 million, or 4.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the prior year.\nReductions in salaries and employee benefits of $3.7 million primarily drove the decline as short-term incentive compensation\nand stock-based compensation costs were substantially lower than 2022 based on the Company falling short of established\nperformance metrics for 2023. The primary offset to the lower salaries and employee benefits was a $782,000 increase in\nFDIC insurance expense due to higher assessment rates.\nThe Bank recorded a credit loan loss provision of $326,000 during 2023. Changes in the loan loss reserve were driven largely\nby adjustments for economic conditions offset by net chargeoffs of $2.1 million, or 6 bps of average loans. The ACL to total\nloans (\"reserve coverage ratio\") at year end 2023 was 0.89% of total loans as compared to 0.95% of total loans at December\n31, 2022. Past due loans and nonaccrual loans were modest at $3.1 million and $1.1 million, respectively, at December 31,\n2023. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Bank partially charged off a previously identified substandard commercial and\nindustrial loan relationship in the amount of $1.4 million. The remaining outstanding balance of $632,000 is fully reserved\nand represents the majority of outstanding nonaccrual loans. Overall credit quality in the loan and investment portfolios\nremains strong.\nIncome tax expense decreased $8.1 million and the effective tax rate (income tax expense as a percentage of pre-tax book\nincome) declined from 19.4% in 2022 to 11.0% in 2023. The decline in the effective tax rate is mainly due to an increase in\nthe percentage of pre-tax income derived from the Bank's REIT and BOLI. The decrease in income tax expense reflects the\nlower effective tax rate and a decline in pre-tax income.\nAsset Quality. The Bank’s reserve coverage ratio was 0.89% at December 31, 2023, compared to 0.95% at December\n31, 2022. The decrease in the reserve coverage ratio was mainly due to improvements in historical loss rates and other\nportfolio metrics, partially offset by specific reserves taken against two commercial and industrial loans. Gross loan\nchargeoffs and recoveries were $2.2 million and $96,000, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nNonaccrual loans were $1.1 million, or 0.03% of total loans outstanding, at December 31, 2023. The Bank had no nonaccrual\nloans at December 31, 2022. Loans modified for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty prior to 2023 amounted to\n$431,000, or 0.01% of total loans outstanding, at December 31, 2023, compared to $480,000, or 0.01%, at December 31,\n2022. All such modifications are performing in accordance with their modified terms at December 31, 2023. Loans past due\n30 through 89 days amounted to $3.1 million, or 0.10% of total loans outstanding, at December 31, 2023, compared to\n$750,000, or 0.02%, at December 31, 2022.\nThe Bank’s mortgage securities are backed by mortgages underwritten on conventional terms, with 26% of these securities\nbeing full faith and credit obligations of the U.S. government and the balance being obligations of U.S. government sponsored\nentities. The remainder of the Bank’s securities portfolio principally consists of high quality, general obligation municipal\nsecurities rated AA or better by major rating agencies and investment grade corporate bonds of large U.S. financial\ninstitutions. In selecting securities for purchase, the Bank uses credit agency ratings for screening purposes only and then\nperforms its own credit analysis. On an ongoing basis, the Bank periodically assesses the credit strength of the securities in\nits portfolio and makes decisions to hold or sell based on such assessments.\nLooking Forward to 2024. Management is encouraged by recent declines in inflation figures that may lead to reductions\nin short-term rates in 2024. Our liability-sensitive balance sheet should perform well in a falling rate environment. Current\nexpectations are for our net interest margin to remain under pressure during the first half of 2024 before improving in the\nsecond half of the year based on falling rate assumptions and an improving yield curve.\nManagement continues to pursue ways to reduce noninterest expense as a tactic to offset the impact of the decline in net\ninterest income yet remains cognizant of preventing short term expense reductions that could have longer term negative\nimpacts on shareholder value. We invested in upgrades to the Bank’s core system, business online banking, branch systems\nand other ancillary systems that were completed in the first quarter of 2024. Both customer facing technology and back-office\noperations will see benefits. We anticipate a lower run rate of noninterest expenses in 2024 including the cost associated with\nmaking these technology upgrades.\n20\nOverview –2022 Versus 2021\nAnalysis of 2022 Earnings. Net income and diluted EPS for 2022 were $46.9 million and $2.04, respectively. Dividends\nper share increased 5.1% from $0.78 for 2021 to $0.82 for 2022. ROA and ROE for 2022 were 1.11% and 12.13%,\nrespectively, compared to 1.04% and 10.34%, respectively, for 2021.\nNet income for 2022 was $46.9 million, an increase of $3.8 million, or 8.9%, as compared to 2021. The increase was\nprimarily due to growth in net interest income of $8.9 million and a decrease in noninterest expense of $1.1 million. These\nitems were partially offset by increases in the provision for credit losses of $4.9 million and income tax expense of\n$1.1 million.\nThe increase in net interest income reflected growth in interest income on loans of $10.1 million due to higher average loans\noutstanding of $300.5 million in 2022 offset by $2.3 million of growth in interest expense on total interest-bearing liabilities\nresulting from increases in short-term rates. Also contributing to the increase was a favorable shift in the mix of funding as\nan increase in average checking deposits of $96.1 million outpaced the growth in average interest-bearing liabilities of $23.0\nmillion resulting in average checking deposits comprising a larger portion of total funding. Net interest margin for 2022 was\n2.89% versus 2.74% for 2021.\nIn 2022, we originated $656 million in mortgage loans at a weighted average rate of approximately 3.69% which\nincluded $452 million and $204 million of commercial and residential mortgages at weighted average rates of 3.66% and\n3.74%, respectively. The Bank’s commercial and industrial loan portfolio grew $18.1 million to $108 million in 2022 and\nhad a weighted average rate of 6.34%.\nThe provision for credit losses increased $4.9 million when comparing the full year periods from a credit of $2.6 million\nin 2021 to a charge of $2.3 million in 2022. The provision for 2022 was mainly due to an increase in outstanding loans,\ndeteriorating economic conditions and low net chargeoffs, partially offset by lower historical loss rates.\nTotal noninterest income remained flat from the prior year although several line items had ups and downs. BOLI and merchant\ncard services revenues increased by $618,000 and $410,000, respectively. The Bank received a final transition payment of\n$477,000 for the conversion of the Bank’s retail broker and advisory accounts. Service charges on deposit accounts increased\n$232,000. These increases were offset by a decrease in investment services income of $693,000 as the shift to an outside\nservice provider resulted in a revenue sharing agreement and less assets under management. Also, there were no net gains on\nsales of securities in 2022 down from $1.1 million in 2021.\nThe decrease in noninterest expense of $1.1 million reflected the reduction in debt extinguishment costs from 2021. The Bank\ndid have increases in noninterest expense during 2022. Salaries and benefits expense increased $1.3 million due to the hiring\nof seasoned banking professionals, competitive mid-year salary increases in 2022 and higher stock-based compensation\nexpense. The Bank had a net loss of $553,000 on the disposition of premises and fixed assets relating to the Bank’s former\nbuildings in Glen Head and costs relating to the branding initiative in the Bank’s branches of $531,000. Other items\ncontributing to increases in noninterest expense included the cost of new branch locations on the east end of Long Island, two\nbranch relocations, new corporate office space in Melville, NY, higher marketing expense and increases in other costs of\noperating the business. All increases in expenses were offset by branch optimization and back-office consolidation initiatives.\nIncome tax expense increased $1.1 million and the effective tax rate increased from 19.2% to 19.4% when comparing the full\nyear periods. The increase in the effective tax rate was mainly due to a decrease in the percentage of pre-tax income derived\nfrom tax-exempt sources. The increase in income tax expense was due to higher pre-tax earnings in 2022 as compared to the\nprior year and the higher effective tax rate.\nAsset Quality. The Bank’s reserve coverage ratio was 0.95% at December 31, 2022, compared to 0.96% at December\n31, 2021. The decrease in the reserve coverage ratio was mainly due to improvements in historical loss rates, partially offset\nby current and forecasted economic conditions. Gross loan chargeoffs and recoveries were $884,000 and $154,000,\nrespectively, for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe Bank had no nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2022, compared to $1.2 million, or 0.04% of total loans outstanding, at\nDecember 31, 2021. Modifications negotiated prior to 2022 amounted to $480,000, or 0.01% of total loans outstanding, at\nDecember 31, 2022, compared to $554,000, or 0.02%, at December 31, 2021. All such modifications were performing in\naccordance with their modified terms at December 31, 2022. Loans past due 30 through 89 days amounted to $750,000, or\n0.02% of total loans outstanding, at December 31, 2022, compared to $460,000, or 0.01%, at December 31, 2021.\n21\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported asset and liability balances and revenue and expense amounts. Our determination of the ACL is a critical accounting\nestimate because it is based on our subjective evaluation of a variety of factors at a specific point in time and involves difficult\nand complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. In the event that management’s estimate needs to be\nadjusted based on additional information that comes to light after the estimate is made or changes in circumstances, such\nadjustment could result in the need for a significantly different ACL and thereby materially impact, either positively or\nnegatively, the Bank’s results of operations.\nThe Bank’s Allowance for Credit Losses Committee (“ACL Committee”), which is a management committee chaired by the\nChief Credit Officer, meets on a quarterly basis and is responsible for determining the ACL after considering the results of\ncredit reviews performed by the Bank’s independent loan review consultants and the Bank’s credit department. In addition,\nand in consultation with the Bank’s Chief Financial Officer, the ACL Committee is responsible for implementing and\nmaintaining accounting policies and procedures surrounding the calculation of the required allowance. The Loan Committee\nreviews and approves the Bank’s loan policy at least once each calendar year. The Bank’s ACL is reviewed and ratified by\nthe Loan Committee on a quarterly basis and is subject to periodic examination by the OCC whose safety and soundness\nexamination includes a determination as to the adequacy of the allowance to absorb current expected credit losses.\nThe ACL is a valuation amount that is deducted from the loans’ amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to\nbe collected on the Bank’s loan portfolio. The allowance is established through provisions for credit losses charged against\nincome. When available information confirms that specific loans, or portions thereof, are uncollectible, these amounts are\ncharged against the ACL, and subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance.\nManagement estimates the ACL balance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to\npast events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical loss information from the Bank’s own\nloan portfolio has been compiled since December 31, 2007 and generally provides a starting point for management’s\nassessment of expected credit losses. A historical look-back period that begins in 2007 covers an entire economic cycle and\nimpacts the average historical loss rates used to calculate the final ACL. Adjustments to historical loss information are made\nfor differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix,\ndelinquency level or term as well as for current and potential future changes in economic conditions over a one year to two\nyear forecasting horizon, such as unemployment rates, GDP, vacancy rates or other relevant factors. The immediate reversion\nmethod is applied for periods beyond the forecasting horizon. The ACL is an amount that management currently believes\nwill be adequate to absorb expected lifetime losses in the Bank’s loan portfolio. The process for estimating credit losses and\ndetermining the ACL as of any balance sheet date is subjective in nature and requires material estimates and judgements.\nActual results could differ significantly from those estimates.\nThe ACL is measured on a collective (pool) basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Management segregates its loan\nportfolio into ten distinct pools: (1) commercial and industrial; (2) small business credit scored; (3) multifamily; (4) owner-\noccupied; (5) other commercial real estate; (6) construction and land development; (7) residential mortgage; (8) revolving\nhome equity; (9) consumer; and (10) municipal loans. The vintage method is applied to measure the historical loss component\nof lifetime credit losses inherent in most of its loan pools. For the revolving home equity and small business credit scored\npools, the lifetime PD/LGD (probability of default/loss given default) method is used to measure historical losses.\nManagement believes that the methods selected fairly reflect the historical loss component of expected losses inherent in the\nBank’s loan portfolio. However, since future losses could vary significantly from those experienced in the past, on a quarterly\nbasis management adjusts its historical loss experience to reflect current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.\nIn doing so, management considers a variety of Q-factors and then subjectively determines the weight to assign to each in\nestimating losses. The factors include: (1) changes in lending policies and procedures; (2) experience, ability and depth of\nlending staff; (3) trends in average loan growth and concentrations; (4) changes in the quality of the loan review function; (5)\ndelinquencies; (6) environmental risks; (7) current and forecasted economic conditions as judged by things such as\nunemployment levels and GDP; (8) changes in the value of underlying collateral as judged by things such as median home\nprices and forecasted vacancy rates in the Bank’s service area; and (9) direction and magnitude of risks in the portfolio. The\nBank’s ACL allocable to its loan pools results primarily from these Q-factor adjustments to historical loss experience with\nthe largest sensitivity of the ACL arising from loan growth, loan concentrations and economic forecasts of unemployment,\nGDP and vacancies. At December 31, 2023, the ACL was composed approximately 77% of Q-factors, 21% of historical\nlosses and 2% reserves on individually evaluated loans. Because of the nature of the Q-factors and the difficulty in assessing\ntheir impact, management’s resulting estimate of losses may not accurately reflect lifetime losses in the portfolio.\n22\nLoans that do not share similar risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. Such disparate risk characteristics\nmay include internal or external credit ratings, risk ratings, collateral type, size of loan, effective interest rate, term, geographic\nlocation, industry or historical or expected loss pattern. Estimated losses for loans individually evaluated are based on either\nthe fair value of collateral or the discounted value of expected future cash flows. For all collateral dependent loans evaluated\non an individual basis, credit losses are measured based on the fair value of the collateral. In estimating the fair value of real\nestate collateral, management utilizes appraisals or evaluations adjusted for costs to dispose and a distressed sale adjustment,\nif needed. Estimating the fair value of collateral other than real estate is also subjective in nature and sometimes requires\ndifficult and complex judgements. Determining expected future cash flows can be more subjective than determining fair\nvalues. Expected future cash flows could differ significantly, both in timing and amount, from the cash flows received over\nthe loan’s remaining life. Individually evaluated loans are not included in the estimation of credit losses from the pooled\nportfolio.\nNet Interest Income\nAverage Balance Sheet; Interest Rates and Interest Differential. The following table sets forth the average daily\nbalances for each major category of assets, liabilities and stockholders’ equity as well as the amounts and average rates earned\nor paid on each major category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The average balances of loans include\nnonaccrual loans. The average balances of investment securities exclude unrealized gains and losses on AFS securities in the\n2023 and 2022 periods and include such amounts in the 2021 period.

The changes attributable to a combined impact of volume and rate have\nbeen allocated to the changes due to volume and the changes due to rate.\n2023 Versus 2022 2022 Versus 2021\nIncrease (decrease) due to changes in: Increase (decrease) due to changes in:\nNet Net\n(in thousands) Volume Rate Change Volume Rate Change\nInterest Income:\nInterest-earning bank balances ...... $ 325 $ 1,509 $ 1,834 $ (381) $ 794 $ 413\nInvestment securities:\nTaxable ...................................... 3,550 7,484 11,034 (244) 1,464 1,220\nNontaxable .................................

Net interest income declined due to an increase in interest expense that was only partially offset by an increase\nin interest income. Year over year, the cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 186 bps while the yield on interest-earning\nassets increased 48 bps. Also contributing to the decline in net interest income was a shift in the mix of funding as average\nnoninterest-bearing deposits decreased $217.9 million while average interest-bearing liabilities increased $221.6 million as\ndepositors took advantage of interest rates not seen in over a decade.\nNet Interest Income – 2022 Versus 2021\nNet interest income on a tax-equivalent basis was $117.9 million in 2022, an increase of $8.8 million, or 8.1%, from $109.1\nmillion in 2021. The increase in net interest income reflected growth in interest income on loans of $10.1 million due to\nhigher average loans outstanding of $300.5 million, or 10.1%, to $3.3 billion in 2022, offset by $2.3 million of growth in\ninterest expense on total interest-bearing liabilities. Also contributing to the increase was a favorable shift in the mix of\nfunding as an increase in average checking deposits of $96.1 million, or 7.2%, outpaced the growth in average interest-bearing\nliabilities of $23.0 million, or 1.0%, resulting in average checking deposits comprising a larger portion of total funding.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income includes service charges on deposit accounts, gains or losses on sales of securities and other assets,\nincome on BOLI, and all other items of income, other than interest, resulting from the business activities of the Corporation.\nNoninterest income was $6.3 million in 2023 compared to $11.9 million in 2022. Excluding the net gains and losses on sales\nof securities and the disposition of premises and fixed assets, noninterest income was $9.6 million in 2023 compared to $12.4\nmillion in 2022. The primary factor reducing noninterest income for the current year was a $2.3 million decline in the net\npension credit, excluding service costs. The remaining difference was related to a payment received in 2022 for the conversion\nof the Bank’s retail broker and advisory accounts to LPL.\nTotal noninterest income in 2022 of $11.9 million decreased $0.7 million from the prior year. Investment services income\ndecreased $693,000 as the shift to an outside service provider resulted in a revenue sharing agreement and less assets under\nmanagement. The Bank had a net loss of $553,000 on the disposition of premises and fixed assets relating to the Bank’s\nformer buildings in Glen Head, NY and there were no net gains on sales of securities in 2022 down from $1.1 million in\n2021. These decreases were offset by increases in BOLI and merchant card services revenues of $618,000 and $410,000,\n24\nrespectively. Service charges on deposit accounts increased $232,000 and the Bank received a final transition payment of\n$477,000 for the conversion of the Bank’s retail broker and advisory accounts.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense is comprised of salaries and employee benefits and other personnel expense, occupancy and equipment\nexpense and other operating expenses incurred in supporting the various business activities of the Corporation.\nNoninterest expense declined $3.0 million, or 4.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to 2022. Reductions\nin salaries and employee benefits of $3.7 million primarily drove the decline as short-term incentive compensation and stock-\nbased compensation costs were substantially lower than 2022 based on the Company falling short of established performance\nmetrics for 2023. The primary offset to the lower salaries and employee benefits was a $782,000 increase in FDIC insurance\nexpense due to higher assessment rates.\nNoninterest expense was $67.0 million in 2022, compared to $68.6 million in 2021. The decrease reflects the reduction in\ndebt extinguishment costs from 2021. The Bank did have increases in noninterest expense during 2022. Salaries and benefits\nexpense increased $1.3 million due to the hiring of seasoned banking professionals, competitive mid-year salary increases in\n2022 and higher stock-based compensation expense. Other items contributing to the increase in noninterest expense include\nthe cost of new branch locations on the east end of Long Island, two branch relocations, new corporate office space in\nMelville, NY, higher marketing expense, costs relating to the branding initiative in the Bank’s branches of $531,000 and\nincreases in other costs of operating the business. All increases in expenses were offset by branch optimization and back-\noffice consolidation initiatives.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Corporation’s effective tax rate was 11.0% and 19.4% in 2023 and 2022, respectively. The effective tax rate reflects the\ntax benefits derived from the Bank’s municipal securities portfolio, ownership of BOLI and maintenance of a captive REIT.\n2023 Versus 2022. Income tax expense decreased $8.1 million due to lower pre-tax earnings in 2023 and a decrease in\nthe effective tax rate. The decrease in the effective tax rate is mainly due to an increase in the percentage of pre-tax income\nderived from the REIT and BOLI in 2023.\n2022 Versus 2021. Income tax expense increased $1.1 million due to higher pre-tax earnings in 2022 and an increase in\nthe effective tax rate. The increase in the effective tax rate was mainly due to a decrease in the percentage of pre-tax income\nderived from tax-exempt municipal securities and BOLI in 2022.\nFinancial Condition\nTotal assets were $4.2 billion at December 31, 2023, a decrease of $45.6 million, or 1.1%, from the previous year end. The\ndecrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in loans of $63.7 million, or 1.9%, partially offset by an increase in securities\nof $22.5 million, or 3.3%. Total deposits decreased $193.6 million to $3.3 billion at December 31, 2023. Total borrowings\nincreased $131.5 million, or 32.0%, due to an increase in short-term borrowings of $70.0 million and long-term debt of\n$61.5 million. Stockholders’ equity increased $15.6 million, or 4.3%, from December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily\ndue to net income of $26.2 million and an increase in the after-tax value of the Bank’s AFS investment securities of\n$6.2 million, partially offset by cash dividends declared of $18.9 million.\nInvestment Securities.

See \"Note 7 - Derivatives\" to the Corporation’s consolidated financial statements of this Form\n10-K for more information on the fair value hedge.\nAsset Quality. Information about the Corporation’s risk elements is set forth below. Risk elements include nonaccrual\nloans, other real estate owned, loans that are contractually past due 30 days or more and modifications made to borrowers\nexperiencing financial difficulty. These risk elements present more than the normal risk that the Corporation will be unable\nto eventually collect or realize their full carrying value.\nDecember 31,\n(in thousands) 2023 2022\nLoans including modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty:\nModified and performing according to their modified terms ....................................... $ 431 $ 480\nPast due 30 through 89 days ........................................................................................ 3,086 750\nPast due 90 days or more and still accruing ................................................................. — —\nNonaccrual ................................................................................................................... 1,053 —\n4,570 1,230\nOther real estate owned ................................................................................................... — —\n$ 4,570 $ 1,230\nThe past due status of a loan is based on the contractual terms in the loan agreement. Unless a loan is well secured and in the\nprocess of collection, the accrual of interest income is discontinued when a loan becomes 90 days past due as to principal or\ninterest payments. The accrual of interest income on a loan is also discontinued when it is determined that the borrower will\nnot be able to make principal and interest payments according to the contractual terms of the current loan agreement. When\nthe accrual of interest income is discontinued on a loan, any accrued but unpaid interest is reversed against current period\nincome.\n27\nLoan Risk Ratings.

The ACL decreased by $2.4 million during 2023 amounting to\n$29.0 million, or 0.89% of total loans, on December 31, 2023, compared to $31.4 million, or 0.95% of total loans, at\nDecember 31, 2022. The decrease in the reserve coverage ratio was mainly due to improvements in historical loss rates and\nother portfolio metrics, partially offset by reserves taken against two individually evaluated commercial and industrial loans.\nNonaccrual loans, modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty and loans past due 30 through 89 days remain\nat low levels.\nDuring 2023, the Bank had loan chargeoffs of $2.2 million, recoveries of $96,000 and recorded a credit provision for credit\nlosses of $326,000. The credit provision recorded in 2023 was mainly due to improvements in historical loss rates, economic\nforecasts of unemployment and GDP, and other portfolio metrics and a decrease in outstanding mortgage loans, partially\noffset by net chargeoffs and reserves for individually evaluated loans.\nDuring 2022, the Bank had loan chargeoffs of $884,000, recoveries of $154,000 and recorded a provision for credit losses\nof $2.3 million. The provision was mainly attributable to loan growth, economic conditions and net chargeoffs of $730,000,\npartially offset by improvements in historical loss rates.\nThe ACL is an amount that management currently believes will be adequate to absorb expected lifetime losses in the Bank’s\nloan portfolio. As more fully discussed in the “Application of Critical Accounting Policies” section of this document, the\nprocess for estimating credit losses and determining the ACL as of any balance sheet date is subjective in nature and requires\nmaterial estimates and judgements. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Other detailed information\non the Bank’s loan portfolio and ACL can be found in “Note C – Loans” to the Corporation’s consolidated financial\nstatements of this Form 10-K.\n28\nThe following table sets forth balances and credit ratios of the Bank’s loan portfolio.\nDecember 31,\n(dollars in thousands) 2023 2022\nTotal loans outstanding ................................................................................................... $ 3,248,064 $ 3,311,733\nAverage loans outstanding .............................................................................................. 3,260,903 3,276,589\nAllowance for credit losses ............................................................................................. 28,992 31,432\nTotal nonaccrual loans..................................................................................................... 1,053 —\nNet chargeoffs ................................................................................................................. 2,114 730\nAllowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans .............................................. 0.89% 0.95%\nNonaccrual loans as a percentage of total loans .............................................................. 0.03% —%\nNet chargeoffs as a percentage of average loans outstanding ......................................... 0.06% 0.02%\nAllowance for credit losses as a multiple of nonaccrual loans ........................................ 27.5x —\nThe following table sets forth net chargeoffs by loan type, average loans during the period and the percentage of net chargeoffs\nover average loans.\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\n% of % of\nNet Average Average Net Average Average\n(dollars in thousands) Chargeoffs Loans Loans Chargeoffs Loans Loans\nCommercial and industrial ........... $ 1,945 $ 108,453 1.79% $ 357 $ 104,883 0.34%\nSBA PPP ...................................... — — — — 7,565 —\nCommercial mortgages:\nMultifamily ............................... — 861,758 — — 922,463 —\nOther .........................................

Such conditions could affect the financial strength of the Bank’s borrowers and will affect the value\nof real estate collateral securing the Bank’s mortgage loans. Loans secured by real estate represent approximately 96% of the\nBank’s total loans outstanding at December 31, 2023. The majority of these loans are collateralized by properties located on\nLong Island and in the boroughs of NYC. While business activity in the NY metropolitan area continues to improve, inflation,\n29\nincreasing interest rates and housing legislation pose new economic challenges and may result in higher chargeoffs and\nprovisions.\nFuture provisions and chargeoffs could also be affected by environmental impairment of properties securing the Bank’s\nmortgage loans. At the present time, management is not aware of any environmental pollution originating on or near\nproperties securing the Bank’s loans that would materially affect the carrying value of such loans.\nDeposits and Other Borrowings. Total deposits were $3.3 billion at December 31, 2023, compared to $3.5 billion at\nDecember 31, 2022. Decreases in noninterest-bearing checking deposits of $191.0 million, or 14.4%, and savings, NOW and\nmoney market deposits of $115.1 million, or 6.9%, was partially offset by growth in time deposits of $112.5 million,\nor 23.5%.\nThe aggregate amount of uninsured deposits (amounts greater than or equal to $250,000, which is the maximum amount for\nfederal deposit insurance) was $1.7 billion at December 31, 2023 and $2.0 billion at December 31, 2022.\nThe following table sets forth the remaining maturity of uninsured time deposits, by account.\n(in thousands) December 31, 2023\n3 months or less ............................................................................................................................. $ 28,662\nOver 3 through 6 months ............................................................................................................... 19,605\nOver 6 through 12 months ............................................................................................................. 18,967\nOver 12 months ............................................................................................................................. 3,070\n$ 70,304\nBorrowings include short-term and long-term FHLB advances.

Short-term borrowings and long-term debt increased\n$70.0 million and $61.5 million, respectively. The increase in long-term debt includes $275.0 million new FHLB advances\npartially offset by maturities of $213.5 million.\nCapital. Stockholders’ equity totaled $380.1 million at December 31, 2023, an increase of $15.6 million from $364.5\nmillion at December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to net income of $26.2 million and an increase in the\nafter-tax value of the Bank’s AFS investment securities of $6.2 million, partially offset by cash dividends declared of $18.9\nmillion.\nThe Corporation and the Bank elected to adopt the CBLR framework in 2020. As a qualifying community banking\norganization, the Corporation and the Bank may opt out of the CBLR framework in any subsequent quarter by completing\nits regulatory agency reporting using the traditional capital rules.\nThe Corporation’s ROE was 7.14%, 12.13% and 10.34% for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively and its ROA was 0.62%, 1.11% and 1.04%, respectively. Book value per share increased 3.6% during 2023 to\n$16.83 at December 31, 2023, from $16.24 at December 31, 2022. The decrease in ROE in 2023 as compared to 2022 was\ndue to lower net income as well as a decrease in the net unrealized loss in the AFS securities portfolio. Based on the\nCorporation’s market value per share at December 31, 2023 of $13.24, the dividend yield is 6.34%.\nThe Corporation’s capital management policy is designed to build and maintain capital levels that exceed regulatory standards\nand appropriately provide for growth. The leverage ratio of the Corporation and the Bank at December 31, 2023 was 10.05%\nand 10.13%, respectively. The Corporation and the Bank elected the optional five-year transition period provided by the\nfederal banking agencies for recognizing the regulatory capital impact of the implementation of CECL.\nThe Corporation has a stock repurchase program under which it is authorized to purchase shares of its common stock from\ntime to time through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or in any other manner that is compliant with\napplicable securities laws. The stock repurchase program does not obligate the Corporation to purchase shares and there is\nno guarantee as to the exact number of shares that may be repurchased pursuant to this program, which is subject to market\nconditions, the cost of repurchasing shares, the availability of alternative investment opportunities, liquidity and other factors\ndeemed appropriate. Under this program, the Corporation has approval to repurchase another $15 million. No shares were\nrepurchased in 2023.\n30\nCash Flows and Liquidity\nCash Flows. During 2023, the Corporation’s cash and cash equivalent position decreased by $13.3 million,\nfrom $74.2 million at December 31, 2022 to $60.9 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease occurred primarily\nbecause cash used to repay deposits and borrowings, purchase securities, originate loans and pay cash dividends exceeded\ncash provided by sales, paydowns or repayments of securities and loans, deposit inflows, proceeds from long-term debt and\noperations.\nLiquidity. The Bank has a board committee-approved liquidity policy and liquidity contingency plan, which are intended\nto ensure that the Bank has sufficient liquidity to meet the ongoing needs of its customers in terms of credit and deposit\noutflows, take advantage of earnings enhancement opportunities and respond to liquidity stress conditions should they arise.\nBased on securities and loan collateral in place at the FRBNY and FHLBNY, the Bank had borrowing capacity of\napproximately $1.5 billion at December 31, 2023, which includes $386.1 million of unencumbered AFS securities. The\nBank’s borrowing capacity may be adjusted by the FRBNY or the FHLBNY and may take into account factors such as the\nBank’s tangible common equity ratio, collateral margins required by the lender or other factors. A possible future downgrade\nof securities and loans pledged as collateral could also impact the amount of available funding.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations. Commitments to extend credit and letters of credit arise\nin the normal course of the Bank’s business of meeting the financing needs of its customers and involve, to varying degrees,\nelements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. Since some of the commitments\nto extend credit and letters of credit are expected to expire without being drawn upon and, with respect to unused home equity,\nsmall business and certain other lines, can be frozen, reduced or terminated by the Bank based on the financial condition of\nthe borrower, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.\nThe Bank's exposure to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the other party to financial instruments for\ncommitments to extend credit and letters of credit is represented by the contractual notional amount of these instruments. The\nBank uses the same credit policies in making commitments to extend credit, and generally uses the same credit policies for\nletters of credit, as it does for on-balance sheet instruments such as loans.\nThe Corporation believes that its current sources of liquidity are sufficient to fulfill the obligations it has at December 31,\n2023 pursuant to off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations.\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe Bank invests in interest-earning assets, which are funded by interest-bearing deposits and borrowings, noninterest-\nbearing deposits and capital. The Bank’s results of operations are subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations\ngenerally and having assets and liabilities that have different maturity, repricing, and prepayment/withdrawal characteristics.\nThe Bank defines interest rate risk as the risk that the Bank's net interest income and/or EVE will change when interest rates\nchange. The principal objective of the Bank’s asset liability management activities is to optimize current and future net\ninterest income while at the same time maintain acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk and facilitate the funding\nneeds of the Bank.\nThe Bank monitors and manages interest rate risk through a variety of techniques including traditional gap analysis and the\nuse of interest-rate sensitivity models. Both gap analysis and interest rate sensitivity modeling involve a variety of significant\nestimates and assumptions and are done at a specific point in time. Changes in the estimates and assumptions made in gap\nanalysis and interest rate sensitivity modeling could have a significant impact on projected results and conclusions. Therefore,\nthese techniques may not accurately reflect the actual impact of changes in the interest rate environment on the Bank’s net\ninterest income or EVE.\nThrough the use of interest rate sensitivity modeling, the Bank projects net interest income over a five-year time period\nassuming a static balance sheet and no changes in interest rates from current levels. Utilization of a static balance sheet\nensures that interest rate risk embedded in the Bank’s current balance sheet is not masked by assumed balance sheet growth\nor contraction. Net interest income is projected over a five-year time period utilizing various interest rate change scenarios,\nincluding both ramped and shocked changes as well as changes in the shape of the yield curve. The interest rate scenarios\nmodeled are based on the shape of the current yield curve and the relative level of rates and management’s expectations as to\npotential future yield curve shapes and rate levels.\nThe Bank also uses interest rate sensitivity modeling to calculate EVE in the current rate environment assuming shock\nincreases and decreases in interest rates. EVE is the difference between the present value of expected future cash flows from\n31\nthe Bank’s assets and the present value of the expected future cash flows from the Bank’s liabilities. Present values are\ndetermined using discount rates that management believes are reflective of current market conditions. EVE can capture long-\nterm interest rate risk that would not be captured in a five-year projection of net interest income.\nIn utilizing interest rate sensitivity modeling to project net interest income and calculate EVE, management makes a variety\nof estimates and assumptions which include the following: (1) how much and when yields and costs on individual categories\nof interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities will change in response to projected changes in market interest rates;\n(2) future cash flows, including prepayments of mortgage assets and calls of municipal securities; (3) cash flow reinvestment\nassumptions; (4) appropriate discount rates to be applied to loan, deposit and borrowing cash flows; and (5) decay or runoff\nrates for nonmaturity deposits such as checking, savings, NOW and money market accounts. The repricing of loans and\nborrowings and the reinvestment of loan and security cash flows are generally assumed to be impacted by the full amount of\neach assumed rate change, while the repricing of nonmaturity deposits is not. For nonmaturity deposits, management makes\nestimates of how much and when it will need to change the rates paid on the Bank’s various nonmaturity deposit products in\nresponse to changes in general market interest rates. These estimates are based on product type, management’s experience\nwith needed deposit rate adjustments in prior interest rate change cycles, the results of a nonmaturity deposit study conducted\nby an independent consultant and updated on a periodic basis and management’s assessment of competitive conditions in its\nmarketplace.\nThe information provided in the following table is based on a variety of estimates and assumptions that management believes\nto be reasonable, the more significant of which are set forth hereinafter. The base case information in the table shows: (1) a\ncalculation of the Corporation’s EVE at December 31, 2023 arrived at by discounting estimated future cash flows at rates\nthat management believes are reflective of current market conditions; and (2) an estimate of net interest income for the year\nending December 31, 2024 assuming a static balance sheet, the adjustment of repricing balances to current rate levels, and\nthe reinvestment at current rate levels of cash flows from maturing assets and liabilities in a mix of assets and liabilities that\nis intended to reflect a static balance sheet. In addition, in calculating EVE, cash flows for nonmaturity deposits are assumed\nto have an overall life of 6.2 years based on the current mix of such deposits and the most recently updated nonmaturity\ndeposit study.\nThe rate change information in the following table shows estimates of net interest income for the year ending\nDecember 31, 2024 and calculations of EVE at December 31, 2023 assuming rate changes of plus and minus 100, 200 and\n300 bps. The rate change scenarios were selected based on the relative level of current interest rates and: (1) are assumed to\nbe shock or immediate changes for both EVE and net interest income; (2) occur uniformly across the yield curve regardless\nof the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities; and (3) impact the repricing and reinvestment of all\nassets and liabilities, except nonmaturity deposits, by the full amount of the rate change. In projecting future net interest\nincome under the indicated rate change scenarios, activity is simulated by assuming that cash flows from maturing assets and\nliabilities are reinvested in a mix of assets and liabilities that is intended to reflect a static balance sheet. The changes in EVE\nfrom the base case have not been tax affected.\nEconomic Value of Equity Net Interest Income for\nat December 31, 2023 2024\nPercent Percent\nChange Change\nFrom From\nRate Change Scenario (dollars in thousands) Amount Base Case Amount Base Case\n+ 300 basis point rate shock .................................... $ 333,169 -31.2% $ 57,283 -23.2%\n+ 200 basis point rate shock .................................... 380,224 -21.5% 62,966 -15.6%\n+ 100 basis point rate shock .................................... 435,902 -10.0% 69,099 -7.4%\nBase case (no rate change) ................................... 484,094 — 74,632 —\n- 100 basis point rate shock ..................................... 525,465 8.5% 79,690 6.8%\n- 200 basis point rate shock ..................................... 547,540 13.1% 83,398 11.7%\n- 300 basis point rate shock ..................................... 554,726 14.6% 86,104 15.4%\nAs shown in the preceding table, assuming a static balance sheet, an immediate increase in interest rates of 100, 200 or 300\nbps could negatively impact the Bank’s net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2024 because the Bank might\nneed to increase the rates paid on its nonmaturity deposits to remain competitive and any time deposits or borrowings that\nmature would reprice at a higher interest rate. In addition, the Bank’s securities portfolio, excluding corporate bonds and SBA\nagency obligations, and a large portion of its loan portfolio do not immediately reprice with changes in market rates. At\nDecember 31, 2023, approximately $853 million of the Bank's loans and securities, or 21% of total assets, reprice or mature\nwithin one year. An immediate decrease in interest rates of 100, 200 or 300 bps could positively impact the Bank’s net interest\n32\nincome for the same time period because the Bank would pay less for time deposits or borrowings that mature and reprice at\na lower interest rate and would be able to reduce non-maturity deposit rates while the downward repricing of its assets would\nlag. The positive impact on net interest income of an immediate decrease in interest rates is somewhat constrained because\nthe decrease is assumed to occur uniformly across the inverted yield curve. Changes in management’s estimates as to the\nrates that will need to be paid on nonmaturity deposits could have a material impact on the net interest income amounts shown\nfor each scenario in the table. The negative impact of rising interest rates on net interest income in 2024 could be more\nsignificant than the amounts shown in the table.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents incorporated into it by reference contain or may contain various\nforward-looking statements.

(“REIT”). The Corporation’s financial condition and\noperating results principally reflect those of the Bank and its subsidiaries. The consolidated entity is referred to as the\n“Corporation,” and the Bank and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the “Bank.” All intercompany balances have\nbeen eliminated.\nThe accounting and reporting policies of the Corporation reflect banking industry practice and conform to generally accepted\naccounting principles (“GAAP”) in the United States. The following is a summary of the Corporation’s significant accounting\npolicies.\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management is required to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported asset and liability balances, revenue and expense amounts, and the disclosures provided,\nincluding disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, based on available information. Actual results could differ\nsignificantly from those estimates. Information available which could affect these judgements include, but are not limited to,\nchanges in interest rates, changes in the performance of the economy and changes in the financial condition of borrowers.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include cash and deposits with other financial institutions that generally mature within 90 days.\nNet cash flows are reported for customer loan and deposit transactions.\nInvestment Securities\nCurrent accounting standards require that investment securities be classified as held-to-maturity (“HTM”), available-for-sale\n(“AFS”) or trading. The trading category is not applicable to any securities in the Bank's portfolio because the Bank does not\nbuy or hold debt or equity securities principally for the purpose of selling in the near term. HTM securities, or debt securities\nwhich the Bank has the intent and ability to hold to maturity, are reported at amortized cost, net of allowance for credit losses\n(“ACL” or “allowance”), if any. AFS securities, or debt securities which are neither HTM securities nor trading securities,\nare reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of the related income tax effect, included in other\ncomprehensive income (loss) (“OCI”). Equity securities, if any, are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value reported\nin net income. Equity securities without readily determinable fair values are carried at cost, minus impairment, if any, plus\nor minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment.\nInterest income includes amortization or accretion of purchase premium or discount. Premiums and discounts on securities\nare amortized or accreted using the level-yield method. Prepayments are anticipated for mortgage-backed securities.\nPremiums on municipal securities are amortized to the earlier of the stated maturity date or the first call date, while discounts\non municipal securities are accreted to the stated maturity date. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are\ndetermined using the specific identification method.\nManagement measures expected credit losses on HTM debt securities, if any, on a collective basis by major security type.\nAccrued interest receivable on HTM debt securities is excluded from the estimate of credit losses.\nFor AFS securities in an unrealized loss position, management first evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resulted\nfrom an actual or estimated credit loss event. Management considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost,\nchanges to the rating of the security, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security. If this assessment indicates\nthat a credit loss is likely, management then assesses whether it has the intent to sell the security or more likely than not will\nbe required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost and determines the present value of cash flows expected\nto be collected from the security as compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of the cash flows\nexpected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, an allowance is recorded for the estimated credit loss, limited\nby the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an\nallowance is recognized in OCI. Accrued interest receivable on AFS securities is excluded from the estimate of credit losses.\n39\nLoans Held-for-Sale\nLoans held-for-sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value. Any subsequent declines in fair value below the initial\ncarrying value are recorded as a valuation allowance established through a charge to noninterest income.\nLoans and Allowance for Credit Losses\nLoans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are reported at\namortized cost, net of the ACL. Amortized cost is the principal balance outstanding plus or minus net deferred loan costs and\nfees. Accrued interest receivable is reported in “Other assets” on the consolidated balance sheets and is excluded from the\nestimate of credit losses. Interest on loans is credited to income based on the principal amount outstanding. Direct loan\norigination costs, net of loan origination fees, are deferred and recognized in interest income using the level-yield method\nwithout anticipating prepayments.\nThe past due status of a loan is based on the contractual terms in the loan agreement. Unless a loan is well secured and in the\nprocess of collection, the accrual of interest income is discontinued when a loan becomes 90 days past due as to principal or\ninterest payments. The accrual of interest income on a loan is also discontinued when it is determined that the borrower will\nnot be able to make principal and interest payments according to the contractual terms of the current loan agreement. When\nthe accrual of interest income is discontinued on a loan, any accrued but unpaid interest is reversed against current period\nincome. Interest received on nonaccrual loans is applied to the outstanding principal balance until the loans qualify for return\nto an accrual status, if ever. Return to an accrual status occurs when all the principal and interest amounts contractually past\ndue are brought current and all future payments are reasonably assured.\nThe ACL is a valuation account that is deducted from the loans’ amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to\nbe collected on the Bank’s loan portfolio. The ACL is established through provisions for credit losses charged against income.\nWhen available information confirms that specific loans, or portions thereof, are uncollectible, these amounts are charged\nagainst the ACL, and subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the ACL.\nManagement identifies loans in the Bank’s portfolio that must be individually evaluated for loss due to disparate risk\ncharacteristics. For loans individually evaluated, an allowance is estimated based on either the fair value of collateral or the\ndiscounted value of expected future cash flows. In estimating the fair value of real estate collateral, management utilizes\nappraisals or evaluations adjusted for costs to dispose and a distressed sale adjustment, if needed. Estimating the fair value\nof collateral other than real estate is also subjective in nature and sometimes requires difficult and complex judgements.\nDetermining expected future cash flows can be more subjective than determining fair values. Expected future cash flows\ncould differ significantly, both in timing and amount, from the cash flows actually received over the loan’s remaining life.\nIndividually evaluated loans are excluded from the estimation of credit losses for the pooled portfolio.\nFor loans collectively evaluated for credit loss, management segregates its loan portfolio into distinct pools, certain of which\nare combined in reporting loans outstanding by class of loans: (1) commercial and industrial; (2) small business credit scored;\n(3) multifamily; (4) owner-occupied; (5) other commercial real estate; (6) construction and land development; (7) closed end\nresidential mortgage; (8) revolving home equity; (9) consumer; and (10) municipal loans. Historical loss information from\nthe Bank’s own loan portfolio from December 31, 2007 to present provides a basis for management’s assessment of expected\ncredit losses. The choice of a historical look-back period that begins in 2007 covers an entire economic cycle and impacts the\naverage historical loss rates used to calculate the final ACL. Due to the extensive loss data available, management selected\nthe vintage approach to measure the historical loss component of credit losses for most of its loan pools. For the revolving\nhome equity and small business credit scored pools, the lifetime PD/LGD (probability of default/loss given default) method\nis used to measure historical losses.\nModifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty are included in loans collectively evaluated for credit loss. An\nassessment of whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty is made on the date of a modification. A charge to the\nallowance for credit losses is generally not recorded upon modification.\nManagement believes that the methods selected fairly reflect the historical loss component of expected losses inherent in the\nBank’s loan portfolio. However, since future losses could vary significantly from those experienced in the past, on a quarterly\nbasis management adjusts its historical loss experience to reflect current and forecasted conditions. In doing so, management\nconsiders a variety of general qualitative and quantitative factors (“Q-factors”) and then subjectively determines the weight\nto assign to each in estimating losses. Qualitative characteristics include differences in underwriting standards, policies,\nlending staff and environmental risks. Management also considers whether further adjustments to historical loss information\nare needed to reflect the extent to which current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts over a one year to two\nyear forecasting horizon differ from the conditions that existed during the historical loss period. These quantitative\n40\nadjustments reflect changes to relevant data such as changes in unemployment rates, gross domestic product (“GDP”),\nvacancies, average growth in pools of loans, delinquencies or other factors associated with the financial assets. The immediate\nreversion method is applied for periods beyond the forecasting horizon. The Bank’s ACL allocable to pools of loans that are\ncollectively evaluated for credit loss results primarily from these qualitative and quantitative adjustments to historical loss\nexperience. Because of the nature of the Q-factors and the degree of judgement involved in assessing their impact,\nmanagement’s resulting estimate of losses may not accurately reflect current and future losses in the portfolio.\nThe ACL is an amount that management currently believes will be adequate to absorb current expected credit losses in the\nBank’s loan portfolio. The process for estimating credit losses and determining the ACL as of any balance sheet date is\nsubjective in nature and requires material estimates. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.\nTransfers of Financial Assets\nTransfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when control over the assets has been relinquished. Control over\ntransferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when the assets have been isolated from the Corporation, the transferee obtains\nthe right (free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right) to pledge or exchange the transferred assets,\nand the Corporation does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through an agreement to repurchase them\nbefore their maturity.\nBank Premises and Equipment and Operating Leases\nLand is carried at cost. Other bank premises and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.\nBuildings are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from 31 to 40 years.\nBuilding and leasehold improvements are depreciated using the straight-line method over the remaining lives of the buildings\nor leases, as applicable, or their estimated useful lives, whichever is shorter. The lives of the respective leases range from five\nyears to fifteen years. Furniture, fixtures and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated\nuseful lives, which range from three years to ten years. Premises and equipment held-for-sale, if any, is included in “other\nassets” on the Corporation’s consolidated balance sheets and carried at the lower of cost or fair value. Writedowns upon\ntransfer to held-for-sale are included in “other noninterest expense” on the consolidated income statements. Fair value is\nbased on an appraisal, where available, adjusted for estimated costs to sell.\nThe Bank determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception and recognizes a right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and lease liability\nat the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of the Bank’s leases do\nnot provide an implicit interest rate, the Bank uses its incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of the lease\npayments. Leases with an initial lease term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. The\nBank’s ROU asset and lease liability may include options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Bank will\nexercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nBank-owned Life Insurance\nThe Bank is the owner and beneficiary of insurance policies on the lives of certain current and past employed officers. Bank-\nowned life insurance (“BOLI”) is recorded at the amount that can be realized under the contract at the balance sheet date,\nwhich is the cash surrender value adjusted for other charges or amounts due that are probable at settlement, if any.\nRestricted Stock\nThe Bank is a member of and is required to own stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of NY (“FHLBNY”) and the Federal\nReserve Bank of NY (“FRBNY”). The amount of FHLBNY stock held is based on membership and the level of FHLBNY\nadvances. The amount of FRBNY stock held is based on the Bank’s capital and surplus balances. These stocks do not have a\nreadily determinable fair value, are carried at cost, classified as restricted stock and periodically evaluated for impairment\nbased on the prospects for the ultimate recovery of cost. Cash dividends, if any, are reported as interest income on taxable\ninvestment securities.\nOther Real Estate Owned\nReal estate acquired through foreclosure or by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure is initially recorded at the lower of cost or fair\nvalue, less estimated selling costs and is included in “other assets” on the consolidated balance sheets. Chargeoffs recorded\nat the time of acquisition are charged to the ACL. Subsequently, decreases in the property’s estimated fair value are charged\nto earnings and credited to a valuation allowance and recoveries in fair value are credited to earnings and charged to the\nvaluation allowance. Such adjustments to earnings are included in other noninterest expense along with any additional\n41\nproperty maintenance costs incurred in owning the property. Rental income received from tenants of other real estate owned\nis included in other noninterest income.\nLong-term Assets\nPremises and equipment, intangible assets, BOLI and other long-term assets, if any, are reviewed for impairment when events\nindicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable from future undiscounted cash flows. If impaired, the assets are\nrecorded at fair value.\nLoan Commitments and Related Financial Instruments\nFinancial instruments include off-balance sheet credit instruments, such as commitments to make loans, commercial letters\nof credit and standby letters of credit. The face amount of these items represents the exposure to loss, before considering\ncollateral held or ability to repay. The Bank estimates credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures by considering the\nlikelihood of an outstanding commitment converting into an outstanding loan and applying an estimate of expected lifetime\ncredit losses used on similar portfolio segments, unless the obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Bank. The ACL\non off-balance sheet credit exposures is recorded in the line item “Accrued expenses and other liabilities” in the consolidated\nbalance sheets and totaled $590,000 and $421,000, respectively, at December 31, 2023 and 2022. The ACL is adjusted\nthrough a provision (credit) for credit loss expense which is included in the line item “other noninterest expense” in the\nconsolidated statements of income and amounted to $169,000, ($71,000) and $82,000 in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nOff-balance sheet credit instruments are recorded on the balance sheet when they are funded or drawn down.\nDerivatives\nAt the inception of a derivative contract, the Corporation designates the derivative as one of three types based on the\nCorporation's intentions and belief as to likely effectiveness as a hedge. These three types are (1) a hedge of the fair value of\na recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment (\"fair value hedge\"), (2) a hedge of a forecasted\ntransaction or the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (\"cash flow hedge\"),\nor (3) an instrument with no hedging designation (\"non-designated derivative\"). For a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on\nthe derivative, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item is attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in\ncurrent earnings as fair values change. For a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in OCI and is\nreclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The changes in the fair\nvalue of a derivative that is not designated is recorded currently in earnings, as noninterest income.\nNet cash settlements on derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting are recorded in interest income or interest expense,\nbased on the item being hedged. Net cash settlements on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are reported in\nnoninterest income or noninterest expense. Cash flows from hedges are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows\nin the same manner as the items being hedged.\nThe Corporation formally documents the relationship between derivatives and hedged items, as well as the risk management\nobjective and the strategy for undertaking hedge transactions at the inception of the hedging relationship. This documentation\nincludes linking cash flow hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or\nforecasted transactions. The Corporation also formally assesses, both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing basis,\nwhether the derivative instruments that are used are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item.\nThe Corporation discontinues hedge accounting when it determines that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting\nchanges in cash flows of the hedged item, the derivative is settled or terminated, a hedged forecasted transaction is no longer\nprobable, a hedged firm commitment is no longer firm or treatment of the derivative as a hedge is no longer appropriate or\nintended.\nWhen hedge accounting is discontinued, subsequent changes in fair value of the derivative are recorded as interest expense.\nWhen a cash flow hedge is discontinued but the hedged cash flows or forecasted transactions are still expected to occur, gains\nor losses that were accumulated in OCI are amortized into earnings over the same periods which the hedged transactions will\naffect earnings.\nIncome Taxes\nA current tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year.\nA deferred tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and\ncarryforwards. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by the amount of any tax benefits that, based\non available evidence, are not expected to be realized. The measurement of current and deferred tax liabilities and assets is\n42\nbased on provisions of the enacted tax law. The effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not considered. The\nCorporation recognizes interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in noninterest income or noninterest expense\nas appropriate.\nRetirement Plans\nPension expense is the sum of service cost, interest cost, amortization of actuarial gains and losses and plan expenses, net of\nthe expected return on plan assets and participant contributions. The service cost component of pension expense is included\nin salaries and employee benefits on the consolidated statements of income. All other components of pension expense are\nincluded in other noninterest income. Employee 401(k) plan expense is equal to the amount of the Corporation’s matching\ncontributions and is included in salaries and employee benefits in the consolidated statements of income.\nLoss Contingencies\nLoss contingencies, including claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business, are recorded as liabilities\nwhen the likelihood of loss is probable and an amount or range of loss can be reasonably estimated.\nOperating Segments\nWhile management monitors the revenue streams of the Bank’s various products and services, the identifiable segments are\nnot material and operations are managed and financial performance is evaluated on a company-wide basis. Accordingly, all\nof the financial operations of the Bank are aggregated in one reportable operating segment.\nInvestment Services\nAssets held in a fiduciary capacity are not assets of the Corporation and, accordingly, are not included in the accompanying\nconsolidated financial statements. The Bank records investment services fees on the accrual basis.\nReclassifications\nWhen appropriate, items in the prior year financial statements are reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.\nEarnings Per Share\nThe Corporation calculates basic and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) using the treasury stock method. Basic EPS excludes\nthe dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and is computed by dividing net income by the weighted\naverage number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if\noutstanding RSUs were converted into shares of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the Corporation. Diluted\nEPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive RSUs. There were\n101,480 and 33,017 RSUs excluded from the calculation of EPS at December 31, 2023 and 2022, because their inclusion\nwould be anti-dilutive. There were no anti-dilutive RSUs at December 31, 2021. Other than the RSUs described in “Note I –\nStock-Based Compensation,” the Corporation has no securities that could be converted into common stock nor does the\nCorporation have any contracts that could result in the issuance of common stock.\nStock-based Compensation\nThe Corporation’s stock-based compensation plans are described in “Note I – Stock-Based Compensation.” Compensation\ncost is determined for RSUs issued to employees and non-employee directors based on the grant date fair value of the award.\nCompensation expense for RSUs is recognized over the applicable performance or service period, which is usually the vesting\nperiod. Compensation expense is adjusted at the end of the performance period, if applicable, to reflect the actual number of\nshares of the Corporation’s common stock into which the RSUs will be converted. The Corporation accounts for forfeitures\nas they occur.\nComprehensive Income\nComprehensive income (loss) includes net income and OCI. OCI includes revenues, expenses, gains and losses that under\nGAAP are included in comprehensive income but excluded from net income. OCI for the Corporation consists of net\nunrealized holding gains or losses on AFS securities and derivative instruments and changes in the funded status of the Bank’s\n43\ndefined benefit pension plan, all net of related income taxes. Accumulated OCI is recognized as a separate component of\nstockholders’ equity.\nThe following sets forth the components of accumulated OCI, net of tax:\nCurrent\nBalance Period Balance\n(in thousands) 12/31/2022 Change 12/31/2023\nUnrealized holding loss on available-for-sale securities .................... $ (56,055 ) $ 6,246 $ (49,809)\nUnrealized actuarial loss on pension plan ..........................................

The\nunrealized loss is attributable to changes in interest rates and illiquidity and not credit quality. The issuers continue to make\ntimely principal and interest payments on the bonds. The Bank has the ability to hold these securities and it is likely that it\nwill not be required to sell the securities before their anticipated recovery. The fair value is expected to recover as the bonds\napproach maturity.\nPass-through Mortgage Securities\nAt December 31, 2023, pass-through mortgage securities of approximately $136.9 million had an unrealized loss of\n$27.1 million. These securities were issued by U.S. government and government-sponsored agencies and are considered high\ninvestment grade. The unrealized loss is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality. The issuers continue\nto make timely principal and interest payments on the bonds. The Bank has the ability to hold these securities and it is likely\nthat it will not be required to sell the securities before their anticipated recovery. The fair value is expected to recover as the\nbonds approach maturity.\nCollateralized Mortgage Obligations\nAt December 31, 2023, collateralized mortgage obligations of approximately $102.5 million had an unrealized loss of $21.1\nmillion. These securities were issued by U.S. government and government-sponsored agencies and are considered high\ninvestment grade. The unrealized loss is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality. The issuers continue\nto make timely principal and interest payments on the bonds. The Bank has the ability to hold these securities and it is likely\nthat it will not be required to sell the securities before their anticipated recovery. The fair value is expected to recover as the\nbonds approach maturity.\nSBA Agency Obligations\nAt December 31, 2023, SBA agency obligations of approximately $98.9 million had an unrealized loss of $1.1 million. These\nsecurities were issued by the SBA, a U.S. government agency and are considered high investment grade. The unrealized loss\nis attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality. The issuer continues to make timely principal and interest\npayments on the bonds. The Bank has the ability to hold these securities and it is likely that it will not be required to sell the\nsecurities before their anticipated recovery. The fair value is expected to recover as the bonds approach maturity.\nCorporate Bonds\nAt December 31, 2023, approximately $105.9 million of corporate bonds had an unrealized loss of $13.1 million. The\ncorporate bonds represent senior unsecured debt obligations of six of the largest U.S. based financial institutions, including\nJPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo. Each of the corporate\nbonds has a stated maturity of ten years and matures in 2028. The bonds reprice quarterly based on the ten year constant\nmaturity swap rate.\nEach of the financial institutions is considered medium investment grade and rated A3 or higher. The unrealized loss is\nattributable to changes in credit spreads and interest rates and the illiquid nature of the securities. The Bank does not have the\n46\nintent to sell these securities and it is likely that it will not be required to sell the securities before their anticipated recovery.\nEach of these financial institutions has diversified revenue streams, is well capitalized and continues to make timely interest\npayments. Management evaluates the quarterly financial statements of each company to determine if full payment of principal\nand interest is in doubt and does not believe there is any impairment at December 31, 2023.\nSales of AFS Securities.

At December 31, 2023, loans outstanding to executive officers and directors,\nincluding their immediate families and companies in which they are principal owners totaled $1.6 million. There were no\nsuch loans outstanding at December 31, 2022.\nLoan Modifications. From time to time, the Bank may modify the terms of loans to borrowers experiencing financial\ndifficulty in the form of principal forgiveness, an interest reduction, an other-than-insignificant payment delay or a term\nextension. In order to determine whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, an evaluation is performed of the\nprobability that the borrower will be in payment default on any of its debt in the foreseeable future without the modification.\nThe Bank performs the evaluation under its internal underwriting policy.\nThe Bank did not modify any loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty during 2023, 2022 or 2021.\nThere were no modifications for which there was a payment default during 2023, 2022 and 2021 that were modified during\nthe 12 month period prior to default. A loan is considered to be in payment default once it is 90 days contractually past due\nunder the modified terms.\n49\nRisk Characteristics. Credit risk within the Bank’s loan portfolio primarily stems from factors such as changes in the\nborrower’s financial condition, credit concentrations, changes in collateral values, economic conditions, rent regulation and\nenvironmental contamination of properties securing mortgage loans. The Bank’s commercial loans, including those secured\nby real estate mortgages, are primarily made to small and medium-sized businesses. Such loans sometimes involve a higher\ndegree of risk than those to larger companies because such businesses may have shorter operating histories, higher debt-to-\nequity ratios and may lack sophistication in internal record keeping and financial and operational controls. In addition, most\nof the Bank’s loans are made to businesses and consumers on Long Island and in the boroughs of New York City (“NYC”),\nand a large percentage of these loans are mortgage loans secured by properties located in those areas. The primary sources of\nrepayment for residential and commercial mortgage loans include employment and other income of the borrowers, the\nbusinesses of the borrowers and cash flows from the underlying properties. In the case of multifamily mortgage loans, a\nsubstantial portion of the underlying properties are rent stabilized or rent controlled. These sources of repayment are\ndependent on the strength of the local economy.\nCredit Quality Indicators. The Bank categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the\nborrower’s ability to service their debt including, but not limited to, current financial information for the borrower and any\nguarantors, payment experience, credit underwriting documentation, public records, due diligence checks and current\neconomic trends. Management analyzes loans individually and classifies them using risk rating matrices consistent with\nregulatory guidance as follows.\nWatch: The borrower’s cash flow has a high degree of variability and subject to economic downturns. Liquidity is strained\nand the ability of the borrower to access traditional sources of credit is diminished.\nSpecial Mention: The borrower has potential weaknesses that deserve management’s close attention. If left uncorrected,\nthese potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or in the Bank’s credit position\nat some future date. Special mention assets are not adversely classified and do not expose the Bank to risk sufficient to warrant\nadverse classification.\nSubstandard: Loans are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or the\ncollateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of\nthe debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not\ncorrected.\nDoubtful: Loans have all the inherent weaknesses of those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the\nweaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, based on existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and\nimprobable.\nRisk ratings on commercial and industrial loans and commercial mortgages are initially assigned during the underwriting\nprocess and affirmed as part of the approval process. The ratings are periodically reviewed and evaluated based on borrower\ncontact, credit department review or independent loan review.\nThe Bank's loan risk rating and review policy establishes requirements for the annual review of commercial real estate and\ncommercial and industrial loans. The requirements include details of the scope of coverage and selection process based on\nloan-type and risk rating. The Bank reviews at least 80% of its commercial real estate loan portfolio on an annual basis. Lines\nof credit are also reviewed annually at each proposed reaffirmation. The frequency of the review of other loans is determined\nby minimum principal balance thresholds and the Bank’s ongoing assessments of the borrower’s condition.\nResidential mortgage loans, revolving home equity lines and other consumer loans are initially evaluated utilizing the\nborrower’s credit score. A credit score is a tool used in the Bank’s loan approval process, and a minimum score of 680 is\ngenerally required for new loans. Credit scores for each borrower are updated at least annually. However, regardless of credit\nscore, loans may be classified, criticized or placed on management’s watch list if relevant information comes to light.\n50\nThe following tables present the amortized cost basis of loans by class of loans, vintage and risk rating.

(49,902 ) (48,042 )\n$ 31,414 $ 31,660\n52\nIn 2022, the Bank incurred a net loss of $553,000 on the disposition of certain premises and fixed assets. The net loss includes\na gain on sale of five Glen Head, NY buildings, a writedown and transfer to held-for-sale of a remaining building in Glen\nHead and a write-off of all related equipment and fixed assets including a nearby freestanding ATM location. In 2023,\nthe Bank sold the remaining Glen Head building held-for-sale and realized a net gain of $240,000.\nLand and buildings held-for-sale at December 31, 2023 and 2022 amounted to $383,000 and $2.4 million, respectively.\nOperating Leases. The Bank leases certain branch and back-office locations under long-term, non-cancelable operating\nlease agreements. The leases expire at various dates through 2038 and had a weighted average remaining term of 11.15 and\n11.79 years at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Many of the Bank’s leases include renewal options of up to 10\nyears with the longest option extending to 25 years. The exercise of lease renewal options is at the Bank’s sole discretion.\nThe weighted average discount rate for leases in place at December 31, 2023 and 2022 was 3.29% and 3.24%, respectively.\nLeases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. The Bank had one such lease in 2023\nand 2022 and recognized rent expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. There were no short-term\nleases in 2021.\nThe Bank’s branch optimization strategy resulted in charges of $905,000 in 2022 and $3.1 million in 2021 related to the\nclosing or relocation of leased branch office space. The charges include rent and depreciation expenses, lease acceleration\ncosts and asset disposal charges. These charges are included in the consolidated statements of income in “occupancy and\nequipment expense” and, in 2022, partially included in “loss on disposition of premises and fixed assets.”\nRental payments required by the Bank’s lease agreements may increase over time based on certain variable components such\nas real estate taxes and common area maintenance charges.\nThe components of rent expense were as follows:\nDecember 31,\n(in thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nOperating lease cost ........................................................................... $ 3,480 $ 3,271 $ 4,462\nVariable lease cost .............................................................................. 463 490 405\nShort-term lease cost .......................................................................... 78 10 —\n$ 4,021 $ 3,771 $ 4,867\nThe following is a maturity analysis of the operating lease liability at December 31, 2023.\nYear (dollars in thousands) Total\n2024 ....................................................................................................................................................... $ 3,522\n2025 ....................................................................................................................................................... 3,379\n2026 ....................................................................................................................................................... 3,097\n2027 ....................................................................................................................................................... 2,750\n2028 ....................................................................................................................................................... 1,879\nThereafter .............................................................................................................................................. 15,422\nTotal lease payments .......................................................................................................................... 30,049\nLess: interest ...................................................................................................................................... 5,109\n$ 24,940\nNOTE E – DEPOSITS\nThe following table sets forth the remaining maturities of the Bank’s time deposits at December 31, 2023.\nYear (dollars in thousands) Total\n2024 ................................................................................................................................................... $ 528,784\n2025 ................................................................................................................................................... 15,455\n2026 ................................................................................................................................................... 11,194\n2027 ................................................................................................................................................... 18,209\n2028 ................................................................................................................................................... 16,218\nThereafter .......................................................................................................................................... 1,573\n$ 591,433\n53\nTime deposits that meet or exceed the FDIC insurance limit of $250,000 totaled $70.3 million and $104.7 million at\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

The\nCorporation did not incur any amounts for interest and penalties due taxing authorities for calendar years 2023, 2022 or\n2021. The tax years 2021 through 2023 remain open to examination by the Internal Revenue Service, NYS, NYC, New Jersey\nand Connecticut.\nNOTE H – REGULATORY MATTERS\nMinimum Regulatory Capital Requirements. The Corporation and the Bank are subject to the Basel III regulatory capital\nrequirements administered by federal banking agencies. Capital adequacy guidelines and, additionally for banks, prompt\ncorrective action (“PCA”) regulations, involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items\ncalculated under regulatory accounting practices. Failure to meet the minimum capital requirements can result in certain\n55\nmandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material\neffect on the financial statements of the Corporation and Bank. The most recent regulatory notifications categorized the Bank\nas well capitalized under the PCA provisions and there are no conditions or events since that notification that management\nbelieves have changed that category.\nIn accordance with the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, the federal banking agencies\nadopted, effective January 1, 2020, a final rule whereby financial institutions and financial institution holding companies that\nhave less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets and meet other qualifying criteria, including a leverage ratio of greater\nthan 9% (“qualifying community banking organizations”), are eligible to opt into a community bank leverage ratio (“CBLR”)\nframework. Qualifying community banking organizations that elect to use the CBLR framework and that maintain a leverage\nratio of greater than 9% are considered to have satisfied the generally applicable risk-based and leverage capital requirements\nin the agencies’ capital rules and will be considered to have met the well capitalized ratio requirements under the PCA statutes.\nThe agencies reserved the authority to disallow the use of the CBLR framework by a financial institution or holding company,\nbased on the risk profile of the organization.\nThe Corporation and the Bank elected to adopt the CBLR framework. As a qualifying community banking organization, the\nCorporation and the Bank may opt out of the CBLR framework in any subsequent quarter by completing its regulatory agency\nreporting using the traditional capital rules.\nThe Corporation and the Bank exclude accumulated OCI components from Tier 1 and Total regulatory capital.\nDuring 2020, the Corporation and the Bank elected the optional five-year transition period provided by the federal banking\nagencies for recognizing the regulatory capital impact of the implementation of CECL.\nThe Corporation’s and the Bank’s actual and required capital amounts and ratios under the CBLR rules at December 31, 2023\nand 2022 are presented in the tables below.\n2023\nTo Be Well Capitalized\nActual Capital Under CBLR Framework\n(dollars in thousands) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio\nTier 1 capital to average assets:\nConsolidated ............................................................................. $ 435,643 10.05% $ 389,969 9.00%\nBank .......................................................................................... 438,648 10.13 389,874 9.00\n2022\nTo Be Well Capitalized\nActual Capital Under CBLR Framework\n(dollars in thousands) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio\nTier 1 capital to average assets:\nConsolidated ............................................................................. $ 430,366 9.83% $ 394,017 9.00%\nBank .......................................................................................... 429,377 9.81 393,883 9.00\nOther Matters. The source of funds for the Corporation’s dividend payments to shareholders is dividends received from\nthe Bank. Banking regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by the Bank without prior approval of regulatory\nagencies. Under these regulations, the amount of dividends that the Bank may pay in any calendar year is limited to the\ncurrent year’s net profits, combined with the retained net profits of the preceding two years, subject to the minimum capital\nrequirements described above. During 2024, the Bank could, without prior approval, declare dividends of\napproximately $25.1 million plus any 2024 net profits retained to the date of the dividend declaration.\nRegulation D of the Board of Governors of The Federal Reserve System may require banks to maintain reserves against\ncertain deposit balances. There was no reserve requirement in 2023 or 2022.\nNOTE I – STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nOn April 20, 2021, the stockholders of the Corporation approved the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (“2021 Plan”). Upon\napproval of the 2021 Plan, no further awards could be made under the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (“2014 Plan”).\n56\n2021 Plan. Under the 2021 Plan, awards may be granted to employees and non-employee directors as stock options,\nrestricted stock awards or RSUs, with a one year minimum vesting period for at least 95% of the awards granted. All awards\ngranted under the 2021 Plan will immediately vest upon an involuntary termination following a change in control, total and\npermanent disability, as defined, or death.\nThe Corporation has 750,000 shares of common stock reserved for awards under the 2021 Plan, plus 23,167 shares that\nremained available for grant as full value RSUs or restricted stock awards under the 2014 Plan. RSUs granted under the 2014\nPlan that expire or are forfeited after April 20, 2021 are added to the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance\nof awards under the 2021 Plan. At December 31, 2023, 524,573 equity awards remain available to be granted under the 2021\nPlan.\n2014 Plan. Under the 2014 Plan, awards were granted to employees and non-employee directors as non-qualified stock\noptions, restricted stock awards and RSUs. Substantially all of the awards granted under the 2014 Plan were RSUs. All awards\ngranted under the 2014 Plan will immediately vest upon an involuntary termination following a change in control, total and\npermanent disability, as defined, or death, and with certain exceptions, will immediately vest in the event of retirement, as\ndefined.\nDetails of RSUs.

The performance-based RSUs have a maximum payout\npotential of 1.50 shares of the Corporation’s common stock for each RSU awarded. Based on the Corporation’s performance\nin 2023, 63,917 shares were forfeited on the performance-based RSUs and reflected in the table above. Service-based RSUs\nhave a maximum payout potential of one share of the Corporation’s common stock for each RSU awarded.\nThe total intrinsic value of RSUs converted in 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $2.2 million, $2.0 million and $1.6 million,\nrespectively.\nStock Option Activity. During 2022, the 750 stock options outstanding at December 31, 2021 were forfeited. There were\nno stock options outstanding at December 31, 2023 or 2022.\nNo stock options were exercised in 2023 or 2022. The total intrinsic value of options exercised in 2021 was $55,000. Cash\nreceived from option exercises in 2021 was $133,000 and the tax benefit from these exercises was $17,000.\nCompensation Expense. The Corporation recorded expense for share-based payments of $1.2 million, $2.5 million and\n$1.6 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and related income tax benefits of $383,000, $760,000 and $420,000,\nrespectively.\nUnrecognized Compensation Cost. As of December 31, 2023, there was $1.8 million of total unrecognized\ncompensation cost related to non-vested RSUs. The total cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period\nof 1.7 years.\nOther. No cash was used to settle stock options in 2022 or 2021. The Corporation uses newly issued shares for the\nconversion of RSUs. During 2023, 2022 and 2021, 4,573, 3,315 and 6,580 shares, respectively, of the Corporation’s common\nstock were issued to members of the Board of Directors in payment of director fees.\nNOTE J – RETIREMENT PLANS\nThe Bank has a 401(k) plan and a defined benefit pension plan (“Pension Plan” or “Plan”). Employees are immediately\neligible to participate in the 401(k) plan provided they are at least 18 years of age. Participants may elect to contribute up to\n100% of gross compensation, as defined, subject to the limitations of Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Bank\nmay, at its sole discretion, make matching contributions to each participant's account based on the amount of the participant's\ncontributions. Participants are fully vested in their elective contributions and, after five years of participation in the 401(k)\nplan, are fully vested (20% vesting per year) in the matching contributions, if any, made by the Bank. The Bank’s expense\nfor matching contributions was $571,000, $530,000 and $519,000 for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nAn internal management committee (the “Committee”) oversees the affairs of the Pension Plan and acts as named fiduciary.\nThe Committee has retained Vanguard Group, Inc., including its subsidiaries and affiliates (“Vanguard”), to act as\ndiscretionary investment agent, trustee and custodian for the Plan. Vanguard has formulated investment recommendations\n58\ncustomized to meet the Committee’s objectives and, after approval by the Committee, such investment recommendations are\nincorporated into the investment guidelines and policies contained in the investment management agreement between the\nBank and Vanguard (the “Investment Management Agreement”). The Committee utilizes a formal Investment Policy\nStatement which includes the investment guidelines and policies contained in the Investment Management Agreement. The\nInvestment Policy Statement is periodically revised by the Committee as deemed appropriate.\nEmployees are eligible to participate in the Pension Plan after attaining 21 years of age and completing 12 full months of\nservice. Pension benefits are generally based on a percentage of average annual compensation during the period of creditable\nservice. The Bank makes contributions to the Pension Plan which, when taken together with participant contributions equal\nto 2% of their compensation, will be sufficient to fund these benefits. The Bank’s funding method, the unit credit actuarial\ncost method, is consistent with the funding requirements of applicable federal laws and regulations which set forth both\nminimum required and maximum tax deductible contributions. Employees become fully vested after four years of\nparticipation in the Pension Plan (no vesting occurs during the four year period).\nSignificant Actuarial Assumptions. The following table sets forth the significant actuarial assumptions used to determine\nthe benefit obligation at December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 and the benefit cost for each of the Plan years then ended.\n2023 2022 2021\nWeighted average assumptions used to determine the\nbenefit obligation at year end:\nDiscount rate ................................................................................... 5.16% 5.44% 2.97%\nRate of increase in compensation levels ......................................... 4.00% 3.50% 3.50%\nWeighted average assumptions used to determine net pension cost:\nDiscount rate ................................................................................... 5.44% 2.97% 2.67%\nRate of increase in compensation levels ......................................... 3.50% 3.50% 3.50%\nExpected long-term rate of return on plan assets ............................ 6.00% 5.25% 5.25%\nThe decrease in the discount rate from 5.44% in 2022 to 5.16% in 2023 increased the projected benefit obligation at December\n31, 2023 by approximately $1.5 million. The increase in the salary scale from 3.50% in 2022 to 4.00% in 2023 increased the\nprojected benefit obligation at December 31, 2023 by approximately $296,000. Changes due to experience, including changes\nin participant demographics, resulted in a net actuarial loss of approximately $1.0 million during 2023.\nThe increase in the discount rate from 2.97% in 2021 to 5.44% in 2022 decreased the projected benefit obligation at December\n31, 2022 by approximately $15.3 million. Changes due to experience, including changes in participant demographics, resulted\nin a net actuarial loss of approximately $1.6 million during 2022.\nNet Pension Cost. The following table sets forth the components of net periodic pension cost.\n(in thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nService cost plus expected expenses and net of expected plan\nparticipant contributions ..................................................................... $ 1,378 $ 2,133 $ 2,131\nInterest cost ........................................................................................ 2,341 1,641 1,454\nExpected return on plan assets ...........................................................

The Bank does not expect to make a contribution in 2024.\nPlan Assets. The objective for the Plan’s assets is to generate long-term investment returns from both income and capital\nappreciation which outpaces the rate of inflation, while maintaining sufficient liquidity to ensure the Plan’s ability to pay all\nanticipated benefit and expense obligations when due. The Plan will maintain a de minimis amount of cash equivalents, with\nthe remaining assets allocated across two broadly-defined financial asset categories: (1) equity, both domestic and\ninternational; and (2) fixed income of various durations and issuer type. The goal of the equity allocation is to supplement\nthe Bank’s contributions to the Plan when the Plan is underfunded and increase surplus when the Plan is overfunded. The\nfixed income component will include longer-duration bonds designed to match and hedge the characteristics of the Plan’s\nliabilities. Cash equivalents, under normal circumstances, will be temporary holdings for the purpose of paying expenses and\nmonthly benefits.\nFor fixed income investments: (1) the minimum average credit quality shall be investment grade (Standard & Poor’s BBB or\nMoody’s Baa) or higher; and (2) no more than 5% of the portfolio may be invested in securities with ratings below investment\ngrade, and none may be rated below investment grade at the time of purchase.\nReasonable precautions are taken to avoid excessive concentrations to protect the portfolio against unfavorable outcomes\nwithin an asset class. Specifically, the following guidelines are in place:\n● With the exception of fixed income investments explicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government, no single investment\nsecurity shall represent more than 5% of total Plan assets; and\n● With the exception of passively managed investment vehicles seeking to match the returns of broadly diversified\nmarket indices or diversified investment vehicles chosen specifically to hedge the interest rate risk embedded in Plan\nliabilities, no single investment pool or investment company (mutual fund) shall comprise more than 10% of total\nplan assets.\nThe portfolio will be rebalanced to the target asset allocation, if needed, no less often than quarterly. Unless expressly\nauthorized in writing by the Committee, the following investing activities are prohibited:\n● Purchasing securities on margin;\n● Pledging or hypothecating securities, except for loans of securities that are fully collateralized;\n● Purchasing or selling derivative securities for speculation or leverage; and\n● Engaging in investment strategies that have the potential to amplify or distort the risk of loss beyond a level that is\nreasonably expected given the objectives of the portfolio.\n60\nThe Plan’s actual asset allocations, target allocations and expected long-term rates of return by asset category are set forth in\nthe following tables.\nDecember 31, 2023\nWeighted\nAverage\nExpected\nLong-term\nTarget Percentage of Rates of\nAllocation Plan Assets Return\nCash equivalents .................................................................................... 0% - 1% 0.3% <1.00%\nEquity mutual funds .............................................................................. 20% - 30% 25.0% 6.1% to 8.5%\nFixed income mutual funds ................................................................... 70% - 80% 74.7% 4.9% to 6.1%\n100.0% 5.2% to 6.7%\nDecember 31, 2022\nCash equivalents .................................................................................... 0% - 1% 0.3% <1.00%\nEquity mutual funds .............................................................................. 20% - 30% 24.8% 6.3% to 8.8%\nFixed income mutual funds ................................................................... 70% - 80% 74.9% 4.3% to 5.6%\n100.0% 4.8% to 6.3%\nThe ranges for the weighted average expected long-term rates of return for equity funds, bond funds and total plan assets set\nforth in the preceding table represent expected 25th to 75th percentile returns provided by Vanguard. For these purposes\nVanguard utilizes a proprietary capital markets model (the “model”) developed and maintained by Vanguard’s primary\ninvestment research and advice teams. The model forecasts distributions of future returns for a wide array of broad asset\nclasses. The theoretical and empirical foundation of the model is that the returns of various asset classes reflect the\ncompensation investors require for bearing different types of systematic risk. At the core of the model are estimates of the\ndynamic statistical relationship between risk factors and asset returns, obtained from statistical analysis based on available\nhistorical monthly financial and economic data.\nAt December 31, 2023, the equity and fixed income components of Plan assets consisted of the following Vanguard\ninstitutional funds:\nEquity\n● Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VITSX). This fund seeks to track the performance of the Center for\nResearch in Security Prices (CRSP) U.S. Total Market Index. The fund is passively managed using index sampling\nand consists of large, small and mid-cap equity securities diversified across growth and value styles.\n● Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund (VTSNX). This fund seeks to track the performance of the Financial\nTimes Stock Exchange (FTSE) Global All Cap ex U.S. Index. The fund is passively managed and includes broad\nexposure across developed and emerging non-U.S. equity markets.\nFixed Income\n● Vanguard Long-Term Investment-Grade Fund (VWETX). This fund seeks high and sustainable current income.\nInvestments are selected using a fundamental, bottom-up credit selection process and consist of long-term, high-\nquality bonds broadly diversified by issuer and industry sector.\n● Vanguard Long-Term Treasury Index Fund (VLGIX). This fund seeks to track the performance of the Bloomberg\nBarclays U.S. Long Treasury Bond Index. The fund is passively managed using index sampling and includes long-\nterm, fixed income securities issued by the U.S. Treasury.\n61\nFair Value of Plan Assets.

In the normal course of business, the Bank enters into various\ntypes of off-balance-sheet arrangements to meet the financing needs of its customers. These off-balance-sheet financial\ninstruments include commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and commercial letters of credit. These\ninstruments involve varying degrees of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets and\nexpose the Bank to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the Bank’s customers. The Bank's exposure to credit loss\nis represented by the contractual notional amount of these instruments. The Bank uses the same credit policies in making\ncommitments to extend credit, and generally uses the same credit policies for letters of credit, as it does for on-balance sheet\ninstruments such as loans.\nFinancial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit risk are as follows:\n2023 2022\nVariable Variable\n(in thousands) Fixed Rate Rate Fixed Rate Rate\nCommitments to extend credit...................................................... $ 1,877 $ 237,083 $ 27,694 $ 222,470\nStandby letters of credit ................................................................ 6,852 — 8,706 —\nA commitment to extend credit is a legally binding agreement to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any\ncondition established in the contract. Unused home equity, small business and commercial lines of credit are a large\ncomponent of the Bank’s variable rate loan commitments. Since some of the commitments to extend credit and letters of\ncredit are expected to expire without being drawn upon and, with respect to unused lines of credit, can be frozen, reduced or\nterminated by the Bank based on the financial condition of the borrower, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily\nrepresent future cash requirements. Home equity lines generally expire ten years from their date of origination and small\nbusiness lines generally have a three year term. Other real estate loan commitments generally expire within 60 to 90 days and\ncommercial line commitments generally expire within one year. The amount of collateral obtained, if any, by the Bank upon\nextension of credit is based on management’s credit evaluation of the borrower. Collateral held varies but may include\nmortgages on commercial and residential real estate, securities, deposit accounts with the Bank or other financial institutions\nand security interests in business assets and equipment. At December 31, 2023, the Bank’s fixed rate loan commitments are\nprimarily overdraft lines of credit on deposit accounts.\nStandby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Bank to assure the performance or financial obligations\nof a customer to a third party. The credit risk involved in issuing standby letters of credit is essentially the same as that\ninvolved in extending loans to customers. The Bank generally holds collateral and/or obtains personal guarantees supporting\nthese commitments. Standby letters of credit are considered financial guarantees and are recorded at fair value.\nEmployment Agreements. At December 31, 2023, the Corporation’s chief executive officer and executive vice\npresidents, collectively referred to as the senior executives, have employment agreements with the Corporation under which\nthey are entitled to severance compensation in the event that their employment is terminated without cause or they terminate\ntheir employment following an event constituting Good Reason, as defined. The chief executive officer’s amended and\nrestated employment agreement has a term of three years beginning January 1, 2022. Each of the other senior executives has\nan employment agreement with a term of two years and various effective dates. These two year and three year employment\nagreements automatically renew for an additional period of one year on January 1 of each year unless the Corporation gives\nwritten notice of non-renewal at least 30 days prior to such date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of these employment\nagreements expire on December 31 of the calendar year in which the executive attains normal retirement age (“Retirement\nAge Termination Date”), which for these purposes is age 65. At the appropriate time and at its option, the Corporation can\nextend the employment agreements for two years beyond their retirement age termination dates. The current aggregate annual\nsalaries provided for in these employment agreements is $2.7 million.\n63\nLitigation. From time to time the Corporation may be a named defendant in legal actions incidental to the business. For some\nof these actions there is always a possibility that the Corporation will sustain a financial loss. Management believes that none\nof the possible losses are material.\nNOTE M – FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nFinancial Instruments Recorded at Fair Value. When measuring fair value, the Corporation uses a fair value hierarchy,\nwhich is designed to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The hierarchy\ninvolves three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Corporation can access at the\nmeasurement date.\nLevel 2: Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in\nactive markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; or inputs other than\nquoted prices that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.\nLevel 3: Significant unobservable inputs that reflect the Corporation’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market\nparticipants would use in pricing an asset or liability.\nThe Corporation deems transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy to have occurred on the date of the event or change\nin circumstance that caused the transfer. There were no transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy in either 2023 or\n2022.\nThe fair values of the Corporation’s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are set forth in\nthe table that follows. The fair values of AFS securities are determined on a recurring basis using matrix pricing (Level 2\ninputs). Matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique widely used in the industry to value debt securities, does not rely\nexclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but rather on the relationship of such securities to other benchmark\nquoted securities. Where no significant other observable inputs were available, Level 3 inputs were used. The fair values of\ninterest rate swaps are based on valuation models using observable market data as of the measurement date resulting in a\nLevel 2 classification.\nFair Value Measurements Using:\nQuoted Prices Significant\nin Active Other Significant\nMarkets for Observable Unobservable\nIdentical Assets Inputs Inputs\n(in thousands) Total (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nDecember 31, 2023:\nFinancial Assets:\nAvailable-for-Sale Securities:\nState and municipals .................................. $ 143,621 $ — $ 143,429 $ 192\nPass-through mortgage securities ............... 138,603 — 138,603 —\nCollateralized mortgage obligations ........... 182,262 — 182,262 —\nSBA agency obligations ............................. 125,476 — 125,476 —\nCorporate bonds ......................................... 105,915 — 105,915 —\n695,877 — 695,685 192\nDerivative - interest rate swaps ...................... 582 — 582 —\n$ 696,459 $ — $ 696,267 $ 192\nDecember 31, 2022:\nFinancial Assets:\nAvailable-for-Sale Securities:\nState and municipals .................................. $ 305,247 $ — $ 304,680 $ 567\nPass-through mortgage securities ............... 148,520 — 148,520 —\nCollateralized mortgage obligations ........... 113,394 — 113,394 —\nCorporate bonds ......................................... 106,252 — 106,252 —\n$ 673,413 $ — $ 672,846 $ 567\n64\nState and municipal AFS securities measured using Level 3 inputs. The Bank held three non-rated bond anticipation\nnotes with a book value of $192,000 at December 31, 2023. These bonds have a one year maturity and are issued by local\nmunicipalities that are customers of the Bank. Due to the short duration of the bonds, book value approximates fair value at\nDecember 31, 2023.\nLand and Buildings. Premises and facilities held-for-sale of $383,000 and $2.4 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively, are reported in the line item “Other assets” in the consolidated balance sheets and are measured at lower of cost\nor fair value on a nonrecurring basis.\nFinancial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value. Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time. Such\nestimates are generally subjective in nature and dependent upon a number of significant assumptions associated with each\nfinancial instrument or group of similar financial instruments, including estimates of discount rates, liquidity, risks associated\nwith specific financial instruments, estimates of future cash flows, and relevant available market information. Changes in\nassumptions could significantly affect the estimates. In addition, fair value estimates do not reflect the value of anticipated\nfuture business, premiums or discounts that could result from offering for sale at one time the Corporation’s entire holdings\nof a particular financial instrument, or the income tax consequences of realizing gains or losses on the sale of financial\ninstruments.\nThe following table sets forth the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of financial instruments that are not recorded at\nfair value in the Corporation’s financial statements.\nLevel of December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nFair Value Carrying Carrying\n(in thousands) Hierarchy Amount Fair Value Amount Fair Value\nFinancial Assets:\nCash and cash equivalents .....................................

Fees are earned and collected on a monthly basis for account maintenance and activity-\nbased service charges on deposit accounts. The services are performed for customers over time, requiring a time-based\nmeasure of progress. Customers may be required to maintain minimum balances and average balances. Additional fees may\nalso be earned for overdrafts, replacement of debit cards, bill payment, lockbox services and ACH services and are earned\nand collected as transactions take place. All deposit account fees are accrued to income as earned, either monthly or at the\npoint of sale, and included in the consolidated statements of income in the line item \"Service charges on deposit accounts.\"\nTransaction and Branch Service Fees. The following revenue streams are components of “Other noninterest income”\non the consolidated statements of income. These components totaled $3.3 million, $2.9 million and $2.6 million for the years\nended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Other items included in “Other noninterest income,” such as non-\nservice components of net pension cost, real estate tax refunds and gains on sales of fixed assets are outside of the scope of\nAccounting Standards Codification 606.\n65\nDebit/Credit Card Revenues. The Bank earns a fee when its customers use their debit or credit cards in point-of-sale\ntransactions. These fees are generally known as interchange fees. Interchange fees from cardholder transactions represent a\npercentage of the underlying transaction value and are recorded daily, concurrently with the transaction processing services\nprovided to the cardholder.\nMerchant Card Services. Together with a third-party vendor, the Bank offers its small business customers debit/credit\ncard readers for them to accept and process card payments. The vendor aggregates the charges, collects the fees and remits\nthe Bank’s portion on a monthly basis. Fees are accrued to income as earned and collected.\nBranch Services Revenues. The Bank charges fees for safe deposit box rentals, wire transfers, money orders, checkbook\nprinting, official checks and ATM usage. Fees are earned, collected and generally recorded as revenue when the service is\nprovided.\nInvestment Services Revenues. Customer assets are held in a fiduciary capacity and the Bank provides trust services to\nthose customers as it transitions its remaining accounts to the LPL Financial platform. The services are performed for\ncustomers over time, requiring a time-based measure of progress. Fees are assessed based on market values of customer assets\nheld as of a certain point in time, and income cannot be estimated prior to the end of the measurement period. Volatility in\nequity and other market values impacts the amount of revenue earned. Fees are generally earned and collected on a monthly\nor quarterly basis and accrued to income as earned.\nInvestment Management Services. The Bank provides investment management, trust, estate and custody services and\noffers retail investment services through a partnership with an outside service provider, LPL Financial. Fees are variable and\nbased on various factors including the market value of financial assets under management. Fees are accrued to income as\nearned and collected.\nNOTE O – DERIVATIVES\nAs part of its asset liability management activities, the Corporation may utilize interest rate swaps to help manage its interest\nrate risk position. The notional amount of an interest rate swap does not represent the amount exchanged by the parties. The\nexchange of cash flows is determined by reference to the notional amount and the other terms of the interest rate swap\nagreements.\nFair Value Hedge. On March 16, 2023, the Bank entered into a three year interest rate swap with a notional amount\ntotaling $300 million which was designated as a fair value portfolio layer hedge of certain fixed rate residential mortgages.\nThe Bank pays a fixed rate of 3.82% and receives a floating rate based on the secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”) for\nthe life of the agreement without an exchange of the underlying notional amount. The hedge was determined to be effective\nduring the year ended December 31, 2023 and the Corporation expects the hedge to remain effective during the remaining\nterm of the swap. The gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to\nthe hedged risk is recognized in interest income.\nThe following table summarizes information about the interest rate swap designated as a fair value hedge.\nDecember 31,\n2023\nNotional amount (in millions) ................................................................................................................. $ 300\nFixed pay rate .......................................................................................................................................... 3.82 %\nOvernight SOFR receive rate .................................................................................................................. 5.38 %\nMaturity (in years) .................................................................................................................................. 2.21\nThe following table presents the amount recorded on the balance sheet related to cumulative basis adjustments for the fair\nvalue hedge as of the years indicated.\nDecember 31,\n(in thousands) 2023 2022\nLoans - Residential Mortgages:\nCarrying amount of the hedged asset (1) ..................................................................... $ 465,495 $ —\nFair value hedging adjustment included in the carrying amount of the hedged asset .. (506 ) —\n(1) This amount represents the amortized cost basis of the closed loan portfolio used to designate the hedging relationship in\nwhich the hedged item is the stated amount of assets in the closed portfolio anticipated to be outstanding for the designated\n66\nhedge period. At December 31, 2023, the amortized cost basis of the closed portfolio used in this hedging relationship\nwas $466.0 million. The cumulative basis adjustment associated with this hedging relationship was $506,000 and the\namount of the designated hedged item was $582,000.\nDuring 2023, the Bank recorded a $3.1 million credit from the swap transaction as a component of interest income in the\nconsolidated statements of income.\nCash Flow Hedge. The Bank entered into a five year interest rate swap with a notional amount totaling $50 million on\nJanuary 17, 2019, which was designated as a cash flow hedge of certain FHLB advances and included in short-term\nborrowings on the consolidated balance sheets. In April 2022, the swap was terminated and the FHLB advance was paid off.\nTermination fees were immaterial.\nIn May 2021 a second interest rate swap with a notional amount totaling $150 million expired and the Bank paid off $150\nmillion of brokered certificates of deposit used in the cash flow hedge.\nInterest expense recorded on the swap transactions, which totaled $426,000 and $2.9 million for 2022 and 2021, respectively,\nwas recorded as a component of interest expense in the consolidated statements of income. Amounts reported in accumulated\nOCI related to the swaps were reclassified to interest expense as interest payments were made on the Bank’s variable rate\nliabilities. During 2022 and 2021, the Corporation had $426,000 and $2.9 million, respectively, of reclassifications to interest\nexpense. The Bank did not have any outstanding cash flow hedges in 2023.\nThe following table presents the activity recorded in the consolidated statements of income and the consolidated statements\nof comprehensive income relating to the interest rate swaps for the years indicated.\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nInterest rate contract:\nAmount of gain recognized in OCI (effective portion) ...................... $ — $ 1,324 $ 668\nAmount of loss reclassified from OCI to interest expense ................. — 426 2,867\nAmount of loss recognized in other noninterest income\n(ineffective portion) ........................................................................ — — —\nNOTE P – PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nCondensed financial information for the Corporation (parent company only) is as follows:\nCONDENSED BALANCE SHEETS\nDecember 31,\n(in thousands) 2023 2022\nAssets:\nCash and due from banks ............................................................................................. $ 695 $ 897\nInvestment in subsidiary bank, at equity ...................................................................... 383,151 363,547\nPrepaid income taxes ................................................................................................... 42 3,712\nDeferred income tax benefits ....................................................................................... 1,010 1,088\nOther assets .................................................................................................................. 9 25\n$ 384,907 $ 369,269\nLiabilities:\nOther liabilities ............................................................................................................ $ 17 $ 20\nCash dividends payable ............................................................................................... 4,744 4,713\n4,761 4,733\nStockholders' equity:\nCommon stock ............................................................................................................. 2,259 2,244\nSurplus ......................................................................................................................... 79,728 78,462\nRetained earnings ......................................................................................................... 355,887 348,597\n437,874 429,303\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax ......................................................

We also have audited the Company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework:(2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the\nCompany as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the\nthree-year period ended December 31, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States\nof America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial\nreporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework:(2013) issued\nby COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over\nfinancial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the\naccompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on the Company’s financial statements and an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting\nbased on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\n(United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S.\nfederal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform\nthe audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether\ndue to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risk of material misstatement of the\nfinancial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures\nincluded examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits\nalso included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating\nthe overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining\nan understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing\nand evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included\nperforming such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a\nreasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures\nthat (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and\ndispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to\npermit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and\nexpenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the\ncompany; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n69\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that\nwas communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that\nare material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex\njudgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial\nstatements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion\non the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nQualitative and Quantitative Loss Factors in the Allowance for Credit Losses\nThe methodology for determining the allowance for credit losses requires substantial judgment by management. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, the balance of the allowance for credit losses was $28.9 million. As described in Note A to the\nconsolidated financial statements, management estimates the allowance for credit losses balance using relevant available\ninformation, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable\nforecasts.\nManagement adjusts its historical loss experience to reflect current and forecasted conditions. In doing so, management\nconsiders a variety of general qualitative and quantitative loss factors (“Q-factors”). We consider management’s application\nof the Q-factors in the allowance for credit losses to be a critical audit matter due to the extent of audit effort and degree of\nauditor judgment required to evaluate the Q-factors given the volume and nature of inputs and the significant management\njudgment required.\nTo address this matter, we tested the design and operating effectiveness of the Company's controls related to the Q-factors,\nincluding the following:\n● Management’s application of qualitative and quantitative judgments related to the Q-factors and the resulting\nallocation to the allowance for credit losses;\n● Management's review over the completeness and accuracy of the data used as the basis for the Q-factors;\n● Management's testing over the mathematical accuracy of the allowance for credit losses calculation; and\n● Management committee review of the allowance for credit losses and provision for credit losses.\nOur substantive procedures related to the Q-factors included the following:\n● Evaluating the reasonableness of management’s application of Q-factors and the resulting allocation to the allowance\nfor credit losses;\n● Testing the completeness and accuracy of certain data used in the qualitative factor calculations; and\n● Testing the mathematical accuracy of the allowance for credit loss calculation.\n/s/ CROWE LLP\nCrowe LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2003.\nNew York, New York\nMarch 8, 2024\n70\nITEM 9.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Corporation’s Principal Executive Officer, Christopher Becker, and Principal Financial Officer, Janet T.

Based upon that evaluation, they have concluded that the\nCorporation’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThe management of The First of Long Island Corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal\ncontrol over financial reporting, based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework:(2013) issued\nby the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). The First of Long Island\nCorporation’s system of internal control over financial reporting was designed by or under the supervision of the\nCorporation’s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of the preparation of the Corporation’s financial statements for external and regulatory reporting purposes, in\naccordance with U.S. GAAP. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or\ndetect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls\nmay become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures\nmay deteriorate.\nThe First of Long Island Corporation’s management assessed the effectiveness of the Corporation’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated\nFramework:(2013) issued by COSO. Based on the assessment, management determined that, as of December 31, 2023, the\nCorporation’s internal control over financial reporting is effective.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nCrowe LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has expressed an opinion on the effectiveness of the\nCorporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 in their report which appears on page 69.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2023 that have\nmaterially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting.\nITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, none of our directors or officers adopted or terminated any contract, instruction or written\nplan for the purchase or sale of the Corporation’s securities that was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of\nRule 10b5-1(c) or any “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement,” as that term is used in Securities and Exchange Commission\n(“SEC”) regulations.\nITEM 9C.

The principal drivers of the lower earnings were a decline in net interest income of $5.5 million, or 23.2%, and a $1.1 million credit\nprovision for credit losses taken in the first quarter of 2023, partially offset by a loss on sales of securities of $3.5 million in the first quarter of 2023. The decline in net\ninterest income primarily resulted from the current rate environment’s impact on the Bank’s liability sensitive balance sheet. The quarter produced a return on average\nassets of 0.42%, return on average equity of 4.72%, net interest margin of 1.79%, and an efficiency ratio of 76.48%.\nNet interest income declined when comparing the first quarters of 2024 and 2023 due to an increase in interest expense of $11.0 million that was only partially offset\nby a $5.5 million increase in interest income. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 151 basis points while the yield on interest-earning assets increased 52\nbasis points when comparing the two quarters. Also contributing to the decline in net interest income was a shift in the mix of funding as average noninterest-bearing\ndeposits decreased $155.4 million while average interest-bearing liabilities increased $137.3 million.\nNoninterest income, excluding the loss on sales of securities, increased $272,000, or 10.9%, when comparing the first quarters of 2024 and 2023. Recurring\ncomponents of noninterest income including bank-owned life insurance (“BOLI”) and service charges on deposit accounts had increases of 7.7% and 11.8%,\nrespectively. Other noninterest income increased 12.7% and included increases of $106,000 in real estate tax refunds and $52,000 in merchant card services.\nNoninterest expense declined $365,000, or 2.2%, for the first quarter of 2024, as compared to the first quarter of 2023. Reductions in legal fees of $233,000, occupancy\nand equipment expense of $111,000 and director fees of $82,000 primarily drove the decline. These items were partially offset by an increase of $209,000 in salaries and\nemployee benefits due to higher incentive compensation and group health costs in the current quarter.\nThe Bank did not record a credit loss provision in the first quarter of 2024, compared to a credit provision of $1.1 million in the prior year’s first quarter. Changes in\nthe credit loss reserve were driven largely by net chargeoffs of $657,000. The reserve coverage ratio on March 31, 2024, was 0.88% of total loans as compared to 0.89%\nof total loans at December 31, 2023. Past due loans and nonaccrual loans were modest at $292,000 and $1.2 million, respectively, on March 31, 2024. Overall credit quality\nin the loan and investment portfolios remains strong.\nIncome tax expense decreased $357,000, and the effective tax rate declined from 9.1% in the first quarter of 2023 to 6.2% in the current quarter. The decline in the\neffective tax rate is mainly due to an increase in the percentage of pre-tax income derived from the Bank’s real estate investment trust and BOLI. The decrease in income\ntax expense reflects the lower effective tax rate and a decline in pre-tax income.\n1\nAnalysis of Earnings – First Quarter 2024 Versus Fourth Quarter 2023\nNet income for the first quarter of 2024 declined $1.6 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. The decrease was mainly due to a decrease in net interest\nincome of $1.8 million, primarily due to higher cost of funds on total interest-bearing liabilities, and an increase in salaries and employee benefits of $1.9 million. Salaries\nand employee benefit expenses were considerably lower in the fourth quarter of 2023 as the Company fell short of established performance metrics for short-term\nincentive and stock-based compensation payouts. Partially offsetting these items was the fourth quarter provision for credit losses of $901,000, an increase in\nnoninterest income of $377,000 and a reduction in the provision for off-balance sheet commitments of $227,000.\nThe decline in the net interest margin to 1.79% in the first quarter of 2024 from 2.00% in the fourth quarter of 2023 was largely due to the change in the mix of\nfunding. Average deposits decreased $100.6 million while overnight and other borrowings increased $107.7 million. The weighted average cost of $100 million of new\nFHLB borrowings taken during the first quarter was 4.72%, considerably more than the weighted average cost of total deposits of 2.08% during the quarter. The change\nin average funding mix was mainly related to decreases in average tax escrow accounts and municipal deposits.\nLiquidity\nTotal average deposits declined by $162.6 million, or 4.7%, comparing the first quarters of 2024 to 2023, reflecting industry trends. On March 31, 2024, short term\nborrowings were down $70 million from year-end 2023. Long-term borrowings increased $42.5 million in the quarter to $515.0 million on March 31, 2024. The Bank had\n$1.1 billion in collateralized borrowing lines with the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York and the Federal Reserve Bank, as well as a $20 million unsecured line of credit\nwith a correspondent bank. We also had $375 million in unencumbered cash and securities. In total, we had approximately $1.5 billion of available liquidity on March 31,\n2024.\nCapital\nThe Corporation’s capital position remains strong with a leverage ratio of approximately 10.0% on March 31, 2024. Book value per share was $16.78 on March 31,\n2024, versus $16.43 on March 31, 2023. The accumulated other comprehensive loss component of stockholders’ equity is mainly comprised of a net unrealized loss in the\navailable-for-sale securities portfolio due to higher market interest rates. We repurchased 167,526 shares in the first quarter of 2024 at a cost of $2.0 million and the Bank\ndeclared its quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share. The Board and management continue to evaluate both capital management tools to provide the best opportunity\nto maximize shareholder value.\nLooking Forward\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer Chris Becker commented on the Company’s financial position: “Historically the Bank experiences seasonal deposit outflows at\nyear-end and deposits generally build throughout the year. While average deposits declined approximately $100 million during the first quarter, on March 31, 2024, total\ndeposits were $55.5 million higher than on December 31, 2023. During the first quarter the Bank repriced $62.5 million of wholesale funding with a weighted average cost\nof 1.36% to current market rates with a weighted average cost of 4.78%. The first quarter 2024 repricing of wholesale funding represented the final tranches of wholesale\nfunding with a significant increase in interest costs. Our retail certificates of deposit have largely repriced to market although the 2024 tranches in April and May have a\nweighted average cost of approximately 4% and will likely reprice higher during the second quarter of 2024.”\nMr. Becker added: “The combination of deposit stabilization since year-end 2023’s seasonal outflows and wholesale funding and retail certificates of deposit largely\nrepriced to market rates should stabilize our margin in the coming quarter. Improvement in the margin in second half of 2024 is dependent on an improving yield curve.”\n2\nForward Looking Information\nThis earnings release contains various “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of that term as set forth in Rule 175 of the Securities Act of 1933 and Rule\n3b-6 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Applicants and guarantors must have a satisfactory credit history and demonstrate the ability to repay through documentation such as\nfinancial statements, leases, and rent rolls. In processing requests for commercial mortgage loans, the Bank obtains independent appraisals in accordance with regulatory\nrequirements and an appropriate environmental assessment. All properties are inspected by Bank personnel and/or approved third-party vendors before closing on the mortgage and\nannually thereafter for loans over $2.5 million. Properties may also be re-inspected if concerns arise during the Bank’s annual review process described below. Commercial mortgage\nloans generally mature in 10 years with amortization schedules ranging between 20 and 30 years. We strive to reprice commercial mortgage loans every five years although pricing\nmay be fixed for longer terms. The Bank will generally not lend more than 75% of appraised value for investment properties, including multifamily properties.\nThe Bank completes annual management reviews on at least 80% of the outstanding balance of commercial mortgage loans. Additionally, an independent third-party loan review\nconsulting firm completes annual reviews on at least 60% of the outstanding balance of commercial mortgage loans. Results of the entire management and third-party annual review\nscope are reported to the Board Loan Committee. Management completes a quarterly commercial real estate market analysis using a combination of internal and third-party data to\nassess the risks in the portfolio. The market analysis includes, among other things, a vintage analysis, capital concentrations, geographic concentrations, property type\nconcentrations, broker concentrations, risk rating data, average LTV trends, average DSCR trends, delinquency trends and loss trends. The market analysis also includes third-party\nvendor narratives on the markets where we lend that detail trends such as average rents, vacancy rates, income growth, job growth trends, absorption rates, cap rates and new units\ncoming to market, among other information.\nThe Bank’s credit risk management processes have produced historically strong asset quality metrics and today’s underwriting standards are consistent with past practices, some of\nwhich are indicated below.\nMinimum DSCR Maximum LTV Use Actual Low Interest\nInspections\nRequirement of\n80%, Current Only Exposure,\nCashflow,

On the call today are Chris Becker, President and Chief Executive Officer\nand Janet Verneuille, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nToday’s call is being recorded. A copy of the earnings release is available on the\nCorporation’s website at FNBLI.com and on the earnings call webpage at\nhttps://www.cstproxy.com/fnbli/earnings/2024/q2.\nBefore we begin, the Company would like to remind everyone that this call may contain\ncertain statements that constitute forward-looking statements made under the safe harbor\nprovisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are\nsubject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause actual results to differ\nmaterially from those contained in any such statements, including as set forth in the\ncompany’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Investors should also\nrefer to our 2023 10-K filed on March 8, 2024, as supplemented by our 10-Q for the quarter\nended March 31, 2024, for a list of risk factors that could cause actual results to differ\nmaterially from those indicated or implied by such statements.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Chris Becker.\nChris’ Opening Remarks [00:01:35]\nThank you. Good afternoon and welcome to The First of Long Island Corporation’s earnings\ncall for second quarter of 2024.\nI am pleased to report linked quarter improvements in many key financial ratios and\nFinancial Statement line items including:\n• Increase in Return on Assets.\nFNBLI 2Q 2024 Earnings Call Transcript Page 1 of 13\n• Increase in Return on Equity.\n• Improvement in efficiency ratio.\n• Growth in deposits.\n• Growth in loans.\n• Higher noninterest income.\n• Lower noninterest expense.\n• Higher net income.\n• Higher earnings per share.\nAnd most importantly:\n• Increase in net interest margin.\nAfter six consecutive quarters of net interest margin decline from 2.97% for the three months\nended September 30, 2022, to 1.79% for the three months ended March 31, 2024, our\nmargin increased to1.80% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024. While not a\nsubstantial move up, certainly a positive indicator for stabilization.\nRepeating what I stated last quarter, barring any significant changes in our funding mix or\nshort-term rates moving higher, we believe our net interest margin should be at the bottom.\nThe pace of interest-earning asset repricing was basically in line with the pace interest-\nbearing liability repricing during the second quarter of this year and that trend is expected to\ncontinue, if not improve, in the quarters ahead. Managing the mix of the Balance Sheet will\naugment margin improvement and coupled with a more favorable yield curve this\nimprovement can accelerate. Talk of lower short-term rates is encouraging for continued\nearnings growth moving forward.\nThe Bank had stronger loan originations during the second quarter, closing $70 million with\na weighted average rate of approximately 7%. Second-quarter originations were driven by\nC&I and owner-occupied commercial mortgages, highlighting our focus on relationship-\nbased business.\nOriginations during the second quarter continued the progress made remixing our loan\nportfolio from consumer to commercial that began in 2020. During that period, relationship-\nbased C&I and Owner-Occupied Commercial Mortgages increased 80% and other\ncommercial real estate increased 30%. In total, our commercial lending business has grown\nFNBLI 2Q 2024 Earnings Call Transcript Page 2 of 13\n$582 million. That growth has been masked by letting our residential lending business\namortize down by $514 million over the same period. Building our commercial relationship\nbusiness has also resulted in an improved mix on the funding side as noninterest-bearing\ndeposits represented 30% of our funding mix at June 30, 2024, compared to 25% on\nDecember 31, 2019.\nIn the current environment, I believe it is important to note that our remix to commercial\nlending has not included any significant increase in multifamily loans outstanding. Our\nmultifamily loans totaled $868 million at the end of the second quarter of 2024, up minimally\nfrom $835 million at the end of 2019.\nThe June 30, 2024, pipeline was $137 million with a projected weighted average rate of\napproximately 6.75%. Please keep in mind that many loans in the pipeline are floating off\nan index plus a margin until the closing, so the weighted average rate moves with the market.\nThe pipeline has increased from the end of the first quarter when it was $113 million.\nWe have been closely monitoring rate resets and have provided detailed information in that\nregard in a Form 8K filed on March 1, 2024, supplemented by additional information in our\nAnnual Shareholders Meeting Presentation on April 16, 2024. During the second half of this\nyear, based on rates as of June 30, 2024, we have $65 million of multifamily and nonowner\noccupied commercial mortgages repricing with a weighted average rate of 4.24% before the\nrate reset and a projected weighted average rate of 7.00% after the rate reset.\nLooking forward into 2025, based on rates as of June 30, 2024, we have $122 million of\nmultifamily and nonowner-occupied commercial mortgages repricing with a weighted\naverage rate of 3.53% before the rate reset and a projected weighted average rate of 7.02%\nafter the rate reset. For loans with projected cash flow stress, we have started to reach out\nto borrowers to discuss options for their consideration.\nOur criticized, classified, past due, nonperforming, and charge-off levels all remain low and\nwe currently assess our credit quality as strong.\nOn June 28, 2024, we opened a branch on the North Fork of Long Island in Southold. We\nbelieve this location will be a great complement to the rest of the East End of Long Island\npresence that we established over recent years including Riverhead, Southampton, and\nEast Hampton. We currently have 41 branches, covering Nassau and Suffolk counties and\nthe boroughs of Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn. Our branch count is down from a high\nFNBLI 2Q 2024 Earnings Call Transcript Page 3 of 13\nof 52 branches at the end of 2019 but our total deposits have increased by approximately\n$220 million over that period, a much more efficient model. We continue to evaluate\nprospects for geographic expansion as well as efficiencies within our existing branch\nnetwork.\nOur Company has been around for nearly a century because we stay focused on the\nfundamentals of strong credit quality and meaningful customer relationships. We believe\nour fundamentals have built and will continue building a strong franchise. Growth and\nmargins have been challenged over the past 18 months, but we remain optimistic about\nfuture opportunities to build shareholder value.\nJanet Verneuille will now take you through financial highlights of the quarter and year to\ndate. Janet.\nJanet’s Comments [00:08:30]\nThank you, Chris. Good afternoon, everyone:\nFollowing up on some of Chris’ comments, positive trends quarter over quarter included the\nfollowing:\n• Increase in ROA from 0.42% to 0.45%\n• Increase in ROE from 4.72% to 5.15%\n• Increase in net interest margin from 1.79% to 1.80%\n• Improvement in efficiency ratio to 73.6% from 76.5%\nAlthough these are slight improvements, they can be a forward-facing indicator of trending\nstabilization of our net interest margin. Coupled with recent heightened market anticipation\nof a Fed funds rate cut in September, we expect to maintain this trend.\nThe Company recognized net income of $4.8 million for the second quarter of 2024, $4.4\nmillion for the linked quarter, and $6.9 million for the same quarter last year. Earnings per\nshare were $0.21 for the quarter, equal to the per share dividend declared by our Board of\nDirectors in June of 2024. EPS for the linked quarter and the same quarter last year were\n$0.20 and $0.31, respectively.\nFNBLI 2Q 2024 Earnings Call Transcript Page 4 of 13\nThe increase from the linked quarter was largely attributed to the increase in net interest\nincome by $270 thousand and decrease in salaries and employee benefits of $474 thousand\nprimarily due to decreases in employee incentive accruals. These were partially offset by a\n$570 thousand provision for loan losses.\nThe decline from the second quarter of 2023 is largely attributed to the decrease in the net\ninterest income by $3.4 million, a $570 thousand provision for loan losses, partially offset by\na decrease in the provision for income tax expense of $1 million attributable to lower\nearnings and a decrease in the effective tax rate.\nNoninterest income of $2.9 million exceeded noninterest income recorded in the linked\nquarter of $2.8 million and the same quarter last year of $2.7 million. Improved results from\nservice charges on deposit accounts, merchant card services and bank-owned life insurance\nwere the main contributors to the increase. Management had guided in analyst calls to\nquarterly non-interest income totals of approximately $2.6 million. Based on deposit\naccount service charge collection improvements after our system upgrade, management\ncurrently believes increases in service charge revenue will remain stable. Although\nmerchant card services can fluctuate, we now expect for the last two quarters of 2024 these\nrevenues will trend consistent to the first two quarters.\nNoninterest expense totaled $15.8 million for the current quarter as compared to $16.2\nmillion in the linked quarter and $16.5 million in the same quarter last year. Earlier in the\nyear, management had guided in analyst calls to quarterly non-interest expense totals of\napproximately $16.25 million. We did have some open staffing positions during the second\nquarter, but we also lowered incentive compensation accrual rates. We anticipate non-\ninterest expenses for the last two quarters of 2024 will be comparable to the first two\nquarters.\nDuring the second quarter, we used excess cash to pay down about $143 million of\nwholesale borrowings, leading to a small deleveraging of the Balance Sheet of $46 million\neven though we had deposit growth of $37 million and loan growth of $14 million. Loan\ngrowth was better than the net number reflects as C&I loans increased $27 million and\ncommercial mortgages increased by $15 million. Commercial growth was offset by\nresidential mortgages decreasing $27 million as we continue to remix the loan portfolio\ntoward commercial lending. The overall loan yield of 4.22% was up 8 basis points quarter\nFNBLI 2Q 2024 Earnings Call Transcript Page 5 of 13\nover quarter.\nThe second quarter saw a notable increase in average non-maturity interest-bearing\ndeposits of $85 million and CDs of $15 million. Average noninterest-bearing checking\ndeposits increased by $11 million and represent 33% of total deposits. The weighted\naverage cost of interest-bearing non-maturity deposits was 2.84% and for CDs was 4.24%.\nAs of the close of the second quarter, the repricing of wholesale funding, FHLB borrowings,\nand brokered CDs to current market rates remained largely behind us. Although at a slower\npace, we continue to approve upward interest rate adjustments based on the overall\ncustomer relationship.\nThe purchase of the fixed-to-floating swap in March 2023 continued to pay dividends adding\n$1.2 million to net interest income in the second quarter. The swap matures in March 2026.\nNet interest income for the second quarter of 2024 increased $270 thousand compared to\nthe linked quarter and decreased $3.4 million from the same quarter last year. Our net\ninterest margin of 1.80% for the second quarter of 2024 compares to 1.79% for the linked\nquarter and 2.17% for same quarter last year.\nYield on total interest-earning assets was 4.16% for the second quarter of 2024, 4.08% for\nthe linked quarter, and 3.78% for same quarter last year.\nCost of total interest-bearing liabilities was 3.56% for second quarter of 2024, 3.47% for the\nlinked quarter, and 2.51% for same quarter last year.\nThe Allowance for Credit Losses as of June 30, 2024, was $28.5 million. A provision was\nbooked to the ACL of $570 thousand during the quarter. The quarterly provision was largely\ndue to a $276 thousand specific reserve on one nonperforming loan and $421 thousand of\nnet charge-offs. The reserve coverage ratio at June 30, 2024, remained flat at .88% when\ncompared to the linked quarter.\nThe capital position remains strong with a Leverage Ratio of approximately 9.9% at June\n30, 2024. Book value per share was $16.71 at June 30, 2024, versus $16.22 at June 30,\n2023. The accumulated other comprehensive loss component of stockholders’ equity is\nmainly comprised of a net unrealized loss in the available-for-sale securities portfolio due to\nhigher market interest rates. There were no shares repurchased in the second quarter of\n2024.\nFNBLI 2Q 2024 Earnings Call Transcript Page 6 of 13\nThe effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2024 decreased to 1.6% as compared to\n6.2% for the linked quarter. The annualized effective tax rate is now expected to be\napproximately 4%. The change was due to a reduction in 2024 projected income, with rates\nstaying higher for longer than anticipated, causing a greater impact of the tax-exempt items\non the effective tax rate.\nWith that, I turn it back to our operator for questions.\nOperator [00:16:29]\nThank you.\nOur first question for today comes from Mark Fitzgibbon from Piper Sandler. Mark, please\nproceed with your question.\nMark Fitzgibbon [00:16:37]\nThank you for taking my question, and good afternoon. Happy Friday.\nChris Becker [00:16:41]\nHey. Good afternoon, Mark.\nMark Fitzgibbon\nIf the Fed follows the forward curve, if we see two more cuts this year, I'm curious, how much\ndo you think the net interest margin might be able to snap back by the end of the year?\nChris Becker\nWell, we're in a previous call we had indicated that each 25 basis-point cut could improve\nmargin by 4 to 5 basis points. And we haven't updated that further. So that's, that still seems\nto be pretty good estimate.\nFNBLI 2Q 2024 Earnings Call Transcript Page 7 of 13\nMark Fitzgibbon\nOkay. And then secondly, I was curious. Credit, obviously, here is terrific, but what drove\nthat $1.8 million uptick in non-performing loans? And could you also share with us what net\ncharge-offs were in the quarter?\nChris Becker\nYeah, net charge-offs were a little over 400,000 for the quarter. And it was one loan that\nwent non-performing where we took--that's the loan that had the specific reserve and had a\npartial charge-off down to the appraised value. The charge-off was about 175,000.\nMark Fitzgibbon\nOkay. And what type of loan is that?\nChris Becker\nThat was a multifamily loan. That's our only multifamily loan in non-performing.\nMark Fitzgibbon\nAll right. And then I heard the numbers that you mentioned on the call about multifamily and\nnon-owner occupied commercial real estate. That's rolling from sort of, you know, four and\na quarter, up to 7% or three and a half, up to 7% on the 122 million. I guess I'm curious,\nhave you guys done an analysis that sort of looks at whether the cash flow on those buildings\nwill be sufficient once you know, the rate basically doubles?\nChris Becker\nYes, absolutely. Absolutely. We've looked at every loan that's repricing between now and\nthe end of 2025 to calculate their repricing rate and their cash flow. And that's where I'd\nmentioned anything that's showing some possible stress. We're reaching out in advance to\nFNBLI 2Q 2024 Earnings Call Transcript Page 8 of 13\nthose customers to see, what type of strategies we can do to help relieve any of that stress.\nWe've had success in that regard. We've had situations where the borrower has refinanced\nearly and pay down. We've had other situations where we've gotten additional pieces of\ncollateral or by combining two loans into one, one that had stronger cash flow, one that\nmaybe was showing signs of stress at the reset to combine them to make the cash flow\nbetter overall. So, borrowers have been receptive to us reaching out early and because\nobviously they don't want to get into a situation, and especially if there's a current option for\na rate that might be a little bit less than what they would reset at, say, 5 or 6 months down\nthe road.\nMark Fitzgibbon\nOkay. And then the last question I had was around the tax rate. I heard Janet, your\ncomments, the effective rate for the year will be around 4%. What will it look like in 2025?\nLike what sort of a normalized run rate for you all?\nJanet Verneuille [00:22:13]\nWell, assuming that income goes up, the effective tax rate will go up, obviously, because\nthe tax-exempt items will be a small percentage of income. I hesitate to give a number. I\ndon't know, maybe I'd say, I don't know, probably maybe about 7%. I would estimate at this\npoint. But really, it's going to depend on where income comes in and how we manage those\ntax-exempt items.\nMark Fitzgibbon\nGreat. Thank you.\nChris Becker\nThank you, Mark.\nFNBLI 2Q 2024 Earnings Call Transcript Page 9 of 13\nOperator [00:20:59]\nAll right. Our next question.\nFor today comes from Chris O'Connell, a KBW. Chris, please proceed with your question.\nChris O'Connell [00:21:07] Hey. Good afternoon.\nChris Becker [00:21:09]\nHey. How are you doing, Chris?\nChris O'Connell [00:21:12]\nGood. Just wanted to start off with: you provided the multifamily and Non-owner-occupied\nCRE repricing in the second half of the year. Just curious how much of the multifamily and\nnon-owner occupied re-priced in the first half of ‘24?\nChris Becker\nYeah, it's similar to what's going on in the second. I don't have that number right in front of\nme, but it was very similar to what's repricing in the second half.\nChris O'Connell\nGot it. And you know, as far as the funding side goes with CDs or up probably pretty close\nto market rates at this point. I mean, how much more do you think has left to reprice, uh,\nupwards in the second half of the year?\nJanet Verneuille [00:22:13]\nThere's very little bit. We just had one small piece that repriced that was at a low rate on the\nbrokered side. And as far as the retail CDs, they're pretty much at market. I would say it's a\nminimal what's left to reprice to market rates.\nFNBLI 2Q 2024 Earnings Call Transcript Page 10 of 13\nChris O'Connell\nGot it. So, I mean, I'm just…curious, because you did have a decent amount of CD repricing,\nespecially kind of earlier in the year as well as the borrowings. Why not a little bit more\npositive on the margin in the interim between now and when rate cuts begin, given that it\nseems like similar asset repricing on the other side of the balance sheet?\nChris Becker\nYeah. I think as we looked at the second quarter, it was pretty well even as far as what we\npriced on both sides of the balance sheet. And we still have on the non-maturity side in our\nmoney market deposit accounts. You still have those one-off relationship discussions. And\nwe still had some increase in those rates throughout the second quarter. And I think that's\nwhy we're still being a little a little cautious on this. We're looking closely at those. But there's\nstill…that's where the numbers still went up for us in the second quarter.\nChris O'Connell\nGot it. On the loan growth, it sounds like pipelines are up, and improved, the past couple of\nquarters… good originations. Are you still thinking, inclusive of the residential plan, drawn\noff on net low single-digit growth for this year?\nChris Becker\nYes.\nChris O'Connell\nAnd if you're getting into a rate-cutting environment, as we get towards the back half of ’24-\n2025, is that residential strategy? Do you think that will continue or moderate if there's less\nfunding pressures and lead to higher kind of net loan growth into 2025?\nFNBLI 2Q 2024 Earnings Call Transcript Page 11 of 13\nChris Becker\nIt will continue. We don't plan to begin originating residential mortgages. We stopped\noriginating them towards the second half of last year. We don't plan to begin originating them\nnow. We may consider purchasing loans if we wanted to have some diversification in the\nportfolio, but we really want to focus on continuing to grow the relationship-based CNI and\nowner-occupied commercial mortgages. If you look at our loan portfolio kind of pie chart\nthat's still the smallest slice. While it's up from a low of 7% a handful of years ago to about\n12% or so now. Ideally, we'd like kind of like four equal buckets of multifamily other\ncommercial real estate relationship CNI and owner-occupied, and then residential. So, the\nresidential still has a ways to go to get down to that quarter. If you look at those four pieces\nof the pie and at that point we would possibly consider, as I said, buying some residential.\nChris O'Connell\nGot it. That's helpful. And then as you guys have reached out to what you said in the\nmultifamily customers and the ones that look tight…any sense of how big that customer\nsegment is, either on a percentage basis of the book or on a dollar amount, even if it's kind\nof just ballparking?\nChris Becker\nYeah. I can tell you it's for the remainder of this year, it's six loans. So, it's a small number\nof borrowers.\nChris O'Connell\nGreat. And as you guys start to see the margin come up and get a little bit more comfortable\nwith the overall, you know, earnings and profitability profile, you're in the back half of the\nyear into 2025, you know, do you think you start to revisit the buyback conversation?\nFNBLI 2Q 2024 Earnings Call Transcript Page 12 of 13\nChris Becker\nYeah, I certainly think that that's something I mean, we did buy back some stock in the first\nquarter of this year. That's something we look at every quarter along with the dividend and,\nand make those decisions. But certainly, we have 13 million still under the buyback program\nthat we have outstanding, so absolutely. We would look at that.\nChris O'Connell\nGreat. Appreciate all the color. Thanks, Chris, Janet. Great, quarter.\nChris Becker\nAll right. You’re welcome.\nJanet Verneuille [00:27:27]\nThank you.\nOperator\nAll right. Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will turn the floor\nback to Chris Becker for closing comments.\nChris Becker- Closing Comments [00:27:39]\nYes. Thank you for your attention and participation on the call today. We remain focused on\nmaking the right decisions to increase shareholder value over the long term. I thank our\nemployees for their continued dedication to service our customers and communities. Enjoy\nthe upcoming weekend.\nFNBLI 2Q 2024 Earnings Call Transcript Page 13 of 13"

A copy of the earnings release is available on the Corporation’s\nwebsite at FNBLI.com and on the earnings call webpage at\nhttps://www.cstproxy.com/fnbli/earnings/2024/q1.\nBefore we begin, the Company would like to remind everyone that this call may contain certain\nstatements that constitute forward-looking statements made under the safe harbor provisions of\nthe U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to risks,\nuncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those\ncontained in any such statements, including as set forth in the company’s filings with the U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission. Investors should also refer to our 2023 10-K filed on March\n8, 2024, for a list of risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those\nindicated or implied by such statements.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Chris Becker.\nChris Becker- Opening Remarks [00:01:34]\nThank you. Good afternoon and welcome to The First of Long Island Corporation’s earnings call for\nfirst quarter of 2024.\nJust last week we held our Annual Stockholders Meeting and covered a number of key topics of\ninterest. Please visit the Investor Relations page of our FNBLI.com website to re-play the\npresentation. It focuses on the key strengths of our organization, the causes of the current\nearnings challenges, how an improving yield curve can lift performance, and the many benefits of\nour recent technology upgrades.\nFocusing on our strengths, capital remains strong at the end of the first quarter with a leverage\nratio of 10% and a tangible common equity ratio of 8.9%.\nWe had ample liquidity on March 31, 2024, of $1.5 billion with a balance of collateral for potential\nFNBLI 4Q 2022 Earnings Call Transcript Page 1 of 13\nborrowings at both the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York and the Federal Reserve Bank as\nwe believe both are an appropriate source for day-to-day liquidity needs. The Federal Reserve\nBank is working to eliminate the stigma of being the lender of last resort, especially with recent\nreports and discussions regarding the Federal Home Loan Bank System’s charter of supporting\nlow and moderate housing initiatives verses its role as a primary source of liquidity for banks.\nOur C&I loans, including owner-occupied commercial mortgages, increased 6% since year-end\nand we are encouraged by recent activity that is not yet reflected in our March 31, 2024, loan\npipeline of $113 million, up from $86 million at year-end 2023.\nOur credit quality remained rock solid through March 31, 2024, with charge-offs, nonperforming\nloans and past-due loans remaining at single-digit basis points as a percentage of total loans.\nNoninterest income had a good first quarter and was slightly ahead of our guidance of $2.6 million\nper quarter in 2024.\nNoninterest expense was slightly below our guidance of $6.25 million per quarter in 2024.\nWe have a new technology platform to support future growth.\nWe are opening our fourth branch on the East End of Long Island during the second quarter of this\nyear continuing our growing momentum in that area.\nWe are staying disciplined in a difficult environment. We do not bend on credit quality. We focus\non adding one relationship banker at a time and look to build long-standing relationships. Our\ndeposit base has a history of being loyal through good and bad news in the banking world and we\nwant to keep it that way.\nAs anticipated, our net interest margin was lower in the first quarter of 2024. The drop was largely\nrelated to our average funding mix as approximately $100 million shifted from average deposits to\naverage wholesale funds when comparing the first quarter of 2024 to the fourth quarter of 2023.\nWe also had $62.5 million of wholesale funding reprice from a weighted average cost of 1.36% to\n4.78%. Regarding the drop in deposits, during the fourth quarter of 2023, $34.2 million in tax\nescrow deposits were used to make real estate tax payments and municipal deposits were down\n$97.5 million. Escrow deposits build back throughout the year as monthly loan payments are\nreceived. Municipal deposits were $46.6 million higher at March 31, 2024, when compared to the\nlinked quarter. The fluctuations in tax escrow and municipal deposits are common for our Bank in\nthe fourth quarter. Real estate tax payments are made every year in the fourth quarter and\nmunicipal deposits have been down in the fourth quarter four of the last five years by an average of\n$54.4 million. Our commercial and consumer relationship deposits remained stable and non-\ninterest-bearing checking deposits were 33% of total deposits at the end of the first quarter.\nFNBLI 4Q 2022 Earnings Call Transcript Page 2 of 13\nPlease note that while average deposits were lower during the quarter, quarter-end deposits were\nhigher than year-end 2023 by over $55 million. As of the end of the first quarter, there are no\nsignificant tranches of wholesale funding, including any brokered CDs, that are not at or close to\nmarket rates. Our retail CDs maturing over the next twelve months are largely at current market\nrates, especially after approximately $87 million in maturities in April and May that are paying very\nclose to 4% and are expected to reprice at an estimated 50 to 75 basis points higher. Barring any\nsignificant changes in our funding mix or short-term rates moving higher, we believe our margin\nshould be at the bottom. We expect it will fluctuate within a narrow band for the remainder of 2024.\nAlthough, continued improvement in our funding mix or a more favorable yield curve may improve\nmargin in the second half of the year.\nJanet Verneuille will now take you through financial highlights of the first quarter. Janet.\nJanet Verneuille [00:07:40]\nThank you, Chris. Good afternoon, everyone:\nThe Company recognized net income of $4.4 million for first quarter of 2024, down from $6.5\nmillion in the first quarter of 2023. The decrease was largely attributed to lower net interest income\nof $5.5 million, a $1.1 million credit provision for loan losses in 2023, partially offset by the loss on\nsale of securities of $3.5 million in the first quarter of 2023. Net income was also down from $6.1\nmillion in the linked quarter. That decrease was mainly the result of lower net interest income of\n$1.8 million and an increase in salaries and employee benefits of $1.9 million, due to the reversal\nof incentive accruals taken in the linked quarter.\nAfter excluding the loss on the sale of securities in 2023, noninterest income of $2.8 million\nexceeded noninterest income recorded in the first quarter of 2023 of $2.5 million. The quarters\nnoninterest income also exceeded the linked quarter of $2.4 million. Better service charge income\non deposit accounts and BOLI income helped in both quarter comparisons.\nNoninterest expense totaled $16.2 million which is a decline of $365,000, or 2.2%, compared to\nthe first quarter of 2023. The linked quarter had a lot of noise related to reversals of incentive\naccruals, so the comparison is not as meaningful.\nGross loans declined $11.5 million from the prior quarter end mainly related to $21.2 million of\namortization and other paydowns of residential mortgages and home equity lines. This decline\nwas offset by continued growth in our commercial portfolios as Chris mentioned. The overall loan\nyield of 4.14% was up 5 basis points from the linked quarter. Loan yield for the first quarter of\n2023 was 3.70%.\nFNBLI 4Q 2022 Earnings Call Transcript Page 3 of 13\nTotal deposits increased $55.5M from year end. The mix of the deposits continues to change as\ncustomers move out of noninterest bearing checking accounts and into interest bearing\nalternatives. As Chris mentioned average deposits were down approximately $100 million from the\nlinked quarter. The average cost of deposits was 2.64% for the first quarter of 2024, 2.43% for the\nlinked quarter, and 1.40% for first quarter of 2023.\nOther borrowings averaged $523.1 million for the first quarter as the drop in deposits was\nsupplemented partially by these advances. The average cost of these borrowings was 4.82% in the\nfirst quarter of 2024, 4.59% in the linked quarter, and 3.79% in the first quarter of 2023.\nNet interest income and the net interest margin for the first quarter reflects the challenges\ndescribed above. The purchase of the fixed to floating swap, and the repositioning of a portion of\nthe investment securities portfolio, in the first quarter of 2023 continued to positively impact the\nincome statement above the line. Yet the pace of the repricing of the liability side of the balance\nsheet continued to outpace the repricing of the assets on the balance sheet.\nNet interest income for first quarter of 2024 declined $1.8 million dollars from the linked quarter and\n$5.5 million from the first quarter of 2023. The net interest margin calculated to 1.79% in the first\nquarter of 2024, 2.0% in the linked quarter, and 2.34% in the first quarter of 2023. The yield on total\nearning assets was 4.10% in the first quarter of 2024, 4.0% in the linked quarter, and 3.61% in the\nfirst quarter of 2023. Cost of total interest-bearing liabilities is 3.47% in the first quarter of 2024,\n3.15% in the linked quarter, and 1.96% in the first quarter of 2023.\nNo provision was booked to the Allowance for Credit Losses during the quarter. The Commercial\nReal Estate market remains under heightened scrutiny, especially in the New York metropolitan\narea, in the wake of credit problems disclosed by New York Community Bank at year-end 2023.\nAlthough the New York State Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act passed in 2019, most\nrecently the ripple impact of the legislation is negatively affecting the rent regulated multifamily real\nestate market in the New York metropolitan area.\nManagement has provided detailed disclosures on our CRE portfolio including our multifamily\nportfolio in an 8K furnished on March 1, 2024, and in our recent Annual Meeting presentation. We\nbelieve the credit quality of the loan portfolio remains strong. The reserve coverage ratio on March\n31, 2024 is 88 basis points compared to 89 basis points at year-end 2023.\nBook value per share was $16.78 on March 31, 2024 versus $16.43 on March 31, 2023. The\naccumulated other comprehensive loss component of stockholders’ equity is mainly comprised of a\nnet unrealized loss in the available-for-sale securities portfolio due to higher market interest rates.\nThe Company repurchased shares during the first quarter of 2024 at a cost of $2.0 million and the\nFNBLI 4Q 2022 Earnings Call Transcript Page 4 of 13\nBank declared its quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share.\nThe effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2024 was 6.2% as tax-advantaged assets of loans in\nour REIT subsidiary, municipal bonds and BOLI were a larger portion of taxable income during the\nquarter.\nWith that I turn it back to our operator for questions.\nOperator [14:08]\nThank you. Our first question for today comes from Alex Twerdahl-Piper Sandler. Alex, please\nproceed with your question.\nAlex Twerdahl-Piper Sandler\nHey. Good afternoon.\nChris Becker/ Janet Verneuille\nGood afternoon, Alex.\nAlex Twerdahl\nAt first on the loan outlook: Chris, you talk a little bit about the commercial loan growth you saw this\nquarter and that pipeline building. It's still, however, a pretty small percentage of the overall pie.\nSo, I was hoping maybe you can just help us frame sort of the opportunity and the outlook for that,\nthe commercial portfolio overall, and where you think it over time might eventually get to as a\npercentage of the overall loan book.\nChris Becker\nSo, the commercial--well, let's break it down, right? The CNI portfolio and owner-occupied\nportfolio…you know, was at 11% of the total portfolio. And then obviously we have the commercial\nreal estate portfolio, which is over half of the portfolio. So, we like…we certainly…we're happy with\nthe size of where the commercial real estate portfolio is. We still want that piece of the pie in the\nresidential side, which is still over 35% of the portfolio to come down. And the CNI and owner-\noccupied piece is the piece we want to grow. If I could, if I can look forward and look at that pie, I'd\nlove to see four equal slices. I'd love to see about 25% in multifamily, about 25% in other CRE,\nabout 25% in residential, and about 25% in CNI and owner-occupied. But it's going to take some\ntime for the CNI and owner-occupied to get there. And when I say “some time”, that…you're talking\nFNBLI 4Q 2022 Earnings Call Transcript Page 5 of 13\nyears, not months, but that's certainly the direction we're moving. And we've, you know, we've just\nhired another middle market lenders. You know, we've grown our middle market team over the\npast four years. And, you know, some activities picking up there. You see our pipeline is up a little\nbit quarter over quarter. And, you know, we want to keep growing that. But the…you know, the\nactivity is, has been quiet. You know, the rates are obviously impacting that. Some of the…on the\nreal estate side, commercial real estate side, you know, we're seeing some opportunities from\nother banks, but quite often the loans have to be right-sized because of the current interest rate\nenvironment. And not everybody's willing to do that, so it does remain challenging out there. And\nthat's why you see very low growth rates in the industry and some banks shrinking a little bit.\nAlex Twerdahl\nYeah. Then that makes sense. I mean, as you kind of think about those four equal slices over time\nand totally get it's going to take a while to get there, do you see it kind of being sort of a flattish\noverall loan book, or is the overall loan book grow as well? And I guess when you think about loan\ngrowth for this year and the pipelines and the opportunities, are they sufficient to keep the loan\nbook at a current level, just running against that amortization and the payoff activity that you\nalluded to earlier in the call?\nChris Becker\nI think so. We're still thinking, you know, low single-digit growth for the year, even though we were\ndown a little bit in the first quarter and mainly related to payoffs in the residential portfolio, not in the\ncommercial side. So, when you look at our pipeline numbers that we talk about in our earnings\ncalls and, or state in our press or our earnings releases, depending on, you know, where we talk\nabout them, and then you look at what we close in a quarter, the numbers are much more in line\nwith each other. And I think every bank, you know, decides how to disclose their pipeline numbers\na little bit differently. I hear pipeline numbers of some banks that are very large, but then when I\nsee closings for the quarter, they're not very large. And there seems to be, to me, a little bit of\ndisconnect, but I just think that's the way everybody looks at it. When we look at our pipeline, we\nlook at, obviously, loans that are approved and ready to close and we look at, you know, LOIs that\nare signed and agreed upon. And we've already vetted those credits closely, and they have a very\nhigh probability of getting to closing. So, I think, you know, looking at our number, which is\nprobably a little bit more on the conservative side, the way we report it, is probably why it looks\nmaybe a little bit lower than some others.\nFNBLI 4Q 2022 Earnings Call Transcript Page 6 of 13\nAlex Twerdahl\nOkay. Understood. Thanks for that, Caller. You know, as you--I think, Janet, as you're going\nthrough some of the repricing on the borrowing and sort of what new stuff's coming on today, and\nyou kind of look at it against, you know, the securities portfolio… I mean, it's clear that there's\nsome, you know, less efficient leverage on the balance sheet today that I know is not necessarily\ngoing to be super cheap to get out of, but you have a pretty healthy capital position. So, as you\nthink about using capital today, you know, how do you weigh some restructuring either similar to\nwhat you did last year or something else, to kind of get rid of some of that leverage that maybe is\nupside down right now?\nJanet Verneuille\nWe have modeled various scenarios out. We usually look at the payback period to see if it makes\nsense. We will consider, you know, as we go forward and we have some room with liquidity,\nmaybe putting some investment securities on. But for the first quarter, it just didn't make sense.\nChris Becker\nThe year-end back periods on some of the things we looked at… if you start getting out to 5 or 6\nyears, we don't think that makes a lot of sense. So, we…but we continue to monitor that. We look\nat that on both the securities and loan side.\nAlex Twerdahl\nYeah, I mean, totally get it. Are there pieces of the securities portfolio that are…have a shorter\nweighted average life or sort of cash flows that you could see over the next year or two that you\ncould accelerate and do something today just to give us some near-term boost to the NIM?\nJanet Verneuille\nNot at the moment, I would say. We'll continue to look at that, but there's nothing-- when we look at\nthe investment portfolio, I mean, the munis are paying down, but some of the mortgage\nbacks…that, they're longer…the CMOs.\nChris Becker\nFNBLI 4Q 2022 Earnings Call Transcript Page 7 of 13\nThe mortgage-backed portfolio is similar to our residential portfolio. There's, you know, a lot of the\nunderlying loans in the mortgage-backed portfolio is not a lot of prepayments coming in if the\nunderlying mortgage is at 3% or 3.5%.\nAlex Twerdahl\nYeah, okay.\nI wanted to…I really liked all the disclosure you guys put in your slide deck, with respect to the\nmultifamily, and was looking at the weighted average debt service coverage ratio after reset for\nsome of the stuff that's resetting in ‘24 and ‘25, which is pretty helpful, and I haven't seen a lot of\nthat, so thanks for giving us that information. I was wondering if you had at your fingertips, and\nmaybe you don't just, you know, we kind of all can guess at what the rates are going to do and sort\nof the interest in the debt service. But, you know, in terms of the net operating income of some of\nthese properties, you know, for both the regulated and the free market, do you have a sense for\nwhether or not those NOIs are starting to come down in the next year or two, or how do you think\nabout that piece of the equation for the debt service coverage ratio?\nChris Becker\nI don't have specific numbers for you, but I do see NOIs coming down and the NOIs are coming\ndown because of inflation. I mean, we're seeing…when we're looking at new opportunities or when\nyou're looking at loans that are up, you know, for a rate reset, we're just doing annual reviews. You\nknow, certain areas: utility expenses, insurance…we've seen insurance rates on some loans triple\nsince the loan was originally booked. So, the expense side is really also a challenge, right? When\nyou think about the multifamily, you do have a lot of rent-regulated properties in that space. But if\nyou see properties that look like they may have some stress on cash flow, it's more related to the\nhigher interest rates at reset and the expenses. So, it's not necessarily related to the regulations\nand to the 2019 legislation that was passed.\nAlex Twerdahl\nRight. Okay. I mean, I guess when you guys think about underwriting these things and resetting\nthem, then what's sort of the magic number on debt service coverage ratio that you feel\ncomfortable with?\nFNBLI 4Q 2022 Earnings Call Transcript Page 8 of 13\nChris Becker\nWell, listen, if it's new stuff, if you look at policy and you'll go down to maybe 125, but if you look at\nreality where we book things and we've talked about it and obviously provide a lot of guidance on\nit, we generally book things at the average weighted average debt service coverage ratio about 1.8\ntimes and 50% LTVs. And that's consistent with the information that we put out there in both our\nannual meeting and the 8-K. So, you know, that that leaves you a lot of room. And when we also\nput the additional information in our annual meeting when we talked about what the…looking at\nwhat was resetting in ‘24 and ‘25 and we assumed that they all reset at March 31 of this year, the\ndebt service coverage ratios, you know, basically went from the 180 to the 140s. Still a strong debt\nservice coverage ratio and certainly loans--if it was a new loan coming in that we would look at\nseriously assuming all the other metrics were in good shape--but looking at those changes, right,\nthat's basically about a 20% drop in the debt service coverage ratio, okay? So, if you were to write\nloans at a minimum debt service coverage ratio--and banks have different: some have a minimum\nof 115, some 120, 125; but if you had a 125 and if you did book a full loan and it was at a 125 debt\nservice coverage ratio at the time you booked it, and that 20% decrease kind of held on across the\nboard that you're seeing on average from what we showed you for ‘24 and ’25, then that loan\nwould go down to about 1 to 1. So, you know, it would obviously be in a more of a stretched stress\nsituation, but it would be covering itself. There just would be no excess cash flow for the borrower,\nbut they would be able to cover their expenses. So that 20% threshold for us, from what we're\nseeing, kind of seems to be the number where things are falling. And I would guess that's probably\npretty consistent throughout the industry, because everybody's kind of looking at the same rates\nand everybody's kind of looking at the same type of properties.\nAlex Twerdahl\nThat's really helpful, Caller Chris, I appreciate all the comments. Thanks for taking my questions.\nChris Becker\nThanks, Alex. Appreciate it.\nOperator [00:26:12]\nThank you, Alex. Our next question comes from Chris O'Connell at KBW. Chris, you can proceed\nwith your question.\nFNBLI 4Q 2022 Earnings Call Transcript Page 9 of 13\nChris O’Connell-KBW\nThanks. Following up on the multifamily discussion: the slide with that service coverage ratios--it\nshows the 2025 free market at 2…almost 2.2 times. Is there anything unusual in that? It just seems\nreally, really strong for it to be that high before the rate resets kick in.\nChris Becker\nNo, there is nothing unusual in that. I mean, we're pretty consistent in the way we underwrite and\nthere's nothing unusual in that number. I mean, when you look at our overall portfolio and it's 190\nwhen the entire CRE portfolio…it's certainly not going to be unusual to have some segments\nabove 2 and some below.\nChris O’Connell\nGot it. And then circling back to just the overall loan growth discussion, can you give us what the\nyield on that $118 million pipeline is?\nChris Becker\nThe yield on the pipeline is always tough because a lot of them are, you know, floating off of an\nindex until they close, but I can tell you in the first quarter, the closings for the first quarter were just\nabout 7%. It was within a few basis points of 7%. So, based on the fact that rates haven't changed\nthat much, I know we've seen some ups and downs on the Treasury curve, but I'm going to say it's\nprobably pretty close to that, but I don't have an exact number on that. But it shouldn't be too\ndifferent from the 7% number.\nChris O’Connell\nGot it. And for the remainder of the year or next 12 months… I know you gave us on the combined\nbasis, I think, last quarter. But do you have just what the dollar amount of loans either repricing or\nmaturing are? And then securities, but the separate balances of each?\nChris Becker\nSo, what we put out there is we generally have about 80 to 90 million dollars in quarterly cash flow\nFNBLI 4Q 2022 Earnings Call Transcript Page 10 of 13\ncoming in. I know that's not necessarily loans repricing, but that's quarterly cash flow coming in\nrepricing. I don't have--other than what we've put out on CRE and what's repricing on the\nmultifamily portfolio--I don't have the total amount. Because again, when you look at the CNI side,\nright, you have lines of credit, you know, paying up, paying down and moving around. So, you can't\nalways tell when the usage…when the line usage is going to be up or be down a little bit from\nquarter to quarter, and that does fluctuate. So, I don't have specific numbers on that. But that's\nsomething that we can try to put together better for the next quarter for you.\nChris O’Connell\nYep. No problem. I guess what I'm getting at is after we get past the second quarter with some of\nthese May and April kind of final CD repricings, you seem to be a little bit more tepid on the back\nend of the year. You know, NIM rebounding this quarter and it seems like the CDs will pretty much\nfully reprice the borrowings, are more or less fully repriced, and you're going to be getting\nimprovement, although slow, with the asset side, are you thinking about just being conservative?\nOr do you think the NIM is going to be going up in the second half of the year?\nChris Becker\nI think we're being conservative because whenever you're not conservative it seems to, you know,\ncome back just like everybody thought going into this year or the market was certainly thinking\nthere was going to be seven rate decreases, and now we don't know if there's going to be any,\nright? So, the feds still saying they're going to do something, maybe 2 or 3 or what have you, but\nthere's others saying that maybe it doesn't happen till next year. So, you do get a little\nconservative, and then you have some unexpected changes in the mix a little bit, and you still do\nhave money moving out of DDA. So, conservatively, you know, we say, hey, if there's if the mix is\ngood and we get some relief on the rate side, we see margin being able to move up. But, when\nyou look at our overall liability side, as we've said, the higher cost stop, the wholesale funding, any\nbrokered CDs, the retail CDs…I mean, that is really largely repriced, right? There's a few little\nthings here and there, but nothing real significant, so that's largely repriced. When we look at our\nnon-maturity deposits, savings-now money market accounts, they've been continuing to go up but\nat a decreasing pace. And you can see those numbers in our NIM tables for the past several\nquarters. And those numbers have moved down from an average of about 17 basis points a\nmonth--when you go back to the first quarter of last year--down to about 7 basis points a month--\nwhen you look at the first quarter of this year. So, when you look at that, and if you look at that on,\nsay, about 1…$1.6 billion, and you apply how much extra interest cost is that going to be, and then\nFNBLI 4Q 2022 Earnings Call Transcript Page 11 of 13\nif we look at our cash flow that we talk about coming in the 80 to 90 million a quarter coming in on\nloans and securities, and if we look at a number of, say, 2 or 2 to 3%, 2.5% on that repricing up\nand just simply taking a 3.5% loan and saying it's going to reprice to six, for argument's sake, and\nuse that number, that repricing on that asset side, that small group of assets coming in because it's\ngoing to be a much larger repricing than where we currently are on the non-maturity deposits,\nthere's upside potential there. Right? We believe that that trend in the non-maturity deposits,\ncoming down from that 17 basis points a month to 7, it's been coming down fairly consistently over\nthat period of time, so, that could very well continue. But, if something happens it could go back up\na little bit. So, I think we're being on the conservative side a little when you when you boil it down to\nwhat's really repricing now and where the pressures may be. I would say it leans towards the\nupside, but there's always the unknowns every quarter, right? We went down 21 basis points in\nmargin this quarter, which was higher than I would have expected it to go down, but we just had an\nunfortunate change in mix from quarter to quarter that seems to be correcting now as we see the\nend of the first quarter numbers. But you do, you know, there is always the unexpected in there.\nChris O’Connell\nUnderstood. And just on the capital position: you guys bought back a little bit of shares this quarter.\nYou were a little cautious on the buyback last quarter. Is it's something that you think you will\ncontinue from here?\nJanet Verneuille\nWe take a look at it every quarter and depending on the capital position, we would consider buying\nback shares for sure in the upcoming months.\nChris O’Connell\nGreat. And then last one for me is just: what's the good go-forward tax rate?\nJanet Verneuille\nWell, I know we guided to 12 at the beginning of the year. We came in at six and a quarter. We're\nstarting to max out on the tax benefit of the REIT. So, I think, I do think the tax rate is going to be\ngoing up. I would say somewhere in the middle of the six and a quarter and the 12 that we guided\nFNBLI 4Q 2022 Earnings Call Transcript Page 12 of 13\nat the beginning of the year.\nChris O’Connell\nOkay, great. Thanks for the time.\nJanet Verneuille\nYou're welcome.\nChris Becker\nThanks, Chris.\nOperator [00:35:36]\nThank you. This concluded our question-and-answer session. I will turn the floor back over to Chris\nBecker for closing comments.\nChris Becker- Closing Remarks\nYeah, thank you for your attention and participation on the call today, and we look forward to\ntalking to everybody at the end of the second quarter. Have a good rest of the day.\nFNBLI 4Q 2022 Earnings Call Transcript Page 13 of 13"

Applicants and guarantors must have a satisfactory credit history and demonstrate the ability to repay through documentation such as\nfinancial statements, leases, and rent rolls. In processing requests for commercial mortgage loans, the Bank obtains independent appraisals in accordance with regulatory\nrequirements and an appropriate environmental assessment. All properties are inspected by Bank personnel and/or approved third-party vendors before closing on the mortgage and\nannually thereafter for loans over $2.5 million. Properties may also be re-inspected if concerns arise during the Bank’s annual review process described below. Commercial mortgage\nloans generally mature in 10 years with amortization schedules ranging between 20 and 30 years. We strive to reprice commercial mortgage loans every five years although pricing\nmay be fixed for longer terms. The Bank will generally not lend more than 75% of appraised value for investment properties, including multifamily properties.\nThe Bank completes annual management reviews on at least 80% of the outstanding balance of commercial mortgage loans. Additionally, an independent third-party loan review\nconsulting firm completes annual reviews on at least 60% of the outstanding balance of commercial mortgage loans. Results of the entire management and third-party annual review\nscope are reported to the Board Loan Committee. Management completes a quarterly commercial real estate market analysis using a combination of internal and third-party data to\nassess the risks in the portfolio. The market analysis includes, among other things, a vintage analysis, capital concentrations, geographic concentrations, property type\nconcentrations, broker concentrations, risk rating data, average LTV trends, average DSCR trends, delinquency trends and loss trends. The market analysis also includes third-party\nvendor narratives on the markets where we lend that detail trends such as average rents, vacancy rates, income growth, job growth trends, absorption rates, cap rates and new units\ncoming to market, among other information.\nThe Bank’s credit risk management processes have produced historically strong asset quality metrics and today’s underwriting standards are consistent with past practices, some of\nwhich are indicated below.\nMinimum DSCR Maximum LTV Use Actual Low Interest\nInspections\nRequirement of\n80%, Current Only Exposure,\nCashflow, Not\nRequired\n1.25x, Current Portfolio is Closer 1.8% of Total\nProjections\nPortfolio is to 50%\nLoans\nOver 2x\nFirst of Long Island Corporation | Investor Presentation 3\nTotal Loans*\nMultifamily\n26%\nResidential\nMortgage\n$3.25B\n37%\nNon Owner-\nOccupied\nCommercial\n25%\nConstruction\n1%\nOwner Occupied /\nCommercial &\nIndustrial\n11%\n*Consumer loans less than 1%\nFirst of Long Island Corporation | Investor Presentation 4\nCommercial Real Estate Loans\nLTV Asset Quality Metrics:\nConstruction\n(Weighted Average)\n1%\n52% • Classified/Criticized* – 0.63%\nMultifamily\nOwner- 45% • Non-Performing* – 0.00%\nOccupied\nCommercial\n• Past Due* – 0.05%\nDSCR 12% $1.9B\n(Weighted Average) • Charge-Offs in 2023* – 0.00%\n2.25x\nNon Owner-\nOccupied\nCommercial\n42%\n36-Month Growth\n(12/31/20-12/31/23)\n35.1% 59% of Total Loan Portfolio\nAverage Loan Size – $2.4 million\n* As a percentage of the total loans\nFirst of Long Island Corporation | Investor Presentation 5\nMMuullttiiffaammiillyy LLooaannss\nLTV Asset Quality Metrics:\nRate Reset\n(Weighted Average)\n52% • Classified/Criticized* – 0.00%\n0–12-Months\nMultifamily\n82%\n• Non-Performing* – 0.00%\n$73.5M\n• Past Due* – 0.00%\nDSCR $857M\n(Weighted Average) • Charge-Offs in 2023* – 0.00%\n13–24-Months\n1.91x\nMultifamily $88.4M\nMixed Use\n18%\nLong\nOther\nManhattan\nIsland\n4%\n15%\n36-Month Growth 19%\n(12/31/20-12/31/23)\nQueens\nMKT\n10.3% 26% of Total Loan Portfolio 12%\nBrooklyn\nAverage Loan Size – $2.4M\n31%\nBronx\n19%\n* As a percentage of the total loans\nFirst of Long Island Corporation | Investor Presentation 6\nMultifamily – Majority Free Market\nLTV\nAsset Quality Metrics:\n(Weighted Average)\n51%\n• Classified/Criticized* – 0.00%\nNYC Majority Outside NYC\nFree Market 22%\n• Non-Performing* – 0.00%\n25%\n• Past Due* – 0.00%\nDSCR\n$857M\n(Weighted Average)\n• Charge-Offs in 2023* – 0.00%\n1.94x NYC Majority\nNYC 100%\nRent\nRent\nRegulated\nRegulated Rate Reset\n23%\n30%\nLoan Size 0–12-Months 13–24-Months\nMaturity MaturiLtyTV LTV DSCR\n$29.3M $35.5M\n(Average) (Five year) (Weighted Average) (three year)\n50% 41.4%\n$2.4M 50% 41.4% 1.76x\n12% of Total Loan Portfolio\n* As a percentage of the total loans\nFirst of Long Island Corporation | Investor Presentation 7\nMultifamily – 100% Rent Regulated\nLTV Asset Quality Metrics:\n(Weighted Average)\n53% • Classified/Criticized* – 0.00%\nNYC Majority Outside NYC\nFree Market 22%\n• Non-Performing* – 0.00%\n25%\n• Past Due* – 0.00%\nDSCR $857M\n(Weighted Average)\n• Charge-Offs* in 2023 – 0.00%\nNYC Majority\n1.97x NYC 100%\nRent\nRent\nRegulated\nRegulated\n23% Rate Reset\n30%\n0–12-Months 13–24-Months\nLoan Size\n$24.4M $20.2M\n(Average)\n$2.2M\n8% of Total Loan Portfolio\n* As a percentage of the total loans\nFirst of Long Island Corporation | Investor Presentation 8\nMultifamily – Majority Rent Regulated\nLTV\nAsset Quality Metrics:\n(Weighted Average)\n52% • Classified/Criticized* – 0.00%\nNYC Majority\nOutside NYC\nFree Market\n22% • Non-Performing* – 0.00%\n25%\n• Past Due* – 0.00%\nDSCR $857M\n(Weighted Average)\n• Charge-Offs* in 2023 – 0.00%\nNYC 100%\n1.77x NYC Majority\nRent\nRent\nRegulated\nRegulated\n30%\nRate Reset\n23%\n0–12-Months 13–24-Months\nLoan Size\nMaturity LTV\n$19.7M $32.6M\n(Average) (Five year) (Weighted Average)\n$2.6M 50% 41.4%\n6% of Total Loan Portfolio\n* As a percentage of the total loans\nFirst of Long Island Corporation | Investor Presentation 9\nOffice – Non-Owner Occupied\nLTV Asset Quality Metrics:\n(Weighted Average)\n57% • Classified/Criticized – 0.43%*\nQueens\nManhattan 19% • Non-Performing – 0.00%\n<1%\nLong Island • Past Due – 0.00%\nDSCR Brooklyn\n$219M 54%\n6%\n(Weighted Average) • Charge-Offs in 2023 – 0.00%\nBronx\n1.73x\n8%\nOther\n13% Rate Reset\n36-Month Growth 0–12-Months 13–24-Months\n(12/31/20-12/31/23) $1.6M $12.3M\n41.2% 7% of Total Loan Portfolio\nAverage Loan Size – $4.3M\n* As a percentage of the total loans\nFirst of Long Island Corporation | Investor Presentation 10"

On the call today are Chris Becker, President and Chief Executive Officer\nand Janet Verneuille, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nToday’s call is being recorded. A copy of the earnings release is available on the\nCorporation’s website at FNBLI.com and on the earnings call webpage at\nhttps://www.cstproxy.com/fnbli/earnings/2023/q4.\nBefore we begin, the Company would like to remind everyone that this call may contain\ncertain statements that constitute forward-looking statements made under the safe harbor\nprovisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are\nsubject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ\nmaterially from those contained in any such statements, including as set forth in the\ncompany’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Investors should also\nrefer to our 2022 10-K filed on March 9, 2023, as supplemented by our 10-Q for the quarter\nended September 30, 2023, for a list of risk factors that could cause actual results to differ\nmaterially from those indicated or implied by such statements.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Chris Becker.\nChris Becker [ 00:01:37]\nThank you. Good afternoon and welcome to The First of Long Island Corporation’s earnings\ncall for fourth quarter and year-end of 2023.\nI am proud to say key aspects of our transformation strategy which began in 2020 are\nlargely in the rearview. The Bank has a fresh look, top notch technology, innovative\npartnerships, a more efficient branch network, bankers focused on commercial\nrelationship growth, a proven history of strong asset quality all of which is underpinned by\na strong capital position with leverage and tangible capital ratios of 10.1% and 9.0%,\nrespectively. Combined with optimism about short-term rates moving lower, especially for\na Bank that remains generally liability-sensitive, we enter 2024 with a bright outlook for the\nfuture.\nAs reported in our first quarter 2023 earnings call, we proactively completed two balance\nsheet repositioning transactions that converted approximately $450 million of fixed rate\nassets to floating rates to lessen our liability sensitivity. These two transactions were\ngenerating over $2 million in quarterly pre-tax earnings as we entered 2024. It was the right\nmove in early 2023. As we considered similar transactions throughout the remainder of the\nyear, the benefit of rates staying flat or moving up did not outweigh the risk of rates\nmoving down. We will consider additional strategies for 2024, but based on the current\nsentiment for rates, we believe we struck an appropriate balance so our net interest\nmargin can begin to bounce back nicely as short-term rates come down.\nThe technology upgrades announced in the summer of 2022 are built, tested, and planned\nto “Go Live” in February 2024. Upgrades to our technology include Fiserv’s DNA core\nprocessing system, business online banking, business mobile app, branch platform and\nteller systems, biometric identification and paper-eliminating efficiencies. I cannot thank\nour team enough for their outstanding work and dedication to this project. We believe our\nnew best-in-class systems will enhance customer experience and provide our bankers with\nthe tools needed to service our clients and generate new relationship-based business.\nThe transition to a more commercially focused institution that began in 2020 continued to\nmake progress in 2023 thanks to the hard work of our commercial lending teams and their\nbranch partners. A key component of this objective is growing our commercial and\nindustrial loan and owner-occupied mortgage business. This combined relationship-based\nportfolio has increased 12% per year on average since 2020 and our total commercial loan\nportfolio has grown a half a billion dollars over the same period.\nOther moves such as consolidating our back-office operations into a new administrative\nheadquarters, selling vacated buildings, closing branches and adjusting branch hours are\nall starting to pay dividends. Refreshing our brand and building a social media presence are\ngetting the bank noticed. We believe the Bank is now a much better company with a solid\nfooting both physically and digitally. Our team is 25% smaller than it was just four years\nago, but much more adept at meeting today’s challenges.\nJanet Verneuille will now take you through financial highlights of the full year and fourth\nquarter. Janet.\nJanet Verneuille [ 00:05:44]\nThanks, Chris. Good afternoon, everyone.\nNet income for 2023 totaled $26.2 million and fully diluted earnings per share were $1.16.\nThe Company’s return on average assets was 0.62% and its return on average equity was\n7.14%. Our performance for 2023 did not match up to the record net income and fully\ndiluted earnings per share performance the Company produced in 2022 of $46.9 million\nand $2.04, respectively. In 2022, ROA was 1.11% and ROE was 12.13%.\nThe overwhelming reason for the decline in earnings was the drop in the net interest\nmargin to 2.16% in 2023 from 2.89% in 2022. The pace of decline in the net interest margin\nhas slowed significantly throughout 2023, with the quarterly margin declining 57 basis\npoints in the first half of the year compared to 17 basis points in the second half of the\nyear. The Bank’s non-interest income, excluding net losses on sales of securities, pension\ncredits and other one-time items, was relatively flat when comparing 2023 and 2022.\nThe Bank’s non-interest expense for 2023 of $64 million decreased $3 million from $67\nmillion in 2022. Salaries and employee benefits declined by $3.7 million mostly due to\nlower incentive and stock-based compensation expense as the Bank fell short of its\nperformance metrics this year. An increase of over $700,000 in FDIC insurance expense\ndue to higher assessment rates partially offset the savings in incentive compensation.\nThe Bank’s effective tax rate was 11% for 2023 down from 19.4% in 2022. The decline in the\neffective tax rate was due to an increase in the percentage of pre-tax income derived from\nthe Bank’s real estate investment trust and Bank Owned Life Insurance.\nNet income for the fourth quarter of 2023 totaled $6.1 million, down $741,000 from the\nlinked quarter. The decrease was mostly due to lower net interest income of $1.5 million\nresulting from alternative higher priced funding that replaced seasonal deposit outflows.\nAdditionally, the provision for credit losses increased $1.1 million, as $1.6 million in net\ncharge-offs were partially offset by net improvements in various qualitative and\nquantitative factors in our ACL model. These items were partially offset by lower salaries\nand employee benefits expense and lower income tax expense for the same reasons\nmentioned previously for the full year of 2023.\nThe Bank’s net interest margin was 2.00% in the fourth quarter compared to 2.13% in the\nlinked quarter. The 13-basis point decrease in the net interest margin in the fourth quarter\nwas largely due to seasonal outflow of lower cost non-maturity deposits being replaced by\nhigher wholesale funding costs.\nThe Bank’s quarterly non-interest income was $2.4 million which is consistent with prior\nguidance and prior quarters.\nThe Bank’s non-interest expense decreased $1.4 million to $14.8 million compared to the\nlinked quarter. The decline is mostly attributable to lower incentive and stock-based\ncompensation expense, the same reason as for the full year.\nNet income for the fourth quarter of 2023 was down $3.8 million compared to the fourth\nquarter of 2022. The decrease was mainly attributable to the reasons cited with respect to\nthe year over year or linked quarter changes including a $7.8 million decline in net interest\nincome, an increase in the provision for credit losses of $818,000, a decline in salaries and\nemployee benefits expense of $2.7 million, and a decline in income tax expense of $1.7\nmillion.\nThe yield curve has been inverted for approximately 18 months, one of the longest periods\nin history and continues to make it difficult for Banks to utilize their excess capital to\nleverage the balance sheet. As far as the Balance Sheet is concerned…\nOn the asset side, the Bank continues to deploy approximately $80 to $90 million in\nquarterly cash flows from our securities and loan portfolios into new assets at current\nmarket rates. The Bank has approximately $860 million or 21% of interest earning assets\nmaturing or repricing within one year but remains liability sensitive.\nOn the liability side of the balance sheet, pricing pressure continued through year end.\nAlthough the Bank priced competitively to maintain deposit balances, total deposits on a\nlinked quarter declined 4.85% to $3.3 billion mostly due to seasonally lower municipal and\ntax escrow deposits. The deposits were replaced by overnight borrowings and FHLB\nadvances. The Bank’s total wholesale funding, including brokered deposits, was $648.7\nmillion or 15% of total assets on December 31, 2023, and had a weighted average cost of\nfunds of 4.66% and average maturity of 6 months. In addition, the Bank has $352 million in\nretail time deposits that mature in 2024 with an average cost of funds of 4.20%.\nAs this funding matures in the coming quarters, we anticipate some final additional upward\ncost pressure. However, management believes additional interest expense from liability\nrepricing will be largely offset by additional income as asset cashflows reprice higher\nleading to margin stabilization. Once the Federal Reserve begins to lower short-terms rates\nwe believe margin expansion should follow shortly thereafter.\nLiquidity indicators remain ample. We maintained $1.1 billion in collateralized borrowing\nlines with the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York and the Federal Reserve Bank. We also\nhad $386 million in unencumbered cash and securities. In total we had approximately $1.5\nbillion of available liquidity at the end of the quarter, which is well in excess of our\nuninsured and uncollateralized deposits.\nThe Bank did not repurchase any shares during 2023. We still have approximately $15\nmillion authorized under the most recent Board approved stock repurchase plan and given\nour strong capital levels will likely resume the buyback program in 2024.\nChris will talk a little bit now about 2024. Chris\nChris Becker [00:12:28]\nThanks, Janet. In preparing today’s remarks, I reviewed our fourth quarter 2022 earnings\ncall, which included forward-looking challenges for 2023. I specifically cited:\n• The Federal Reserve’s increases in interest rates have not been at this pace in over\n40-years putting downward pressure on the Bank’s net interest margin. We\nprojected a lower margin.\n• I mentioned the political and regulatory message of removing so called “junk fees” is\nlimiting the Bank’s ability to charge for the fundamental services we provide. We\nprojected noninterest income of $2.5 million per quarter in 2023.\n• I stated that regulatory oversight continues to pile on operational costs no matter\nan institutions size, but management efforts to create efficiencies through branch\nand back-office consolidations have kept expense growth in check. We projected\nnoninterest expenses between $16.5 and $17 million per quarter in 2023.\nAs we all know now, the Federal Reserve increased rates four more times during 2023\nputting more pressure on our net interest margin than anticipated. Backing out of our net\nloss on sales of securities we were spot on with our 2023 projected noninterest income\naveraging close to $2.5 million per quarter. And while thousands of more pages of\nregulatory guidance were issued, our noninterest expenses came in lower than projected\nprincipally due to lower incentive compensation expense. Other than incentive\ncompensation, noninterest expenses were in line with 2023 projections.\nLet’s consider these same three areas as we enter 2024.\n• First, our net interest margin. Our 2024 projections include the Federal Reserve\nbeginning to lower rates during the second half of the year. As Janet reported, our\nnet interest margin in the fourth quarter of 2023 was 2.00%. We currently believe\nthere will be downward pressure during the first quarter of 2024 with a leveling out\nduring the second quarter of the year. During the third and fourth quarters of 2024,\nwe are projecting the net interest margin to begin to recover as short-term rates\nbegin to come down. Our current thinking is consistent with my comments during\nour third quarter earnings call that the margin should bottom out over the next two\nquarters, referring to the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024.\n• Next our noninterest income. During 2023, we fine-tuned our business checking\naccount analysis program and adjusted service charges on consumer checking\naccounts to encourage more debit card and eStatement usage. These changes\nshould produce some additional fee income in 2024 and as such we are projecting\nnoninterest income to average $2.6 million per quarter in 2024.\n• Lastly, our noninterest expenses. Even though we are investing in new technology,\nour continued success with our branch optimization plan, back-office\nconsolidations, selling vacated buildings and eliminating our residential mortgage\ngroup, among other initiatives, have reduced our run rate of noninterest expenses.\nWe are projecting noninterest expenses to average 6.25 million per quarter in 2024,\nor $250,000 to $500,000 lower than 2023 guidance. Please note that our noninterest\nincome and noninterest expense guidance are averages and quarterly variances are\nlikely.\nWith that I will turn it back to our operator for questions.\nOperator [ 00:16:46]\nThank you. Our first question for today comes from Chris O'Connell from KBW. Chris,\nplease proceed with your question.\nChris O'Connell\nYeah, just on the last item on the guide, you said 6.25. That seems low.\nChris Becker\n16.25. Yes. Sorry.\nChris O'Connell\nOkay. Great. That's helpful. And does the compensation line, is that kind of reset back to\nnormal immediately for the for the first quarter?\nChris Becker\nYeah. It will reset back to normal for the first quarter. But, we do have some efficiencies\ngoing in there as from some of the branch consolidations and back office consolidations,\nour computer upgrades and such. And just from the work we've done throughout the year\non staffing in the branches. So, realize an entire year's benefit of that in 2024.\nChris O'Connell\nGreat. And then on the margin, it sounds like, maybe down a little bit in the first quarter,\nbut the pace of that should probably slow. Based on the funding costs kind of having a little\nbit less pressure into the first quarter. And some of the deposits may be coming back in on\nseasonality.\nChris Becker\nYes. If you look at the fourth quarter with some of the deposit outflows, which were the\nbulk of that, was some municipal deposit outflows. And in November and December each\nyear, we pay out from our escrow accounts, the real estate tax bills. So that number alone\nwas 35 million. And with those outflows, as Janet mentioned, that money going into\novernight borrowings, that's more expensive. That obviously pushed down the fourth\nquarter margin a little bit. So far, we've already brought 35 million back in this first quarter.\nSo, that will also help relieve some of that pressure as that money flows back in.\nChris O'Connell\nGreat. And regarding the second half of the year, with fed cuts, maybe you guys could\nprovide a little bit of color as to how you see the margin reacting. Depending on the level or\nthe pace of fed cuts and how much upward mobility it has.\nJanet Verneuille\nOkay, so for every 25 basis points that the fed cuts, over time, we're predicting that the\nmarginal improved 4 to 5 basis points. Again, this is over time, it depends obviously on\nmany factors. But that's where we're projecting it to increase.\nChris O'Connell\nGreat. And last one for me. What's a good go forward tax rate for 2024?\nJanet Verneuille\nSo, we're looking at between 12 and 13% for the next year. Some of the benefits of the REIT\nare capping out. So, it's going up slightly.\nChris O'Connell\nGreat. Thanks for taking my questions.\nChris Becker\nThank you. Chris.\nOperator [00:20:26]\nOur next question comes from Alex Twerdahl of Piper Sandler. Alex, please proceed with\nyour question.\nAlex Twerdahl\nHey. Good afternoon.\nChris Becker\nHey. Good afternoon. Alex.\nJanet Verneuille\nHi, Alex.\nAlex Twerdahl\nHey, I guess we'll start with sort of the outlook for the loan portfolio. Obviously, you guys\nhave plenty of capital. Liquidity, obviously not as much. And maybe that's a little more\nstrained, but as you kind of set yourself up for potential rate cuts and maybe some easing\nliquidity, there's funding costs. Do you think we could see a little bit more loan growth in\n2024?\nChris Becker\nWe do think there will be some growth in 2024. We don't think it's going to be as robust as\nwe would all like. But we do think that there'll be some lower single digit loan growth\nduring this year. Last year loans were pretty flat throughout the year to down. And\nhopefully with some rate relief. And really, you've already seen some of that because\nyou've seen five- and ten-year rates come off of their highs. So, that does also provide\nsome rate relief as the loan rates are pricing off. More of that end of the curve. So, we're,\nanticipating to see some additional volume, the pipeline at the end of the year was not\noverly robust, about 100 million, at year end. But there are certainly some more\nconversations going on and some more activity. So, encouraged that that pipeline is going\nto grow.\nAlex Twerdahl\nGot it. And I think in the past you've given us sort of the average yield on the pipeline. Are\nyou able to provide that?\nChris Becker\nThe pipelines are always difficult, right? Because it's floating, kind of, with the rates moving\nevery day. But I can tell you that the loan closings that we had in the fourth quarter, the\nyield was right around 7%. So, it should be pretty much in line with that. Shouldn't stray too\nmuch from that.\nAlex Twerdahl\nGreat. And I just wanted to ask you how you guys are thinking about the dividend going\nforward.\nJanet Verneuille\nWell, we look at the dividend, obviously every quarter. We analyze it. And right now, we're\nexpecting that we'll continue to pay the dividend going forward.\nAlex Twerdahl\nYeah, at the current level, because I know you guys have a pretty extensive history of\nincreasing the dividend annually, and it's something that probably has given you a lot of, I\ndon't want to say people have relied on it, but it's a nice streak. Is that a consideration? Or\nis it really that you’ve got to take one quarter at a time and look at it from a payout ratio\nstandpoint and from a capital standpoint.\nChris Becker\nYou know, we appreciate that streak. I think our shareholders appreciate that streak, or our\nboard of directors appreciates that streak. And again, in an environment like this, you look\nat it, quarter by quarter. But obviously our board declared the fourth quarter dividend, to\nkeep it going. We just paid that out in early January. And so, at this point, they've\ncommitted to continuing to pay the quarterly dividend. But last year we did not have an\nincrease. We usually do one increase a year. Last year we did keep the quarterly dividend\nflat at the $0.21 a share.\nAlex Twerdahl\nOkay. And then I guess, Janet, I think you said in your prepared remarks that buybacks will\nbe back on the table in the near term. Can you just give us a sense for what would trigger\nbuybacks or capital levels that you'd feel comfortable with, things like that?\nJanet Verneuille\nThe capital ratio is at 10%. So, we're going to analyze that each quarter. Take a look at it.\nAnd if there's room for buybacks, like we said, we didn't do any last year, we’ll definitely.\nBased on where we project earnings to go for the year, we do have to watch that, we would\nconsider buying back. But I don't think we have a number at this point. I'm sorry.\nChris Becker\nI think we've talked before that as a national bank, we do watch our, dividend ability to\ndividend money up to the holding company based on the prior two years retained earnings\nin the current year. So, we do monitor that also. So, that's also something that could be a\nlittle bit of a governor on how much money we dividend up to the holding company. So,\nthat's why it's kind of a quarter, by quarter item that we have to consider.\nAlex Twerdahl\nUnderstood. And then I just wanted to ask about the pickup at NPLs this quarter. If you can\ngive us a little bit more color on something that is relatively uncharacteristic for you guys.\nChris Becker\nYes, absolutely. So unfortunately, when we seem to have any LPL's, it seems to come up.\nSo, we actually have a grand total of about $1 million in non-accruals. There was one CNI\nrelationship that we took a $1.4 million charge off of in the fourth quarter. It was a\nbusiness that generally had longer terms, fixed rate contracts and that created some losses\ndue to pandemic price increases and delays and such. And we take proactive steps to\nresolve that and do it quickly. But we charge that as a partial charge off. There's still about\na $600,000 balance on that loan which we have fully reserved for. But that 600,000 is part\nof that. And then we have one small residential mortgage just a little over 300,000 that's in\nthat's part of an estate. So, we're not concerned about that. And then there's an even\nsmaller, less than $100,000, SBA small business line, SBA guaranteed small business line.\nThat is in that list. So, the grand total is three loans in there, all below $1 million. And in the\ntotal, it is $1 million.\nAlex Twerdahl\nReally appreciate you taking my questions. Thanks.\nChris Becker\nAll right. Thank you. Alex.\nOperator [00:27:06]\nThis concluded our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the floor back to Chris\nBecker for closing comments.\nChris Becker\nThank you for your attention and participation on the call today. I want to reassure our\nloyal shareholders that the Board of Directors and Management Team are focused on\nreturning to, and improving on, our historical performance metrics. We look forward to\ntalking to you at the end of the first quarter. Have a good rest of the day."
