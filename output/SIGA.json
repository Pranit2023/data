(SIGA) (NASDAQ: SIGA), a commercial-stage pharmaceutical company, today reported financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\n“Building on strong momentum, SIGA received $122 million in orders during the third quarter, including a significant $112.5 million order for oral TPOXX under the 19C BARDA contract and a $9 million order for oral TPOXX from the U.S. Department of Defense,” said Diem Nguyen, Chief Executive Officer. “As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately $146 million of outstanding procurement orders, positioning the Company for substantial revenue in the fourth quarter and 2025. Deliveries related to the $112.5 million order began in late September and continued into October. We remain committed to diversifying and expanding our revenue base, enhancing shareholder value, advancing our development programs, and continuing our public health mission, while preparing to negotiate the next contract with the U.S. Government.”** _Summary Financial Results_**\n\n_($ in millions, except_ _per share amounts)_| **Three Months****Ended September 30**| **Nine Months****Ended September 30**  \n---|---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nProduct sales(1)| $8.9| $8.0| $53.5| $14.9  \nTotal revenues| $10.0| $9.2| $57.3| $23.4  \nOperating income (loss)(2)| $0.5| ($1.3| )| $12.9| ($8.1| )  \nIncome (loss) before income taxes(2)| $1.9| ($0.4| )| $17.5| ($5.1| )  \nNet income (loss)| $1.3| ($0.4| )| $13.5| ($4.2| )  \nDiluted income (loss) per share| $0.02| ($0.01| )| $0.19| ($0.06| )  \n  \n(1) Includes supportive services related to product sales. \n\n(2) Operating income (loss) excludes, and income (loss) before income taxes includes other income. Both line items exclude the impact of income taxes.\n\n**_Recent Developments:_**\n\n  * In October 2024, the Company announced that it obtained an exclusive license to a portfolio of preclinical fully human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from Vanderbilt University that have the potential to treatment a broad range of orthopoxviruses, including smallpox and mpox. Under the agreement, SIGA has exclusive rights to develop, manufacture, and commercialize these mAbs globally. The U.S. Department of Defense is currently funding the development of these mAbs as potential orthopoxvirus treatments through Phase 1 clinical trials under a contract awarded to a contract manufacturing organization with proven biologics development and manufacturing expertise.\n  * In October 2024, the Company announced its first sale of TPOXX (tecovirimat) in Africa, made in response to a request from the Ministry of Health in Morocco. This milestone sale occurred during the third quarter.\n  * In August 2024, the Company received a procurement contract and related order from the U.S. Department of Defense for approximately $9 million of oral TPOXX, as well as a small amount of IV TPOXX.\n  * In August 2024, the Company reported that the National Institutes of Health’s (NIH) National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) announced topline results from a preliminary analysis of the PALM 007 (Tecovirimat for Treatment of Monkeypox Virus) clinical trial (NCT05559099). NIAID reported that the study did not meet its primary endpoint of a statistically significant improvement in time to lesion resolution within 28 days post-randomization for patients in the Democratic Republic of the Congo with mpox who were administered tecovirimat versus placebo. Improvement was observed, however, in patients receiving tecovirimat whose symptoms began seven days or fewer before randomization and in those with severe or grave disease, defined by the World Health Organization as having 100 or more skin lesions. The Company believes these data are consistent to tecovirimat’s mechanism of action and support further trials to assess its potential benefit in post exposure prophylactic settings, or in patients who present for medical care soon after symptoms, and in those with the most severe disease. \n  * In July 2024, the Company received a procurement order for $112.5 million of oral TPOXX from the U.S. Government under the 19C BARDA contract, for delivery to the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile (SNS).\n\n\n\n**_Capital Management Activity:_**\n\nOn April 11, 2024, a special cash dividend of $0.60 per share was paid, an increase of $0.15 per share from last year’s special cash dividend. This dividend was declared on March 12, 2024.\n\n**_Conference Call and Webcast_**\n\nSIGA will host a conference call and webcast to provide a business update today, Thursday, November 7, 2024, at 4:30 P.M.

Forward-looking statements include statements regarding our future financial position, business strategy, budgets, projected costs, plans and objectives of management for future operations. The words “may,” “continue,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “will,” “believe,” “project,” “expect,” “seek,” “anticipate,” “could,” “should,” “target,” “goal,” “potential” and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not necessarily mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Such forward-looking statements are subject to various known and unknown risks and uncertainties, and SIGA cautions you that any forward-looking information provided by or on behalf of SIGA is not a guarantee of future performance. SIGA’s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by such forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, some of which are beyond SIGA’s control, including, but not limited to, (i) the risk that BARDA elects, in its sole discretion as permitted under the 75A50118C00019 BARDA Contract (the “BARDA Contract”), not to exercise the remaining unexercised option under the BARDA Contract, (ii) the risk that SIGA may not complete performance under the BARDA Contract on schedule or in accordance with contractual terms, (iii) the risk that the BARDA Contract or U.S. Department of Defense contracts are modified or canceled at the request or requirement of, or SIGA is not able to enter into new contracts to supply TPOXX to, the U.S. Government, (iv) the risk that the nascent international biodefense market does not develop to a degree that allows SIGA to continue to successfully market TPOXX internationally, (v) the risk that potential products, including potential alternative uses or formulations of TPOXX that appear promising to SIGA or its collaborators, cannot be shown to be efficacious or safe in subsequent pre-clinical or clinical trials, (vi) the risk that target timing for deliveries of product to customers, and the recognition of related revenues, are delayed or adversely impacted by the actions, or inaction, of contract manufacturing organizations, or other vendors, within the supply chain, or due to coordination activities between the customer and supply chain vendors, (vii) the risk that SIGA or its collaborators will not obtain appropriate or necessary governmental approvals to market these or other potential products or uses, (viii) the risk that SIGA may not be able to secure or enforce sufficient legal rights in its products, including intellectual property protection, (ix) the risk that any challenge to SIGA’s patent and other property rights, if adversely determined, could affect SIGA’s business and, even if determined favorably, could be costly, (x) the risk that regulatory requirements applicable to SIGA’s products may result in the need for further or additional testing or documentation that will delay or prevent SIGA from seeking or obtaining needed approvals to market these products, (xi) the risk that the volatile and competitive nature of the biotechnology industry may hamper SIGA’s efforts to develop or market its products, (xii) the risk that changes in domestic or foreign economic and market conditions may affect SIGA’s ability to advance its research or may affect its products adversely, (xiii) the effect of federal, state, and foreign regulation, including drug regulation and international trade regulation, on SIGA’s businesses, (xiv) the risk of disruptions to SIGA’s supply chain for the manufacture of TPOXX®, causing delays in SIGA’s research and development activities, causing delays or the re-allocation of funding in connection with SIGA’s government contracts, or diverting the attention of government staff overseeing SIGA’s government contracts, (xv) risks associated with actions or uncertainties surrounding the debt ceiling, (xvi) the risk that the U.S. or foreign governments' responses (including inaction) to national or global economic conditions or infectious diseases, are ineffective and may adversely affect SIGA’s business, and (xvii) risks associated with responding to an mpox outbreak, as well as the risks and uncertainties included in Item 1A “Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and SIGA's subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

(SIGA) (NASDAQ: SIGA), a commercial-stage pharmaceutical company and leader in infectious diseases, today announced that it entered into an agreement with Vanderbilt University to obtain a license to a portfolio of preclinical fully human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) which could be used as potential treatments for a broad range of orthopoxviruses, including smallpox and mpox. Under the agreement, SIGA has exercised its option to license the exclusive rights to develop, manufacture, and commercialize these mAbs globally.\n\n“SIGA has cultivated deep expertise in orthopoxvirus, and we are thrilled to expand our pipeline with Vanderbilt’s human monoclonal antibodies, which nicely complement our best-in-class TPOXX® franchise. We believe these antibodies hold the potential to treat a broad spectrum of orthopoxviruses, both as a therapeutic and a prophylactic measure. By leveraging our unique capabilities in clinical development and our long-standing partnerships with U.S. Government agencies, we are well-positioned to maximize the impact of these potential new therapies,” said Diem Nguyen, SIGA Chief Executive Officer. “This license marks a step forward in our strategy to leverage our existing capabilities to create new opportunities for growth over the long term.”\n\nDeveloped by James Crowe, Jr., M.D., Professor of Pediatrics, Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, these mABs have demonstrated promise in preclinical models and could potentially be used as standalone treatments or in combination with TPOXX®. The U.S. Department of Defense is currently funding the development of these mAbs as potential orthopoxvirus treatments through Phase 1 clinical trials under a contract awarded to a contract manufacturing organization with biologics expertise.\n\n“Given the need for additional orthopoxvirus treatments in these unsettling times of recurring poxvirus outbreaks, my team and I are excited to work with SIGA in its future efforts to advance the development of these innovative antibodies,” said Dr. Crowe.\n\nThe financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed.\n\n**About SIGA** SIGA is a commercial-stage pharmaceutical company and leader in global health focused on the development of innovative medicines to treat and prevent infectious diseases. With a primary focus on orthopoxviruses, we are dedicated to protecting humanity against the world’s most severe infectious diseases, including those that occur naturally, accidentally, or intentionally. Through partnerships with governments and public health agencies, we work to build a healthier and safer world by providing essential countermeasures against these global health threats. Our flagship product, TPOXX® (tecovirimat), is an antiviral medicine approved in the U.S. and Canada for the treatment of smallpox and authorized in Europe and the UK for the treatment of smallpox, mpox (monkeypox), cowpox, and vaccinia complications.

We are deeply angered by his comments and behavior which do not reflect SIGA, the way we do business or our values. As a result of his conduct and lack of judgment, Dr. Varma was terminated from SIGA Technologies on September 19, 2024. He is no longer affiliated with SIGA in any way.\n\nHis recent comments regarding SIGA and TPOXX represent his personal views and relate to areas of our business for which he was not responsible during his one year as a SIGA employee. TPOXX (tecovirimat) was developed over the course of a decade in coordination with various industry and government partners. Supported by robust clinical data, TPOXX was approved in the U.S. in 2018 for the treatment of smallpox. Based on studies completed to date, we strongly believe in the effectiveness of TPOXX as a treatment for orthopoxviruses, including mpox. As announced in a press release on August 15, 2024, while the PALM 007 clinical trial did not meet its primary endpoint, results did show that tecovirimat is safe and may benefit patients with severe disease and those who seek treatment early.\n\nOur focus remains on developing important medicines to prevent and treat emerging infectious diseases with high unmet medical needs.\n\n**Additional Information on TPOXX (tecovirimat)** TPOXX (tecovirimat) was approved by the FDA in 2018 for the treatment of smallpox and by the EU and UK in 2022 for the treatment of smallpox and mpox. It has been administered to more than 8,000 patients worldwide for compassionate use. Mpox represents a significant area of unmet need in global health with no approved therapies available in the U.S. to treat infected patients. In August 2024, the topline results of the PALM 007 clinical trial of TPOXX for the treatment of mpox in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) were released. As with many antivirals, patients taking tecovirimat appear to benefit most when treatment is administered as soon as possible after infection.

Smallpox, a highly contagious and fatal disease, presents itself as a risk to global health security today given fears of its release accidentally or intentionally as a bioweapon. Mpox virus, similar to smallpox, causes intermittent human infections, painful lesions, and possible case fatalities. Mpox outbreaks have been observed recently in the US, Europe, and Central & West Africa. Whether through natural occurrence or potential bioweapon warfare, orthopox threatens global health. Anti-virals and vaccines serve as possible solutions to address these threats.\n\n**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**\n\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, including statements relating to SIGA’s future business development and plans, including future procurement of TPOXX in the ASEAN region.

Smallpox, a highly contagious and fatal disease, presents itself as a risk to global health security today given fears of its release accidentally or intentionally as a bioweapon. Mpox virus, similar to smallpox, causes intermittent human infections, painful lesions, and possible case fatalities. Mpox outbreaks have been observed recently in the US, Europe, and Central & West Africa. Whether through natural occurrence or potential bioweapon warfare, orthopox threatens global health. Anti-virals and vaccines serve as possible solutions to address these threats.\n\n**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**\n\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, including statements relating to SIGA’s future business development and plans including securing new contracts and partnerships.

(SIGA) (NASDAQ: SIGA), a commercial-stage pharmaceutical company, today reported financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023.\n\n“In 2023, SIGA had approximately $131 million in product revenues and approximately $84 million of pre-tax operating income,” stated Diem Nguyen, Chief Executive Officer. “These financial results represent a significant increase over the 2022 financial results; product revenues increased 51% over the corresponding 2022 amount, and pre-tax operating income year increased 96% over the corresponding 2022 amount. The overall financial performance, and growth over prior-year financial results, highlight the strength, resilience and growth potential of SIGA’s business model and are a testament to SIGA’s long-standing leadership within the public health sector. We look forward to continuing our strong performance and sector leadership in 2024.” \n\n**_Summary Financial Results_**\n\n_($ in millions, except_ _per share amounts)_ | **Three Months****Ended****December 31** | **Year****Ended****December 31**  \n---|---|---  \n**2023** | **2022** | **2023** | **2022**  \nProduct Sales(1) | $115.7 | $5.1 | $130.7 | $86.7  \nTotal revenues | $116.5 | $11.4 | $139.9 | $110.8  \nOperating income (loss)(2) | $91.7 | ($1.8 | ) | $83.6 | $42.7  \nIncome (loss) before income taxes(2) | $92.9 | ($1.2 | ) | $87.8 | $44.1  \nNet income (loss) | $72.3 | ($0.8 | ) | $68.1 | $33.9  \nDiluted income (loss) per share | $1.01 | ($.01) | $0.95 | $0.46  \n  \n(1) Includes supportive services related to product sales. (2) Operating income (loss) excludes, and income (loss) before income taxes includes, other income and adjustments to the fair value of the Company’s outstanding warrant. Both line items exclude the impact of income taxes.\n\n**_2023 Key Activity:_**\n\n  * In 2023, SIGA had $131 million of product sales, including: approximately $98 million of fourth quarter product sales of oral TPOXX to the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile (“SNS”); approximately $11 million of product sales of oral TPOXX to the U.S. Department of Defense, of which approximately $6 million was recognized in the fourth quarter; and approximately $21 million of international sales, of which approximately $12 million was recognized in the fourth quarter. In the first two months of 2024, the Company delivered an additional approximately $15 million of oral TPOXX to the SNS, substantially completing the oral TPOXX order received in July 2023, as well as delivered an additional approximately $7 million of oral TPOXX to European countries and Canada.\n  * Highlighting the continuing diversification of the Company’s revenue base, the Company has received procurement orders for oral TPOXX from over 25 countries over the past two years. As an example of the diversification trend, in October 2023, the Company reported the creation by the European Commission’s DG HERA (Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority) of a joint procurement framework contract under which participating countries from the European Union (EU) and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) can efficiently order oral TPOXX. Under this mechanism, $18 million of oral TPOXX was ordered by 13 countries in the fourth quarter, and revenues were recorded for deliveries on substantially of these orders in the fourth quarter or the first two months of 2024.\n\n\n\n**_Capital Management Activity:_**\n\nOn March 12, 2024, SIGA’s Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of $0.60 per share, an increase of $0.15 per share from last year’s special cash dividend. In 2023, the Company paid a special cash dividend of $0.45 per share, as well as repurchased approximately 1.7 million shares of its common stock. ** _Conference Call and Webcast_**\n\nSIGA will host a conference call and webcast to provide a business update today, Tuesday, March 12, 2024, at 4:30 P.M.

Health security comprises countermeasures for biological, chemical, radiological and nuclear attacks (biodefense market), vaccines and therapies for emerging infectious diseases, and health preparedness. Our lead product is TPOXX®, also known as tecovirimat and ST-246®, an orally administered and IV formulation antiviral drug for the treatment of human smallpox disease caused by variola virus. TPOXX is a novel small-molecule drug and the US maintains a supply of TPOXX under Project BioShield. The oral formulation of TPOXX was approved by the FDA for the treatment of smallpox in 2018, and the IV formulation was approved for the same indication in 2022. The full label is available by [clicking here](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=wCHbAB5R89JSNn5jPMK1hB_RyH3C8_uqiNYW93y37_6pnOX9tXOsCUeUpCM0t0Ag50l_Nw3AsAv52GG05SG36EjIySzxtWnZwYWdtSJI8hkzHU1CbNVH4yRKazbjJGpCC58SBBNCkfEtt-Frq2Anow==). Oral tecovirimat received approval from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the United Kingdom in 2022. The EMA and UK approvals include labeling for oral tecovirimat indicating its use for the treatment of smallpox, monkeypox, cowpox, and vaccinia complications following vaccination against smallpox. The full label is available by [clicking here](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=wCHbAB5R89JSNn5jPMK1hN_sxx0HWqJXg8IK7EnLWpim_-Uf-TcmNrwa57uKUPLmdVYHoiW4E-ZfPC4A9_sPGFE-VRkEG7TwwohyrZ6nFw2Kz_o6LzYR5fMiIQ9ENKXk7wm1DdK_O5FCvly9l4OWatH4YyNYJbJUMSS4vRjFFpjgeyh-ZqEj-AvdOQVhWrEb). In September 2018, SIGA signed a contract with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the office of the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, for additional procurement and development related to both oral and intravenous formulations of TPOXX. For more information about SIGA, please visit [www.siga.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=7koKjE9bI5bxhR-zFOcOXg4067slMtoD8HNq80Ed71S8AXRC-uSKPtRUTQY3_uN0qxZhs-TgY60bDtjDxTMUrQ==).\n\n**About Smallpox**\n\nSmallpox is a contagious, disfiguring and often deadly disease that has affected humans for thousands of years. Naturally-occurring smallpox was eradicated worldwide by 1980, the result of an unprecedented global immunization campaign. Samples of smallpox virus have been kept for research purposes. This has led to concerns that smallpox could someday be used as a biological warfare agent. A vaccine can prevent smallpox, but the risk of the current vaccine's side effects is too high to justify routine vaccination for people at low risk of exposure to the smallpox virus.\n\n**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**\n\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, including statements relating to the progress of SIGA’s development programs and timelines for bringing products to market, delivering products to the Strategic Stockpile, the enforceability of our procurement contracts, such as the 19C BARDA Contract (the \"BARDA Contract\"), with BARDA, the impact of the COVID pandemic and responding to the global outbreak of monkeypox.

Naturally-occurring smallpox was eradicated worldwide by 1980, the result of an unprecedented global immunization campaign. Samples of smallpox virus have been kept for research purposes. This has led to concerns that smallpox could someday be used as a biological warfare agent. A vaccine can prevent smallpox, but the risk of the current vaccine's side effects is too high to justify routine vaccination for people at low risk of exposure to the smallpox virus.\n\n**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**\n\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, including statements relating to SIGA’s future business development including securing new contracts and partnerships. The words or phrases “can be,” “expects,” “may affect,” “may depend,” “believes,” “estimate,” “project” and similar words and phrases are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are subject to various known and unknown risks and uncertainties, and SIGA cautions you that any forward-looking information provided by or on behalf of SIGA is not a guarantee of future performance. SIGA’s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by such forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, some of which are beyond SIGA’s control, including, but not limited to, (i) the risk that BARDA elects, in its sole discretion as permitted under the 19C BARDA Contract (the “BARDA Contract”), not to exercise all, or any, of the remaining unexercised options under those contracts, (ii) the risk that SIGA may not complete performance under the BARDA Contract on schedule or in accordance with contractual terms, (iii) the risk that the BARDA Contract, the current Department of Defense procurement contract or PEP Label Expansion R&D Contract (as defined in SIGA’s Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023) are modified or canceled at the request or requirement of the U.S. Government, (iv) the risk that the nascent international biodefense market does not develop to a degree that allows SIGA to continue to successfully market TPOXX® internationally, (v) the risk that potential products, including potential alternative uses or formulations of TPOXX® that appear promising to SIGA or its collaborators, cannot be shown to be efficacious or safe in subsequent pre-clinical or clinical trials, (vi) the risk that SIGA or its collaborators will not obtain appropriate or necessary governmental approvals to market these or other potential products or uses, (vii) the risk that SIGA may not be able to secure or enforce sufficient legal rights in its products, including intellectual property protection, (viii) the risk that any challenge to SIGA’s patent and other property rights, if adversely determined, could affect SIGA’s business and, even if determined favorably, could be costly, (ix) the risk that regulatory requirements applicable to SIGA’s products may result in the need for further or additional testing or documentation that will delay or prevent SIGA from seeking or obtaining needed approvals to market these products, (x) the risk that the volatile and competitive nature of the biotechnology industry may hamper SIGA’s efforts to develop or market its products, (xi) the risk that changes in domestic or foreign economic and market conditions may affect SIGA’s ability to advance its research or may affect its products adversely, (xii) the effect of federal, state, and foreign regulation, including drug regulation and international trade regulation, on SIGA’s businesses, (xiii) the risk of disruptions to SIGA’s supply chain for the manufacture of TPOXX®, causing delays in SIGA’s research and development activities, causing delays or the re-allocation of funding in connection with SIGA’s government contracts, or diverting the attention of government staff overseeing SIGA’s government contracts, (xiv) the risk that the U.S. or foreign governments' responses (including inaction) to national or global economic conditions or infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, are ineffective and may adversely affect SIGA’s business, and (xv) risks associated with responding to the current monkeypox outbreak, as well as the risks and uncertainties included in Item 1A “Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 and SIGA's subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
