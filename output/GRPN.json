But even more — we also want it to be the company you think of when it comes to helping build communities where individuals and families can thrive and prosper. \n\n[Social Responsibility ›](https://about.groupon.com/social-responsibility/)\n\n[Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion ›](https://about.groupon.com/diversity-equity-and-inclusion/)\n\n[Our People ›](https://about.groupon.com/our-people/)\n\n## Built with Groupon\n\n###  Groupon champions small businesses by connecting customers and merchants with their communities through effective local business marketing campaigns. \n\nIn this video, Marisol Sarabia and Ziba Lennox of MaZi Dance Fitness share how Groupon helps them pull people out of their comfort zones and stay relevant in a changing marketing landscape. \n\nMaZi Dance Fitness was co-founded in 2009 by two sisters who, upon retiring from professional ballet and entering the corporate world, found that they missed the physical, emotional, and social fulfillment they drew from dance studios. MaZi offers a fun and engaging alternative for people not motivated by regular workout routines, and uses Groupon campaigns to get people hooked on their nontraditional model. \n\n## Latest News\n\nLoading ...\n\n[All Press Releases](/press-releases/default.aspx)\n\n##  Investor Email Alerts\n\nTo opt-in for investor email alerts, please enter your email address in the field below and select at least one alert option.
