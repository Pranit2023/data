(NASDAQ: AAL) today reported its third-quarter 2024 financial results, including:\n\n  * **Record third-quarter revenue of $13.6 billion.**\n  * **Third-quarter net loss of $149 million, or ($0.23) per share. Excluding net special items1, third-quarter net income of $205 million, or $0.30 per diluted share.**\n  * **Led U.S. network carriers in third-quarter completion factor.**\n  * **Ended the third quarter with $11.8 billion of total available liquidity.**\n  * **On track to reduce total debt 2 from peak levels by $15 billion by year-end 2025.**\n  * **Full-year adjusted earnings per diluted share 3 expected to be between $1.35 and $1.60.**\n\n\n\n“The American Airlines team continues to focus on running a reliable operation and managing costs across the airline,” said American’s CEO Robert Isom. “We have taken aggressive action to reset our sales and distribution strategy and reengage the business travel community, which we’re confident will improve our revenue performance over time. We have heard great feedback from travel agencies and corporate customers as we work to rebuild the foundation of our commercial strategy and make it easy for customers to do business with American.”\n\n**Sales and distribution strategy** American continues to evolve its sales and distribution strategy to address feedback from corporate and agency partners and regain lost share. In the third quarter, the airline renegotiated competitive contracts with a majority of the largest travel agencies and many of its top corporate customers, reintroduced Corporate Experience benefits for corporate travelers, and increased support for corporate and agency customers by adding sales account managers and sales support staff.\n\n**Operational performance** The American Airlines team demonstrated its continued resilience in the third quarter by quickly recovering from several irregular operations events, most notably the CrowdStrike outage and Hurricanes Debby and Helene. Despite the impact of these events, the American team delivered strong operational results in the third quarter, including the highest completion factor among U.S. network carriers and delivering the airline’s highest third-quarter load factor since the merger of American and US Airways in 2013.\n\n**Financial performance** American delivered earnings results ahead of prior guidance. The company produced record third-quarter revenue of $13.6 billion, an increase of 1.2% year over year. On a GAAP basis, the company produced an operating margin of 0.7% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of net special items1, the company produced an adjusted operating margin of 4.7% in the quarter.\n\n**Balance sheet and liquidity** American continued to strengthen its balance sheet in the third quarter by reducing total debt2 by approximately $360 million. The company is more than $13 billion toward its goal of reducing total debt2 by $15 billion by the end of 2025. The company ended the quarter with approximately $11.8 billion of total available liquidity, comprised of cash and short-term investments plus undrawn capacity under revolving credit and other facilities.\n\n**Guidance and investor update** Based on present demand trends, the current fuel price forecast and excluding the impact of special items, the company expects its fourth-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings per diluted share3 to be between $0.25 and $0.50. The company now expects its full-year 2024 adjusted earnings per diluted share3 to be between $1.35 and $1.60.\n\nFor additional financial forecasting detail, please refer to the company’s investor update, furnished with this press release with the SEC on Form 8-K. This filing is also available at [aa.com/investorrelations](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=epAeqBetnCoq4hMNZ35KCy5lL8kbA3RnvrJYTBZ1P8t7Nr2Q7aZq5v2qyjSW1C0fWuQzs2H-YCeimUT3GLxnbL-dkDpsgKr-c60VFisW0PIB3RXwqCAoCM8TDEqkTXjZ).\n\n**Conference call and webcast details** The company will conduct a live audio webcast of its financial results conference call at 7:30 a.m. CT today. The call will be available to the public on a listen-only basis at [aa.com/investorrelations](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=epAeqBetnCoq4hMNZ35KCy5lL8kbA3RnvrJYTBZ1P8uL7pvQ4hdy5wwrcietjhuItx1aICHj4uLeV9vh5Ia1lsWuq9OZjBMe_mHfJhErC-XY-mtWyqu1ObeDpxvDlaKY). An archive of the webcast will be available through Nov. 24.\n\n**Notes** See the accompanying notes in the financial tables section of this press release for further explanation, including a reconciliation of all GAAP to non-GAAP financial information and the calculation of free cash flow.\n\n  1. The company recognized $354 million of net special items in the third quarter after the effect of taxes, which principally included one-time charges resulting from the ratification of a new collective bargaining agreement with the company’s mainline flight attendants.\n  2. All references to total debt include debt, finance and operating lease liabilities and pension obligations.\n  3. Adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance excludes the impact of net special items. The company is unable to reconcile certain forward-looking information to GAAP as the nature or amount of net special items cannot be determined at this time. \n\n\n\n**About American Airlines Group**As a leading global airline, American Airlines offers thousands of flights per day to more than 350 destinations in more than 60 countries.

(the Company) sometimes uses financial measures that are derived from the condensed consolidated financial statements but that are not presented in accordance with GAAP to understand and evaluate its current operating performance and to allow for period-to-period comparisons. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures may also provide useful information to investors and others. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures of other companies, and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, any measure of performance, cash flow or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company is providing a reconciliation of reported non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable financial measures on a GAAP basis.The tables below present the reconciliations of the following GAAP measures to their non-GAAP measures:- Operating Income (Loss) (GAAP measure) to Operating Income Excluding Net Special Items (non-GAAP measure)- Operating Margin (GAAP measure) to Operating Margin Excluding Net Special Items (non-GAAP measure)- Pre-Tax Income (Loss) (GAAP measure) to Pre-Tax Income Excluding Net Special Items (non-GAAP measure)- Pre-Tax Margin (GAAP measure) to Pre-Tax Margin Excluding Net Special Items (non-GAAP measure)- Net Income (Loss) (GAAP measure) to Net Income Excluding Net Special Items (non-GAAP measure)- Basic and Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share (GAAP measure) to Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share Excluding Net Special Items (non-GAAP measure)Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the Company's current operating performance and to allow for period-to-period comparisons. As net special items may vary from period-to-period in nature and amount, the adjustment to exclude net special items allows management an additional tool to understand the Company’s core operating performance.Additionally, the tables below present the reconciliations of total operating costs (GAAP measure) to total operating costs excluding net special items and fuel (non-GAAP measure) and total operating costs per ASM (CASM) to CASM excluding net special items and fuel. Management uses total operating costs excluding net special items and fuel and CASM excluding net special items and fuel to evaluate the Company's current operating performance and for period-to-period comparisons. The price of fuel, over which the Company has no control, impacts the comparability of period-to-period financial performance. The adjustment to exclude fuel and net special items allows management an additional tool to understand and analyze the Company’s non-fuel costs and core operating performance.  \n**Reconciliation of Operating Income Excluding Net Special Items**|  3 Months EndedSeptember 30,| PercentIncrease| 9 Months EndedSeptember 30,| PercentIncrease  \n2024| 2023| (Decrease)| 2024| 2023| (Decrease)  \n(in millions)| (in millions)  \nOperating income (loss) as reported| $| 89| $| (223| )| $| 1,480| $| 2,378  \nOperating net special items:  \nMainline operating special items, net (1)| 554| 949| 625| 962  \nRegional operating special items, net| -| 2| -| 8  \nOperating income excluding net special items| $| 643| $| 728| (11.7%)| $| 2,105| $| 3,348| (37.1%)  \n**Calculation of Operating Margin**  \nOperating income (loss) as reported| $| 89| $| (223| )| $| 1,480| $| 2,378  \nTotal operating revenues as reported| $| 13,647| $| 13,482| $| 40,551| $| 39,726  \nOperating margin| 0.7%| (1.7%| )| 3.7%| 6.0%  \n**Calculation of Operating Margin Excluding Net Special Items**  \nOperating income excluding net special items| $| 643| $| 728| $| 2,105| $| 3,348  \nTotal operating revenues as reported| $| 13,647| $| 13,482| $| 40,551| $| 39,726  \nOperating margin excluding net special items| 4.7%| 5.4%| 5.2%| 8.4%  \n**Reconciliation of Pre-Tax Income Excluding Net Special Items**  \nPre-tax income (loss) as reported| $| (256| )| $| (690| )| $| 359| $| 1,089  \nPre-tax net special items:  \nMainline operating special items, net (1)| 554| 949| 625| 962  \nRegional operating special items, net| -| 2| -| 8  \nNonoperating special items, net (2)| (27| )| 101| 30| 146  \nTotal pre-tax net special items| 527| 1,052| 655| 1,116  \nPre-tax income excluding net special items| $| 271| $| 362| (25.2%)| $| 1,014| $| 2,205| (54.0%)  \n**Calculation of Pre-Tax Margin**  \nPre-tax income (loss) as reported| $| (256| )| $| (690| )| $| 359| $| 1,089  \nTotal operating revenues as reported| $| 13,647| $| 13,482| $| 40,551| $| 39,726  \nPre-tax margin| (1.9%| )| (5.1%| )| 0.9%| 2.7%  \n**Calculation of Pre-Tax Margin Excluding Net Special Items**  \nPre-tax income excluding net special items| $| 271| $| 362| $| 1,014| $| 2,205  \nTotal operating revenues as reported| $| 13,647| $| 13,482| $| 40,551| $| 39,726  \nPre-tax margin excluding net special items| 2.0%| 2.7%| 2.5%| 5.6%  \n3 Months EndedSeptember 30,| PercentIncrease| 9 Months EndedSeptember 30,| PercentIncrease  \n**Reconciliation of Net Income Excluding Net Special Items**|  2024| 2023| (Decrease)| 2024| 2023| (Decrease)  \n(in millions, except share and per share amounts)| (in millions, except share and per share amounts)  \nNet income (loss) as reported| $| (149| )| $| (545| )| $| 256| $| 803  \nNet special items:  \nTotal pre-tax net special items (1), (2)| 527| 1,052| 655| 1,116  \nNet tax effect of net special items| (173| )| (244| )| (158| )| (252| )  \nNet income excluding net special items| $| 205| $| 263| (21.9%)| $| 753| $| 1,667| (54.8%)  \n**Reconciliation of Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share Excluding Net Special Items**  \nNet income excluding net special items| $| 205| $| 263| $| 753| $| 1,667  \nShares used for computation (in thousands):  \nBasic| 657,424| 654,119| 656,745| 653,241  \nDiluted| 720,086| 722,087| 720,503| 719,956  \nEarnings per share excluding net special items:  \nBasic| $| 0.31| $| 0.40| $| 1.15| $| 2.55  \nDiluted (3)| $| 0.30| $| 0.38| $| 1.10| $| 2.36  \n**Reconciliation of Total Operating Costs per ASM Excluding Net Special Items and Fuel**  \nTotal operating expenses as reported| $| 13,558| $| 13,705| $| 39,071| $| 37,348  \nOperating net special items:  \nMainline operating special items, net (1)| (554| )| (949| )| (625| )| (962| )  \nRegional operating special items, net| -| (2| )| -| (8| )  \nTotal operating expenses excluding net special items| 13,004| 12,754| 38,446| 36,378  \nAircraft fuel and related taxes| (2,874| )| (3,209| )| (8,916| )| (9,098| )  \nTotal operating expenses excluding net special items and fuel| $| 10,130| $| 9,545| $| 29,530| $| 27,280  \n(in cents)| (in cents)  \nTotal operating expenses per ASM as reported| 17.92| 18.70| 17.64| 17.96  \nOperating net special items per ASM:  \nMainline operating special items, net (1)| (0.73| )| (1.29| )| (0.28| )| (0.46| )  \nRegional operating special items, net| -| -| -| -  \nTotal operating expenses per ASM excluding net special items| 17.19| 17.40| 17.36| 17.49  \nAircraft fuel and related taxes per ASM| (3.80| )| (4.38| )| (4.03| )| (4.38| )  \nTotal operating expenses per ASM excluding net special items and fuel| 13.39| 13.02| 13.34| 13.12  \n**Note: Amounts may not recalculate due to rounding.**  \n**FOOTNOTES:**  \n(1)| The 2024 third quarter mainline operating special items, net principally included $516 million of one-time charges resulting from the ratification of a new collective bargaining agreement with our mainline flight attendants.

The Company defines free cash flows as net cash provided by operating activities less net cash used in investing activities, adjusted for (1) net purchases of short-term investments and (2) change in restricted cash. We believe that calculating free cash flow as adjusted for these items is more useful for investors because short-term investment activity and restricted cash are not representative of activity core to our operations.This non-GAAP measure may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures of other companies, and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, any measure of performance, cash flow or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our calculation of free cash flow is not intended, and should not be used, to measure the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because, among other things, it excludes mandatory debt service requirements and certain other non-discretionary expenditures.  \n9 Months EndedSeptember 30, 2024  \n(in millions)  \n**Net cash provided by operating activities**|  $| 3,585  \n**Adjusted net cash used in investing activities(1)**| (1,203| )  \n**Free cash flow**|  $| 2,382  \n(1)| The following table provides a reconciliation of adjusted net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (in millions):  \nNet cash used in investing activities| $| (1,834| )  \nAdjustments:  \nNet purchases of short-term investments| 627  \nDecrease in restricted cash| 4  \nAdjusted net cash used in investing activities| $| (1,203| )  \n**American Airlines Group Inc.**  \n---  \n**Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets**  \n**(In millions, except shares)**  \nSeptember 30, 2024| December 31, 2023  \n(unaudited)  \nAssets  \nCurrent assets  \nCash| $| 834| $| 578  \nShort-term investments| 7,638| 7,000  \nRestricted cash and short-term investments| 752| 910  \nAccounts receivable, net| 1,820| 2,026  \nAircraft fuel, spare parts and supplies, net| 2,582| 2,400  \nPrepaid expenses and other| 830| 658  \nTotal current assets| 14,456| 13,572  \nOperating property and equipment  \nFlight equipment| 43,110| 41,794  \nGround property and equipment| 10,105| 10,307  \nEquipment purchase deposits| 1,098| 760  \nTotal property and equipment, at cost| 54,313| 52,861  \nLess accumulated depreciation and amortization| (23,467| )| (22,097| )  \nTotal property and equipment, net| 30,846| 30,764  \nOperating lease right-of-use assets| 7,709| 7,939  \nOther assets  \nGoodwill| 4,091| 4,091  \nIntangibles, net| 2,046| 2,051  \nDeferred tax asset| 2,768| 2,888  \nOther assets| 1,612| 1,753  \nTotal other assets| 10,517| 10,783  \nTotal assets| $| 63,528| $| 63,058  \nLiabilities and Stockholders’ Equity (Deficit)  \nCurrent liabilities  \nCurrent maturities of long-term debt and finance leases| $| 5,384| $| 3,632  \nAccounts payable| 2,623| 2,353  \nAccrued salaries and wages| 2,484| 2,377  \nAir traffic liability| 7,551| 6,200  \nLoyalty program liability| 3,584| 3,453  \nOperating lease liabilities| 1,173| 1,309  \nOther accrued liabilities| 2,733| 2,738  \nTotal current liabilities| 25,532| 22,062  \nNoncurrent liabilities  \nLong-term debt and finance leases, net of current maturities| 26,268| 29,270  \nPension and postretirement benefits| 2,568| 3,044  \nLoyalty program liability| 6,035| 5,874  \nOperating lease liabilities| 6,348| 6,452  \nOther liabilities| 1,631| 1,558  \nTotal noncurrent liabilities| 42,850| 46,198  \nStockholders' equity (deficit)  \nCommon stock, 657,102,842 shares outstanding at September 30, 2024| 7| 7  \nAdditional paid-in capital| 7,407| 7,374  \nAccumulated other comprehensive loss| (4,835| )| (4,894| )  \nRetained deficit| (7,433| )| (7,689| )  \nTotal stockholders' deficit| (4,854| )| (5,202| )  \nTotal liabilities and stockholders’ equity (deficit)| $| 63,528| $| 63,058  \n  \n**Corporate Communications**[mediarelations@aa.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=8MIMRHsxDv3QJrAiRUqDVDIgsj8fJx0VPPqG736jTAbx3BvQ2f9IpcWd72L7WxU4uhv2NlTY0QzoklnLmB23iBI93wt54plEv-LQIuaRbwM=)\n\n**Investor Relations**[investor.relations@aa.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=kBh9gvxKWalvMIcT7PRum1Uuz-pxHIS1z7reSzEa6uOxzufQ8fsDo2Jk_ZCI8LF8MbvG55Ly43_0R0OTlelzcdnzbzhr9ooJ4_O_d1MY5Yq3DJxaQ-D12m9-ZMBrHufe)\n\n![](https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=OTI2MTIzMCM2NTQ2NDQ2IzIwMTg2OTA=)\n\n![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/YzQ5MjIwYWQtM2NhMC00YTY2LWE3ZmEtYjY3NDgzZWM2NGFlLTEwMzAyNjM=/tiny/American-Airlines-Inc-.png)\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/21b82fa4-c9a7-4da3-811e-90c52524e7ab/small/american-airlines-logo-jpg.jpg)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/21b82fa4-c9a7-4da3-811e-90c52524e7ab)\n\nSource: American Airlines, Inc.\n"

(NASDAQ: AAL) today reported its second-quarter 2024 financial results, including:\n\n  * **Highest-ever quarterly revenue of $14.3 billion.**\n  * **Second-quarter net income of $717 million, or $1.01 per diluted share. Excluding net special items****1****, second-quarter net income of $774 million, or $1.09 per diluted share.**\n  * **Generated operating cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion and free cash flow****2****of approximately $850 million in the second quarter.**\n  * **Reduced total debt****3****by approximately $680 million in the second quarter. **\n  * **On track to reduce total debt****3****from peak levels by $15 billion by year-end 2025. **\n  * **Full-year adjusted earnings per diluted share****4****expected to be between $0.70 and $1.30.**\n\n\n\n“American has a fleet, network and product built to deliver results, but during the second quarter, we did not perform to our initial expectations due to our prior sales and distribution strategy and an imbalance of domestic supply and demand,” said American’s CEO Robert Isom. “We are taking this challenge head-on, with clear and decisive actions to deliver on a strategy that maximizes our revenue and profitability, and importantly, one that makes it easy for customers to do business with American. When we return to the level of revenue generation we know we can achieve, and we couple that with our operational reliability and best-in-class cost management, we will unlock significant value.”\n\n**Sales and distribution** American has taken swift and aggressive action to reorient its sales and distribution strategy in ways that continue to be customer-centric, while addressing feedback from corporate and agency partners. Since May, the airline has focused its near-term efforts in three areas:\n\n**Ensuring content availability**\n\n  * **Restored content.** American has reinstated competitive fares in the distribution channel traditionally used by travel agencies and corporate managed travel programs.\n  * **Removed plans to differentiate mileage earn by channel.** Travelers continue to earn in the AAdvantage® program as usual, no matter where they book.\n\n\n\n**Making it easy, attractive and rewarding to do business with American**\n\n  * **Expanded availability of AAdvantage Business™ benefits to agencies.** Companies will earn AAdvantage® miles and travelers will earn Loyalty Points anywhere business travel is booked, including when booked through travel agencies.\n  * **Announced new features coming to AAdvantage Business™.** Improvements will enhance the travel management and end-traveler experience.\n\n\n\n**Strengthening relationships and regaining the trust of partners**\n\n  * **Listening to feedback.** The company has conducted extensive outreach to customers to inform them of changes being made to address pain points.\n  * **Updating agreements.** American is renegotiating contracts with corporate customers and travel agencies.\n  * **Improving support.** The airline is adding account managers for corporate customers, has established a dedicated AAdvantage Business™ customer service team and is increasing sales support for agencies.\n\n\n\n**Operational performance** The American Airlines team continues to produce strong operational results and demonstrate its resilience in recovering from irregular operations, as evidenced by its second-quarter performance, despite significant storms that impacted several key hubs in May and June. The airline also delivered a fantastic operation over the Fourth of July holiday, carrying 7.2 million customers and operating its largest-ever schedule while producing its best-ever combined completion factor over the holiday period. American quickly rebounded from the technology outage that impacted businesses worldwide on July 19. By that evening, its operation had fully recovered, and the airline delivered a 98.9% completion factor the next day — the best operational performance among U.S. network carriers.\n\n**Financial performance** American produced record quarterly revenue of $14.3 billion in the second quarter, an increase of 2% year over year. On both a GAAP basis and excluding the impact of net special items1, the company produced an operating margin of 9.7% in the quarter.\n\n**Balance sheet and liquidity** American remains committed to strengthening its balance sheet. In the second quarter, the company reduced total debt3 by approximately $680 million and is now more than $13 billion, or approximately 87%, toward its goal of reducing total debt3 by $15 billion by the end of 2025. The company ended the quarter with approximately $11.7 billion of total available liquidity, comprised of cash and short-term investments plus undrawn capacity under revolving credit facilities.\n\n**Guidance and investor update** American has taken aggressive action to improve its revenue performance, however, the company’s previous sales and distribution strategy will continue to impact its revenue performance and earnings through the remainder of the year. Accounting for these impacts and based on present demand trends, the current fuel price forecast and excluding the impact of special items, the company expects its third-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings per diluted share4 to be approximately breakeven. The company now expects its full-year 2024 adjusted earnings per diluted share4 to be between $0.70 and $1.30.\n\nFor additional financial forecasting detail, please refer to the company’s investor update, furnished with this press release with the SEC on Form 8-K.

An archive of the webcast will be available through Aug. 25.\n\n**Notes** See the accompanying notes in the financial tables section of this press release for further explanation, including a reconciliation of all GAAP to non-GAAP financial information and the calculation of free cash flow.\n\n  1. The company recognized $57 million of net special items in the second quarter after the effect of taxes, which principally included nonoperating net special items for charges associated with debt refinancings and mark-to-market net unrealized losses on certain equity investments.\n  2. Please see the accompanying notes for the company’s definition of free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP measure.\n  3. All references to total debt include debt, finance and operating lease liabilities and pension obligations.\n  4. Adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance excludes the impact of net special items. The company is unable to reconcile certain forward-looking information to GAAP as the nature or amount of net special items cannot be determined at this time.\n\n\n\n**About American Airlines Group**To Care for People on Life’s Journey®.

(the Company) sometimes uses financial measures that are derived from the condensed consolidated financial statements but that are not presented in accordance with GAAP to understand and evaluate its current operating performance and to allow for period-to-period comparisons. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures may also provide useful information to investors and others. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures of other companies, and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, any measure of performance, cash flow or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company is providing a reconciliation of reported non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable financial measures on a GAAP basis. The tables below present the reconciliations of the following GAAP measures to their non-GAAP measures: - Operating Income (GAAP measure) to Operating Income Excluding Net Special Items (non-GAAP measure) - Operating Margin (GAAP measure) to Operating Margin Excluding Net Special Items (non-GAAP measure) - Pre-Tax Income (GAAP measure) to Pre-Tax Income Excluding Net Special Items (non-GAAP measure) - Pre-Tax Margin (GAAP measure) to Pre-Tax Margin Excluding Net Special Items (non-GAAP measure) - Net Income (GAAP measure) to Net Income Excluding Net Special Items (non-GAAP measure) - Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share (GAAP measure) to Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share Excluding Net Special Items (non-GAAP measure) Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the Company's current operating performance and to allow for period-to-period comparisons. As net special items may vary from period-to-period in nature and amount, the adjustment to exclude net special items allows management an additional tool to understand the Company’s core operating performance. Additionally, the tables below present the reconciliations of total operating costs (GAAP measure) to total operating costs excluding net special items and fuel (non-GAAP measure) and total operating costs per ASM (CASM) to CASM excluding net special items and fuel. Management uses total operating costs excluding net special items and fuel and CASM excluding net special items and fuel to evaluate the Company's current operating performance and for period-to-period comparisons. The price of fuel, over which the Company has no control, impacts the comparability of period-to-period financial performance. The adjustment to exclude fuel and net special items allows management an additional tool to understand and analyze the Company’s non-fuel costs and core operating performance.  \n**Reconciliation of Operating Income Excluding Net Special Items** | 3 Months EndedJune 30, | Percent Increase | 6 Months EndedJune 30, | Percent Increase  \n2024 | 2023 | (Decrease) | 2024 | 2023 | (Decrease)  \n(in millions) | (in millions)  \nOperating income as reported | $ | 1,384 | $ | 2,163 | $ | 1,391 | $ | 2,600  \nOperating net special items:  \nMainline operating special items, net (1) | -

The Company defines free cash flows as net cash provided by operating activities less net cash used in investing activities, adjusted for (1) net purchases of short-term investments and (2) change in restricted cash. We believe that calculating free cash flow as adjusted for these items is more useful for investors because short-term investment activity and restricted cash are not representative of activity core to our operations. This non-GAAP measure may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures of other companies, and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, any measure of performance, cash flow or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our calculation of free cash flow is not intended, and should not be used, to measure the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because, among other things, it excludes mandatory debt service requirements and certain other non-discretionary expenditures.  \n6 Months EndedJune 30, 2024  \n(in millions)  \n**Net cash provided by operating activities** | $ | 3,308  \n**Adjusted net cash used in investing activities****(1)** | (1,091 | )  \n**Free cash flow** | $ | 2,217  \n(1) | The following table provides a reconciliation of adjusted net cash used in investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2024 (in millions):  \nNet cash used in investing activities | $ | (1,892 | )  \nAdjustments:  \nNet purchases of short-term investments | 833  \nIncrease in restricted cash | (32 | )  \nAdjusted net cash used in investing activities | $ | (1,091 | )  \n**American Airlines Group Inc. **  \n---  \n**Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets**  \n**(In millions, except shares)**  \nJune 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023  \n(unaudited)  \nAssets  \nCurrent assets  \nCash | $ | 605 | $ | 578  \nShort-term investments | 7,841 | 7,000  \nRestricted cash and short-term investments | 875 | 910  \nAccounts receivable, net | 2,067 | 2,026  \nAircraft fuel, spare parts and supplies, net | 2,575 | 2,400  \nPrepaid expenses and other | 832 | 658  \nTotal current assets | 14,795 | 13,572  \nOperating property and equipment  \nFlight equipment | 42,752 | 41,794  \nGround property and equipment | 10,198 | 10,307  \nEquipment purchase deposits | 1,052 | 760  \nTotal property and equipment, at cost | 54,002 | 52,861  \nLess accumulated depreciation and amortization | (22,958 | ) | (22,097 | )  \nTotal property and equipment, net | 31,044 | 30,764  \nOperating lease right-of-use assets | 7,873 | 7,939  \nOther assets  \nGoodwill | 4,091 | 4,091  \nIntangibles, net | 2,047 | 2,051  \nDeferred tax asset | 2,668 | 2,888  \nOther assets | 1,607 | 1,753  \nTotal other assets | 10,413 | 10,783  \nTotal assets | $ | 64,125 | $ | 63,058  \nLiabilities and Stockholders’ Equity (Deficit)  \nCurrent liabilities  \nCurrent maturities of long-term debt and finance leases | $ | 4,120 | $ | 3,632  \nAccounts payable | 3,016 | 2,353  \nAccrued salaries and wages | 1,767 | 2,377  \nAir traffic liability | 8,030 | 6,200  \nLoyalty program liability | 3,619 | 3,453  \nOperating lease liabilities | 1,209 | 1,309  \nOther accrued liabilities | 2,849 | 2,738  \nTotal current liabilities | 24,610 | 22,062  \nNoncurrent liabilities  \nLong-term debt and finance leases, net of current maturities | 27,636 | 29,270  \nPension and postretirement benefits | 2,652 | 3,044  \nLoyalty program liability | 6,031 | 5,874  \nOperating lease liabilities | 6,482 | 6,452  \nOther liabilities | 1,460 | 1,558  \nTotal noncurrent liabilities | 44,261 | 46,198  \nStockholders' equity (deficit)  \nCommon stock, 656,607,802 shares outstanding at June 30, 2024 | 7 | 7  \nAdditional paid-in capital | 7,389 | 7,374  \nAccumulated other comprehensive loss | (4,858 | ) | (4,894 | )  \nRetained deficit | (7,284 | ) | (7,689 | )  \nTotal stockholders' deficit | (4,746 | ) | (5,202 | )  \nTotal liabilities and stockholders’ equity (deficit) | $ | 64,125 | $ | 63,058  \n  \n**Corporate Communications**[mediarelations@aa.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=3yHhH0VBvBzuemCCQXKmhg0aeL0rPaGheZiLUqjvyCLNyGfOyUULAhxXwbpKpsDMTazDHzgXBxzVT_-9xsAWI-ak0n0srVwgAZJzQU0q6i8=)\n\n**Investor Relations**[investor.relations@aa.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ESL3RjWm_hm7-9z73VYy_VYpxE2G-3W42PNprOv9bEG1bYnRpJGHV2YM6-miiNWFkGJ-AX5BooKcplA_PMm2qxrswITw8eXNChY4Voztexg=)\n\n![](https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=OTE5MzI0NCM2MzkxMjk4IzIwMTg2OTA=)![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/ZjdmYmVjOGMtYWQyYi00OGQ1LTgzNGEtMDAyNzQ5ZDY5N2Y1LTEwMzAyNjM=/tiny/American-Airlines-Inc-.png)\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/21b82fa4-c9a7-4da3-811e-90c52524e7ab/small/american-airlines-logo-jpg.jpg)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/21b82fa4-c9a7-4da3-811e-90c52524e7ab)\n\nSource: American Airlines, Inc.\n"

The report also includes a discussion of how American is extending its commitment to sustainability to its sourcing and procurement practices.\n\n“Thanks to the hard work of our more than 140,000 team members, American continues to deliver for our customers while making strides toward our sustainability goals,” said American’s CEO Robert Isom. “There is far more work to be done and many areas where we will continue to rely on policymakers and partnerships to make progress. But I’m proud of our record — from advancing the development of lower-carbon technologies, to our work to better develop and recruit a diverse and talented group of leaders with unmatched expertise throughout the company.“\n\nThrough ongoing engagement across the company and with a broad range of external stakeholders, American has identified four priority sustainability issues discussed in detail in the report: safety; support for team members; customer satisfaction and operational performance; and climate change and fuel efficiency. American has maintained its commitment to its long-term sustainability goals, while recognizing the challenges and interdependencies in reaching them.\n\n“American’s goal to achieve zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 is the right one, but it won’t be easy,” said American’s Chief Sustainability Officer Jill Blickstein. “Our report describes the concrete steps we have taken and sets the stage for the hard work in the years ahead. American is committed to working with our partners inside and beyond the aviation industry to get us and our industry on a path to meet these global challenges.”\n\nIn line with American’s commitment to transparency and strong industry standards, the report also substantially aligns with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures and the standard for the airline industry developed by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board.\n\nRead the full [Sustainability Report](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ZzkjT8nV91xpDAvkyaA_AOLpJnuqCgTcVkl1iVHFlZizLs9nPe1Y62chP-O6YMgHUtEob-ti7NfkAkznFKT8X49yxyP3CuvElTvyjrJUiDgT2o4eTFXmNma3wWJiYvxzs2gTHcTE8rmXXx-c_aLKRr_pRyQ4oIe4uMQQlcRcXHfMfe2K0CxYlZ_PdQPVb4IZ).\n\n**About American Airlines Group**To Care for People on Life’s Journey®.
