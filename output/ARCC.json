The fourth quarter 2024 dividend is payable on December 30, 2024 to stockholders of record as of December 13, 2024. \n\n**SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 FINANCIAL RESULTS**\n\nAres Capital also announced financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\n**OPERATING RESULTS**  \n---  \n**Q3-24(1)** |  **Q3-23(1)**  \n**(dollar amounts in millions, except per share data)** |  **Total Amount** |  **Per Share** |  **Total Amount** |  **Per Share**  \nGAAP net income per share(2)(3)  |  $  |  0.62  |  $  |  0.89   \nCore EPS(4)  |  $  |  0.58  |  $  |  0.59   \nDividends declared and payable  |  $  |  0.48  |  $  |  0.48   \nNet investment income(2)  |  $  |  361  |  $  |  0.57  |  $  |  289  |  $  |  0.52   \nNet realized losses(2)  |  $  |  (24  |  )  |  $  |  (0.04  |  )  |  $  |  (76  |  )  |  $  |  (0.14  |  )   \nNet unrealized gains(2)  |  $  |  57  |  $  |  0.09  |  $  |  287  |  $  |  0.51   \nGAAP net income(2)(3)  |  $  |  394  |  $  |  0.62  |  $  |  500  |  $  |  0.89   \n**As of**  \n---  \n**(dollar amounts in millions, except per share data)** |  **September 30 , 2024** |  **December 31 , 2023**  \nPortfolio investments at fair value  |  $  |  25,918  |  $  |  22,874   \nTotal assets  |  $  |  27,100  |  $  |  23,800   \nStockholders’ equity  |  $  |  12,773  |  $  |  11,201   \nNet assets per share  |  $  |  19.77  |  $  |  19.24   \nDebt/equity ratio  |  1.06x  |  1.07x   \nDebt/equity ratio, net of available cash(5)  |  1.03x  |  1.02x   \n(1)  |  Net income can vary substantially from period to period due to various factors, including the level of new investment commitments, the recognition of realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation and depreciation. As a result, quarterly comparisons of net income may not be meaningful.   \n---|---  \n(2)  |  All per share amounts and weighted average shares outstanding are basic. The basic weighted average shares outstanding for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 635 million and 562 million, respectively.   \n(3)  |  The basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 635 million shares. Ares Capital’s diluted GAAP net income per share for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was $0.87. The weighted average shares outstanding for the purpose of calculating the diluted GAAP net income per share for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was approximately 582 million shares, which includes approximately 20 million shares related to the assumed conversion of Ares Capital’s then outstanding $403 million in aggregate principal amount of unsecured convertible notes (the “2024 Convertible Notes”).   \n(4)  |  Core EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure. Core EPS is the net increase (decrease) in stockholders’ equity resulting from operations, and excludes net realized and unrealized gains and losses, any capital gains incentive fees attributable to such net realized and unrealized gains and losses and any income taxes related to such net realized gains and losses, divided by the basic weighted average shares outstanding for the relevant period. GAAP net income (loss) per share is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Ares Capital believes that Core EPS provides useful information to investors regarding financial performance because it is one method Ares Capital uses to measure its financial condition and results of operations. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of GAAP net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to Core EPS are set forth in Schedule 1 hereto.   \n(5)  |  Computed as total principal debt outstanding less available cash divided by stockholders’ equity. Available cash excludes restricted cash as well as cash held for uses specifically designated for paying interest and expenses on certain debt.   \n  \n“We reported strong third quarter Core EPS and another record in our net asset value per share supported by robust new investment activity and healthy credit performance,” said Kipp deVeer, Chief Executive Officer of Ares Capital. “As we celebrate our 20-year anniversary this month, we are proud of the returns we delivered for our shareholders, including a total annualized stock return with dividends of 13% and a cumulative net realized loss rate of 0% on our investments over the past two decades.” \n\n“We believe that the strength and diversification of our balance sheet continues to be a source of differentiation,” said Scott Lem, Chief Financial Officer of Ares Capital. “During the third quarter, our investment-grade profile improved further, making ARCC the only company to have the highest ratings in the BDC sector and positive outlooks by S&P and Fitch. Our conservative approach to investing and funding our balance sheet have enabled us to pay a stable to growing regular quarterly dividend for our shareholders for over 15 years.” \n\n**PORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY**\n\n**(dollar amounts in millions)** |  **Q3-24** |  **Q3-23**  \n---|---|---  \n_Portfolio Activity During the Period:_  \nGross commitments  |  $  |  3,919  |  $  |  1,598   \nExits of commitments  |  $  |  2,598  |  $  |  1,280   \n_Portfolio Information:_  \n**As of**  \n**September 30 , 2024** |  **December 31 , 2023**  \nPortfolio investments at fair value  |  $  |  25,918  |  $  |  22,874   \nFair value of accruing debt and other income producing securities(6)  |  $  |  23,346  |  $  |  20,375   \nNumber of portfolio company investments  |  535  |  505   \nPercentage of floating rate securities at fair value(7)  |  69  |  %  |  69  |  %   \nWeighted average yields on debt and other income producing securities(8):   \nAt amortized cost  |  11.7  |  %  |  12.5  |  %   \nAt fair value  |  11.7  |  %  |  12.5  |  %   \nWeighted average yields on total investments(9):   \nAt amortized cost  |  10.7  |  %  |  11.3  |  %   \nAt fair value  |  10.5  |  %  |  11.2  |  %   \n_Asset class percentage at fair value:_  \nFirst lien senior secured loans  |  53  |  %  |  44  |  %   \nSecond lien senior secured loans  |  11  |  %  |  16  |  %   \nSubordinated certificates of the SDLP  |  5  |  %  |  6  |  %   \nSenior subordinated loans  |  5  |  %  |  5  |  %   \nPreferred equity  |  10  |  %  |  11  |  %   \nIvy Hill Asset Management, L.P.(10)  |  7  |  %  |  9  |  %   \nOther equity  |  9  |  %  |  9  |  %   \n(6)  |  Includes the fair value of Ares Capital’s equity investment in Ivy Hill Asset Management, L.P. (“IHAM”).   \n---|---  \n(7)  |  Includes Ares Capital's investment in the subordinated certificates of the SDLP (as defined below).   \n(8)  |  Weighted average yields on debt and other income producing securities are computed as (a) the annual stated interest rate or yield earned plus the net annual amortization of original issue discount and market discount or premium earned on accruing debt and other income producing securities (including the annualized amount of the dividend received by Ares Capital related to its equity investment in IHAM during the most recent quarter end), divided by (b) the total accruing debt and other income producing securities at amortized cost or at fair value (including the amortized cost or fair value of Ares Capital’s equity investment in IHAM as applicable), as applicable.   \n(9)  |  Weighted average yields on total investments are computed as (a) the annual stated interest rate or yield earned plus the net annual amortization of original issue discount and market discount or premium earned on accruing debt and other income producing securities (including the annualized amount of the dividend received by Ares Capital related to its equity investment in IHAM during the most recent quarter end), divided by (b) total investments at amortized cost or at fair value, as applicable.   \n(10)  |  Includes Ares Capital’s subordinated loan and equity investments in IHAM, as applicable.   \n  \nIn the third quarter of 2024, Ares Capital made new investment commitments of approximately $3.9 billion, of which approximately $2.7 billion were funded. New investment commitments included 23 new portfolio companies and 51 existing portfolio companies. As of September 30, 2024, 240 separate private equity sponsors were represented in Ares Capital’s portfolio. Of the approximately $3.9 billion in new commitments made during the third quarter of 2024, 93% were in first lien senior secured loans, 1% were in second lien senior secured loans, 2% were in subordinated certificates of the Senior Direct Lending Program (the “SDLP”), 1% were in senior subordinated loans, 1% were in Ares Capital’s subordinated loan investment in IHAM, 1% were in preferred equity and 1% were in other equity. Of the approximately $3.9 billion in new commitments, 95% were in floating rate debt securities, of which 87% contained interest rate floors and 2% were in the subordinated certificates of the SDLP. The weighted average yield of debt and other income producing securities funded during the period at amortized cost was 10.3% and the weighted average yield on total investments funded during the period at amortized cost was 10.1%. Ares Capital may seek to sell all or a portion of these new investment commitments, although there can be no assurance that Ares Capital will be able to do so. Also in the third quarter of 2024, Ares Capital funded approximately $453 million related to previously existing unfunded revolving and delayed draw loan commitments. \n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, Ares Capital exited approximately $2.6 billion of investment commitments. Of the approximately $2.6 billion of exited investment commitments, 72% were first lien senior secured loans, 12% were second lien senior secured loans, 5% were subordinated certificates of the SDLP, 3% were senior subordinated loans, 1% were Ares Capital’s subordinated loan investment in IHAM, 6% were preferred equity and 1% were other equity. Of the approximately $2.6 billion of exited investment commitments, 92% were floating rate, 3% were fixed rate, 2% were non-income producing and 3% were on non-accrual. \n\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the weighted average grade of the portfolio at fair value was 3.1 and 3.1, respectively, and loans on non-accrual status represented 1.3% of the total investments at amortized cost (or 0.6% at fair value) and 1.3% at amortized cost (or 0.6% at fair value), respectively. For more information on Ares Capital’s portfolio investment grades and loans on non-accrual status, see “Part I—Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Portfolio and Investment Activity” in Ares Capital’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on October 30, 2024. \n\n**LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, Ares Capital had $486 million in cash and cash equivalents and $13.5 billion in total aggregate principal amount of debt outstanding ($13.5 billion at carrying value). Subject to borrowing base and other restrictions, Ares Capital had approximately $4.5 billion available for additional borrowings under its existing credit facilities as of September 30, 2024. \n\nIn July 2024, Ares Capital and its consolidated subsidiary, ARCC FB Funding LLC (“AFB”), entered into an agreement to amend AFB’s revolving funding facility (the “BNP Funding Facility”). The amendment, among other things, (a) increased the total commitment under the BNP Funding Facility from $865 million to approximately $1.3 billion, (b) extended the end of the reinvestment period from April 20, 2026 to July 26, 2027, (c) extended the stated maturity date from April 20, 2028 to July 26, 2029 and (d) adjusted the interest rate charged on the BNP Funding Facility from an applicable Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) or a “base rate” (as defined in the documents governing the BNP Funding Facility) plus a margin of (i) 2.50% during the reinvestment period and (ii) 3.00% following the reinvestment period to an applicable SOFR or a “base rate” plus a margin of (i) 2.10% during the reinvestment period and (ii) 2.60% following the reinvestment period. The other terms of the BNP Funding Facility remained materially unchanged. \n\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, Ares Capital issued and sold approximately 14.7 million shares of common stock under its equity distribution agreements, with net proceeds totaling approximately $302.4 million, after giving effect to sales agents’ commissions and certain estimated offering expenses. \n\n**THIRD QUARTER 2024 DIVIDENDS PAID**\n\nOn July 30, 2024, Ares Capital announced that its Board of Directors declared a third quarter 2024 dividend of $0.48 per share for a total of approximately $308 million. The third quarter 2024 dividend was paid on September 30, 2024 to stockholders of record as of September 13, 2024. \n\n**RECENT DEVELOPMENTS**\n\nOn October 8, 2024, Ares Capital and its consolidated subsidiary, Ares Capital CP Funding LLC (“Ares Capital CP”), entered into an agreement to amend Ares Capital CP’s revolving funding facility (“Revolving Funding Facility”). The amendment, among other things, (a) increased the commitments under the Revolving Funding Facility from $1.775 billion to $2.150 billion, (b) extended the end of the reinvestment period from December 29, 2024 to October 8, 2027, (c) extended the stated maturity date from December 29, 2026 to October 8, 2029 and (d) adjusted the interest rate charged on the Revolving Funding Facility from an applicable SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.10% or a “base rate” plus an applicable spread of 1.90% per annum to an applicable SOFR or a “base rate” (as defined in the documents governing the Revolving Funding Facility) plus an applicable spread of 2.00% per annum and with no credit spread adjustment. The other terms of the Revolving Funding Facility remained materially unchanged. \n\nIn October 2024, Ares Capital, through a wholly owned and consolidated subsidiary, priced a $544 million term debt securitization. The transaction is expected to close in November 2024, subject to customary closing conditions. A term debt securitization is also known as a collateralized loan obligation and is a form of secured financing incurred by Ares Capital which is consolidated by it and subject to its overall asset coverage requirement. \n\nFrom October 1, 2024 through October 24, 2024, Ares Capital made new investment commitments of approximately $408 million, of which approximately $320 million were funded. Of the approximately $408 million in new investment commitments, 55% were in first lien senior secured loans, 19% were in senior subordinated loans and 26% were in Ares Capital’s subordinated loan investment in IHAM. All of the approximately $408 million in new investment commitments were floating rate. The weighted average yield of debt and other income producing securities funded during the period at amortized cost was 10.8% and the weighted average yield on total investments funded during the period at amortized cost was 10.8%. Ares Capital may seek to sell all or a portion of these new investment commitments, although there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so. \n\nFrom October 1, 2024 through October 24, 2024, Ares Capital exited approximately $1.2 billion of investment commitments, including $458 million of loans sold to IHAM or certain vehicles managed by IHAM. Of the approximately $1.2 billion of exited investment commitments, 60% were first lien senior secured loans, 28% were second lien senior secured loans, 1% were subordinated certificates of the SDLP, 11% were Ares Capital’s subordinated loan investment in IHAM. All of the approximately $1.2 billion of exited investment commitments were floating rate. The weighted average yield of debt and other income producing securities exited or repaid during the period at amortized cost was 11.3% and the weighted average yield on total investments exited or repaid during the period at amortized cost was 11.3%. Of the approximately $1.2 billion of investment commitments exited from October 1, 2024 through October 24, 2024, Ares Capital recognized total net realized gains of approximately $4 million, with no realized gains or losses recognized from the sale of loans to IHAM or certain vehicles managed by IHAM. \n\nIn addition, as of October 24, 2024, Ares Capital had an investment backlog of approximately $2.8 billion. Investment backlog includes transactions approved by Ares Capital’s investment adviser’s investment committee and/or for which a formal mandate, letter of intent or a signed commitment have been issued, and therefore Ares Capital believes are likely to close. The consummation of any of the investments in this backlog depends upon, among other things, one or more of the following: Ares Capital’s acceptance of the terms and structure of such investment and the execution and delivery of satisfactory transaction documentation. In addition, Ares Capital may sell all or a portion of these investments and certain of these investments may result in the repayment of existing investments. Ares Capital cannot assure you that it will make any of these investments or that Ares Capital will sell all or any portion of these investments. \n\n**WEBCAST / CONFERENCE CALL**\n\nAres Capital will host a webcast/conference call on Wednesday, October 30, 2024 at 12:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) to discuss its quarter ended September 30, 2024 financial results.

The basic weighted average shares outstanding for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 635 million and 614 million, respectively, and approximately 562 million and 548 million, respectively, for the comparable periods in 2023.   \n---|---  \n(2)  |  The basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 635 million shares and 614 million shares, respectively. Ares Capital’s diluted GAAP net income per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $0.87 and $1.98, respectively. The weighted average shares outstanding for the purpose of calculating the diluted GAAP net income per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were approximately 582 million shares and 568 million shares, respectively, which includes approximately 20 million shares for each period related to the assumed conversion of the then outstanding 2024 Convertible Notes.   \n(3)  |  Core EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure. Core EPS is the net increase (decrease) in stockholders’ equity resulting from operations, and excludes net realized and unrealized gains and losses, any capital gains incentive fees attributable to such net realized and unrealized gains and losses and any income taxes related to such net realized gains and losses, divided by the basic weighted average shares outstanding for the relevant period. GAAP net income (loss) per share is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Ares Capital believes that Core EPS provides useful information to investors regarding financial performance because it is one method Ares Capital uses to measure its financial condition and results of operations. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP.   \n  \n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20241030297703r1&sid=acqr8&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\nView source version on [businesswire.com](http://businesswire.com): <https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241030297703/en/>\n\n**INVESTOR RELATIONS CONTACTS** Ares Capital Corporation John Stilmar or Carl Drake (888) 818-5298 irarcc@aresmgmt.com\n\nSource: Ares Capital Corporation\n\n[ Download PDF ](/news/?id=e41842d9-9a6a-41aa-bf10-63c809a89ca3&showPdf=1)\n\nBack \n"

The weighted average shares outstanding for the purpose of calculating the diluted GAAP net income per share for the three months ended June 30, 2023 was approximately 567 million shares, which includes approximately 20 million shares related to the assumed conversion of Ares Capital’s $403 million in aggregate principal amount of unsecured convertible notes (the “2024 Convertible Notes”).   \n(4)  |  Core EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure. Core EPS is the net increase (decrease) in stockholders’ equity resulting from operations, and excludes net realized and unrealized gains and losses, any capital gains incentive fees attributable to such net realized and unrealized gains and losses and any income taxes related to such net realized gains and losses, divided by the basic weighted average shares outstanding for the relevant period. GAAP net income (loss) per share is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Ares Capital believes that Core EPS provides useful information to investors regarding financial performance because it is one method Ares Capital uses to measure its financial condition and results of operations. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of GAAP net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to Core EPS are set forth in Schedule 1 hereto.   \n(5)  |  Computed as total principal debt outstanding less available cash divided by stockholders’ equity. Available cash excludes restricted cash as well as cash held for uses specifically designated for paying interest and expenses on certain debt.   \n  \n“We reported another strong quarter with solid year-over-year growth in both our Core EPS and net asset value per share,” said Kipp deVeer, Chief Executive Officer of Ares Capital. “Our performance was driven by increased investment activity and continued strong credit fundamentals. We believe our deep origination capabilities and longstanding relationships continue to support our ability to deliver attractive investment returns for our shareholders.” \n\n“With over $5 billion of available liquidity and a net debt to equity ratio of approximately 1.0x, our balance sheet continues to support our ability to invest in the compelling opportunities we are seeing,” said Scott Lem, Chief Financial Officer of Ares Capital. “With the declaration of the upcoming third quarter dividend, we have now had stable or increasing dividends for 15 consecutive years, which we believe is a testament to our industry-leading track record.” \n\n**PORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY**  \n---  \n**(dollar amounts in millions)** |  **Q2-24** |  **Q2-23**  \n_Portfolio Activity During the Period:_  \nGross commitments  |  $  |  3,857  |  $  |  1,218   \nExits of commitments  |  $  |  1,376  |  $  |  1,138   \n_Portfolio Information:_  \n**As of**  \n**June 30, 2024** |  **December 31, 2023**  \nPortfolio investments at fair value  |  $  |  24,973  |  $  |  22,874   \nFair value of accruing debt and other income producing securities(6)  |  $  |  22,463  |  $  |  20,375   \nNumber of portfolio company investments  |  525  |  505   \nPercentage of floating rate securities at fair value(7)  |  69 %  |  69 %   \nWeighted average yields on debt and other income producing securities(8):   \nAt amortized cost  |  12.2 %  |  12.5 %   \nAt fair value  |  12.2 %  |  12.5 %   \nWeighted average yields on total investments(9):   \nAt amortized cost  |  11.1 %  |  11.3 %   \nAt fair value  |  11.0 %  |  11.2 %   \n_Asset class percentage at fair value:_  \nFirst lien senior secured loans  |  50 %  |  44 %   \nSecond lien senior secured loans  |  12 %  |  16 %   \nSubordinated certificates of the SDLP  |  5 %  |  6 %   \nSenior subordinated loans  |  6 %  |  5 %   \nPreferred equity  |  11 %  |  11 %   \nIvy Hill Asset Management, L.P.(10)  |  8 %  |  9 %   \nOther equity  |  8 %  |  9 %   \n____________________________________________  \n---  \n(6)  |  Includes the fair value of Ares Capital’s equity investment in Ivy Hill Asset Management, L.P.

New investment commitments included 23 new portfolio companies and 58 existing portfolio companies. As of June 30, 2024, 239 separate private equity sponsors were represented in Ares Capital’s portfolio. Of the approximately $3.9 billion in new commitments made during the second quarter of 2024, 89% were in first lien senior secured loans, 1% were in second lien senior secured loans, 4% were in senior subordinated loans, 1% were in Ares Capital’s subordinated loan investment in IHAM, 3% were in preferred equity and 2% were in other equity. Of the approximately $3.9 billion in new commitments, 92% were in floating rate debt securities, of which 87% contained interest rate floors. The weighted average yield of debt and other income producing securities funded during the period at amortized cost was 11.2% and the weighted average yield on total investments funded during the period at amortized cost was 11.0%. Ares Capital may seek to sell all or a portion of these new investment commitments, although there can be no assurance that Ares Capital will be able to do so. Also in the second quarter of 2024, Ares Capital funded approximately $375 million related to previously existing unfunded revolving and delayed draw loan commitments. \n\nAlso in the second quarter of 2024, Ares Capital exited approximately $1.4 billion of investment commitments. Of the approximately $1.4 billion of exited investment commitments, 68% were first lien senior secured loans, 19% were second lien senior secured loans, 1% were subordinated certificates of the Senior Direct Lending Program (the “SDLP”), 4% were preferred equity and 8% were other equity. Of the approximately $1.4 billion of exited investment commitments, 68% were floating rate, 6% were fixed rate, 12% were non-income producing and 14% were on non-accrual. \n\nAs of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the weighted average grade of the portfolio at fair value was 3.1 and 3.1, respectively, and loans on non-accrual status represented 1.5% of the total investments at amortized cost (or 0.7% at fair value) and 1.3% at amortized cost (or 0.6% at fair value), respectively. For more information on Ares Capital’s portfolio investment grades and loans on non-accrual status, see “Part I—Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Portfolio and Investment Activity” in Ares Capital’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on July 30, 2024. \n\n**LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES**\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, Ares Capital had $601 million in cash and cash equivalents and $13.0 billion in total aggregate principal amount of debt outstanding ($13.0 billion at carrying value). Subject to borrowing base and other restrictions, Ares Capital had approximately $4.5 billion available for additional borrowings under its existing credit facilities as of June 30, 2024. \n\nIn April 2024, Ares Capital amended and restated its senior secured credit facility (as amended and restated, the “A&R Credit Facility”). The amendment, among other things, (a) reduced the total commitment under the A&R Credit Facility from $4.8 billion to $4.5 billion, (b) extended the expiration of the revolving period for lenders electing to extend their revolving commitments in an amount equal to approximately $3.0 billion from April 19, 2027 to April 12, 2028, during which period Ares Capital, subject to certain conditions, may make borrowings under the A&R Credit Facility, (c) extended the stated maturity date for lenders electing to extend their revolving commitments in an amount equal to approximately $3,005 million from April 19, 2028 to April 12, 2029 and (d) extended the stated maturity date for $968 million of the lenders electing to extend their term loan commitments from April 19, 2028 to April 12, 2029. Lenders who elected not to extend their revolving commitments in an amount equal to approximately $269 million and $107 million will remain subject to a revolving period expiration of March 31, 2026 and March 31, 2025, respectively, and a stated maturity date of March 31, 2027 and March 31, 2026, respectively. Lenders who elected not to extend their term loan commitments in an amount equal to $70 million, $41 million and $28 million will remain subject to a maturity date of April 19, 2028, March 31, 2027 and March 31, 2026, respectively. \n\nThe A&R Credit Facility is composed of a revolving loan tranche equal to approximately $3,381 million and a term loan tranche equal to approximately $1,107 million. The A&R Credit Facility includes an “accordion” feature that allows Ares Capital, under certain circumstances, to increase the size of the facility by an amount up to $2,244 million. \n\nIn addition, in June 2024, Ares Capital increased the total commitment under the A&R Credit Facility from approximately $4,488 million to approximately $4,513 million. The other terms of the A&R Credit Facility remained unchanged. \n\nIn April 2024, Ares Capital and its consolidated subsidiary, ARCC FB Funding LLC (“AFB”), entered into an agreement to amend AFB’s revolving funding facility (the “BNP Funding Facility”). The amendment, among other things, adjusted the interest rate charged on the BNP Funding Facility from an applicable Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) or a “base rate” (as defined in the documents governing the BNP Funding Facility) plus a margin of (i) 2.65% during the reinvestment period and (ii) 3.15% following the reinvestment period to an applicable SOFR or a “base rate” plus a margin of (i) 2.50% during the reinvestment period and (ii) 3.00% following the reinvestment period. The other terms of the BNP Funding Facility remained materially unchanged. \n\nIn May 2024, Ares Capital, through a wholly-owned, consolidated subsidiary, Ares Direct Lending CLO 1 LLC (“ARCC CLO I”), completed a $702 million term debt securitization (the “2024 Debt Securitization”). The 2024 Debt Securitization is also known as a collateralized loan obligation and is an on-balance sheet financing incurred by Ares Capital, which is consolidated by Ares Capital for financial reporting purposes and subject to its overall asset coverage requirement. The notes offered in the 2024 Debt Securitization (collectively, the “2024-1 CLO Notes”) were issued by ARCC CLO I pursuant to the indenture governing the 2024-1 CLO Notes and include (i) $406 million of Class A Senior Floating Rate Notes, which bear interest at an applicable SOFR plus 1.80%; (ii) $70 million Class B Senior Floating Rate Notes, which bear interest at an applicable SOFR plus 2.20%; and (iii) $226 million of subordinated notes (the “CLO Subordinated Notes”), which do not bear interest. Ares Capital retained all of the CLO Subordinated Notes, which are unsecured obligations of ARCC CLO I. The 2024-1 CLO Notes mature on April 25, 2036. \n\nIn May 2024, Ares Capital issued $850 million in aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes, which bear interest at a rate of 5.95% per annum and mature on July 15, 2029 (the “July 2029 Notes”). The July 2029 Notes pay interest semi-annually and all principal is due upon maturity. The July 2029 Notes may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time at Ares Capital’s option at a redemption price equal to par plus a “make whole” premium, if applicable, as determined pursuant to the indenture governing the July 2029 Notes, and any accrued and unpaid interest. The July 2029 Notes were issued at a discount to the principal amount. In connection with the July 2029 Notes, Ares Capital entered into an interest rate swap agreement for a total notional amount of $850 million that matures on July 15, 2029. Under the interest rate swap agreement, Ares Capital receives a fixed interest rate of 5.95% and pays a floating interest rate of one-month SOFR plus 1.64%. \n\nIn June 2024, Ares Capital repaid in full the $900 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of its unsecured notes which bore interest at a rate of 4.200% per annum, payable semi-annually. \n\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2024, Ares Capital issued and sold approximately 21.6 million shares of common stock under its equity distribution agreements, with net proceeds totaling approximately $448.7 million, after giving effect to sales agents’ commissions and certain estimated offering expenses. \n\n**SECOND QUARTER 2024 DIVIDENDS PAID**\n\nOn May 1, 2024, Ares Capital announced that its Board of Directors declared a second quarter 2024 dividend of $0.48 per share for a total of approximately $300 million. The second quarter 2024 dividend was paid on June 28, 2024 to stockholders of record as of June 14, 2024. \n\n**RECENT DEVELOPMENTS**\n\nOn July 25, 2024, Ares Capital and its consolidated subsidiary, AFB, entered into an agreement to amend the BNP Funding Facility. The amendment, among other things, (a) increased the total commitment under the BNP Funding Facility from $865 million to $1,265 million, (b) extended the end of the reinvestment period from April 20, 2026 to July 26, 2027, (c) extended the stated maturity date from April 20, 2028 to July 26, 2029 and (d) adjusted the interest rate charged on the BNP Funding Facility from an applicable SOFR or a “base rate” (as defined in the document governing the BNP Funding Facility) plus a margin of (i) 2.50% during the reinvestment period and (ii) 3.00% following the reinvestment period to an applicable SOFR or a “base rate” plus a margin of (i) 2.10% during the reinvestment period and (ii) 2.60% following the reinvestment period. The other terms of the BNP Funding Facility remained materially unchanged. \n\nFrom July 1, 2024 through July 24, 2024, Ares Capital made new investment commitments of approximately $682 million, of which approximately $532 million were funded. Of the approximately $682 million in new investment commitments, 93% were in first lien senior secured loans, 5% were in senior subordinated loans and 2% were in Ares Capital’s subordinated loan investment in IHAM. Of the approximately $682 million in new investment commitments, 95% were floating rate and 5% were fixed rate. The weighted average yield of debt and other income producing securities funded during the period at amortized cost was 10.6% and the weighted average yield on total investments funded during the period at amortized cost was 10.6%. Ares Capital may seek to sell all or a portion of these new investment commitments, although there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so. \n\nFrom July 1, 2024 through July 24, 2024, Ares Capital exited approximately $493 million of investment commitments. Of the approximately $493 million of exited investment commitments, 82% were first lien senior secured loans, 9% were second lien senior secured loans, 7% were Ares Capital’s subordinated loan investment in IHAM, 1% were preferred equity and 1% were other equity. Of the approximately $493 million of exited investment commitments, 98% were floating rate, 1% were fixed rate and 1% were non-income producing. The weighted average yield of debt and other income producing securities exited or repaid during the period at amortized cost was 11.4% and the weighted average yield on total investments exited or repaid during the period at amortized cost was 11.2%. Of the approximately $493 million of investment commitments exited from July 1, 2024 through July 24, 2024, Ares Capital recognized total net realized gains of approximately $2 million. \n\nIn addition, as of July 24, 2024, Ares Capital had an investment backlog and pipeline of approximately $2.9 billion and $40 million, respectively. Investment backlog includes transactions approved by Ares Capital’s investment adviser’s investment committee and/or for which a formal mandate, letter of intent or a signed commitment have been issued, and therefore Ares Capital believes are likely to close. Investment pipeline includes transactions where due diligence and analysis are in process, but no formal mandate, letter of intent or signed commitment have been issued. The consummation of any of the investments in this backlog and pipeline depends upon, among other things, one or more of the following: satisfactory completion of Ares Capital due diligence investigation of the prospective portfolio company, Ares Capital’s acceptance of the terms and structure of such investment and the execution and delivery of satisfactory transaction documentation. In addition, Ares Capital may sell all or a portion of these investments and certain of these investments may result in the repayment of existing investments. Ares Capital cannot assure you that it will make any of these investments or that Ares Capital will sell all or any portion of these investments. \n\n**WEBCAST / CONFERENCE CALL**\n\nAres Capital will host a webcast/conference call on Tuesday, July 30, 2024 at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) to discuss its quarter ended June 30, 2024 financial results.

The basic weighted average shares outstanding for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 were approximately 616 million and 603 million, respectively, and approximately 547 million and 541 million, respectively, for the comparable periods in 2023.   \n(2)  |  The basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 was approximately 616 million shares and 603 million shares, respectively. Ares Capital’s diluted GAAP net income per share for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 was $0.59 and $1.10, respectively. The weighted average shares outstanding for the purpose of calculating the diluted GAAP net income per share for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 were approximately 567 million shares and 561 million shares, respectively, which includes approximately 20 million shares for each period related to the assumed conversion of the 2024 Convertible Notes.   \n(3)  |  Core EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure. Core EPS is the net increase (decrease) in stockholders’ equity resulting from operations, and excludes net realized and unrealized gains and losses, any capital gains incentive fees attributable to such net realized and unrealized gains and losses and any income taxes related to such net realized gains and losses, divided by the basic weighted average shares outstanding for the relevant period. GAAP net income (loss) per share is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Ares Capital believes that Core EPS provides useful information to investors regarding financial performance because it is one method Ares Capital uses to measure its financial condition and results of operations. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP.   \n  \n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20240729274196r1&sid=acqr8&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\nView source version on [businesswire.com](http://businesswire.com): <https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240729274196/en/>\n\n**INVESTOR RELATIONS** Ares Capital Corporation John Stilmar or Carl Drake (888) 818-5298 irarcc@aresmgmt.com\n\nSource: Ares Capital Corporation\n\n[ Download PDF ](/news/?id=a89429a2-3736-4ff0-9d34-211c7229ebb6&showPdf=1)\n\nBack \n"
