          "content": "– The Global Health and Wellness Company –\nINVESTOR PRESENTATION | November 2024\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis Investor Presentation includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,\nSection 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended and the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act\nof 1995. The expectations, estimates, and projections of the Company may differ from its actual results and consequently, you should not rely\non these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Words such as “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “budget,” “forecast,”\n“anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “may,” “might,” “project,” “possible,” “would,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “believe,” “predict,” “potential,”\n“continue,” or the negative or other variations thereof and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These\nforward-looking statements include, without limitation, expectations with respect to future performance of the Company, including projected\nDISCLOSURE &\nfinancial information (which is not audited or reviewed by the Company’s auditors), and the future plans, operations and opportunities for the\nCompany and other statements that are not historical facts. These statements are based on the current expectations and beliefs of the\nFORWARD-LOOKING\nCompany’s management concerning future developments and their potential effects on us taking into account information currently available to\nSTATEMENTS us and are not predictions of actual performance. There can be no assurances that future developments affecting us will be those that we have\nanticipated. These forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially\nfrom the expected results. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to: the demand for the Company’s services\ntogether with the possibility that the Company may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors or changes in\nthe business environment in which the Company operates; changes in consumer preferences or the market for the Company’s services; changes\nin applicable laws or regulations; the availability of competition for opportunities for expansion of the Company’s business; difficulties of\nmanaging growth profitably; the loss of one or more members of the Company’s management team; and other risks and uncertainties described\nor incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Company’s reports (including all amendments to those reports) filed from\ntime to time with the SEC, including the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the\nCompany’s most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. The Company cautions that the foregoing list of\nfactors is not exclusive. You should not place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made.\nShould one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, they could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking\nstatements. The Company does not undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any\nforward-looking statements to reflect any change in its expectations or any change in events, conditions, or circumstances on which any such\nstatement is based or otherwise, except as required by law. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing the\nCompany’s assessments as of any date subsequent to the date of this Investor Presentation.\nPRIVILEGED, PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL2\nUse of Projections\nThis Investor Presentation contains financial forecasts, including with respect to estimated Revenues, Net Income, Adjusted Net Income, EBITDA, Adjusted\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Unlevered After-Tax Free Cash Flow, Levered After-Tax Free Cash Flow and Unlevered After-Tax Free Cash Flow\nConversion. OSW’s independent auditors did not audit, review, compile, or perform any procedures with respect to the projections for the purpose of\ntheir inclusion in this Investor Presentation, and accordingly, did not express an opinion or provide any other form of assurance with respect thereto for\nthe purpose of this Investor Presentation. These projections should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of future results. In this Investor\nPresentation, certain of the above-mentioned estimated information has been repeated (subject to the qualifications presented herein), for purposes of\nproviding comparisons with historical data. The assumptions and estimates underlying the prospective financial information are inherently uncertain and\nare subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially\nfrom those contained in the prospective financial information. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the prospective results are indicative of the\nDISCLOSURE, future performance of OSW or that actual results will not differ materially from those presented in the prospective financial information. Inclusion of the\nprospective financial information in this Investor Presentation should not be regarded as a representation by any person that the results contained in the\nCONTINUED prospective financial information will be achieved.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), this Investor\nPresentation includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Unlevered After-Tax Free Cash Flow,\nLevered After-Tax Free Cash Flow and Unlevered After-Tax Free Cash Flow Conversion, which may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures\nof other companies. OSW believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures provides information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly\nthe ability of OSW to meet capital expenditure and working capital requirements and provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing\noperating results and trends. These non-GAAP financial measures are in addition to, and not a substitute for or superior to, measures of financial\nperformance prepared in accordance with GAAP. There are certain limitations related to the use of these non-GAAP financial measures versus their\nnearest GAAP equivalents. For example, other companies may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate\ntheir performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparisons with other companies. Please\nsee our most recent Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as well as our earnings press releases reporting our financial results for the year\nended December 31, 2023 and the quarter ended June30, 2024, for further details on how we define these non-GAAP financial measures and for\nreconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their nearest GAAP equivalents. We are not providing a quantitative reconciliation of forward-\nlooking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure because we are unable to predict with reasonable certainty the\nultimate outcome of certain significant items that are uncertain, depend on various factors and could be material to our results computed in accordance\nwith GAAP.\nIndustry and Market Data\nIn this Investor Presentation, OSW relies on and refers to information and statistics regarding market shares in the sectors in which it competes and other\nindustry data. OSW obtained this information and statistics from third-party sources believed to be reliable, including reports by market research firms.\nOSW has supplemented this information where necessary with information from discussions with its customers and its own internal estimates, taking into\naccount publicly available information about other industry participants and its management’s best view as to information that is not publicly available.\nOSW has not independently verified the accuracy or completeness of any such third-party information.\nPRIVILEGED, PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL3\nEXAMPLES OF WORLD CLASS\nFACILITIES AT SEA, ON LAND\n• 90+% outsourced spa market share on cruise ships\nPREEMINENT LEADER • Nearly 20x larger than nearest maritime competitor\n• ~23M annual captive audience\n• 20+ consecutive years of global passenger growth1\nFAVORABLE INDUSTRY\nKEY INVESTMENT\n• Strong population and demographic trends\nDYNAMICS\nHIGHLIGHTS • Emphasis on health, wellness and luxury lifestyles\n• 90+% outsourced spa\nmarket share on cruise\nships • Robust infrastructure and global network\nDIFFICULT TO REPLICATE • Training and service model built over several decades\n• 20+ consecutive years\n• Staggered contracts with cruise line partners\nof global passenger\ngrowth1\n• Robust infrastructure\n• Cruise capacity and occupancy is highly visible\nand global network PREDICTABLE\n• Published Cruise Ship order data\n• Cruise capacity and GROWTH\n• Multi-year contracts include new ships during term\noccupancy is highly\nvisible\n• New services lead to\n• New services lead to higher spend\nINNOVATION IN SERVICES\nhigher spend\n• Increased utilization from booking tools\n& ENHANCED CAPABILITIES\n• ~90% after-tax free • Expansion in offerings to appeal to a broader customer base\ncash flow to Adj.\nEBITDA conversion\n• ~90% after-tax free cash flow to Adj.

Adjusted net income per\ndiluted share is defined as Adjusted net income divided by the weighted average diluted shares outstanding during the period, as if such shares\nhad been outstanding during the entire three and six month periods ended 2024 and 2023.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as income from continuing operations before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and\namortization, adjusted for the impact of certain other items, including non-cash stock-based compensation expense and change in fair value of\nwarrant liabilities.\nWe define Unlevered after-tax free cash flow as Adjusted EBITDA minus capital expenditures and cash taxes paid.\nWe believe that these non-GAAP measures, when reviewed in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, and not in isolation or as substitutes\nfor analysis of our results of operations under GAAP, are useful to investors as they are widely used measures of performance and the\nadjustments we make to these non-GAAP measures provide investors further insight into our profitability and additional perspectives in\ncomparing our performance to other companies and in comparing our performance over time on a consistent basis. Adjusted net income,\nAdjusted net income per diluted share, Adjusted EBITDA and Unlevered after-tax free cash flow have limitations as profitability or liquidity\nmeasures in that they do not include total amounts for interest expense on our debt and provision for income taxes, and the effect of our\nexpenditures for capital assets and certain intangible assets. In addition, all of these non-GAAP measures have limitations as profitability or\nliquidity measures in that they do not include the effect of non-cash stock-based compensation expense and the impact of certain expenses\nrelated to items that are settled in cash. Because of these limitations, the Company relies primarily on its GAAP results.\nIn the future, we may incur expenses similar to those for which adjustments are made in calculating Adjusted EBITDA. Our presentation of\nAdjusted EBITDA should not be construed as a basis to infer that our future results will be unaffected by extraordinary, unusual, or\nnonrecurring items.\nReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Information\nThe following table reconciles Net income (loss) to Adjusted net income for the second quarters and year-to-date periods ended June 30, 2024\nand 2023 and Adjusted net income per diluted share for the second quarters and year-to-date periods ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 (amounts in\nthousands, except per share amounts):\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nJune 30, June 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet income (loss) $ 15,759 $ (3,177) $ 36,925 $ (19,081)\nChange in fair value of warrant liabilities 46 12,201 (7,677) 34,101\nDepreciation and amortization (a) 3,761 3,761 7,522 7,522\nStock-based compensation 2,094 2,257 4,188 4,848\nAdjusted net income $ 21,660 $ 15,042 $ 40,958 $ 27,390\nAdjusted net income per diluted share $ 0.20 $ 0.15 $ 0.39 $ 0.28\nDiluted weighted average shares outstanding 105,767 99,508 104,346 98,011\n(a) Depreciation and amortization refers to addback of purchase price adjustments to tangible and intangible assets resulting from the Business\nCombination.\nThe following table reconciles Net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA and Unlevered after-tax free cash flow for the second quarters and year-\nto-date periods ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 (amounts in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nJune 30, June 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet income (loss) $ 15,759 $ (3,177) $ 36,925 $ (19,081)\nIncome tax expense 813 59 1,392 618\nInterest expense 2,221 4,352 5,176 8,962\nChange in fair value of warrant liabilities 46 12,201 (7,677) 34,101\nDepreciation and amortization 5,870 5,477 12,079 10,986\nStock-based compensation 2,094 2,257 4,188 4,848\nBusiness combination costs (b) 293 476 293 476\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 27,096 $ 21,645 $ 52,376 $ 40,910\nCapital expenditures (1,116) (882) (2,322) (2,201)\nCash taxes (2,223) (637) (2,244) (678)\nUnlevered after-tax free cash flow $ 23,757 $ 20,126 $ 47,810 $ 38,031\n(b) Business combination costs refers to legal and advisory fees incurred by OneSpaWorld in connection with the Business Combination,\nincluding costs associated with the secondary offering and warrant conversion.\nContact:\nICR:\nInvestors:\nAllison Malkin, 203-682-8225\nallison.malkin@icrinc.com\nFollow OneSpaWorld:\nInstagram: @onespaworld\nLinkedIn: OneSpaWorld\nFacebook: @onespaworld"

We are increasing our annual outlook\nbeyond the outperformance achieved in the first quarter based on the ongoing strong execution by our talented team, new partnerships,\nand new initiatives which continue to drive organic growth.\nThe first quarter included several noteworthy accomplishments,” continued Mr. Fluxman. “Financially, we grew total revenue by\n16%, income from operations by 52% and adjusted EBITDA by 31%. We generated robust free cash flow, bolstering our strong\nbalance sheet. We grew key maritime operating metrics at double digit rates, supported by the sustained pipeline of strategic initiatives\nto increase pre-booking, the number of treatments per client, and the number of passengers utilizing the spa. We entered into a new\nexclusive agreement with Royal Caribbean Cruises and Celebrity Cruises for their existing 40 ships in service and all future ships\nwhich enter service during the agreement term. We also added Aroya Cruises to our list of partners, where we will operate all health\nand wellness facilities beginning in late 2024. We anticipate ending fiscal 2024 operating aboard 198 vessels.”\nMr. Fluxman stated further: “The quarter marked a key milestone for OneSpaWorld: the fifth anniversary of our de-SPAC public\nlisting. Notably, OneSpaWorld public warrant holders expressed their support for the company, with 98% of all outstanding warrants\nconverted and exercised. The remaining warrants were canceled. Importantly, we also eliminated the overhang of our private equity\ninvestor which sold its final tranche of our shares, simplifying our capital structure, while increasing trading liquidity and the public\nfloat.\nBased on sustained robust consumer demand for cruising and execution of our proven operating strategies and growth initiatives, we\nexpect that fiscal 2024 will be another year of significant accomplishments and increasing value for OneSpaWorld shareholders. In\nrecognition of this strength and our favorable long-term growth prospects, as well as the strength of our balance sheet, our Board of\nDirectors approved a $50 million share repurchase program,” concluded Mr. Fluxman.\nStephen Lazarus, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Operating Officer, added, “We ended the quarter with total cash of $66.6 million.\nWe received $51.7 million net from the completion of the warrant conversion, repaid $20.0 million of our first lien term loan, and\nutilized $7.7 million to repurchase common shares during the quarter. Since the second quarter of 2022, we have repaid a total of\n$94.1 million in debt, reducing interest expense.”\nMr. Lazarus concluded, “with our strong first quarter performance and a positive outlook, we have increased our fiscal year 2024\nguidance. We now expect revenues to increase 10% and adjusted EBITDA to increase 12% at the mid-point of the guidance range\nfrom fiscal 2023 actual results.”\nFirst Quarter 2024 Highlights:\n• Total revenues increased 16% to $211.2 million compared to $182.5 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n• Income from operations increased 52% to $17.0 million compared to $11.2 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n• Adjusted EBITDA increased 31% to $25.3 million compared to $19.3 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n• Unlevered after-tax free cash flow increased $6.2 million to $24.1 million compared to $17.9 million in the first quarter of\n2023.

The increase was\nprincipally attributable to our average ship count increasing 9% to 188 health and wellness centers onboard ships\noperating during the quarter, compared with our average ship count of 173 health and wellness centers onboard ships\noperating during the first quarter of 2023. In addition, we benefited from our initiatives to drive revenue growth and\nprofitability in each of our onboard health and wellness centers through enhanced pre-booking of guest services, onboard\nguest engagement and experiences, our guest service and product offering innovations, and the disciplined execution of\nour complex operating protocols by our onboard and corporate teams.\n• Cost of services were $144.0 million compared to $126.3 million in the first quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily\nattributable to costs associated with increased service revenues of $172.2 million in the quarter from our operating health\nand wellness centers at sea and on land, compared with service revenues of $150.1 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n• Cost of products were $33.5 million compared to $28.3 million in the first quarter of 2023.

The $37.1 million increase in net income was attributable to:\n(i) a $29.6 million positive change in fair value of warrant liabilities; (ii) a $1.7 million decrease in interest expense; and\n(iii) a $5.8 million positive change in income from operations. The change in fair value of warrant liabilities during the\nquarter ended March 31, 2024 was a gain of $7.7 million compared to a loss of ($21.9) million during the quarter ended\nMarch 31, 2023. Net gain in the change in fair value of warrant liabilities was the result of the remeasurement to fair value\nof the warrants exercised during the first quarter of 2024 and changes in market prices of our common stock and other\nobservable inputs deriving the value of these financial instruments.\n• Adjusted net income was $19.3 million, or adjusted net income per diluted share of $0.19, as compared to adjusted net\nincome of $12.3 million, or adjusted net income per diluted share of $0.13, in the first quarter of 2023.\n• Adjusted EBITDA was $25.3 million compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $19.3 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n• Unlevered after-tax free cash flow was $24.1 million compared to $17.9 million in the first quarter of 2023.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow Highlights\n• Cash at quarter-end March 31, 2024 was $66.6 million.\n• Total debt, net of deferred financing costs, at March 31, 2024, was $138.6 million.\nWarrant Exchange\nOn March 26, 2024, the Company announced that all remaining public warrants had been converted into common shares and\nexercised or canceled, generating $51.7 million in net cash proceeds during the quarter ended March 31, 2024. Over the five-year\nexercise period that expired on March 19, 2024, a total of 24,034,310 warrants were exercised, generating net proceeds to the\nCompany (after deducting applicable fees) of approximately $54.1 million. As previously announced, a total of 19,270,733 warrants\nwere exchanged for the Company’s common shares pursuant to privately negotiated warrant exchange agreements with certain holders\nof the warrants. The Company’s fully diluted share count is expected to approximate 105 million as of June 30, 2024, as most of the\nwarrants were converted for cash.\nShare Repurchase Program\nSubsequent to quarter end, the Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase\nup to $50 million of its common shares. The share repurchases will be funded through the Company’s available cash.\nThe Company may repurchase shares of its outstanding common stock from time to time on the open market, including through Rule\n10b5-1 plans, in privately negotiated transactions, through block purchases, or otherwise in compliance with applicable laws,\nincluding Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Adjusted net income per diluted share is defined as Adjusted net income divided by the weighted\naverage diluted shares outstanding during the period, as if such shares had been outstanding during the entire three-month periods\nended March 31, 2024 and 2023.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as loss from continuing operations before interest expense, income taxes expense, depreciation and\namortization, adjusted for the impact of certain other items, including non-cash stock-based compensation expense, impairment\ncharges of long-lived assets and change in fair value of warrant liabilities.\nWe define Unlevered after-tax free cash flow as Adjusted EBITDA minus capital expenditures and cash taxes paid.\nWe believe that these non-GAAP measures, when reviewed in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, and not in isolation or as\nsubstitutes for analysis of our results of operations under GAAP, are useful to investors as they are widely used measures of\nperformance and the adjustments we make to these non-GAAP measures provide investors further insight into our profitability and\nadditional perspectives in comparing our performance to other companies and in comparing our performance over time on a consistent\nbasis. Adjusted net income, Adjusted net income per diluted share, Adjusted EBITDA and Unlevered after-tax free cash flow have\nlimitations as profitability measures in that they do not include total amounts for interest expense on our debt and provision for income\ntaxes, and the effect of our expenditures for capital assets and certain intangible assets. In addition, all of these non-GAAP measures\nhave limitations as profitability measures in that they do not include the effect of non-cash stock-based compensation expense and the\nimpact of certain expenses related to items that are settled in cash. Because of these limitations, the Company relies primarily on its\nGAAP results.\nIn the future, we may incur expenses similar to those for which adjustments are made in calculating Adjusted EBITDA. Our\npresentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as a basis to infer that our future results will be unaffected by\nextraordinary, unusual, or nonrecurring items.\nReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Information\nThe following table reconciles Net income (loss) to Adjusted net income for the first quarters ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 and\nAdjusted net income per diluted share for the first quarters ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 (amounts in thousands, except per share\namounts):\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2024 2023\nNet income (loss) $ 21,166 $ (15,904)\nChange in fair value of warrant liabilities (7,723 ) 21,900\nDepreciation and amortization (a) 3,761 3,761\nStock-based compensation 2,094 2,591\nAdjusted net income $ 19,298 $ 12,348\nAdjusted net income per diluted share $ 0.19 $ 0.13\nDiluted weighted average shares outstanding 102,933 96,589\n(a) Depreciation and amortization refers to addback of purchase price adjustments to tangible and intangible assets resulting from the\nBusiness Combination.\nThe following table reconciles Net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA and Unlevered after-tax free cash flow for the first quarters\nended March 31, 2024 and 2023 (amounts in thousands):\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2024 2023\nNet income (loss) $ 21,166 $ (15,904)\nIncome tax expense 579 559\nInterest expense, net 2,955 4,610\nChange in fair value of warrant liabilities (7,723 ) 21,900\nDepreciation and amortization 6,209 5,509\nStock-based compensation 2,094 2,591\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 25,280 $ 19,265\nCapital expenditures (1,206 ) (1,319)\nCash taxes (21 ) (41)\nUnlevered after-tax free cash flow $ 24,053 $ 17,905\nContact:\nICR:\nInvestors:\nAllison Malkin, 203-682-8225\nallison.malkin@icrinc.com\nFollow OneSpaWorld:\nInstagram: @onespaworld\nLinkedIn: OneSpaWorld\nFacebook: @onespaworld"

Today, we announced the completion of our public warrant conversion, yet another key\naccomplishment for our Company. These actions combined with the exit of ownership by our private\nequity investor, Steiner Leisure Limited allows us to move forward with a simplified capital structure,\nincreased trading liquidity and increased public float for the benefit of our shareholders.”\nFluxman added, “We continue to be excited about our business outlook as the robust trends we\nexperienced in 2023 have continued into 2024. The momentum for cruising remains strong, and we\ncontinue to add new health and wellness centers to our fold and forge new and extended agreements\nwith our partners, most recently with Royal Caribbean and Celebrity Cruises. We believe our strategies\nhave us poised to take our superior guest experiences to a higher level of performance to drive\ncontinued increases in key operating metrics at our health and wellness centers. We continue to expect\nfiscal 2024 to represent another record year for OneSpaWorld, and importantly, increase value for our\nstakeholders. We remain confident in our ability to deliver consistent and sustained long term revenue\nand profit growth.”\nOn March 19, 2019, OneSpaWorld Holdings Limited (the “Company”) issued 24,499,999 warrants to\npurchase common shares, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company, at an exercise price of $11.50\nper share (the “Warrants”). On March 19, 2024, the five-year exercise period for the Warrants (the\n“Exercise Period”) expired and the remaining 465,689 unexercised Warrants were cancelled. Over the\nExercise Period, a total of 24,034,310 Warrants were exercised, generating net proceeds to the\nCompany (after deducting applicable fees) of approximately $54.1 million. As previously announced, a\ntotal of 19,270,733 Warrants were exchanged for the Company’s common shares pursuant to privately\nnegotiated warrant exchange agreements with certain holders of the Warrants. As most of the warrants\nwere converted for cash, the diluted share count is now approximately 106.0 million.\nThis communication is for informational purposes only and is neither an offer to purchase, nor a\nsolicitation of an offer to sell, subscribe for or buy, any securities, nor shall there be any sale, issuance or\ntransfer or securities in any jurisdiction in contravention of applicable law.\nAbout OneSpaWorld\nHeadquartered in Nassau, Bahamas, OneSpaWorld is one of the largest health and wellness services\ncompanies in the world.
