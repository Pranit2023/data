In addition, we focused on expanding our business domein such as the automobile business.\n\nInvestments in the priority investment areas set for the four years starting in FY21 were carried out ahead of schedule, and we evaluated that we were able to implement and enhance the functions necessary for future growth. So, we will revise the medium-term management plan one year ahead of schedule. We have announced a new medium-term management plan, “To the Next Stage: For 2030 Revival Vision,” with the three-year period ending in FY27 as the period for structural reform toward FY30. Our basic policy is to implement structural reforms for improve profitability and continue to make selective investments, and we will continue to expand and strengthen the functions of our own auction platform. Additionally, we will promote our business with a focus on retail expansion in Japan and expansion of purchasing overseas.\n\nFurthermore, in order to realize our purpose of “Circular Design for the Earth and Us,” we have reviewed our materiality in conjunction with the review of our medium-term management plan, and have established new priority themes and a vision for our group to pursue. (For details, please refer to the [Sustainability page](https://www.valuence.inc/en/sustainability/).) We will aim to achieve sustainable growth by realizing a sustainable society and generating new revenue opportunities. \n\nWe look forward to your continued support.\n\nValuence Holdings Inc.Representative Director\n\nShinsuke Sakimoto\n\n[ Contact ](https://www.valuence.inc/en/contact/)\n\n[ Close Popup ](#)\n\nWe use cookies to give you the best online experience.

In particular, in order to increase the effectiveness of management oversight by the Board of Directors, we are striving to increase the ratio of outside directors to at least one-third of the Board of Directors to the maximum possible majority, and we are working to further strengthen corporate governance. In addition, the Nomination and Compensation Committee, the Risk Management Committee and the ESG Promotion Committee have been established as voluntary bodies of the Board of Directors to enhance corporate governance. \n\n### Corporate governance structure diagram\n\n![](https://www.valuence.inc/wp-content/themes/valuence/assets/images/ir-img_07_en.jpg)\n\n## Corporate Institutions\n\n### Board of Directors\n\nThe Company’s board of directors is composed of 11 members: 7 directors who are not members of the Audit and Supervisory Committee, of which 3 are outside directors, and 4 directors who are members of the Audit and Supervisory Committee, of which 3 are outside directors.

          "url": "https://www.valuence.inc/en/ir/management/risk-info/",
          "content": "[ Valuance Circular Design Company ](https://www.valuence.inc/en)\n\n  * [ EN ](https://www.valuence.inc/en/ir/management/risk-info/ \"EN\")\n  * [JP](https://www.valuence.inc/ir/management/risk-info/ \"JP\")\n\n\n\n  * [](https://x.com/Valuence_group)\n\n\n\n© 2024 Valuence Holdings Inc.\n\n#  RiskInformation\n\n[ Contact ](https://www.valuence.inc/en/contact/)\n\nAmong the matters concerning the status of the Valuence Group (the “Company Group”) business activities, accounting status, etc., the following items may significantly impact investors decisions. Note that forward-looking matters are based on the best judgments of the Company Group as of the date and time of the last update. Not all risks related to business risk or investment in Company stock may be addressed. \n\n## 1. Merchandise Purchasing System\n\n(1) Purchase of Reuse Goods\n     Purchasing reuse goods is the core activity that generates income for the Company Group. However, compared to the purchase of new products, the supply of reuse goods is less certain, depending as it does on the number of goods brought in by customers. To strengthen the stability of its purchasing sources, the Company Group improves SEO, provides outstanding customer support, and offers pre-appraisals via telephone and LINE social media app., to encourage customers to sell goods at buying offices. Efforts are also being made to enhance the purchasing structure, through implementation of delivery buying, in-home buying, and online buying in addition to in-office buying. The Company Group has begun buying merchandise overseas.Nevertheless, the Company Group financial results may be adversely affected by challenges in sourcing reuse goods due to changing economic trends, growing competition, changing customer preferences, or changes in the market price of jewelry, precious metals, and bullion. \n\n(2) Purchasing Staff\n     With the exception of gold and platinum, whose prices are set by the market, reuse goods lack predetermined market prices. The popularity of luxury brands and the recent increase in market volume for reuse goods requires purchasing staff who are capable of inspecting the authenticity of reuse goods in line with the Company Group standards and providing appropriate purchase prices in accordance with individual circumstances. Accordingly, the Company Group recognizes the importance of developing purchasing staff with specialized knowledge and experience.If the Company Group fails to develop sufficient purchasing staff in line with projections, this could hinder buying office operations and opening of new buying offices, which in turn could adversely affect the Company Group financial results. \n\n(3) Risk of Purchasing Counterfeit Goods\n     Counterfeit goods of well-known luxury brand items such as bags and watches are broadly distributed and have emerged as a social issue. The Company Group cultivates purchasing staff’s ability to confirm the authenticity of reuse goods to prevent the purchase of counterfeit goods. The Company Group also performs careful inspections to determine the authenticity of reuse goods before sale to provide safe and secure goods to customers (both partners and general consumers). Counterfeit goods mistakenly purchased are returned or disposed of to prevent resale. The Company Group may ask third-party institutions to assess the authenticity of reuse goods. The nature of its business—purchasing reuse goods from general consumers through secondary distribution rather than from authorized brand stores—poses the constant risk of buying and selling counterfeit goods. The Company Group financial results may be adversely affected by problems or loss of credibility associated with the purchase and sale of counterfeit goods. \n\n(4) Risk of Purchasing Stolen Goods\n     In the event that the Company Group identifies the purchase of any stolen goods, the Company Group attempts to return said items to the rightful owner at no charge within 2 years pursuant to the Civil Code or within 1 year after purchase as permitted under the Civil Code pursuant to the provisions of the Secondhand Articles Dealer Act and when purchased from public markets. The Company Group maintains a firm stance against the purchase of suspected stolen goods in any form and works closely with law enforcement to establish structures to prevent the distribution of stolen goods.From the perspective of compliance with the Secondhand Articles Dealer Act and Civil Code, the Company Group has linked its secondhand articles ledger (detailed records of reuse goods purchase) with its business system to facilitate timely and appropriate cooperation with law enforcement investigations in the event the Company Group discovers purchases of stolen goods and to facilitate the return of stolen goods to the owner at no charge. Nevertheless, the nature of its business makes it difficult to eliminate the purchase of stolen goods entirely. The Company Group financial results may be adversely affected by losses of purchases traceable to the purchase of stolen goods and the loss of creditability arising from such events. \n\n## 2. Expansion and Operation of Stores and Offices\n\n(1) Future Buying Office Opening\n     The Company Group secures reuse goods through Nanboya, BRAND CONCIER, and Hakkoudo offices nationwide.To achieve further growth, the Company Group must continue to improve its capacity to purchase reuse goods. The Company Group financial results may be adversely affected if the opening of buying offices fails to proceed smoothly and the purchase of reuse goods falls short of plans. \n\n(2) Business Areas\n     The Company Group has numerous buying offices in the Special Wards of Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, and surrounding areas, all located at the center of 3 major metropolitan areas supporting relatively large markets for reuse goods. The Company Group financial results may be adversely affected by the destruction of operating facilities or constraints on the use of a wide range of infrastructure in the event of large-scale disasters affecting the 3 major metropolitan and surrounding areas. \n\n(3) Closing of Buying Offices Due to Lease Contracts, Rent Increases\n     The Company Group leases its buying offices and if for some reason the contract cannot be renewed, or if the rents rise upon contract renewal, the Company Group financial results may be adversely affected. \n\n(4) System Failures\n     The Company Group business depends significantly on IT systems to attract customers via the internet; to prevent fraud in cash payout at buying offices; to manage the flow of individual goods; to collect market price data for purchase and sale; and to sell merchandise through online auctions.The Company Group business is capable of operating via organizational response for a limited time in the event of system failures. However, the Company Group financial results may be adversely affected by system stoppages that prove more significant than anticipated. \n\n(5) Asset Impairment Accounting\n     The Company Group operates buying offices and retail stores. The Company Group financial results may be adversely affected if the profitability of each office decreases due to changes in the management environment, resulting in appropriation or losses associated with the application of asset impairment accounting. The Company Group strives to manage profits at each location to prevent impairment and takes appropriate measures at locations marked by low profitability. Nevertheless, an increase in unprofitable locations or the closure of locations may lead to significant impairment losses. \n\n## 3. Influence of Changes in the External Environment\n\n(1) Changes in Financial Results Associated With Changes in the External Environment\n     The Company Group mainly handles precious metals, watches, bullion, jewelry, and reuse luxury brand goods, as well as antiques and art objects. The Company Group has established a stable business structure that reduces dependence on specific goods. To increase earnings further, the Company Group is expanding its lines of merchandise handled to include motor vehicles, real estate, and other property and will handle a wide range of real assets that will have the same value all over the world.However, the prices of some goods may decline due to economic obsolescence associated with changes in trends, exchange rate fluctuations, and changes in market prices of precious metals, bullion, and watches. Additionally, the prices of certain goods may differ significantly depending on the presence or absence of certain popular goods. The Company Group financial results may be adversely affected by sharp fluctuations in exchange rates and stock prices or rapid changes in business sentiment. \n\n(2) Effects of Natural Disasters\n     The Japanese government’s declaration of a state of emergency in response to the COVID-19 pandemic had some impact on buying and selling of reuse goods, resulting from the temporary suspension of buying office operations. Currently, sales were based on the migration of Company-operated auctions to an online platform. Buying occurred under the ordinary structure, with due consideration to prevent the spread of the virus and the highest priority on the safety of customers and employees. Nevertheless, another state of emergency may be declared or similar measures taken in the future; a natural disaster may pose grave difficulties in carrying out business activities, including in-office and in-home purchases of merchandise. \n\n(3) Decrease of Sales and Profitability Declines Associated With Changes in Exchange Rates\n     The Company Group wholesales purchased reuse goods to reuse goods dealers both in Japan and overseas via its independent auctions. Certain reuse goods dealers participating in the auctions tend to quickly sell goods to overseas purchasers. Structurally, its business tends to be influenced by exchange rate fluctuations. Successful bid prices in auctions are influenced by exchange rates. When the yen is weaker, prices tend to increase; prices tend to fall when the yen is stronger.While the Company Group believes this tendency will be diluted by the participation in the auctions of participants from a broader range of countries and regions, the Company Group financial results may be affected by the timing of exchange rate fluctuations and the proportions of partners participating in auctions from specific countries. \n\n(4) Intensified Competition\n     The Company Group competes with other companies to purchase goods. The Company Group seeks to improve its competitiveness and promote differentiation from competitors by strengthening its marketing, opening convenient buying locations, improving service at buying offices, and continuing human resource training and education.However, the Company Group financial results may be adversely affected if competition increases due to new entries into the reuse goods industry. \n\n(5) Dependence on Interest-Bearing Debt\n     The Company Group depends heavily on loans from financial institutions to procure working capital. Accordingly, the Company Group business expansion may be adversely affected if capital procurement fails to proceed as planned due to changes in its financial position. As of August 31, 2023, interest-bearing debt (including lease obligations) was 15.26 billion yen. In addition, although retail sales will be strengthened in the future, the interest-bearing debt ratio may increase due to the growing ratio of retail sales.The Company Group secures sufficient liquidity of funds by entering into the Commitment Line Agreements with multiple financial institutions totaling 11 billion yen. In addition, the Company Group recognizes that maintaining and improving stable external financing capabilities is an important management issue and maintains favorable business relationships with major financial institutions. Moreover, if an increase in interest rates increases the cost of capital procurement, the Company Group financial results may be affected by the resulting pressure on profits. \n\n## 4. Legal Restrictions\n\n(1) Restrictions Imposed by the Secondhand Articles Dealer Act\n     The Company Group is a Certified Secondhand Articles Dealer approved by the Local Public Safety Committee and is obligated to comply with the Secondhand Articles Dealer Act. While Secondhand Articles Dealer certification does not expire, violations of the Secondhand Articles Dealer Act or other laws and regulations regarding the secondhand article business, coupled with the inability to immediately identify or prevent the purchase and sale of stolen goods, may result in business suspension or the revocation of certification by the Local Public Safety Committee, in accordance with Article 24 of the Secondhand Articles Dealer Act.The Company Group purchases and sells secondhand articles under the said certification and operates a market for the purchase and sale of secondhand articles among dealers and international partners with the permission of the secondhand article market owners. The Company Group complies with the Secondhand Articles Dealer Act by providing detailed internal training and education regarding the said act, confirming the identification of sellers in accordance with the said act, and the careful management of secondhand article ledgers. This strengthens the Company Group’s level of confidence that no problems affecting the Company Group’s business continuity will arise.However, the Company Group financial results may be adversely affected if certification is revoked due to the events and conditions referenced above. \n\n(2) Personal Information Management\n     The Company Group handles customer addresses, names, occupations, ages, and credit card information, which are recorded and managed in ledgers in written form or by electromagnetic means. The Company Group has established a system that ensures appropriate protective measures for personal information. The Company Group has also acquired Privacy Mark certification and established internal regulations and other rules. It seeks continually to strengthen internal management structures, provide thorough employee training and education, and enhance information system security to improve its personal information protection management. The Company Group also strives to comply with the Act on the Protection of Personal Information to prevent leaks of personal information. The Group also maintains systems to ensure compliance with laws and regulations in other countries, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA).Nevertheless, the Company Group financial results may be adversely affected, its reputation and societal standing compromised, and significant costs incurred in the event of a personal information leak. \n\n(3) Laws and Regulations regarding the Prevention of Criminal Proceeds Transfer\n     The Criminal Proceeds Transfer Prevention Act applies to the Company Group’s businesses. The Company Group financial results may be adversely affected if the Company Group fails to comply with the said act and is subject to guidance, advice, recommendation, or penalties by government agencies. \n\n## 5. Overseas Business Expansion\n\nThe Company Group continues to develop overseas group businesses to expand its business. The Company Group financial results may be adversely affected in the event of business fluctuations, political and social unrest, changes in laws and regulations, and significant changes in exchange rates in specific countries. In addition, because buying offices overseas are operated by overseas partners using the Company Group’s business name, in the event of negative information or reports related to buying offices operations of local partners, the Company Group financial results and financial position may be adversely affected by a decline in brand image. \n\n## 6. Share Dilution\n\nThe Company Group provides stock acquisition rights to the Company Group directors and employees as incentives. It has adopted the Restricted Stock Compensation Plan and provides shares whose transfer is restricted to the Company Group directors and employees under this program. While the Company Group is considering using these programs in the future as well, the exercise of stock options or the issue of transfer-restricted shares may cause the dilution of shares. \n\n## 7. Risks Related to New Businesses, Corporate Acquisitions, and Investments\n\nThe Company Group aims to improve corporate value through M&A and investments expected to produce synergistic effects to advance into new businesses and strengthen existing businesses. However, the Company Group financial position and business performance may be adversely affected if expected profit growth or synergistic effects are not realized by the companies that went through M&A or investees. \n\nLast Update: November 27, 2023\n\n[ Contact ](https://www.valuence.inc/en/contact/)\n\n[ Close Popup ](#)\n\nWe use cookies to give you the best online experience.

And creating environments for every person to focus on what is most important in their lives. \n\nThe Valuence Group takes a different approach to reuse. We encourage customers to sell their unneeded possessions not for the money, but to pass these precious goods to another who will value them beyond price. In this way, we create opportunities for customers to learn more about themselves through new, essential investments. We value the relationships with customers we meet through shared interests in their possessions, and we strive to maintain these relationships through all life stages. We strive to make the word reuse a familiar part of everyday lives across the world. We continue to take on new challenges in Japan and across the world, creating environments in which customers can focus on what is most important to them. \n\n### Providing added value that goes beyond just buying and selling reused products\n\nThe Valuence Group attracts customers mainly through online channels. We purchase luxury brand goods through the Nanboya and BRAND CONCIER businesses, and antiques and art through the Hakkoudo business. \n\nWe consolidate purchased products at the merchandise management center. Within a few days, we inspect and fix the items for sale through company-operated auctions, stores, and e-commerce sites. We sell wholesale gold bullion and precious metals to specialty dealers.\n\n![](https://www.valuence.inc/wp-content/themes/valuence/assets/images/img_43.jpg)\n\n###  Purchasing\n\n[ View More ](https://www.valuence.inc/en/business/purchasing/)\n\n### Linking Chains, Creating Life-Changing Opportunities \n\nOur purchase business is not simply about putting a price on things that our customers no longer use or need. We listen to the memories and stories behind the goods we buy, discerning the essential value before creating transactions that satisfy our customers. From buy-and-use to sell-and-connect, we help customers make new investments in themselves, nurturing a spiritual richness unique to each person. We strive to create spaces for just such opportunities. \n\n  * [ ![なんぼや](https://www.valuence.inc/wp-content/themes/valuence/assets/images/logo-nanboya_02.svg) ](https://nanboya.com/)\n  * [ ![BRAND CONCIER](https://www.valuence.inc/wp-content/themes/valuence/assets/images/logo-brandconcier_02.svg) ](https://nanboya.com/brand-concier/)\n  * [ ![古美術八光堂](https://www.valuence.inc/wp-content/themes/valuence/assets/images/logo-hakkoudou_02.png) ](https://www.hakkoudo.com/)\n  * [ ![ALLU](https://www.valuence.inc/wp-content/themes/valuence/assets/images/logo-allu_02.svg) ](https://ec-jp.allu-official.com/)\n\n\n\n[ View More ](https://www.valuence.inc/en/business/purchasing/)\n\n![](https://www.valuence.inc/wp-content/themes/valuence/assets/images/img_44.jpg)\n\n###  Retail\n\n[ View More ](https://www.valuence.inc/en/business/retail/)\n\n### A place to create new encounters for customers \n\nWe want to create the moment when people encounter things and feel excited.

This is\nthe market price on the day immediately preceding the resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company,\nand the Company believes that this is rational and cannot be considered a particularly advantageous price.\n5. Matters concerning transactions with majority shareholders, etc.\n(1) Appropriateness of transactions with majority shareholders, etc., and status of compliance with policies\nregarding measures to protect minority shareholders\nSome portions of the New Share Issuance have Shinsuke Sakimoto, the Company’s Representative\nDirector, as the Allottee. He is a shareholder holding 99.3% of the voting rights of SF Property Management\nInc., the majority shareholder of the Company, and as he concurrently serves as Representative Director of\nthe said Company, this classifies as a transaction with a majority shareholder, etc.\nThe “Guidelines on Measures to Protect Minority Shareholders during Dealings with Majority\n5\nShareholders” recorded in the Corporate Governance Report disclosed by the Company on November 22,\n2024, is as follows.\n“When considering transactions with controlling shareholders or close family members of said\nshareholders, Valuence Holdings Inc. may, after deliberating the details and validity of the transactions at a\nmeeting of the board of directors, approve such transactions. Such transactions are predicated on an\nunderlying necessity, subject to the same basic terms and conditions as normal transactions and allowed\nregardless of the financial amount involved. Through this process, the company strives to protect the\ninterests of minority shareholders.”\nThe New Share Issuance was determined according to this policy.\n(2) Matters concerning measures to secure fairness and measures to avoid conflicts of interest\nThe New Share Issuance is implemented in accordance with regulations and procedures stipulated by laws,\nregulations, and various statutes. Additionally, concerning the method for determining the paid-in amount and\nother content and conditions of the issuance as well, as stated in “2. Objectives and reasons for issuance”\nabove, the restricted stock compensation is typical in content and condition and is appropriate, has been\nreported to the Board of Directors after deliberation in the Nomination and Compensation Committee, and\nreceived a resolution at the meeting at the Board of Directors. Furthermore, from the perspective of avoiding\nconflicts of interest, Shinsuke Sakimoto, the Company’s Representative Director, has not participated in the\ndeliberation at the Nomination and Compensation Committee and the deliberation and resolution in the Board\nof Directors regarding the New Share Issuance.\n(3) Summary of opinion from a party with no interest in the majority shareholder stating that said transaction,\netc., will not cause harm interests to the minority shareholders\nThe validity of the content and conditions of the New Share Issuance has been reported to the Company’s\nBoard of Directors after deliberation in the Nomination and Compensation Committee and has been resolved\nby the Board of Directors. Additionally, Chairperson of the Nomination and Compensation Committee\nTakashi Goto (Outside Director who is the Audit and Supervisory Committee Member; Independent Officer)\nprovided the following opinion concerning the determination of this New Share Issuance on November 21,\n2024.\n1 Regarding the objective of the New Share Issuance\nThe New Share Issuance will be conducted based on the System, which is the “Restricted Stock\nCompensation System” introduced by the Board of Directors meeting of the Company held on\nOctober 15, 2018 and the 7th Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders of the Company held on\nNovember 22, 2018. In addition, at the 10th Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders of the\nCompany held on November 25, 2021, the Company resolved to revise compensation related to the\nSystem, as part of measures to revise the compensation system for Directors of the Company\n(excluding Directors who are Audit & Supervisory Committee Members).\nThis New Share Issuance based on the System has the objective of further increasing the desire by\nDirectors (excluding Directors who are Audit & Supervisory Committee Members and Outside\n6\nDirectors) and employees of the Company and Directors and employees of the Company’s\nsubsidiaries to contribute to a higher share price and the improvement of corporate value by having\nthem share the benefits and risks of changes in the share price with shareholders. It can also be\nthought that providing stock to Allottees, including Shinsuke Sakimoto, will work to share value\nbetween Allottees and shareholders while also further increasing the desire to contribute to a higher\nshare price and the improvement of corporate value, and therefore the New Share Issuance will\ncontribute to improving the corporate value of the Company group.\n2 Regarding the validity of the content and conditions, etc., of the New Share Issuance\nThe following are recognized regarding the validity of the content and conditions of the New Share\nIssuance.\n(1) The number of shares of common stock of the Company subject to issuance is a total of 208,900\nshares (of which, the number planned to be allotted to Mr. Sakimoto is 65,600 shares; of which,\n38,300 shares of Restricted Stock I and 27,300 shares of Restricted Stock II), and the ratio against\nthe total number of issued shares (13,532,950 shares as of August 31, 2024) is 1.54%. (rounded to\nthe second decimal place; the combined number of Restricted Stock I and Restricted Stock II\nplanned to be allotted to Mr. Sakimoto is 0.48%), and the ratio of diffusion is insignificant.\n(2) The issuance price is 740 yen, the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the Tokyo\nStock Exchange on the business day immediately preceding (November 21, 2024) the resolution by\nthe Company’s Board of Directors. This is the market price on the day immediately preceding the\nresolution of the Board of Directors of the Company, the price reflects that arbitrary factors were\nexcluded from the determination process, and it can be though that it is rational and not a\nparticularly advantageous price.\n(3) In undertaking the New Share Issuance, the content of the Restricted Stock Allotment Agreement\nfor this New Share Issuance planned to be concluded with Allottees, including Mr. Sakimoto, is\nthought to be typical in content and conditions and appropriate in comparison with restricted stock\nallotment agreements typically found in restricted stock compensation systems at other companies\nof the same type.\nIn consideration of the above, the content and conditions of the New Share Issuance are valid.\n3 Regarding the fairness of the determination process of the New Share Issuance\nThe following are recognized regarding the determination process of the New Share Issuance.\n(1) As stated in 2. (3) above, the content and conditions of the New Share Issuance are thought to be\ntypical in content and conditions and appropriate as restricted stock compensation.\n(2) The New Share Issuance is planned to be implemented based on laws and regulations such as the\nCompanies Act and the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, statutes stipulated by the Tokyo\nStock Exchange, and internal statutes at the Company, and no particular content in violation of\nthese has been recognized.\n7\n(3) In undertaking the New Share Issuance, after deliberation and report to the Board of Director of the\nCompany by the Nomination and Compensation Committee for which an Audit & Supervisory\nCommittee Member who is an Outside Director and Independent Officer of the Company, a\nresolution is planned to be conducted by the Board of Directors of the Company, and Mr. Sakimoto\nis not planned to participate in the deliberation and resolution for said resolution.\nIn consideration of the above, the determination process of the New Share Issuance is fair.\n4 Conclusion\nIn consideration of the content of the above items 1 through 3, the determination of matters\npertaining to the New Share Issuance does not harm the interests of minority shareholders of the\nCompany.\n8"

Provided below is an overview.\nⅠ．Purpose of and reason for granting the Stock Acquisition Rights\nThe Stock Acquisition Rights will be issued to strengthen the motivation of Directors and employees of Company\nsubsidiaries to contribute to medium- to long-term growth in Group corporate value through actions consistent with\nthe interests of shareholders.\nⅡ．Guidelines on issuing Stock Acquisition Rights\n1.

If the number of shares to be granted through the Stock Acquisition Rights is adjusted\nas described under Paragraph 3. (1) below, the total number of shares to be granted will instead be the adjusted\nnumber of shares multiplied by the number of Stock Acquisition Rights.\n2. Amount paid in exchange for Stock Acquisition Rights\nThe paid-in amount per Stock Acquisition Right shall be the fair value of the Stock Acquisition Rights,\ncalculated by a fair method, including the Black–Scholes model, as of the date of allocation of the Stock\nAcquisition Rights.\nThis paid-in amount shall be offset against claims of a Director or employee of a Company subsidiary toward\nthat subsidiary for monetary compensation, the resulting obligations for which are underwritten by the Company.\nIn addition, the paid-in amount above is an amount based on the fair value of the Stock Acquisition Rights as\nabove, and particularly favorable conditions do not apply in the relationship with Directors and employees of\nCompany subsidiaries.\n1\n3. Details of Stock Acquisition Rights\n(1) Class and number of shares to be subject to Stock Acquisition Rights\nThe number of shares to be subject to each Stock Acquisition Right (“number of shares granted” hereinafter)\nshall be 100 shares of Company’s common stock.\nHowever, in the event of a stock split (hereinafter including the gratis allocation of common shares of the\nCompany) or reverse stock split by the Company after the allocation date of Stock Acquisition Rights (the “Date\nof Allocation”), the number of shares granted shall be adjusted using the formula given below. Note that such\nadjustment shall be made only for the number of shares to be subject to the Stock Acquisition Rights not yet\nexercised at that time; any fractional figure of less than one share resulting from such adjustment shall be rounded\ndown.\nNumber of shares granted after adjustment = Number of shares granted before adjustment × Ratio of stock split\n(or reverse stock split)\nFollowing the Date of Allocation of the Stock Acquisition Rights, if the Company needs to adjust the number\nof shares granted due to merger, corporate split, decrease in capital, or other reasons than those indicated above,\nthe number of shares granted may be adjusted appropriately.\n(2) Value of assets financed upon the exercise of the Stock Acquisition Rights and calculation method\nThe value of assets financed for the exercise of the Stock Acquisition Rights shall be the amount calculated by\nmultiplying the paid-in amount per share (the “exercise price”) by the number of shares granted.\nThe exercise price shall be the average of the closing price of the shares of the common stock of the Company\non the Tokyo Stock Exchange for all days of the month preceding the month in which the Date of Allocation of\nStock Acquisition Rights falls (excluding days on which no trading was completed) multiplied by 1.05 (rounding\nup any fraction less than one yen). If this price is less than the closing price on the Date of Allocation of the Stock\nAcquisition Rights (if no transactions were completed on that date, the closing price on the nearest preceding day\non which there is a closing price), such closing price shall be the exercise price.\nIn the event of a stock split or reverse stock split by the Company after the Date of Allocation of the Stock\nAcquisition Rights, the exercise price shall be adjusted using the formula given below; and any fractional figure\nof less than one yen resulting from such adjustment shall be rounded up.\nExercise price Exercise price 1\n＝ ×\nafter adjustment before adjustment Ratio of stock split (or reverse stock split)\nAfter the Date of Allocation of the Stock Acquisition Rights, if the Company issues new shares or disposes of\ntreasury shares of the Company’s common stock at a price less than the market price (excluding issue of new\nshares or disposal of treasury shares based on exercise of stock acquisition rights or transfer of treasury shares as\na result of a share exchange), the exercise price shall be adjusted using the following formula; any fractional figure\nof less than one yen resulting from such adjustment shall be rounded up.\nNumber of shares Amount to be\n×\nNumber of + newly issued paid in per share\nshares\nExercise\nExercise Market price per share prior to issue of new shares\noutstanding\nprice after\n＝ price before ×\nadjustment\nadjustment Number of shares outstanding + Number of shares newly issued\n2\nIn the above formula, “Number of shares outstanding” refers to the total number of shares of the Company’s\ncommon stock issued minus the number of shares of the Company’s common stock held as treasury shares. When\ndisposing of shares of the Company’s common stock held as treasury shares, replace “number of shares newly\nissued” with “number of shares of treasury shares disposed of.”\nIn addition to the adjustments above, if the Company must adjust the exercise price after the Date of Allocation\nof the Stock Acquisition Rights due to a merger with another company, corporate spin-off, or other such reasons,\nit may adjust the exercise price within the range deemed reasonable.\n(3) Period in which the Stock Acquisition Rights may be exercised\nThe period during which the Stock Acquisition Rights may be exercised (“exercise period” hereinafter) shall\nbe from November 23, 2026 through November 21, 2034 (or the preceding banking business day if November 21,\n2034 is not a banking business day).\n(4) Matters related to capital increases and capital reserves\n(i) The increase in capital on issue of shares through the exercise of the Stock Acquisition Rights shall be equal\nto one-half of the Maximum Amount of Increase in Stated Capital calculated in accordance with Article 17,\nParagraph 1 of the Regulation on Corporate Accounting.
