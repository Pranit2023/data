(“Paltalk,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”) (Nasdaq: PALT)** , a communications software innovator that powers multimedia social applications, today announced financial and operational results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Key Financial Highlights Third Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Prior Year Period**\n\n●Revenue decreased 23.4% to $2.1 million\n\n●Subscription revenue decreased 23.9% to $2.0 million\n\n●Advertising revenue decreased 7.1% to $0.1 million\n\n●Net loss was $1.5 million compared to a net loss of $0.2 million\n\n●Adjusted EBITDA1 loss was $1.4 million compared to Adjusted EBITDA1 loss of $0.1 million\n\n●Cash balance decreased $0.7 million from the second quarter of 2024 to $12.1 million\n\n**Key Financial Highlights for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Prior Year Period**\n\n●Revenue decreased 16.2% to $6.9 million\n\n●Subscription revenue decreased 17.5% to $6.6 million\n\n●Advertising revenue increased 31.4% to $0.3 million\n\n●Net loss was $2.9 million compared to a net loss of $0.8 million\n\n●Adjusted EBITDA1 loss was $2.9 million compared to Adjusted EBITDA1 loss of $0.8 million\n\n●Net cash used in operating activities increased 58.2% to $1.6 million\n\n●Deferred revenue decreased 6.0% to $2.0 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023\n\n●The Company had $12.1 million in cash and no long-term debt on its balance sheet as of September 30, 2024\n\n**Operational Highlights**\n\n●Entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Acquisition Agreement”) to acquire Newtek Technology Solutions, Inc. (“NTS”) from NewtekOne, Inc. (“Newtek”), the sole stockholder of NTS, through a two-step merger process. We will pay $4,000,000 in cash to Newtek and will issue to Newtek 4,000,000 shares of a newly created series of our preferred stock (in each case, subject to adjustment as further described in the Acquisition Agreement) (the “Acquisition”). Newtek is also entitled to receive an earn-out payment of up to $5,000,000 based on the achievement of certain cumulative average Adjusted EBITDA thresholds for the 2025 and 2026 fiscal years. As a condition to the closing of the Acquisition, we must effectuate the sale of our “Paltalk” and “Camfrog” applications and all assets and liabilities related to such applications in one or more transactions and cease the operations of our “Tinychat” application.\n\n●Entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Divestiture Agreement”) with Meteor Mobile Holdings, Inc. (“Meteor Mobile”), pursuant to which we and our subsidiaries party thereto agreed to sell our telecommunications services provider, “Vumber”, as well as our “Paltalk” and “Camfrog” applications and all assets related to such services provider and applications, other than certain excluded assets (the “Transferred Assets” and such transaction, the “Divestiture”), to Meteor Mobile in exchange for (i) a cash payment of $1,350,000 and (ii) the assumption of all of our liabilities and obligations arising out of or relating to the Transferred Assets on or after the closing of the Divestiture, other than certain excluded liabilities, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Divestiture Agreement. Following the Divestiture, we will retain all patents, patent applications, and any rights or causes of action related to such patents and patent applications (including the patent litigation against Cisco). We are also entitled to receive, for the six-month period beginning July 1, 2025 and each subsequent annual period beginning on January 1, 2026, 2027 and 2028, certain cash earnout payments based on a percentage of cash revenue, net of any refunds, received by Meteor Mobile that is attributable to the business of the Transferred Assets.\n\n**Business Objectives**\n\nAs a result of the entry into the Acquisition Agreement and the Divestiture Agreement, our near-term business objectives now include:\n\n●Consummation of the Acquisition and the Divestiture;\n\n●Integration of the business of NTS following the closing of the Acquisition;\n\n●Continuing our efforts to improve user experience with our ManyCam software and optimize features for both consumer and enterprise applications; and\n\n●Continuing to defend our intellectual property\n\n1 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please see the discussion below under the heading “Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Metrics” and the reconciliations at the end of this release for additional information concerning this and other non-GAAP financial measures.\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\nJason Katz, Chairman and CEO of Paltalk, commented, “Our team had a very busy and productive end to the summer, with the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire NTS from Newtek. We also recently announced our entry into a definitive agreement to complete the sale of Vumber and our Paltalk and Camfrog applications. We are in midst of a transformational shift in our business strategy that we believe will enhance stockholder value. Additionally, in our patent infringement litigation against Cisco, we were recently awarded a $65.7 million jury verdict. We will continue to defend our intellectual property against any post-trial proceedings, including any potential appellate proceedings by Cisco.”\n\nKatz continued, “We expect that the Acquisition, once completed, will have an immediate and meaningful impact on our revenue, since NTS’s revenue in 2023 was approximately three times greater than Paltalk’s 2023 revenue. We look forward to moving towards the closing of the Divestiture and the Acquisition. We have an ample cash balance of $12.1 million as of September 30, 2024, and we are excited to focus our attention on growing the cybersecurity, cloud hosting and technology solutions business.”\n\n**Patent Litigation Update – Awarded $65.7 Million Award in August 2024**\n\nOn July 23, 2021, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, Paltalk Holdings, Inc., filed a patent infringement lawsuit (the “Lawsuit”) against WebEx Communications, Inc., Cisco WebEx LLC, and Cisco Systems, Inc. (collectively, “Cisco”), in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas (the “Court”). We alleged that certain of Cisco’s products have infringed U.S. Patent No. 6,683,858, and that we were entitled to damages.\n\nOn August 29, 2024, the jury awarded the Company $65.7 million (the “Award”) in a jury verdict in connection with the Lawsuit. On October 8, 2024, an order granting a motion for final judgment was entered into in the Court in connection with the Lawsuit. The final judgment was entered in the Company’s favor in the amount of the Award and started the time for filing any post-trial motions or appeal.\n\nThe exact amount of the Award proceeds to be received by the Company will be determined based on a number of factors and will reflect the deduction of significant litigation-related expenses, including legal fees. Consequently, the Company estimates that it would receive no more than one third of the gross proceeds in connection with the Award, subject to post-trial proceedings (including any potential appellate proceedings by Cisco).\n\n**Financial Results for Three Months Ended September 30, 2024**\n\n●Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 23.4% to $2.1 million, compared to $2.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

The increase in loss from operations was attributed to a decrease in revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as well as an increase in professional fees of $0.8 million related to the Acquisition and the Divestiture;\n\n●Net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 731.2%, or $1.3 million, to a net loss of $1.5 million, compared to net loss of $0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023; and\n\n●Adjusted EBITDA1 loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by approximately 1046.2%, or $1.3 million, to an Adjusted EBITDA1 loss of $1.4 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA1 loss of $0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n**Financial Results for Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024**\n\n●Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 16.2% to $6.9 million, compared to $8.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was attributed to a decrease in subscription revenue of 17.5%;\n\n●Loss from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 129.9%, or $2.0 million, to a loss of $3.6 million, compared to a loss of $1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in loss from operations was attributed to a decrease in revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as well as an increase in professional fees of $1.1 million related to the Acquisition and the Divestiture;\n\n●Net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 274.3%, or $2.2 million, to a net loss of $2.9 million, compared to a net loss of $0.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023;\n\n●Adjusted EBITDA1 loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by approximately 265.1%, or $ 2.1 million, to an Adjusted EBITDA1 loss of $2.9 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA1 loss of $0.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023;\n\n●Cash and cash equivalents totaled $12.1 million at September 30, 2024, a decrease of $1.5 million compared to $13.6 million at December 31, 2023; and\n\n●The Company had no long-term debt on its balance sheet at September 30, 2024.\n\n**Key Financial and Operating Metrics from Operations:**\n\n(in thousands, except for percentages)\n\nThree Months Ended  \n---  \nSeptember 30, (unaudited) | Change  \n2024 | 2023 | $ | %  \nSubscription revenue | $2,033 | $2,673 | (640 | ) | -23.9%  \nAdvertising revenue | 88 | 95 | (7 | ) | -7.1%  \nTotal revenues | 2,121 | 2,768 | (647 | ) | -23.4%  \nLoss from operations |  (1,688  | ) |  (389  | ) | (1,299 | ) | -333.3%  \nNet Income (loss ) |  (1,509  | ) |  (182  | ) | (1,327 | ) | -731.2%  \nNet cash used in operating activities |  (780  | ) |  16 | (796 | ) | -4955.5%  \nAdjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) |  $(1,449  | ) | $(127 | ) | $(1,322 | ) | -1046.2%  \nNine Months Ended  \nSeptember 30, (unaudited) | Change  \n2024 | 2023 | $ | %  \nSubscription revenue | $6,649 | $8,064 | $(1,415 | ) | -17.5%  \nAdvertising revenue | 294 | 224 | 70 | 31.4%  \nTotal revenues | 6,943 | 8,288 | (1,345 | ) | -16.2%  \nLoss from operations | (3,624 | ) | (1,576 | ) | (2,048 | ) | -129.9%  \nNet Income (loss ) | (2,935 | ) | (784 | ) | (2,151 | ) | -274.3%  \nNet cash used in operating activities | (1,552 | ) | (981 | ) | (571 | ) | -58.2%  \nAdjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) | $(2,883 | ) | $(790 | ) | $(2,093 | ) | -265.1%  \n  \n**ABOUT PALTALK, INC.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net loss adjusted to exclude interest (income) expense, net, other (income) expense, net, income tax (benefit) expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and stock-based compensation expense.\n\nManagement uses Adjusted EBITDA internally in analyzing the Company’s financial results to assess operational performance and to determine the Company’s future capital requirements. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to Adjusted EBITDA in assessing its performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. The Company believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors and others to understand and evaluate the Company’s operating results and it allows for a more meaningful comparison between the Company’s performance and that of competitors. Our use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider this performance measure in isolation from or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are that Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect, among other things: cash capital expenditures for assets underlying depreciation and amortization expense that may need to be replaced or for new capital expenditures; interest income, net; other expense, net; income tax expense from continuing operations; our working capital requirements; the potentially dilutive impact of stock-based compensation; and the provision for income taxes.

(“Paltalk,” the “Company,” “we,” our,” or “us”) (NASDAQ: PALT),** announced today that on October 8, 2024, an order granting a motion for final judgment (the “Final Judgment”) was entered into in the District Court for the Western District of Texas (the “Court”) in connection with the Company’s patent infringement lawsuit (the “Lawsuit”) against Cisco Systems, Inc. (“Cisco”).\n\nAs previously disclosed, on July 23, 2021, Paltalk Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, filed the Lawsuit against Cisco in the Court, pursuant to which the Company alleged that certain of Cisco’s products infringed U.S. Patent No. 6,683,858, and that the Company was entitled to damages. On August 29, 2024, the jury awarded the Company $65.7 million (the “Award”) in connection with the Lawsuit.\n\nThe Final Judgment, which was signed by Judge Alan D. Albright, was entered in favor of the Company in the amount of the Award and starts the time for filing any post-trial motions or appeal.\n\nThe exact amount of the Award proceeds to be received by the Company will be determined based on a number of factors and will reflect the deduction of significant litigation-related expenses, including legal fees. Consequently, the Company estimates that it would receive no more than one third of the gross proceeds in connection with the Award, subject to post-trial proceedings (including any potential appellate proceedings by Cisco).\n\nPaltalk holds 8 issued US Patents that the Company will continue to vigorously defend.\n\n**ABOUT PALTALK, INC.
