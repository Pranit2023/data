The company has brought a forward-\nlooking perspective to an old, inefficient and legacy industry. ARC has had a thesis that thermal coal in our region cannot, nor will it be able\nto in the future, compete with natural gas and alternative energy for power generation in the United States. ARC sees the future of coal\nmining as predominantly that for metallurgical coal or specialty uses, which is used in steel production and has a significantly smaller\ndemand and production profile.\nFurthermore, the company has completed eight acquisitions (four through 363 bankruptcy sales) of highly-distressed coal mining operations\nwhereby reclamation liabilities would have otherwise fallen back to the state and or surety companies. With these acquisitions, ARC has\nfocused on the metallurgical and industrial quality of mines, while proceeding full-force towards reclamation of the thermal coal operations.\nUnlike its peers, the Company was transparent with the state to transfer the non-desired permits in reclamation only status. This created an\nextraordinarily difficult timeline to complete the reclamation, but none-the-less, the company preferred communicating it true intentions to\nthe state, versus doing what the industry typical does and kick the can down the road to future generations.\n:\nTOTAL ACQUIRED RECLAMATION BONDS\n$48.0\nMILLION\n:\nCURRENT RECLAMATION BONDS\n$29.5\nMILLION\nC R B R :\nURRENT ECLAMATION OR OND ELEASES IN PROGRESS\n$7.5\nMILLION\nPage 2\nP E – W R , F B\nRIMARY NERGIES ASTE EMOVED UTURE EGINS\nA former coal load out facility that we acquired with no additional economic purpose.\nWe have commenced and completed reclamation at the site cleaning and a removing any waste.\nWe have found a partner to repurpose the site to bring future opportunity to the area.\nThe company is current modifying the post mine land use to get immediate bond release and enable our partner to move forward with\nits development to help improve the local community.\nBefore American Resources After American Resources\nPage 3\nH S M 16 T C M – P C , KY\nIGH ULFUR INE HERMAL OAL INE IKE OUNTY\nThis was a high sulfur thermal coal mine in Pike County KY.

By some estimates it was going to take over\n$2.7 million to achieve this and would burn an estimated 86,000 gallons of pollutive diesel fuel.\nAmerican Resources, instead of letting this fall back to the taxpayers, accomplished such task all while doing it with environmentally\nfriendly equipment utilizing less than 1/6th of the diesel fuel consumption.\nBefore American Resources After American Resources\nPage 14\nK C T C M\nNOTT OUNTY HERMAL OAL INE\nThis thermal coal mine, located in Knott County, was acquired by ARC through its acquisition of ICG Knott County, LLC in 2016.

The recent activity has been highly innovative and surprising – far from things like crushing pop cans or separating your bottles. Companies in Indiana have been using advanced technology to make important, and in some cases critical, products from literal discarded or useless trash.\n\nThis has been both great for business and for the environment, lowering costs and reducing waste. We’ve gathered some highlights that you might not have known were happening right here in your state.\n\n**Rare Earth Recycling**\n\n[![](https://zeta.creativecirclecdn.com/bin/medium/20240805-163350-28d-getty-mineral-metal-possibly-for-the-rare-earth-one-300x171.jpg)](https://buildingindiana.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Getty-mineral-metal-possibly-for-the-Rare-Earth-one.jpg)Final permitting was approved earlier this year for a unique kind of recycling operation in Noblesville. It’s called a “rare earth and critical element isolation and purification facility.” In other words, it’s able to purify rare earth elements that are left behind in old materials into high-value raw minerals.\n\nThe company running this is [American Resources Corporation](https://www.americanresourcescorp.com/), which has two facilities in Noblesville. They use a technology called chromatography to recycle metals and battery metals into 99%+ pure materials that can be used in the manufacturing of new products for the infrastructure or electrification market sectors. This process is both economically viable and environmentally safer than mining or other methods, and it also keeps these materials from going to waste in landfills.\n\nThe new facility will have two production trains. One for recycling rare earth magnets to recover neodymium (Nd), praseodymium (Pr) and dysprosium (Dy), and the other for recycling battery metals like cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), lithium (Li) and manganese (Mn) from waste products like lithium-ion batteries. A total cost for the facility was not announced.\n\n“Our ability to efficiently navigate the permitting process highlights our chromatography process and facility’s environmentally safe nature, and enables us to scale our operations quickly, with more flexibility and at a lower cost than any other existing method,” said Mark Jensen, CEO of American Resources Corporation.\n\n**Recycling the Unrecyclable**\n\n![](https://zeta.creativecirclecdn.com/bin/medium/20240805-163351-43c-butler-macdonald-image-from-purdue-research-foundation-300x169.jpg) Butler MacDonald. Image from Purdue Research Foundation.\n\nThe recycling of plastic items isn’t always what most people imagine. Lots of plastic often gets rejected by recycling companies because its contaminated, poorly processed, or otherwise unusable. Enter [Butler-MacDonald](http://www.butlermacdonald.com/), an Indianapolis-based company that specializes in just the opposite. They are able to take the scraps that other companies reject and turn them into polymers for any type of manufactured plastic product.\n\nIn a way, they’re not just making an output from trash, but from the dregs of it. The kind even other recyclers don’t want.\n\nThe company recently added a new extrusion system to boost its capacity by 28%, or over 20 million pounds a year. Around the same time, the prices of virgin resin used in plastic products had risen and manufacturers around the country began to turn to recycled polymers as a cheaper alternative.\n\n“We help companies control raw material costs and meet corporate environmental initiatives,” said Scott Johnson, CEO of Butler-MacDonald.\n\nMost of the plastic scrap that Butler-MacDonald uses comes from industrial settings. Only a small portion comes from the consumer sector. In 2021, the company processed roughly 44 million pounds of recycled resin.\n\n**Old Tires into New Products**\n\n![](https://zeta.creativecirclecdn.com/bin/medium/20240805-163351-699-bolder-industries-terre-haute-facility-image-from-bolder-industries-300x249.jpg) Bolder Industries Terre Haute Facility - Image from Bolder Industries.\n\nEarly this year, Colorado-based [Bolder Industries, Inc.](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=hP0gzOlDNBXN4iRlocVUPbKsHIABBlZ5kJpnmjPKEBcc3Lh9JgzGYfehYRWat7gw57Vatx4biMicBI8w40xL-DbEFyvknlUG8zJJDabFcVs=) announced it had purchased a facility in Indiana and is planning to bring its tire recycling technology to the Hoosier state. The company takes old, end-of-life tires and is able to convert them into the chemicals needed to produce alternatives to carbon black or various oils. Carbon black is a substance used in rubber products like tires, and it is also used as a color pigment in other plastics.\n\nBy using old tires and rubber scrap, the company is able to make these products using up to 90% less water than traditional methods and emitting 90% less greenhouse gasses.\n\nBolder Industries bought the former Pyrolyx facility in Terre Haute, a 66,000-square-foot facility that ended operations in 2020. Phase 1 of the building’s reconfiguration is expected to be complete in 2023 and will represent a $40 million investment. Up to 40 new jobs will be added as a result.\n\nOnce it’s complete, the company expects the new facility will be able to divert three million tires from landfills or burning.

Individual Responsibility and Compliance\nThis Code provides guidance for specific situations that may arise. However, each director,\nofficer and employee has the responsibility to exercise good judgment so as to act in a manner\nthat will reflect favorably upon the Company and the individual.\nThe Company’s directors, officers and other employees must comply with the spirit as well as\nthe letter of this Code. Directors, officers and other employees must not attempt to achieve\nindirectly, through the use of agents or other intermediaries, what is prohibited directly by\nthis Code.\nII. Implementation\nA.

All officers and other employees, regardless of level, must\nbe provided with a copy of this Code at the time their employment commences with the\nCompany; provided, however, that individuals already employed by the Company at the time\nof the adoption of this Code must be provided with a copy of this Code shortly after its\nadoption.

Violations will result in disciplinary action, including\ndismissal of any officer or other employee where warranted.\nIII. Conflicts of Interest\nA. General\nA conflict of interest occurs when an individual’s private interest interferes in any way with\nthe interests of the Company as a whole. This situation can arise when a director, officer or\nother employee takes actions or has interests that may make it difficult to perform his or her work\nobjectively and effectively. Conflicts of interest also arise when a director, officer or other\nemployee, or a member of such person’s family or household, receives improper personal\nbenefits as a result of the director’s, officer’s or other employee’s position with the Company.\nA conflict of interest is deemed to exist whenever, as a result of the nature or responsibilities\nof his or her relationship with the Company, a director, officer or other employee is in a\nposition to further any personal financial interest or the financial interest of any member of\nsuch person’s family.\nNo director, officer or other employee, regardless of level, is permitted to engage in any\nbusiness or conduct or enter into any agreement or arrangement that would give rise to actual\nor potential conflicts of interest. Directors, officers and other employees should not permit\nthemselves to be placed in a position that might give rise to the appearance that a conflict of\ninterest has arisen.\nWhile it is not possible to describe all circumstances where a conflict of interest involving a\ndirector, officer or employee exists or may exist, the following situations may involve actual\nor potential conflicts of interest:\no An officer’s or employee’s interest in, or position with, any supplier, customer or\ncompetitor of the Company (except for an investment in publicly traded securities as\ndescribed below).\no The acceptance of gifts or favors of more than nominal value by a director, officer or\nemployee (or a member of such person’s immediate family) from an actual or\nprospective customer, supplier or competitor of the Company or any governmental\nofficial or other employee. This does not preclude the acceptance by a director, officer\nor employee of reasonable business entertainment (such as a lunch or dinner or events\ninvolving normal sales promotion, advertising or publicity).\no The disclosure or use of confidential information gained by reason of employment with\nthe Company (or, in the case of a director, election or appointment to the Board) for\nprofit or advantage by a director, officer or other employee or anyone else.\no Competition with the Company in the acquisition or disposition of rights or\nproperty, unless a specific formal agreement references rights to such activity.\nThe following situations should not be considered conflicts of interest:\no Ownership of publicly traded securities of a supplier, customer or competitor of the\nCompany that do not confer upon the holder any ability to influence or direct the\npolicies or management of the supplier, customer or competitor.\no A transaction with one of the Company’s banks, where the transaction is customary\nand conducted on standard commercially available terms (such as a home mortgage or\nbank loan).\no A transaction or relationship disclosed in accordance with this Code and determined by\noutside legal counsel not to be a prohibited conflict of interest.\nThese examples are given only to guide directors, officers and other employees in making\njudgments about conflicts of interest. If any director, officer or employee finds himself or\nherself in a situation where a conflict of interest exists or may exist, he or she should\nimmediately report the matter as provided below.\nB. Reporting Conflicts of Interest Involving Non-Officer Employees\nActual or potential conflicts of interest involving a non-officer employee, or a member of such\nperson’s immediate family, must be reported in writing by the affected person (or by others\nhaving knowledge of the existence of the actual or potential conflicts of interest) to the\nemployee’s immediate supervisor, who shall consult with the Company’s Compliance Officer\nto determine whether a conflict of interest actually exists and to recommend measures to be\ntaken to neutralize the adverse effect of the conflict of interest reported, if such measures are\navailable or appropriate under the circumstances. This procedure will be applied so as to\nminimize its effect on the personal affairs of employees consistent with the protection of the\nCompany’s interests. The matter may also be referred to the Board for its approval or\nrejection.\nC. Reporting Conflicts of Interest Involving Directors or Officers\nAn actual or potential conflict of interest involving a director or officer, or a member of such\nperson’s immediate family, must be reported by the affected person (or by others having\nknowledge of the existence of the actual or potential conflict of interest) to the Company’s\nCompliance Officer, who shall promptly disclose the possible conflict of interest to the Board\nat the earliest time practicable under the circumstances. The possible conflict of interest will\nbe made a matter of record, and the Board will determine whether the possible conflict of\ninterest indeed constitutes a conflict of interest. The Board’s approval will be required prior\nto the consummation of any proposed transaction or arrangement that is determined by the\nBoard to constitute a conflict of interest.\nAny member of the Board or any officer having a possible conflict of interest in any proposed\ntransaction or arrangement is not permitted to vote (in the case of a member of the Board) or\nuse his or her personal influence on the matter being considered by the Board. Any member of\nthe Board having a possible conflict of interest is not counted in determining the quorum\nfor consideration and vote on the particular matter. Finally, any member of the Board or any\nofficer having a possible conflict of interest must be excused from any meeting of the Board\nduring discussion (subject to the exception set forth in the paragraph below) and vote on the\nparticular matter (in the case of an interested director). The minutes of the Board meeting\nshould reflect the disclosure, the absence from the meeting of the interested director or officer,\nthe abstention from voting (in the case of an interested director) and the presence of a quorum.\nThe proposed transaction or arrangement is considered approved if it receives the affirmative\nvote of a majority of the disinterested members of the Board (even though the disinterested\nmembers are less than a quorum).\nThe foregoing requirements do not prohibit the interested director or officer from briefly\nstating his or her position on the matter or from answering pertinent questions of the\ndisinterested members of the Board, as the interested director’s knowledge may be of\nassistance to the other Board members in their consideration of the matter.\nIV. Record Keeping\nA. Company Books and Records\n1. Books and Records. The Company requires honest and accurate recording and reporting\nof information in order to make responsible business decisions. As such, the Company’s\nbooks, records and accounts must accurately and fairly reflect the Company’s transactions\nin reasonable detail and in accordance with the Company’s accounting practices and\npolicies. The following examples are given for purposes of illustration and are not intended\nto limit the generality of the foregoing in any way:\no No false or deliberately inaccurate entries (such as overbilling or advance billing) are\npermitted. Discounts, rebates, credits and allowances do not constitute overbilling when\nlawfully granted. The reasons for the grant should generally be set forth in the\nCompany’s records, including the party requesting the treatment.\no No payment shall be made with the intention or understanding that all or any part of it\nis to be used for any person other than that described by the documents supporting the\npayment.\no No undisclosed, unrecorded or “off-book” funds or assets are permitted.\no No false or misleading statements, written or oral, shall be intentionally made to any\ninternal accountant or auditor or the Company’s independent registered public\naccounting firm with respect to the Company’s financial statements or documents to\nbe filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) or other\ngovernmental authority.\n2. Internal Accounting Controls. The Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial\nofficer are responsible for implementing and maintaining a system of internal accounting\ncontrols sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that:\no Transactions are executed in accordance with management’s general or specific\nauthorization;\no Transactions are recorded as necessary to: (a) permit the preparation of financial\nstatements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles or any\nother applicable criteria and (b) maintain accountability for assets;\no Access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management’s general or specific\nauthorization; and\no The recorded accountability of assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable\nintervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences.\n3. Employee Conduct. No director, officer or other employee of the Company is permitted to\nwillfully, directly or indirectly:\no Falsify, or cause to be falsified, any book, record or account of the Company;\no Make, or cause to be made, any materially false or misleading statement or omit to\nstate, or cause another person to omit to state, any material fact necessary in order to\nmake statements made, in light of the circumstances under which the statements were\nmade, not misleading to an accountant in connection with (a) any audit or examination\nof the Company’s financial statements or (b) the preparation or filing of any document\nor report required to be filed by the Company with the SEC or other governmental\nagency; or\no Take any action to fraudulently influence, coerce, manipulate or mislead the\nCompany’s independent registered public accounting firm.\nDirectors, officers and other employees must exercise reasonable due diligence in\norder to avoid the events described above. If an employee believes that the Company’s\nbooks and records are not being maintained in accordance with these requirements, the\nemployee should follow the procedures outlined in the Company’s Policy for\nEmployee Complaint Procedures for Accounting and Compliance Matters.\nB. Foreign Payments\nThe Company and its directors, officers and other employees must comply with the United\nStates Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which makes it illegal for U.S. companies to win, retain\nor direct business by offering, paying or approving payments to foreign government workers,\npolitical parties or their officials. For additional information, please contact the Company’s\nCompliance Officer.\nV. Use of Company Property and Resources\nA. Protection and Proper Use of Company Assets\nThe use of any Company funds or assets for any unlawful or improper purpose is prohibited.\nAll employees should endeavor to protect the Company’s assets and ensure their efficient use.\nTheft, carelessness and waste have a direct impact on the Company’s profitability. Any\nsuspected incident of fraud or theft should be reported immediately for investigation.\nCompany equipment should not be used for non-business related purposes, though incidental\npersonal use may be permitted (such as occasional use of the Company’s stationery, supplies,\ncopying facilities or telephone when the cost to the Company is insignificant).\nThe obligation of employees to protect the Company’s assets includes an obligation to protect\nthe Company’s proprietary information. Proprietary information includes intellectual property\nsuch as trade secrets, patents, trademarks and copyrights, as well as business, marketing and\nservice plans, databases, records, salary information and any unpublished financial data and\nreports. Unauthorized use or distribution of this information violates Company policy and\ncould also be illegal and result in civil or criminal penalties.\nB. Questionable or Improper Payments and Gifts\n1. Payments or Gifts Made. No payments or gifts from the Company’s funds or assets shall be\nmade to or for the benefit of a representative of any domestic or foreign government (or\nsubdivision thereof), labor union or any current or prospective customer or supplier for the\npurpose of improperly obtaining a desired government action or any sale, purchase, contract or\nother commercial benefit. This prohibition applies to direct or indirect payments made through\nthird parties and employees and is also intended to prevent bribes, kickbacks or any other form\nof payoff.\n2. Payments or Gifts Received. Directors, officers and other employees of the Company shall\nnot accept payments or gifts of the kinds described in this Section V.\n3. Gifts to Government Personnel. In the United States, nothing of value (for example, gifts\nor entertainment) may be provided to government personnel unless permitted by law and\nany applicable regulation. Commercial business entertainment and transportation that is\nreasonable in nature, frequency and cost is permitted. Reasonable business\nentertainment or transportation includes, without limitation, a lunch, dinner or occasional\nathletic or cultural event; gifts of nominal value ($100 or less); entertainment at the\nCompany’s facilities or other authorized facilities; or authorized and reasonable\ntransportation in the Company’s vehicles. In addition, reasonable business entertainment\ncovers traditional promotional events sponsored by the Company.\n4. Proper Documentation. All arrangements with third parties (such as distributors or agents)\nshould be evidenced or memorialized in a written contract, order or other document that\ndescribes the goods or services that are in fact to be performed or provided and should be\nfor reasonable fees or costs.\n5. Extension of Credit by the Company. No director, officer or employee may seek or accept\nfrom the Company credit, an extension of credit or the arrangement of an extension of\ncredit in the form of a personal loan. Any personal loan existing at the time of adoption of\nthis Code shall not be materially modified, extended or renewed.\nC. Corporate Opportunities\nExcept as otherwise permitted under the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws (as\namended from time to time), without the written consent of the Board, directors, officers and\nother employees are prohibited from taking for themselves an opportunity that is (1) a potential\ntransaction or matter that may be an investment or business opportunity or be of prospective\neconomic or competitive advantage in which the Company could reasonably have an interest\nor expectancy or (2) discovered through the use of corporate property, information or position.\nIn addition, directors, officers and other employees are prohibited from using corporate\nproperty, information or position for personal gain and competing with the Company directly\nor indirectly. Directors, officers and other employees of the Company owe a primary duty to\nthe Company to advance its legitimate interests when the opportunity to do so arises.\nVI. Business and Trade Practices\nA. Compliance with Laws, Rules and Regulations\n1. Compliance with Laws. Obeying the law, both in letter and in spirit, is the foundation upon\nwhich the Company’s ethical standards are built. All directors, officers and other\nemployees must respect and obey the laws of the cities, states and countries in which the\nCompany operates. Although directors, officers and other employees are not expected to\nknow every law that is applicable to the Company, it is important that directors, officers and\nother employees know enough to ask questions and seek advice from supervisors,\nmanagers, lawyers or other appropriate personnel if they have any doubt regarding the\nlegality of an action taken, or not taken, on behalf of the Company.\n2. Insider Trading. Purchasing or selling, whether directly or indirectly, the Company’s\nsecurities while in possession of material non-public information is both unethical and\nillegal.

I agree that I will comply with the policies and procedures set forth in the Code.\nI understand and agree that, if I am an employee of the Company or one of its subsidiaries or other\naffiliates, my failure to comply in all respects with the Company’s policies, including the Code, is\na basis for termination for cause of my employment with the Company and any subsidiary or other\naffiliate to which my employment now relates or may in the future relate.\nIn addition, I agree to promptly submit a written report to the Company’s Compliance Officer\ndescribing any circumstances in which:\n1. I have reasonable basis for belief that a violation of the Code by any person has occurred;\n2. I have, or any member of my family has or may have engaged in any activity that violates the\nletter or the spirit of the Code;\n3. I have, or any member of my family has or may have an interest that violates the letter or the\nspirit of the Code; and\n4. I or any member of my family may be contemplating an activity or acquisition that could be in\nviolation of the Code.\nI am unaware of any violations or suspected violations of the Code by any employee except as\ndescribed below or on the attached sheet of paper. (If no exceptions are noted, please check the\nspace provided below.)\nNo exceptions\nTo the best of my knowledge and belief, neither I nor any member of my family has any interest\nor affiliation or has engaged in any activity that might conflict with the Company’s interest, except\nas described below or on the attached sheet of paper. (If no exceptions are noted, please check the\nspace provided below.)\nNo exception\nI am aware that this signed Certification will be filed with my personal records in the Company’s\nHuman Resources Department.\n________________________________\nSignature\n________________________________\nType or Print Name\n________________________________\nDate\nANNEX B CODE OF CONDUCT COMPLIANCE PROCEDURES\nDirectors, officers and other employees must work together to ensure prompt and consistent action\nagainst violations of the Code. However, a director, officer or other employee may encounter a\nsituation in which it is difficult to determine how to proceed while also complying with the Code.\nSince not every situation that will arise can be anticipated, it is important to have a way to\napproach a new question or problem. When considering these situations, a director, officer or other\nemployee should:\n1. Make sure to have all the facts. In order to reach the right solution, all relevant information\nmust be known.\n2. Consider what he or she specifically is being asked to do and whether it seems unethical or\nimproper. This will enable the individual to focus on the specific question and the alternatives\nhe or she has. If something seems unethical or improper, it probably is.\n3. Understand his or her individual responsibility and role. In most situations, there is shared\nresponsibility. Are other colleagues informed? It may help to get other individuals involved\nand discuss the problem.\n4. Discuss the problem with a supervisor. In many cases, supervisors will be more\nknowledgeable about the question and will appreciate being brought into the decision-making\nprocess. Employees should remember that it is the responsibility of supervisors to help solve\nproblems and ensure that the Company complies with this Code.\n5. Seek help from Company resources. In the rare case in which it may not be appropriate to\ndiscuss an issue with a supervisor or a supervisor is not available to answer a question,\nemployees should discuss it locally with the office manager or Human Resources manager. If\nthat is not appropriate or if a satisfactory resolution is not obtained, call or send concerns to\nthe Company’s Compliance Officer or follow the procedures outlined in the Company’s\nPolicy for Employee Complaint Procedures for Accounting and Compliance Matters.\n6. Report ethical violations in confidence and without fear of retaliation. If the situation so\nrequires, anonymity will be protected. The Company does not permit retaliation of any kind\nfor good faith reports of ethical violations.\n7. Always ask first, act later. When unsure of what to do in any situation, the individual should\nseek guidance and ask questions before the action in question is taken."

In (1) any suit\nbrought by a Covered Person to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by\na Covered Person to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (2) in\nany suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an\nundertaking, the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that, the\nCovered Person has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the Florida state law.\nNeither the failure of the Corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a\ncommittee of such directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a determination\nprior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the Covered Person is proper in the\ncircumstances because the Covered Person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the\nFlorida state law, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its directors who are not parties\nto such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the\nCovered Person has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the\nCovered Person has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the\nCovered Person, be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the Covered Person to enforce a right to\nindemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or brought by the Corporation to recover an\nadvancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the Covered\nPerson is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this Section 7.6 or\notherwise shall be on the Corporation.\n(E) The rights conferred on any Covered Person by this Section 7.6 shall not be\nexclusive of any other rights that such Covered Person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute,\nany provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws, any agreement or vote of stockholders or\ndisinterested directors or otherwise.\n(F) This Section 7.6 shall not limit the right of the Corporation, to the extent and in the\nmanner permitted by applicable law, to indemnify and to advance expenses to persons other than Covered\nPersons when and as authorized by appropriate corporate action.\n(G) Any Covered Person entitled to indemnification and/or advancement of expenses,\nin each case pursuant to this Section 7.6, may have certain rights to indemnification, advancement and/or\ninsurance provided by one or more persons with whom or which such Covered Person may be associated\n(including, without limitation, any of the Sponsors). The Corporation hereby acknowledges and agrees\nthat (1) the Corporation shall be the indemnitor of first resort with respect to any proceeding, expense,\nliability or matter that is the subject of this Section 7.6, (2) the Corporation shall be primarily liable for all\n18\n18\nsuch obligations and any indemnification afforded to a Covered Person in respect of a proceeding, expense,\nliability or matter that is the subject of this Section 7.6, whether created by law, organizational or\nconstituent documents, contract or otherwise, (3) any obligation of any persons with whom or which a\nCovered Person may be associated (including, without limitation, any of the Sponsors) to indemnify such\nCovered Person and/or advance expenses or liabilities to such Covered Person in respect of any proceeding\nshall be secondary to the obligations of the Corporation hereunder, (4) the Corporation shall be required to\nindemnify each Covered Person and advance expenses to each Covered Person hereunder to the fullest\nextent provided herein without regard to any rights such Covered Person may have against any other person\nwith whom or which such Covered Person may be associated (including, without limitation, any of the\nSponsors) or insurer of any such person, and (5) the Corporation irrevocably waives, relinquishes and\nreleases any other person with whom or which a Covered Person may be associated (including, without\nlimitation, any of the Sponsors) from any claim of contribution, subrogation or any other recovery of any\nkind in respect of amounts paid by the Corporation hereunder.\n(H) The Corporation shall maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any\nperson who is or was serving as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or is or was\nserving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,\npartnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the\nCorporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under\nFlorida, Kentucky, or Indiana state law, or any other jurisdiction that the Corporation does business and\ndeems it advisable to maintain insurance.\nSECTION 7.7. Facsimile and Electronic Signatures. In addition to the provisions for use of\nfacsimile or electronic signatures elsewhere specifically authorized in these Bylaws, facsimile or electronic\nsignatures of any officer or officers of the Corporation may be used whenever and as authorized by the\nBoard or a committee thereof, the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer or the President.\nSECTION 7.8. Time Periods. In applying any provision of these Bylaws that require that an act be\ndone or not done a specified number of days prior to an event or that an act be done during a period of a\nspecified number of days prior to an event, calendar days shall be used, the day of the doing of the act shall\nbe excluded, and the day of the event shall be included.\nSECTION 7.9.
