These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release, and MACOM undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n\n**Discussion Regarding the Use of Historical and Forward-Looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nIn addition to United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) reporting, MACOM provides investors with financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP, such as: non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations and operating margin, non-GAAP EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, non-GAAP income tax rate and non-GAAP interest income. In this release or elsewhere, we may alternatively refer to such non-GAAP measures as “adjusted” measures. This non-GAAP information excludes the effect, where applicable, of intangible amortization expense, share-based compensation expense, non-cash interest, net, acquisition and integration related costs, debt extinguishment costs and the tax effect of each non-GAAP adjustment.\n\nManagement believes these excluded items are not reflective of our underlying performance and uses these non-GAAP financial measures to: evaluate our ongoing operating performance and compare it against prior periods, make operating decisions, forecast future periods, evaluate potential acquisitions, compare our operating performance against peer companies and assess certain compensation programs. We believe this non-GAAP financial information provides additional insight into our ongoing performance and have therefore chosen to provide this information to investors to help them evaluate the results of our ongoing operations and enable more meaningful period-to-period comparisons. These non-GAAP measures are provided in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\nA reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial data is included in the supplemental financial data attached to this press release. We have not provided a reconciliation with respect to any forward-looking non-GAAP financial data presented because we do not have and cannot reliably estimate certain key inputs required to calculate the most comparable GAAP financial data, such as future acquisition costs, the possibility and impact of any litigation costs, changes in our GAAP effective tax rate and impairment charges. We believe these unknown inputs are likely to have a significant impact on any estimate of the comparable GAAP financial data.\n\nInvestors are cautioned against placing undue reliance on non-GAAP financial measures and are urged to review and consider carefully the adjustments made by management to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures may have limited value as analytical tools because they may exclude certain expenses that some investors consider important in evaluating our operating performance or ongoing business performance. Further, non-GAAP financial measures may have limited value for purposes of drawing comparisons between companies because different companies may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures in different ways because non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.\n\n_Additional information and management_ ’ _s assessment regarding why certain items are excluded from our non-GAAP measures are summarized below:_\n\n_Amortization Expense_ – is related to acquired intangible assets which are based upon valuation methodologies and are generally amortized over the expected life of the intangible asset at the time of acquisition, which may result in amortization amounts that vary over time. This non-cash expense is not considered by management in making operating decisions.\n\n_Share-Based Compensation Expense_ – includes share-based compensation expense for awards that are equity and liability classified on our balance sheet and the related employer tax expense at vesting. Share-based compensation expense is partially outside of our control due to factors such as stock price volatility and interest rates, which may be unrelated to our operating performance during the period in which the expense is incurred. It is an expense based upon valuation methodologies and assumptions that vary over time, and the amount of the expense can vary significantly between companies. Share-based compensation expense amounts are not considered by management in making operating decisions.\n\n_Non-cash Interest, Net_ – includes amounts associated with the amortization of certain fees associated with the establishment or amendment of our term loans and convertible notes that are being amortized over the life of the agreements. We believe these amounts are non-cash in nature, are not correlated to future business operations and do not reflect our ongoing operations.\n\n_Acquisition and Integration Related Costs_ – includes items such as professional fees, employee severance and other costs incurred in connection with acquisitions and integration specific activities which are not expected to have a continuing contribution to operations and the amortization of the fair market step-up value of acquired inventory and fixed assets. We believe the exclusion of these items is useful in providing management a basis to evaluate ongoing operating activities and strategic decision making.\n\n_Debt Extinguishment Costs_ – includes the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and professional fees associated with the paydown of our term loans. We believe these non-cash amounts are not correlated to future business operations and do no reflect our ongoing operations.\n\n_Tax Effect of Non-GAAP Adjustments_ – includes adjustments to arrive at an estimate of our non-GAAP income tax rate associated with our non-GAAP income over a period of time. We determine our non-GAAP income tax rate using applicable rates in taxing jurisdictions and assessing certain factors including our historical and forecast earnings by jurisdiction, discrete items, cash taxes paid in relation to our non-GAAP net income before income taxes and our ability to realize tax assets. We generally assess this non-GAAP income tax rate quarterly and have utilized 3% for fiscal year 2024 and for fiscal year 2023. Our historical effective income tax rate under GAAP has varied significantly from our non-GAAP income tax rate due primarily to income taxed in foreign jurisdictions at generally lower tax rates, research and development tax credits and acquisition expenses. We believe it is beneficial for management to review our non-GAAP income tax rate on a consistent basis over periods of time. Items such as those noted above may have a significant impact on our GAAP income tax expense and associated effective tax rate over time.\n\n_Adjusted EBITDA_ – is a calculation that adds depreciation expense to our adjusted income from operations. Management reviews and utilizes this measure for operational analysis purposes. We believe competitors and others in the financial industry also utilize this measure for analysis purposes.\n\n*** * ***\n\n **MACOM TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS HOLDINGS, INC.****CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS** _(unaudited and in thousands, except per share data)_  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended**| **Twelve Months Ended**  \n**September 27 ,****2024**| **June 28 ,****2024**| **September 29 ,****2023**| **September 27 ,****2024**| **September 29 ,****2023**  \nRevenue| $| 200,710| $| 190,486| $| 150,375| $| 729,578| $| 648,407  \nCost of revenue| 90,868| 89,077| 63,749| 335,805| 262,610  \nGross profit| 109,842| 101,409| 86,626| 393,773| 385,797  \nOperating expenses:  \nResearch and development| 49,592| 47,531| 37,508| 182,158| 148,545  \nSelling, general and administrative| 32,716| 34,162| 33,511| 137,949| 129,852  \nTotal operating expenses| 82,308| 81,693| 71,019| 320,107| 278,397  \nIncome from operations| 27,534| 19,716| 15,607| 73,666| 107,400  \nOther income (expense):  \nInterest income| 6,244| 5,820| 6,056| 22,986| 20,807  \nInterest expense| (1,274| )| (1,288| )| (2,213| )| (5,136| )| (12,384| )  \nOther income (expense), net| 10| —| (458| )| 10| (665| )  \nTotal other income| 4,980| 4,532| 3,385| 17,860| 7,758  \nIncome before income taxes| 32,514| 24,248| 18,992| 91,526| 115,158  \nIncome tax (benefit) expense| 3,100| 4,309| (5,458| )| 14,667| 23,581  \nNet income| $| 29,414| $| 19,939| $| 24,450| $| 76,859| $| 91,577  \nNet income per share:  \nIncome per share -
