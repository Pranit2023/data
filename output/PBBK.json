ANNOUNCES 2024 THIRD QUARTER FINANCIAL\nRESULTS\nCoatesville, Pennsylvania, October 23, 2024 — PB Bankshares, Inc. (the “Company”) (NASDAQ:\nPBBK), the holding company for Presence Bank (the “Bank”), reported unaudited net income of\n$404,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and $1,091,000 for the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 compared to $513,000 and $1,510,000, respectively, for the same\nperiods in 2023. Diluted earnings per share were $0.18 for the third quarter of 2024 and $0.47 for\nthe first nine months of 2024 compared to $0.21 and $0.60, respectively, for the same periods in\n2023.\nYear to Date 2024 Highlights:\n Total interest and dividend income grew by 20.6% to $17.6 million for the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 from $14.6 million for the nine months ended September\n30, 2023.\n Noninterest expense remained relatively flat, increasing by 2.0% to $7.5 million for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 from $7.4 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023.\n Allowance for credit losses remained strong at 1.27% of loans outstanding at\nSeptember 30, 2024 compared to 1.38% of loans outstanding at December 31, 2023.\n Annualized growth rate on gross loans was 9.2% for the nine months ended September\n30, 2024.\n Accumulated other comprehensive loss decreased by 74.9% to $313,000 at September\n30, 2024 compared to $1.3 million at December 31, 2023, accounting for 0.7% of total\nstockholders’ equity at September 30, 2024.\n The remaining weighted average life of our debt securities available-for-sale portfolio\nremained short at 1.89 years at September 30, 2024.\n Book value per common share increased by $1.16 to $18.69 at September 30, 2024\nfrom $17.53 at December 31, 2023.\n The Company repurchased 130,827 shares of its common stock during the first nine\nmonths of 2024, at an average price of $13.25 per share.\nExhibit 99.1\nIncome Statement\nNet interest income was $2.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and $8.2\nmillion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $3.0 million and $9.3 million,\nrespectively, for the same periods in 2023. The decrease for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 was primarily due to increases in\ninterest expense on deposits, partially offset by increases in interest income on loans and cash and\nfederal funds sold. The increases in both interest income and interest expense were as a result of\nthe high interest rate environment and increases in average interest earning assets and average\ninterest bearing liabilities.\nThe Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $34,000 for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and a reversal of provision for credit losses of $33,000 for the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 compared to a provision for credit losses of $140,000 and $570,000,\nrespectively, for the same periods in 2023. The decrease in provision for credit losses for both the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to lower qualitative factor\nallocations within the Company’s current expected credit losses methodology and a lower required\nallowance for unfunded commitments due to a decline in volume of unfunded commitments. There\nwas $115,000 of loan charge-offs during the third quarter of 2024, which was a partial charge-off\non a development loan originated in 2014. There were no charge-offs for the third quarter of 2023.\nThere was $115,000 and $144,000 of loan charge-offs during the first nine months of 2024 and\n2023, respectively. In addition there were $6,000 of overdraft protection charge-offs during the\nfirst nine months of 2024 and none for the same period in 2023. Delinquencies remain benign,\nreserves are deemed to be adequate as of September 30, 2024 and the allowance coverage ratio\nhas remained strong. The allowance for credit losses was $4.4 million, or 1.27%, of loans\noutstanding at September 30, 2024 as compared to $4.5 million, or 1.38%, of loans outstanding at\nDecember 31, 2023. Total non-performing loans decreased to $1.3 million at September 30, 2024\ncompared to $1.4 million at December 31, 2023. The non-performing loans to total loans ratio\ndecreased by eight basis points to 0.36% at September 30, 2024 from 0.44% as of December 31,\n2023.\nNoninterest income was $274,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and $651,000\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $185,000 and $582,000, respectively,\nfor the same periods in 2023. The primary reason for the increase in noninterest income for the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same prior year periods was\ndue to an increase in the gain on equity securities as a result of the increase in market value. The\nincrease in gain on equity securities was $41,000 and $53,000 for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023, respectively. There was an increase in\nthe loan related fee income earned for brokering interest rate swaps in the current three month\nperiod, increasing other income $25,000 as compared to the same period in 2023. There was an\nincrease in bank owned life insurance income in the current nine month period, increasing $21,000\nas compared to the same period in 2023.\nNoninterest expense was $2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and $7.5\nmillion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $2.4 million and $7.4 million,\nrespectively, for the same periods in 2023. The increase for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 was primarily due to increases in data and item processing as the Company\nExhibit 99.1\ncontinues to invest in our information technology infrastructure. The increases for data and item\nprocessing were $67,000 and $117,000 when comparing the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 to the same periods in 2023, respectively.\nBalance Sheet\nTotal assets increased $13.2 million or 3.0% to $452.9 million at September 30, 2024 from $439.7\nmillion at December 31, 2023. The increase in assets was primarily due to increases in cash and\ncash equivalents and net loans receivable, partially offset by a decrease in debt securities available-\nfor-sale. Cash and cash equivalents increased 68.1% to $54.5 million at September 30, 2024 from\n$32.4 million at December 31, 2023 as a result of strong deposit growth and maturity of securities\nduring 2024. Gross loans increased $22.6 million or 6.9% to $349.2 million at September 30, 2024\nfrom $326.6 million at December 31, 2023, primarily as a result of the increase in the commercial\nreal estate portfolio as the Bank continues its focus on commercial lending. Management is\nmonitoring the commercial real estate portfolio and concentrations, assessing their associated\nrisks. As part of its risk management process, the Bank segments and stress tests its non-owner\noccupied commercial real estate portfolio. Approximately 85.5% or $127.6 million of this portfolio\nwas subject to stress testing (loans having exposure under $500,000 are not subject to stress\ntesting). The commercial real estate portfolio has an average Loan-to-Value ratio of 62.6% and a\nDebt Service Coverage ratio of 1.64 times, exclusive of any sponsor or guarantor support at\nSeptember 30, 2024. The commercial real estate portfolio is diverse with respect to both property\ntype as well as location with limited concentrations. Two segments, Office Space and Hospitality,\nare the subject of market scrutiny with these segments’ exposure and selected credit metrics\noutlined below.\nThe Bank has reviewed its loan portfolio for exposure to office space given the uncertainty and\npotential risks associated with vacancy, future demand, and repricing risk for these assets. The\nBank’s exposure to this segment is minimal with only $9.2 million in non-owner-occupied office\nspace at September 30, 2024. Notably the five loans comprising the office segment are all\nmedical related, which the Company believes has not suffered the decline in value that the\ngeneral office market has experienced. The office space loan portfolio has an average Loan-to-\nValue ratio of 71.3% and Debt Service Coverage ratio of 1.50 times, exclusive of any sponsor or\nguarantor support at September 30, 2024.\nThe Bank’s hospitality portfolio is also an area of market focus. Loan exposure to this segment\ntotaled $25.6 million (seven hotel properties) at September 30, 2024. The average Loan-to-Value\nratio was low at 73.2% with a strong Debt Service Coverage ratio of 2.74 times, exclusive of any\nsponsor or guarantor support at September 30, 2024. Guarantor support for the hospitality sector\nis strong and loans are supported by experienced hotel operators.\nDebt securities available-for-sale decreased $31.7 million or 46.6% to $36.4 million at September\n30, 2024 from $68.1 million at December 31, 2023 as a result of short-term treasury securities\npurchased during the fourth quarter of 2023 maturing in the first quarter of 2024 with the majority\nof the proceeds remaining in cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024. The remaining\nExhibit 99.1\nweighted average life of our debt securities available-for-sale portfolio was 1.89 years at\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nWe experienced strong deposit growth of $21.8 million or 6.6% to $354.8 million at September\n30, 2024 from $333.0 million at December 31, 2023 primarily as a result of organic core deposit\ngathering strategies with the growth being from local businesses and individuals. The deposit\ngrowth was supplemented with brokered deposits to support the loan growth of 6.9%. Uninsured\nand uncollateralized deposits totaled approximately $38.1 million or 11.0% of the Bank’s total\ndeposits, as of September 30, 2024. The Company maintains highly liquid sources of available\nfunds in addition to cash and cash equivalents, including unused borrowing capacity with the\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh and the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and\navailable federal funds lines with other banks, as well as unpledged available-for-sale debt\nsecurities. At September 30, 2024, available funding from these sources totaled 534.4% of\nuninsured and uncollateralized deposits. Stockholders’ equity increased $703,000 to $47.7 million\nat September 30, 2024 from $47.0 million at December 31, 2023 primarily as a result of year to\ndate net income of $1.1 million and a decrease of $934,000 in accumulated other comprehensive\nloss, partially offset by stock repurchases of $1.7 million. The Company’s accumulated other\ncomprehensive loss resulting from the unrealized losses on debt securities available-for-sale was\n0.7% of total stockholders’ equity at September 30, 2024, which is low compared to the banking\nindustry. The Bank’s stand-alone stockholders’ equity increased $2.4 million to $41.3 million at\nSeptember 30, 2024 from $38.9 million at December 31, 2023 primarily as a result of year to date\nnet income for the Bank.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements contained herein constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning\nof Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934 and are intended to be covered by the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities\nLitigation Reform Act of 1995.

The decrease for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024\ncompared to the same periods in 2023 was primarily due to increases in interest expense on\ndeposits and borrowings, partially offset by increases in interest income on loans, securities and\ncash and federal funds sold.

The decrease in provision for credit losses for both the three and six months\nended June 30, 2024 was primarily due to lower qualitative factor allocations within the\nCompany’s current expected credit losses methodology and a lower required allowance for\nunfunded commitments due to a decline in volume of unfunded commitments. There were no loan\ncharge-offs during the first six months of 2024 and only $6,000 of overdraft protection charge-\noffs. Delinquencies remain benign, reserves are deemed to be adequate as of June 30, 2024 and\nthe allowance coverage ratio has remained strong. The allowance for credit losses was $4.5\nmillion, or 1.30%, of loans outstanding at June 30, 2024 as compared to $4.5 million, or 1.38%,\nof loans outstanding at December 31, 2023. Total non-performing loans decreased to $1.3 million\nat June 30, 2024 compared to $1.4 million at December 31, 2023. The non-performing loans to\ntotal loans ratio decreased by seven basis points to 0.37% at June 30, 2024 from 0.44% as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\nNoninterest income was $190,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and $377,000 for the\nsix months ended June 30, 2024 compared to $259,000 and $397,000, respectively, for the same\nperiods in 2023. The primary reason for the decrease in noninterest income for the three and six\nmonths ended June 30, 2024 as compared to the same prior year periods was due to a decrease in\nother income. The other income decrease was due to $14,000 and $24,000 of loan related fee\nincome for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to $58,000\nfor the same periods in 2023, earned for brokering interest rate swap agreements between the\nBank’s customers and counterparties unrelated to the Bank.\nNoninterest expense was $2,487,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and $4,985,000 for\nthe six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to $2,493,000 and $4,958,000, respectively, for the\nsame periods in 2023. The decrease for the three months ended June 30, 2024 was primarily due\nto decreases in advertising and marketing of $34,000 primarily due to timing of community\nsponsorships. The increase for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was primarily due to increases\nin data and item processing as the Company continues to invest in our information technology\ninfrastructure.\nExhibit 99.1\nBalance Sheet\nTotal assets increased $9.3 million or 2.1% to $449.0 million at June 30, 2024 from $439.7 million\nat December 31, 2023. The increase in assets was primarily due to increases in cash and cash\nequivalents and net loans receivable, partially offset by a decrease in debt securities available-for-\nsale. Cash and cash equivalents increased 68.7% to $54.7 million at June 30, 2024 from $32.4\nmillion at December 31, 2023 as a result of strong deposit growth and maturity of treasury\nsecurities during the first half of 2024. Gross loans increased $18.5 million or 5.7% to $345.1\nmillion at June 30, 2024 from $326.6 million at December 31, 2023, primarily as a result of the\nincrease in the commercial real estate portfolio as the Bank continues its focus on commercial\nlending. Management is monitoring the commercial real estate portfolio and concentrations,\nassessing their associated risks. As part of its risk management process, the Bank segments and\nstress tests its non-owner occupied commercial real estate portfolio. Approximately 84.7% or\n$121.1 million of this portfolio was subject to stress testing (loans having exposure under $500,000\nand one- to four family investor properties are not subject to stress testing). The commercial real\nestate portfolio has an average Loan-to-Value ratio of 59.8% and a Debt Service Coverage ratio of\n1.47 times, exclusive of any sponsor or guarantor support at June 30, 2024. The commercial real\nestate portfolio is diverse with respect to both property type as well as location with limited\nconcentrations. Two segments, Office Space and Hospitality, are the subject of market scrutiny\nwith these segments’ exposure and selected credit metrics outlined below.\nThe Bank has reviewed its loan portfolio for exposure to office space given the uncertainty and\npotential risks associated with vacancy, future demand, and repricing risk for these assets. The\nBank’s exposure to this segment is minimal with only $9.3 million in non-owner-occupied office\nspace at June 30, 2024. Notably the five loans comprising the office segment are all medical\nrelated, which the Company believes has not suffered the decline in value that the general office\nmarket has experienced. The office space loan portfolio has an average Loan-to-Value ratio of\n71.9% and Debt Service Coverage ratio of 1.50 times, exclusive of any sponsor or guarantor\nsupport at June 30, 2024.\nThe Bank’s hospitality portfolio is also an area of market focus. Loan exposure to this segment\ntotaled $20.5 million (six hotel properties) at June 30, 2024. The average Loan-to-Value ratio\nwas low at 51.2% with a strong Debt Service Coverage ratio of 2.04 times, exclusive of any\nsponsor or guarantor support at June 30, 2024. Guarantor support for the hospitality sector is\nstrong and loans are supported by experienced hotel operators.\nDebt securities available-for-sale decreased $32.0 million or 47.0% to $36.1 million at June 30,\n2024 as a result of short-term treasury securities purchased during the fourth quarter of 2023\nmaturing in the first half of 2024 and the proceeds of which have remained in cash and cash\nequivalents as of June 30, 2024. The remaining weighted average life of our debt securities\navailable-for-sale portfolio was 1.24 years at June 30, 2024.\nWe experienced strong deposit growth of $14.0 million or 4.2% to $347.0 million at June 30, 2024\nfrom $333.0 million at December 31, 2023 as a result of organic core deposit gathering strategies\nwith the growth being from local businesses and individuals. Uninsured and uncollateralized\ndeposits totaled approximately $37.9 million or 10.9% of the Bank’s total deposits, as of June 30,\n2024. The Company maintains highly liquid sources of available funds in addition to cash and\nExhibit 99.1\ncash equivalents, including unused borrowing capacity with the Federal Home Loan Bank of\nPittsburgh and the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and available federal funds lines with\nother banks, as well as unpledged available-for-sale debt securities. At June 30, 2024, available\nfunding from these sources totaled 578.2% of uninsured and uncollateralized deposits.\nStockholders’ equity decreased $389,000 to $46.6 million at June 30, 2024 from $47.0 million at\nDecember 31, 2023 as a result of stock buybacks of 115,827 shares for $1.5 million during the first\nsix months of 2024, partially offset by year to date net income of $687,000. The Company’s\naccumulated other comprehensive loss resulting from the unrealized losses on debt securities\navailable-for-sale was 2.3% of total stockholders’ equity at June 30, 2024, which is low compared\nto the banking industry. The Bank’s stand-alone stockholders’ equity increased $1.1 million to\n$40.0 million at June 30, 2024 from $38.9 million at December 31, 2023 primarily as a result of\nyear to date net income for the Bank.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements contained herein constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning\nof Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934 and are intended to be covered by the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities\nLitigation Reform Act of 1995.

ANNOUNCES 2024 FIRST QUARTER FINANCIAL\nRESULTS\nCoatesville, Pennsylvania, April 24, 2024 — PB Bankshares, Inc. (the “Company”) (NASDAQ:\nPBBK), the holding company for Presence Bank (the “Bank”), reported unaudited net income of\n$317,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to $409,000 for the same period\nin 2023. Diluted earnings per share were $0.13 for the first quarter of 2024 and $0.16 for the same\nperiod in 2023.\n“The increase in interest rates and desire to maintain more liquidity than historical levels have\ncertainly compressed our net interest margin. The Company had strong loan and deposit growth\nin the first quarter allowing us to maintain a strong liquidity position,” said Janak Amin,\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer of PB Bankshares, Inc.\nFirst Quarter 2024 Highlights:\n Total interest and dividend income grew by 28.5% to $5.6 million for the three months\nended March 31, 2024 from $4.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023.\n Noninterest expense remained flat, increasing by 1.3% to $2,498,000 for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2024 from $2,465,000 for the three months ended March 31,\n2023.\n Allowance for credit losses remained consistent at 1.32% of loans outstanding at March\n31, 2024 compared to 1.38% of loans outstanding at December 31, 2023.\n Annualized growth rate on gross loans was 14.5% at March 31, 2024 from December\n31, 2022.\n Accumulated other comprehensive loss was substantially the same totaling $1,250,000\nat March 31, 2024 and $1,247,000 at December 31, 2023, accounting for 2.7% of total\nstockholders’ equity at March 31, 2024.\n The remaining weighted average life of our debt securities available-for-sale portfolio\nremained short at 1.37 years at March 31, 2024.\n Tangible book value per common share excluding accumulated other comprehensive\nloss increased by $0.26 to $18.26 at March 31, 2024 from $18.00 at December 31,\n2023*.\n The Company repurchased 50,000 shares of its common stock during the first quarter\nof 2024, for an average price of $13.35 per share.\n* Refer to the appendix of Financial Highlights (Unaudited) for the Non-GAAP Financial\nMeasure Reconciliation\nExhibit 99.1\nIncome Statement\nNet interest income was $2.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to $3.0\nmillion for the same period in 2023. The decrease for the three months ended March 31, 2024\ncompared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to increases in interest expense on deposits\nand borrowings, partially offset by increases in interest income on loans, securities and cash and\nfederal funds sold. The increases in both interest income and interest expense were as a result of\nrising interest rates and increases in average interest earning assets and average interest bearing\nliabilities.\nThe Company recorded a reversal of provision for credit losses of $84,000 for the three months\nended March 31, 2024 compared to a provision for credit losses of $183,000 for the same period\nin 2023. The reversal of provision was primarily due to lower qualitative factor allocations within\nthe Company’s current expected credit losses methodology and a lower required allowance for\nunfunded commitments due to decline in volume of unfunded commitments. There were no\ncharge-offs during the first quarter of 2024. Delinquencies remain benign, reserves are deemed to\nbe adequate as of March 31, 2024 and the allowance coverage ratio has improved from a year ago.\nThe allowance for credit losses was $4.5 million, or 1.32%, of loans outstanding at March 31, 2024\nas compared to $4.1 million, or 1.30%, of loans outstanding at March 31, 2023. Total non-\nperforming assets decreased to $1.3 million at March 31, 2024 compared to $1.4 million at\nDecember 31, 2023. The non-performing assets to total assets ratio decreased by five basis points\nto 0.39% at March 31, 2024 from 0.44% as of December 31, 2023.\nNoninterest income was $187,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to\n$138,000 for the same period in 2023. The primary reason for the increase in noninterest income\nfor the three months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to the same prior year period was due to\nthe $40,000 loss on disposal of ATMs in the first quarter of 2023 as the Company invested in new\ntechnology to best serve our customers. The increase in noninterest income was partially offset for\nthe three months ended March 31, 2024 due to an increase in the unrealized losses on equity\ninvestments due to the decrease in market value of the associated asset (Community Reinvestment\nAct equity investment) representing a period over period decline of $20,000 for the three months\nended March 31, 2024.\nNoninterest expense was $2,498,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to\n$2,465,000 for the same period in 2023. The increase for the three months ended March 31, 2024\nwas primarily due to increases in advertising and marketing of $26,000 primarily due to increased\ncommunity sponsorships.\nBalance Sheet\nTotal assets increased $10.7 million or 2.4% to $450.4 million at March 31, 2024 from $439.7\nmillion at December 31, 2023. The increase in assets was primarily due to increases in cash and\ncash equivalents and net loans receivable, partially offset by a decrease in debt securities available-\nfor-sale. Cash and cash equivalents increased 105.9% to $66.8 million at March 31, 2024 from\n$32.4 million at December 31, 2023 as a result of strong deposit growth and maturity of treasury\nsecurities during the first quarter of 2024. Gross loans increased $11.8 million or 3.6% to $338.4\nmillion at March 31, 2024 from $326.6 million at December 31, 2023, primarily as a result of the\nExhibit 99.1\nincrease in the commercial real estate portfolio as the Bank continues its focus on commercial\nlending. Management is monitoring the commercial real estate portfolio and concentrations,\nassessing their associated risks. As part of its risk management process, the Bank segments and\nstress tests its non-owner occupied commercial real estate portfolio. Approximately 74% or $118.1\nmillion of this portfolio was subject to stress testing (loans having exposure under $250,000 and\none- to four family investor properties are not subject to stress testing). The commercial real estate\nportfolio has an average Loan-to-Value ratio of 60.0% and a Debt Service Coverage ratio of 1.48\ntimes, exclusive of any sponsor or guarantor support at March 31, 2024. The commercial real estate\nportfolio is diverse with respect to both property type as well as location with limited\nconcentrations. Two segments, Office Space and Hospitality, are the subject of market scrutiny\nwith these segments’ exposure and selected credit metrics outlined below.\nThe Bank has reviewed its loan portfolio for exposure to office space given the uncertainty and\npotential risks associated with vacancy, future demand, and repricing risk for these assets. The\nBank’s exposure to this segment is minimal with only $9.4 million in non-owner-occupied office\nspace at March 31, 2024. Notably the five loans comprising the office segment are all medical\nrelated, which the Company believes has not suffered the decline in value that the general office\nmarket has experienced. The office space loan portfolio has an average Loan-to-Value ratio of\n72.4% and Debt Service Coverage ratio of 1.50 times, exclusive of any sponsor or guarantor\nsupport at March 31, 2024.\nThe Bank’s hospitality portfolio is also an area of market focus. Loan exposure to this segment\ntotaled $21.4 million (seven hotel properties) at March 31, 2024. The average Loan-to-Value\nratio was low at 50.7% with a strong Debt Service Coverage ratio of 1.88 times, exclusive of any\nsponsor or guarantor support at March 31, 2024. Guarantor support for the hospitality sector is\nstrong and loans are supported by experienced hotel operators.\nDebt securities available-for-sale decreased $36.0 million or 52.8% to $32.1 million at March 31,\n2024 as a result of short-term treasury securities purchased during the fourth quarter of 2023\nmaturing in the first quarter of 2024 and remaining in cash and cash equivalents. The remaining\nweighted average life of our debt securities available-for-sale portfolio was 1.37 years at March\n31, 2024.\nWe experienced strong deposit growth of $15.4 million or 4.6% to $348.4 million at March 31,\n2024 from $333.0 million at December 31, 2023 as a result of organic core deposit gathering\nstrategies with the growth being from local businesses and individuals. The uninsured and\nuncollateralized deposits totaled approximately $39.6 million or 11.4% of the Bank’s total\ndeposits, as of March 31, 2024. The Company maintains highly liquid sources of available funds\nin addition to cash and cash equivalents, including unused borrowing capacity with the Federal\nHome Loan Bank of Pittsburgh and the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and available federal\nfunds lines with other banks, as well as unpledged available-for-sale debt securities. At March 31,\n2024, available funding from these sources totaled 593.4% of uninsured and uncollateralized\ndeposits. Stockholders’ equity decreased $220,000 to $46.8 million at March 31, 2024 from $47.0\nmillion at December 31, 2023 as a result of stock buybacks of 50,000 shares for $668,000 during\nthe first quarter of 2024, partially offset by first quarter net income of $317,000. Accumulated\nother comprehensive loss as a result of the unrealized losses on the debt securities available-for-\nsale was 2.7% of total stockholders’ equity at March 31, 2024, which is low compared to the\nExhibit 99.1\nbanking industry. The Bank’s stand-alone stockholders’ equity increased $400,000 to $39.3\nmillion at March 31, 2024 from $38.9 million at December 31, 2023 primarily as a result of first\nquarter 2024 net income at the Bank.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements contained herein constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning\nof Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934 and are intended to be covered by the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities\nLitigation Reform Act of 1995.

ANNOUNCES 2024 THIRD QUARTER FINANCIAL\nRESULTS\nCoatesville, Pennsylvania, October 23, 2024 — PB Bankshares, Inc. (the “Company”) (NASDAQ:\nPBBK), the holding company for Presence Bank (the “Bank”), reported unaudited net income of\n$404,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and $1,091,000 for the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 compared to $513,000 and $1,510,000, respectively, for the same\nperiods in 2023. Diluted earnings per share were $0.18 for the third quarter of 2024 and $0.47 for\nthe first nine months of 2024 compared to $0.21 and $0.60, respectively, for the same periods in\n2023.\nYear to Date 2024 Highlights:\n Total interest and dividend income grew by 20.6% to $17.6 million for the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 from $14.6 million for the nine months ended September\n30, 2023.\n Noninterest expense remained relatively flat, increasing by 2.0% to $7.5 million for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 from $7.4 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023.\n Allowance for credit losses remained strong at 1.27% of loans outstanding at\nSeptember 30, 2024 compared to 1.38% of loans outstanding at December 31, 2023.\n Annualized growth rate on gross loans was 9.2% for the nine months ended September\n30, 2024.\n Accumulated other comprehensive loss decreased by 74.9% to $313,000 at September\n30, 2024 compared to $1.3 million at December 31, 2023, accounting for 0.7% of total\nstockholders’ equity at September 30, 2024.\n The remaining weighted average life of our debt securities available-for-sale portfolio\nremained short at 1.89 years at September 30, 2024.\n Book value per common share increased by $1.16 to $18.69 at September 30, 2024\nfrom $17.53 at December 31, 2023.\n The Company repurchased 130,827 shares of its common stock during the first nine\nmonths of 2024, at an average price of $13.25 per share.\nExhibit 99.1\nIncome Statement\nNet interest income was $2.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and $8.2\nmillion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $3.0 million and $9.3 million,\nrespectively, for the same periods in 2023. The decrease for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 was primarily due to increases in\ninterest expense on deposits, partially offset by increases in interest income on loans and cash and\nfederal funds sold. The increases in both interest income and interest expense were as a result of\nthe high interest rate environment and increases in average interest earning assets and average\ninterest bearing liabilities.\nThe Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $34,000 for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and a reversal of provision for credit losses of $33,000 for the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 compared to a provision for credit losses of $140,000 and $570,000,\nrespectively, for the same periods in 2023. The decrease in provision for credit losses for both the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to lower qualitative factor\nallocations within the Company’s current expected credit losses methodology and a lower required\nallowance for unfunded commitments due to a decline in volume of unfunded commitments. There\nwas $115,000 of loan charge-offs during the third quarter of 2024, which was a partial charge-off\non a development loan originated in 2014. There were no charge-offs for the third quarter of 2023.\nThere was $115,000 and $144,000 of loan charge-offs during the first nine months of 2024 and\n2023, respectively. In addition there were $6,000 of overdraft protection charge-offs during the\nfirst nine months of 2024 and none for the same period in 2023. Delinquencies remain benign,\nreserves are deemed to be adequate as of September 30, 2024 and the allowance coverage ratio\nhas remained strong. The allowance for credit losses was $4.4 million, or 1.27%, of loans\noutstanding at September 30, 2024 as compared to $4.5 million, or 1.38%, of loans outstanding at\nDecember 31, 2023. Total non-performing loans decreased to $1.3 million at September 30, 2024\ncompared to $1.4 million at December 31, 2023. The non-performing loans to total loans ratio\ndecreased by eight basis points to 0.36% at September 30, 2024 from 0.44% as of December 31,\n2023.\nNoninterest income was $274,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and $651,000\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $185,000 and $582,000, respectively,\nfor the same periods in 2023. The primary reason for the increase in noninterest income for the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same prior year periods was\ndue to an increase in the gain on equity securities as a result of the increase in market value. The\nincrease in gain on equity securities was $41,000 and $53,000 for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023, respectively. There was an increase in\nthe loan related fee income earned for brokering interest rate swaps in the current three month\nperiod, increasing other income $25,000 as compared to the same period in 2023. There was an\nincrease in bank owned life insurance income in the current nine month period, increasing $21,000\nas compared to the same period in 2023.\nNoninterest expense was $2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and $7.5\nmillion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $2.4 million and $7.4 million,\nrespectively, for the same periods in 2023. The increase for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 was primarily due to increases in data and item processing as the Company\nExhibit 99.1\ncontinues to invest in our information technology infrastructure. The increases for data and item\nprocessing were $67,000 and $117,000 when comparing the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 to the same periods in 2023, respectively.\nBalance Sheet\nTotal assets increased $13.2 million or 3.0% to $452.9 million at September 30, 2024 from $439.7\nmillion at December 31, 2023. The increase in assets was primarily due to increases in cash and\ncash equivalents and net loans receivable, partially offset by a decrease in debt securities available-\nfor-sale. Cash and cash equivalents increased 68.1% to $54.5 million at September 30, 2024 from\n$32.4 million at December 31, 2023 as a result of strong deposit growth and maturity of securities\nduring 2024. Gross loans increased $22.6 million or 6.9% to $349.2 million at September 30, 2024\nfrom $326.6 million at December 31, 2023, primarily as a result of the increase in the commercial\nreal estate portfolio as the Bank continues its focus on commercial lending. Management is\nmonitoring the commercial real estate portfolio and concentrations, assessing their associated\nrisks. As part of its risk management process, the Bank segments and stress tests its non-owner\noccupied commercial real estate portfolio. Approximately 85.5% or $127.6 million of this portfolio\nwas subject to stress testing (loans having exposure under $500,000 are not subject to stress\ntesting). The commercial real estate portfolio has an average Loan-to-Value ratio of 62.6% and a\nDebt Service Coverage ratio of 1.64 times, exclusive of any sponsor or guarantor support at\nSeptember 30, 2024. The commercial real estate portfolio is diverse with respect to both property\ntype as well as location with limited concentrations. Two segments, Office Space and Hospitality,\nare the subject of market scrutiny with these segments’ exposure and selected credit metrics\noutlined below.\nThe Bank has reviewed its loan portfolio for exposure to office space given the uncertainty and\npotential risks associated with vacancy, future demand, and repricing risk for these assets. The\nBank’s exposure to this segment is minimal with only $9.2 million in non-owner-occupied office\nspace at September 30, 2024. Notably the five loans comprising the office segment are all\nmedical related, which the Company believes has not suffered the decline in value that the\ngeneral office market has experienced. The office space loan portfolio has an average Loan-to-\nValue ratio of 71.3% and Debt Service Coverage ratio of 1.50 times, exclusive of any sponsor or\nguarantor support at September 30, 2024.\nThe Bank’s hospitality portfolio is also an area of market focus. Loan exposure to this segment\ntotaled $25.6 million (seven hotel properties) at September 30, 2024. The average Loan-to-Value\nratio was low at 73.2% with a strong Debt Service Coverage ratio of 2.74 times, exclusive of any\nsponsor or guarantor support at September 30, 2024. Guarantor support for the hospitality sector\nis strong and loans are supported by experienced hotel operators.\nDebt securities available-for-sale decreased $31.7 million or 46.6% to $36.4 million at September\n30, 2024 from $68.1 million at December 31, 2023 as a result of short-term treasury securities\npurchased during the fourth quarter of 2023 maturing in the first quarter of 2024 with the majority\nof the proceeds remaining in cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024. The remaining\nExhibit 99.1\nweighted average life of our debt securities available-for-sale portfolio was 1.89 years at\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nWe experienced strong deposit growth of $21.8 million or 6.6% to $354.8 million at September\n30, 2024 from $333.0 million at December 31, 2023 primarily as a result of organic core deposit\ngathering strategies with the growth being from local businesses and individuals. The deposit\ngrowth was supplemented with brokered deposits to support the loan growth of 6.9%. Uninsured\nand uncollateralized deposits totaled approximately $38.1 million or 11.0% of the Bank’s total\ndeposits, as of September 30, 2024. The Company maintains highly liquid sources of available\nfunds in addition to cash and cash equivalents, including unused borrowing capacity with the\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh and the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and\navailable federal funds lines with other banks, as well as unpledged available-for-sale debt\nsecurities. At September 30, 2024, available funding from these sources totaled 534.4% of\nuninsured and uncollateralized deposits. Stockholders’ equity increased $703,000 to $47.7 million\nat September 30, 2024 from $47.0 million at December 31, 2023 primarily as a result of year to\ndate net income of $1.1 million and a decrease of $934,000 in accumulated other comprehensive\nloss, partially offset by stock repurchases of $1.7 million. The Company’s accumulated other\ncomprehensive loss resulting from the unrealized losses on debt securities available-for-sale was\n0.7% of total stockholders’ equity at September 30, 2024, which is low compared to the banking\nindustry. The Bank’s stand-alone stockholders’ equity increased $2.4 million to $41.3 million at\nSeptember 30, 2024 from $38.9 million at December 31, 2023 primarily as a result of year to date\nnet income for the Bank.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements contained herein constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning\nof Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934 and are intended to be covered by the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities\nLitigation Reform Act of 1995.
