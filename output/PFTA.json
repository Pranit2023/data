Customers demand precision at scale and regulators insist\non accuracy and clarity around who is holding which funds and where.\nBuilding a great ledger may not sound very exciting but it is a foundational\npart of getting a financial services business right and doing this poorly can be\ncatastrophic.\nThe concepts around booking debits and credits have not changed materially\nsince they were introduced but technology has evolved rapidly - and continues to\nevolve. It is now possible to develop more scalable and consistent ledgers than\never before. This document outlines some of the core principles to consider when\nacquiring or building a ledger and provides some examples of ledger components\nand capabilities to evaluate when making these decisions. Buying legacy\ntechnology or building with legacy approaches would leave a financial services\nfirm with a significant disadvantage when it comes to performance, efficiency and\nregulatory readiness.\nA practical and more detailed example is provided to help make some of the core\nconcepts around capabilities and performance real - third party off the shelf\ncomponents provide transparent examples of how to manage the more difficult\naspects of ledger systems design and implementation. These are intended as\npoints of reference and also can help technology teams connect the world of\nsystems architecture to reality in the form of real applications and code.\n3\nIntroduction\nI’ve spent the last two decades creating, building and integrating with financial\nservices ledgers. From designing and purchasing to building these systems for\nboth traditional banks and leading-edge fintechs, I’ve seen a lot of interesting\nthings in this space. In fact, I’ve had the chance to review the technology\narchitecture of about 400 fintech firms and a dozen banks across the globe.\nI’ve seen the good, the bad, and the ugly when it comes to ledger systems.\nThis document isn’t just another theoretical piece. It’s a distillation of real-world\nexperiences, battle-tested insights, and hard-earned lessons. My goal? To guide\nyou through the maze of creating ledger systems that are not just functional,\nbut robust, scalable, and flexible enough to handle whatever the fintech world\nthrows at them.\nYou are going to have bad days in financial services - partner systems go down,\nnetworks have outages, payments get reversed, settlement files go missing, trades\ncome in duplicated and don’t get me started on the long tail of card authorization\nflows and reversals. Payments is a messy business and your ledger should be there\nto bring order to the chaos so that when you have these bad days you can make\nthe correlations and adjustments to make things right. Your ledger is often your\nfinal layer of clarity and truth - or should be if you get it right.\nThe time to start thinking about how your ledger will scale both technically and\nfunctionally is not when it is under load, it’s during the design, planning and\ndevelopment phases. The mantra in most startups is to move fast and break things\nand while this is generally true it doesn’t really work for core financial information\nas well as regulatory hard lines. I’d suggest that moving fast, anticipating things is\na better approach in fintech.\nWhen I’m assessing a fintech solution, one of my first actions is to take a good,\nhard look at their ledger design. It’s like a window into how the team really thinks\nabout the “fin” side of fintech. So, consider this document a roadmap to designing,\nprovisioning, and implementing top-notch ledgers. Let’s dive in.\nKris Hansen\nChief Technical Officer,\nSagard\n4\nUnderstanding Ledgers\nin Financial Services\nLedgers are at the core of any financial services business.\nTraditionally in financial services a ‘core banking system’ really refers to the core\nsubledgers for deposits, loans and other financial products. The subledger is really\nthe core source of truth for the things that most financial institutions are most\nconcerned with from a financial, operational and wellbeing perspective. If you\nhave a financial services business but you don’t know where the money is, this is a\nproblem - so having a solid ledger or core is more than just a nice to have. This is\nthe essence of the business.\nThe fundamental purpose of a ledger is to track the location and movement of\nfunds. This seemingly simple task is critical to the functioning of any financial\ninstitution. Without accurate and reliable ledgers, the entire financial system\nwould be built on an unstable foundation.\nI’ve witnessed firsthand how a well-designed ledger can be the difference between\na thriving financial institution and one that struggles with basic operations. It’s not\njust about keeping the books balanced, although that’s crucial. It’s about providing\nthe bedrock of trust and accuracy that every financial transaction relies on.\nAs we delve deeper into ledger architecture, it becomes clear that this often\noverlooked aspect of finance is actually a complex and essential component that\ndemands careful consideration and robust design.\nIf your ledger is a simple table with a list of transactions - this is more of a\ntransaction log and when faced with edge case scenarios and reconciliation\nchallenges you will find out why banks over the years have built out so much\nrobustness around their subledger designs – it’s not for the happy path of\ntransactions, it’s to handle all of the many corner cases.\n“\nIt’s not just about keeping the books balanced,\nalthough that’s crucial. It’s about providing\nthe bedrock of trust and accuracy that every\n”\nfinancial transaction relies on.\n5\nUnderstanding Ledgers\nin Financial Services (cont.)\nLedger Types and Their Roles\nIt’s crucial to recognize that ledgers are not one-size-fits-all solutions. In my\nwork across various financial institutions, I’ve encountered two main types of\nledgers, each serving distinct purposes:\n1. Enterprise General Ledger (EGL): This type of ledger bears the\nadditional burden of financial and regulatory reporting. It needs to\nhandle complex requirements like Basel II / Basel III compliance,\nIFRS treatment of different asset types, and various regional\nreporting topics. For these purposes, I have typically seen (and\nrecommended) the use of off-the-shelf software with built-in\nreports and calculations.\n2. Subledgers: These focus on specific product areas or domains\nand would roll up (where relevant) to an enterprise GL. This is\ntypically the layer of focus for a fintech wanting to build its platform\nwith a solid base, and it’s where much of my work has been\nconcentrated and is the focus of this document.\nFor fintech platforms, the focus is often on building (or considering buying) more\nof a subledger. This approach allows for greater flexibility and customization in\nhandling specific product or domain requirements, while still providing the\nnecessary data to feed into an enterprise GL for broader financial reporting.\nWhen is an EGL needed vs. a subledger? Generally speaking when the complexity\nof the business demands it: this usually means multiple business lines, multiple\naccounting treatments for different geographies (say IFRS as well as US GAAP),\nconsolidating product lines. Where a subledger is the source of truth for the\nspecific balance of a specific account the EGL is the source of truth for the overall\nposition. Subledgers should be ready to ‘roll up’ into an EGL but should be careful\nnot to duplicate the capabilities of an EGL.\nIn my experience, understanding the distinction between these ledger types and\ntheir roles is crucial for designing an effective overall financial architecture. It\nhelps in making informed decisions about where to invest resources and how to\nstructure your ledger system to best serve your specific business needs.\n6\nAdvancements and Trust\nin Ledger Systems\nThe Evolution of Ledger Technology\nThe landscape of ledger technology has evolved significantly over the years.\nFrom a pure technology standpoint, it’s easier than ever to scale for\nperformance and flexibility. However, despite these advancements, I continue\nto encounter many poorly thought-out ledger designs that lack essential\naccounting concepts and durability.\nThere has been significant growth in the world of database design over the last\ntwo decades - distributed file systems, NoSQL databases, Big Data Processing\nFrameworks, real time event sourcing, in memory data processing and data\nwarehousing innovations. Yet most of these advancements have not directly\nimpacted the design of ledgers, this I believe is largely due to the challenge of\nneeding to provide a unary answer to questions around accounts and amounts. If\nyou develop a ledger with a single table providing the answers around which\naccounts have which balances and then you cluster it now you have two problems:\nlocking and keeping the data in sync across multiple potentially locked rows on\ndifferent instances.\nThis disconnect between technological capability and practical implementation is\na recurring theme I’ve observed across numerous fintech firms and banks. It’s a\nstark reminder that having access to advanced technology doesn’t automatically\ntranslate into an effective ledger system.\nOne of the hard truths I’ve learned is that ledgers can fail on edge case scenarios,\nand when they do, it can lead to severe consequences. I’ve seen instances where\na seemingly minor oversight in ledger design has resulted in major financial\ndiscrepancies and regulatory issues. These failures can be both technical and\nfunctional in nature. Having a ledger which fails under occasional peak load is bad\nbut having a ledger which is subtly off with interest calculations and posting and\nto have something like this go unnoticed for a few quarters would be in many ways\nworse.\nThe challenge, therefore, lies not just in leveraging modern technology, but in\ndoing so while maintaining the fundamental principles of accounting and ensuring\nthe system’s resilience in all scenarios. It’s a delicate balance that requires both\ntechnical expertise and a deep understanding of financial processes.\n7\nAdvancements and Trust\nin Ledger Systems (cont.)\nBuilding Trust in Ledger Systems\nTrust is paramount in financial systems, and ledgers are no exception.\nThroughout my career, I’ve identified several key factors that contribute to\nbuilding and maintaining trust in ledger systems:\n1. Comprehensive referential information: Carrying and\nmaintaining as much referential information as possible is crucial.\nThis data helps with traceability and provides context for each\ntransaction.\n2. Double-entry bookkeeping structures: The ability to balance\naccounts using double-entry bookkeeping principles is not just an\naccounting requirement—it’s a fundamental aspect of building\ntrust in your ledger system.\n3. Granular account structuring: By structuring accounts in as\nfine-grained a way as possible, it becomes feasible to show the\nmicro-flows of funds and how these aggregate into larger\ntransactions. This level of detail can be invaluable for auditing and\ntroubleshooting.\n4. Detailed fund flow steps: Maintaining detailed steps associated\nwith fund inflows and outflows can help identify small issues\nwhich, in the world of ledgers, can sum up to major problems. I’ve\nseen cases where overlooking minor discrepancies led to\nsignificant financial implications down the line.\nIn my experience, these elements work together to create a ledger system that is\nnot just accurate, but also transparent and auditable. This level of trust is essential,\nparticularly in today’s regulatory environment where scrutiny of financial systems\nis at an all-time high.\n8\nAdvancements and Trust\nin Ledger Systems (cont.)\nReconciliation Processes\nAnother critical aspect of maintaining trust in ledger systems relates to\nreconciliation processes. A robust ledger is invariably accompanied by a solid\nset of processes to reconcile accounts, especially against any internal and\nexternal counterparties.\nIn my work with various financial institutions, I’ve found that effective\nreconciliation processes typically include:\n1. Regular internal reconciliations: This involves cross-checking different\ninternal systems and accounts to ensure consistency across the organization.\n2. External counterparty reconciliations: Regular checks against external parties\n(such as banks, payment processors, or other financial institutions) are crucial to\nidentify and resolve any discrepancies quickly.\n3. Automated reconciliation tools: While manual reconciliation is sometimes\nnecessary, automated tools can significantly improve efficiency and reduce human\nerror.\n4. Clear escalation procedures: When discrepancies are found, having a clear\nprocess for investigation and resolution is crucial.\nReconciliation would be easy if the data were perfect – this is of course never the\ncase. Payments data is about as messy as data can get and reconciliation processes\nsee the worst of the worst. Card transactions are notoriously painful to reconcile\ngiven the convoluted nature of the authorization settlement process. Part of the\nsubledger’s job is to help resolve the mysteries of suspense and identify payment\nflows which don’t get resolved. Reconciliation is the key to finding defects in\nsystems and processes which can allow for the leakage of funds or the printing of\nfunds, both of which are very bad scenarios.\nThese processes ensure the ongoing accuracy and reliability of the ledger system.\nThey act as a safety net, catching errors or inconsistencies before they can\nsnowball into larger issues. In my experience, robust reconciliation processes are\noften the unsung heroes of financial operations, quietly maintaining the integrity\nof the entire system.\n9\nAdvancements and Trust\nin Ledger Systems (cont.)\nLedger Integration and Interoperability\nIntegrating ledgers is a well known pain point in the industry.\nWhen integrating ledgers there are a few core principles which can help make this\na bit more manageable:\n1. Have a clear understanding of which ledger is primary and which is shadow\nand for which objects - one must be the lead ledger for key financial information.\nMixing this up creates complexity and chaos.\n2. Understand the data structures and which will be truncated where and when\n(and how) so that key information is not lost in the integration. This is common\nwith metadata which may not seem essential for the core booking of a transaction\nbut may be critical in the understanding of the transaction context for regulatory\npurposes.\n3. Overlap identifiers: Two ledgers which are integrating should carry or have\nmapped the unique identifiers for the objects that they are sharing or interacting\nwith. This can make reconciliation easier and can help rebuild a common view of\nevents in the case of a transactional disaster such as overwritten or missing\nrecords.\n10\nKey Features and Architecture\nof Modern Ledgers\nKey Components of a Modern Ledger\nTo truly understand ledger systems, it’s crucial to recognize that a ledger is not\na monolithic entity, but rather a system comprised of several key capabilities.\nBased on my experience, here are the essential components:\n1. High-performance transaction handling: This\n“ component needs to manage the high-volume deluge of\nreal-time transactions, such as trades or card\ntransactions, without compromising speed or accuracy.\n2. Accounting treatment and internal account\nA ledger is not assignments: This ensures adherence to double-entry\nbookkeeping principles, a fundamental aspect of\na monolithic\nfinancial record-keeping that’s critical for maintaining\nentity, but the integrity of your financial data.\nrather a system 3. Flexible transaction metadata: This allows for rich\ncontextual information to be associated with each\ncomprised\ntransaction, providing deeper insights and facilitating\nof several key more detailed analysis.\ncapabilities.” 4. Immutable record storage with closed periods:\nOnce a transaction is recorded and a period is closed, it\nshould remain unchanged. This creates a reliable audit\ntrail and builds trust in the system.\nEach of these components plays a vital role in creating a comprehensive and\neffective ledger system. In my years of reviewing and designing ledger systems,\nI’ve seen how neglecting even one of these elements can lead to significant issues\ndown the line.\n11\nKey Features and Architecture\nof Modern Ledgers (cont.)\nThe Ideal Ledger Architecture\nAn ideal ledger architecture, in my experience, strikes a balance between\nperformance and flexibility.\nIt typically includes two key components:\n1. A highly transactional component focused on accounts, amounts, and\nbalances. This serves as the core engine, handling the day-to-day financial\noperations with speed and accuracy.\n2. A robust data structure for flexible metadata. This allows for rich, contextual\ninformation to be associated with transactions, providing deeper insights and\nadaptability.\nThe key to a successful ledger lies in the method of holding these two data\nstructures together in a durable and performant fashion. This dual-structure\napproach allows for both the high-speed processing of financial transactions and\nthe flexible management of associated data, creating a system that is both\npowerful and adaptable.\nIn my experience in designing and reviewing ledger systems, I’ve seen many that\nare advanced in one aspect but fall short in the other. The most effective systems\nmanage to integrate these components seamlessly, providing a solid foundation\nfor financial operations while remaining flexible enough to adapt to changing\nbusiness needs.\n12\nTechnical Considerations\nfor High-Performance Ledgers\nOn the technology side, supporting high transaction volumes safely and\nsecurely is a key requirement for modern ledgers.\nBased on my experience designing and implementing high-performance ledgers,\nhere are some critical technical considerations:\n1. Account locking and blocking mechanisms: A ledger under pressure needs to\nbe able to safely block and lock accounts in a way that does not degrade\nperformance. This is crucial for maintaining data integrity in high-volume\nenvironments. A ledger architecture can only perform as fast and as safely as its\nslowest locking mechanism.\n2. FIFO transaction sequencing: Ensuring transactions are kept in a First-In-\nFirst-Out sequence is vital for accurate record-keeping and reporting.\n3. Scalability planning: It’s crucial to remember that whatever transaction\nvolume you think you need, the actual number is probably higher and always\ngrowing as you scale. I’ve seen many systems struggle because they weren’t\ndesigned with sufficient headroom for growth. With ledgers there are often unary\ndatabases or structures (often tied to the locking mechanism) which are simply\nimpossible to parallelize.\n4. Partner system failure handling: Consider scenarios where a partner system\n(like a payment switch) goes down. When it comes back up, it will likely attempt to\nfire as many transactions as possible. Your system needs to be ready for this\nscenario to avoid being overwhelmed.\n5. Recovery mechanisms: Robust recovery processes are essential for handling\nsystem failures or data inconsistencies. This includes both technical recovery (like\ndatabase rollbacks) and business process recovery (like reconciliation and\ncorrection procedures).\nIn my years of working with ledger systems, I’ve found that these technical\nconsiderations often make the difference between a system that can handle real-\nworld pressures and one that falters under strain. Addressing these points early in\nthe design process can save significant headaches down the line.\n13\nCase Studies\nand Real-World Examples\nI’ve encountered a wide range of ledger implementations, both successful and\nproblematic. These real-world experiences offer insights into effective ledger\ndesign and common pitfalls to avoid.\nSuccessful Implementations\nOne standout example I encountered was a mid-sized fintech that built a highly\nflexible ledger system. Their key to success was a modular design that allowed for\neasy addition of new financial products. This flexibility enabled them to rapidly\nenter new markets and adapt to changing regulations without overhauling their\nentire system.\nAnother notable case was a traditional bank that successfully modernized its\nlegacy ledger. They achieved this by implementing a staged migration strategy,\ngradually moving from their monolithic system (used for transactional data) to a\nmore distributed architecture augmented with flexible transactional metadata.\nThis approach minimized disruption to ongoing operations while significantly\nimproving performance and scalability.\nProblematic Designs\nOn the flip side, I’ve also seen my fair share of ledger designs that fell short. One\nparticularly memorable case involved a startup that prioritized speed over\naccuracy in their initial design. While their system could handle high transaction\nvolumes, it lacked robust reconciliation processes. This led to significant\ndiscrepancies that were only discovered months later, resulting in a costly and\ntime-consuming cleanup operation.\nPerformance problems are hard to see until they are experienced. Performance\ntesting without realistic data (which is difficult to simulate) often only shows the\n‘happy path’ of ledger flows and having a ledger which takes many seconds or\nminutes to return a balance or commit a transaction is a critical failure for most\nfinancial systems and one that is very difficult to recover from because the solution\nis often a mix of business functional changes as well as technical remediation.\nRestructuring accounts, changing the way that transactions are being booked\nand adding more systems capacity being an example of the complex solutions\nthat may be required in a situation like this. It is far preferable to anticipate and\ndesign with margins of error vs having to course correct on the fly.\n14\nCase Studies\nand Real-World Examples (cont.)\nAnother common issue I’ve observed is the underestimation of regulatory\nrequirements. Several firms I’ve worked with initially designed their ledgers\nwithout full consideration of compliance needs, necessitating extensive and\ndisruptive retrofitting later on.\nIndustry-Specific Adaptations\nDifferent industries often require unique adaptations in their ledger architectures.\nFor instance, in the insurance sector, I’ve seen ledger systems designed to handle\ncomplex, long-term contracts with multiple payment schedules. In contrast,\nledgers in the retail banking space often prioritize high-volume, real-time\ntransaction processing.\nOne interesting example is the Formance architecture, which I’ve seen successfully\nimplemented in several fintech startups. Its event-sourcing approach provides a\nhigh degree of flexibility and traceability, which has proven particularly valuable\nin rapidly evolving regulatory environments.\nThese case studies underscore the importance of tailoring ledger architecture\nto specific business needs while adhering to fundamental principles of accuracy,\nscalability, and compliance.\nCase study: Formance ledger architecture\nAs an example of a ledger which is well designed and open source (so easy to\nanalyze compared to say, a bank’s custom ledger) let’s take a look at the\nFormance ledger. Formance has designed a ledger platform that is\nimplemented in Go and uses PostgreSQL for data storage.\nThey have developed this project well beyond a simple table with accounts and\namounts and have developed the following key capabilities:\nÌ Core Functionality: Implements a ledger system for financial operations,\nusing a command-based architecture for transactions, reversals, and\nmetadata management.\nÌ Data Model: Deals with transactions, accounts, balances, and logs,\nsupporting expanded views for additional context.\n15\nCase Studies\nand Real-World Examples (cont.)\nÌ Storage: Uses a ledgerstore package for data persistence, with querying\nsupport for various entities.\nÌ Command Pattern: Employs a Commander struct for business logic and\nconsistency, with a command compiler for interpreting operations.\nÌ Concurrency and Locking: Uses a locking mechanism to ensure data\nconsistency in concurrent operations.\nLocking is a key aspect of ledger design - but every locking strategy has a\ntheoretical and practical transaction per second limit. Ledgers are hard to\nfederate reliably so most will have a single locking FIFO queue and many will use\nthe database to handle locking by using row level locking. For this ledger design\nthey are using a custom application level locking mechanism which locks at the\naccount level and distinguishes between read and write operations. When a\ntransaction is initiated, the ledger will acquire account level locks for each account\ninvolved in the transaction and if one of the account is unavailable the lock\nrequest is queued and the application will poll to check when the lock is released\nand the release process also triggers a recheck of the queued lock intents. Overall\nthis is well thought out, the chained locking might lead to a lower transaction per\nsecond throughput but this is helped by more granular locking logic.\nÌ Event Publishing: Integrates with a message publisher for event-driven\narchitecture, using a LedgerMonitor for tracking events.\nEvents and ledgers go hand in hand - many other services want to subscribe to\nledger events.\nÌ Metadata Management: Supports CRUD operations for metadata on\nvarious entities.\nSeparating the treatment of core transactional data (accounts and amounts)\nfrom transactional metadata (can be anything) is a key aspect of modern ledger\ndesign which allows for high performance on the transactional side and flexibility\non the metadata side.\nÌ Error Handling: Implements custom error types for management and\nreporting.\nÌ Context-based Operations: Most methods use context.Context for\ncancellation and value propagation.\n16\nCase Studies\nand Real-World Examples (cont.)\nÌ Cursor-based Pagination: Uses a generic Cursor type for efficient handling\nof large datasets.\nÌ Aggregation: Supports aggregated balance queries for summarized\nfinancial views.\nÌ Schema Management: Includes functionality to check if the database\nschema is up to date and migrations using a custom migration package\nwhich executes all migrations within database transactions.\nMigrating a live running ledger is a terrifying experience, having robust tooling\nand well controlled package for this is a good approach. Although there are many\nstandard Go packages for migration management using their own here ensures\ncontrol of a critical aspect of ledger management.\nÌ Scripting: Supports running scripts for creating transactions, allowing\nflexible, complex operations.\nÌ Modularity: Well-structured with clear separation of concerns between\ndifferent packages.\nÌ Observability: Integrates telemetry logging for debugging and monitoring.\nAs you can see from the list of capabilities above, a well designed ledger is more\nthan a single table with debits and credits. Not all projects will need all of this\nfunctionality but core features like locking, metadata management, schema\nmanagement and having a well thought out data model are critical and not easily\nimplemented.\n17\nBuild vs. Buy Considerations\nWhen it comes to ledger systems, one of the most critical decisions is whether\nto build a custom solution or use an existing package, framework or open\nsource project.\nIn some cases, building a ledger might be essential for your business. This is\nparticularly true if you have unique requirements that known solutions can’t\nmeet, or if ledger functionality is a core differentiator for your product. Building\nyour own system provides maximum control and customization potential.\nHowever, it’s worth considering whether this core functionality could be offloaded\nto a team or project solely focused on ledger systems. These specialized firms\noften have deep expertise and economies of scale that can be hard to match in-\nhouse. They may also offer features and regular updates to keep pace with\nregulatory changes.\nAlso when you consider this question, keep in mind that there is a difference\nbetween a subledger (for say a cards processing system) and an enterprise general\nledger - largely intended for consolidation and regulatory reporting. I would be\nmuch more likely to advise the build of a subledger vs an enterprise GL. The\nsubledger is going to be much closer to the end product behavior and the\nenterprise GL will be much more exposed to regulatory changes.\nThe other consideration in this decision is your\nengineering culture. Buying a ledger as a subledger\nwhich needs to be deeply integrated into product\nfunctionality which is being built by an in-house team\nwill affect product velocity and will add complexity.\nNeeding to rely on external systems and potentially\nconsultants to design and implement new product\nfeatures hampers innovation and product agility. All of\nthese factors can adversely affect the product /\nengineering culture. Having a purchased ledger product\nwhich can be operated and managed by the product/\nengineering team can be the best of both worlds: not\nhaving to build it all but being able to maintain the\noptimal product / engineering velocity.\n18\nBuild vs. Buy Considerations (cont.)\n“\nDon’t invent\nanything you\nIn my experience, the decision often comes\ndon’t need to\ndown to a careful cost-benefit analysis. While\n- because you building allows for precise customization, it\nalso requires significant time, resources, and\nmay find\nongoing maintenance. Adopting an existing\nthings which\npackage or solution, on the other hand, can\noffer a faster time-to-market and reduced\nyou really\nmaintenance burden, but may require\nneed to invent\ncompromises on specific functionalities.\nand your\nMy general advice in this space is don’t invent\nanything you don’t need to - because you may\ncapacity will\nfind things which you really need to invent and\nbe needed\nyour capacity will be needed for this. And if you\nfor this.” do need to build your ledger try to lean on\npatterns and methods that are proven and only\ndeviate as needed. I have seen many teams not\nonly building their ledger but also attempting\nto reinvent aspects of financial accounting\nwhich have been practiced since the first ledger\nwas etched into a stone tablet. A nice mix of\nproven development patterns and frameworks\nand knowledge of generally accepted\naccounting principles and practices makes for a\nsolid ledger team.\n19\nEmerging Trends\nand Future Directions\nThe landscape of ledger technology is continually evolving, and staying ahead\nof these trends is crucial for building future-proof systems. Based on my\nobservations and interactions with industry leaders, here are some key\ndevelopments to watch:\nBlockchain Integration\nWhile the initial hype around blockchain has settled, I’m seeing increased interest\nin integrating blockchain technologies with traditional ledger systems. This hybrid\napproach aims to combine the transparency and immutability of blockchain with\nthe speed and regulatory compliance of conventional ledgers. This is happening in\nWeb3 companies but also in more traditional firms. Blockchain approaches are\nstrong for distribution and sharing ledger visibility (supporting trust) they are not\nstrong in high transaction throughput and latency; pairing this technology with\nsomething highly transactional can achieve results.\nAI-Assisted Reconciliation\nand Anomaly Detection\nMany of the challenges associated with reconciliation, settlement, and dealing\nwith suspense comes from imperfect data in the payments and banking industry\n(and I’m being generous here) . Reducing the manual activity required to make\nsense of this data is a great use case for AI/ML. I’ve seen AI used for merchant\ncategorization of card payments data and bank fee analysis. Recently, I’ve also\nseen AI models successfully identifying fraud and money laundering patterns and\ninconsistencies that would be challenging for human auditors to spot, especially in\nhigh-volume environments.\nReal-Time Reporting and Analytics\nThe demand for real-time financial insights is driving innovations in reporting and\nanalytics capabilities. Modern ledger systems are now expected to provide instant\nvisibility into financial positions, often through intuitive dashboards and self-\nservice analytics tools.\n20\nEmerging Trends\nand Future Directions (cont.)\nDistributed Ledger Technologies\nBeyond blockchain, other forms of distributed ledger technologies are gaining\ntraction. These systems promise to improve inter-organizational reconciliation\nand create more efficient, transparent financial ecosystems. However, their\nadoption is still in early stages, and I anticipate significant developments in this\narea over the coming years.\nRegulatory Technology (RegTech) Integration\nAs regulatory requirements continue to evolve, I’m seeing increased focus on\nintegrating regulatory technology directly into ledger systems. This trend aims to\nautomate compliance processes and reduce the risk of regulatory breaches.\nWhile these trends offer exciting possibilities, it’s important to approach them\nwith a balanced perspective. In my experience, successful adoption of new\ntechnologies in ledger systems requires careful evaluation of their practical\nbenefits and potential risks.\n21\nRegulatory Compliance\nand Ledger Design\nThere are many regulations which care about who is moving money and where\nthey are moving it to - and where the money exists. There are even some\nregulations which speak directly to the ledger and where and how ledger\nprocessing takes place. It’s important to consider the regulatory stakeholders\nand consider the first principles in the ledger design.\nHaving an audit forward design involves holding as many internal and external\nidentifier correlations on or near the ledger as possible. Ideally the ledger can\nserve as a lingua franca for all of the systems and counterparties it interacts with.\nI consider this as a key requirement for the payment metadata layer of the ledger:\nwhen receiving a payment catch the unique identifier from the sending system\nand when sending a payment to a third party capture the transaction identifier\nfrom the recipient. This seems duplicative and will often not be required but when\nit is required it means that something has gone very wrong and these identifiers\ncan help trace and unravel ledger related mysteries.\nMuch of regulatory compliance can be resolved with clarity of data and\ntransparency in reporting. A ledger which carries this data and then sourcing that\ndata into a data warehouse so that the same data can produce different (but\nsimilar) reports for different regulatory stakeholders is a pattern that I have used\nand seen used successfully by most in the financial services industry. The challenge\nhere is to make sure that the data warehouse does not become the ledger and\nprovide clear prescriptive guidance on where the ledger and warehouse data\nbegins and ends.\nThere are also many regulatory requirements which prescribe how customer\ntransactional data can be handled and how private identifying information (PII)\nshould be treated. I prefer to keep all highly sensitive PII outside of the ledger\nusing tokenization. For example, tokenize card personal access numbers (PANs)\nat the edge of the ledger and use the token in the place of the PAN. Unfortunately,\nas vigilant as your platform may be in the handling of PII you cannot control the\nupstream and downstream systems and the financial services industry is still rife\nwith systems that are not adequately handling PII. To protect against this unknown,\nconsider data landing zones which are by default encrypted and protected and\ndesign PII awareness into the loading of this data from source systems to your\nledger.\n22\nHigh Performance Reference\nArchitecture\nWhat is a High Performance Reference Architecture ?\nÌ A modern highly scalable ledger can be constructed using best of breed\ncomponents\nÌ Sort of a hybrid between build vs buy; build but build with frameworks\nÌ TigerBeetle for the high performance transactional ledgering\nÌ Formance as the rich subledger for metadata management, accounting\ntreatment and as the final resting place for financial accounting information\nÌ Temporal as the integration mechanism ensuring that there is a durable\nbond between these systems\nÌ This architecture can support 1 million transactions per second with full\nmetadata\nAs part of this point of view document, I wanted to also share a\nreal world example of how I would design a ledger today which is\nhighly scalable as well as offers the flexibility to handle different\ntypes of instruments and treatments - a highly capable ledger is\nmore attainable now than it has ever been given the focus on this\narea and the evolution of distributed systems and technologies\nwhich support transaction durability. My goal is to create a more\ndetailed and specific proof of concept as an example of what’s\npossible. This is not meant as the best or only way to design a\nledger architecture but I think it helps to provide a real world\nexample of how the different ledger requirements can be met\nwith existing projects. My general mindset is that I only want to\ninvent what needs inventing so if I can reuse existing projects,\nframeworks and components I am happy to do so.\nFor this reference architecture I am looking at three key layers: a\nhigh performance transaction layer, a durability and workflow\nlayer, and a layer for accounting treatment and transaction\nmetadata. But why can’t this be just one layer or component you\nmight ask? The reason is that specialization and focus makes all\nthe difference when it comes to scalability. For lower throughput\nworkloads which are more latency tolerant you can likely do\nsomething simpler.\n23\nHigh Performance Reference\nArchitecture (cont.)\nHigh Performance Transaction Layer\nThis layer is all about speed - it should only really care about accounts and amounts\nand being able to get a balance back to a requester as quickly as possible even\nwhile adjusting and debiting involved accounts. This is where the core locking\nlogic should exist. For the reference architecture I have included TigerBeetle\nwhich positions itself as a financial transactions database - only really focusing on\naccounts and amounts and very little else, but supporting 1,000,000 transactions\nper second (tps) which is a formidable benchmark. TigerBeetle has a business\nmodel which is open source friendly and this makes it easier to understand how it\nachieves its impressive performance results and the extent of its capabilities. As a\npart of my work I developed a utility to help generate accounts, migrate data and\ninteract with TigerBeetle called TigerBeagle. This open source tool is available to\nhelp with testing preparation and migration.\nI have tested this platform with 10 million accounts and have found it to be very\nmuch focused on exactly the topics of concern for this layer - accounts, transfers,\nlookups, balance and balance history, and high performance throughput.\nTigerBeetle also offers a few ways to link these accounts to other systems with\nuser data fields and codes and flags which can be used to help identify the account’s\nmembership in the chart of accounts.\nAccounting Layer\nThis layer is where all of the chaos of payments data is tamed and organized. Each\npayment type and each payment flow has mappings to the appropriate internal\nand counterparty accounts. For the reference architecture I selected Formance;\nthe rationale is that Formance has evolved into more of a financial core platform\nwith fund orchestration, reconciliation, and third party integration built in. Not\neverything needs to be done in a low latency high throughput way; where\nTigerBeetle is designed to be fast and efficient, Formance is designed to be robust\nand fully featured. Where TigerBeetle is good for real time transactions, Formance\nis near-real time and can handle core accounting concepts like end of day and the\nclosing of accounting periods, can emit events to the rest of your systems, offers\nobservability and workflows. Formance also offers an API, a CLI and a domain\nspecific language to help with the operational management of financial data –\nessential for any financial services organization.\n24\nHigh Performance Reference\nArchitecture (cont.)\nDurability and Workflow Layer\nIf you have one layer which can go really fast and another layer which is very\nrobust and can handle all of the accounting logic there is a challenge to keep them\naligned – an impedance mismatch of sorts which needs a layer in between to help\nlet the high performance layer sprint ahead while the robust layer catches up in\nnear real time with the required durability and resilience. For this layer I selected\nTemporal due to its ability to handle complex and challenging process flows with\na highly performant and centralized workflow logic.\nÌ High Performance\nÌ Transaction Handling\nÌ Transaction Durability\nÌ Proces Workflow\nÌ Accounting Treatment\nÌ Transaction Metadata\nÌ Immutable Storage\n25\nConclusion\nThroughout this document, we’ve explored the critical role that well-designed\nledgers play in the financial services industry. Drawing from two decades of\nhands-on experience across hundreds of fintech firms and numerous banks, I\nhave distilled key insights and best practices for creating robust, scalable, and\nflexible ledger systems.\nKey Points Recap\n1. Ledgers as Core Infrastructure: Ledgers are not just bookkeeping tools; they\nare the backbone of financial institutions, providing the essential source of truth\nfor all financial transactions. Getting this right is not optional, it’s required.\n2. Key Components: Modern ledgers should consider high-performance\ntransaction handling, proper accounting treatment, flexible metadata\nmanagement, and immutable record storage as key capabilities.\n3. Architectural Considerations: The ideal ledger architecture balances\nperformance and flexibility, often utilizing a dual-structure approach with a\ntransactional core and a flexible metadata layer. Supporting transaction durability\nand recovery is also a consideration - a reference architecture was shared which\nprovides tangible examples on how to design and implement these concepts.\n4. Build vs. Buy: The decision to build or buy a ledger system should be based on\ncareful cost-benefit analysis, considering factors like unique business\nrequirements and available resources.\n5. Trust and Reconciliation: Building trust in ledger systems requires\ncomprehensive referential information, double-entry bookkeeping, granular\naccount structuring, and robust reconciliation processes.\n6. Technical Considerations: High-performance ledgers demand careful\nattention to account locking mechanisms, transaction sequencing, scalability\nplanning, and failure handling.\n7. Regulatory Compliance: Ledger design must account for evolving regulatory\nrequirements, emphasizing data clarity, transparency in reporting, and proper\nhandling of sensitive information.\n8. Emerging Trends: The future of ledger technology is likely to involve blockchain\nintegration, AI-assisted processes, real-time analytics, and increased focus on\nregulatory technology integration.\n26\nConclusion (cont.)\nFuture Outlook\nAs we look to the future, ledger technology will continue to evolve, driven by\nincreasing demands for real-time processing, enhanced transparency, and\nadvances in compute cost performance. The reference architecture presented in\nthis document, combining high-performance transaction processing with robust\naccounting capabilities and durable workflow management, provides a glimpse\ninto the potential of next-generation ledger systems. To achieve transactions per\nsecond scalability similar to this previously required teams of specialist developers\nand specialized hardware with dedicated data centers and hardware based\nencryption. Being able to assemble off the shelf components and run this solution\non the public cloud is in itself a sign that the future has arrived.\nWe can expect to see further innovations in areas such as:\nÌ Advanced AI integration for anomaly detection and automated\nreconciliation\nÌ Enhanced distributed ledger technologies for improved inter-organizational\ntransparency\nÌ More sophisticated real-time reporting and analytics capabilities\nÌ Tighter integration of regulatory compliance features directly into ledger\narchitectures\nAs financial services continue to evolve, the importance of well-designed, high-\nperformance ledger systems will continue to scale. By understanding and\nimplementing the principles and best practices outlined in this document, financial\ninstitutions and fintech companies can build ledger systems that not only meet\ntoday’s challenges but are also prepared for the complexities of tomorrow’s\nfinancial landscape. Ledgers keep banks, customers and the industry safe by\nknowing where the money is and where it has been.\nIn conclusion, the ledger remains at the heart of financial services. As we’ve seen,\nit’s not just about tracking debits and credits – it’s about creating a robust, flexible,\nand resilient foundation upon which the entire financial ecosystem can operate\nand innovate. By continuing to focus on ledger architecture and leveraging\nemerging technologies thoughtfully, we can ensure that our financial systems\nremain reliable, efficient, and ready for whatever the future may bring.\n27\nDisclaimer\nBy accepting receipt of this document and reviewing the content set forth herein, you acknowledge having read and agreeing with the following\nterms.\nCertain statements above are based on the subjective views and analysis of Sagard/Portage and cannot be independently verified.\nThe information contained herein is in summary form for convenience of presentation.

Despite the potential for\nalternative assets to outperform public securities and offer the\ntheir\ndiversification investors need, their adoption remains concentrated with\nportfolios sophisticated ultra-high-net-worth individuals and institutional investors.\nAt the same time, alternative asset managers are actively seeking to\nacross\ncapture the untapped demand they perceive among the retail and mass\naffluent investor base, signalling a mutual interest in bridging this\nalternative\naccessibility gap.\nassets and\nRetail investors remain substantially underpenetrated across alternative\nliquidity asset classes such as private equity, private credit, venture capital, real\nestate, infrastructure, and structured products—the percentage of retail\nprofiles is\ninvestments allocated toward alternatives currently stands in the low\nsingle digits1,2. In comparison, institutional investors such as pension funds\nmore urgent\nand endowments allocated 23% and 32% of total assets, respectively, to\nthan ever.” alternatives.3 Unlike traditional assets, we believe accessing retail demand\nrequires (i) a simplification of underlying technologies paired with (ii) the\nright educational tools to help retail investors add alternatives to their\nportfolios. Depending on the retail segment (“mass affluent” versus “high\nnet worth”), the emphasis on either of these “blockers” is different.\nThe alternatives retail market is still in its infancy, and this article highlights\nhow technology can change the way alternatives are distributed to retail\ninvestors across different segments, with an emphasis on overcoming\nthese two core challenges.\n1.

While few expect individual investors\nto ever reach the same alternative allocation levels as their institutional\ncounterparts, we believe the power of retail lies in its sheer size.\nBlackstone estimates that mass affluent retail investors represent roughly\n$30 trillion worth of assets.4 Macquarie speculates that households between the\n90th and 99th percentiles of global wealth amount to a cumulative $42.6 trillion of\nuntapped assets.5 These numbers translate into potential seismic capital flows\nwith just slight increases in retail allocation. KKR has cited that if individual\ninvestor allocation towards alternatives across all wealth bands shifts from 1%\nto 5%, there could be a $9 trillion increase in the size of the addressable market.6\nWhile the needs of investors vary significantly by net worth and sophistication,\nwe believe that alternatives must be responsibly sold and positioned as part of a\nlarger, holistic wealth strategy.\n4.

Retrieved from: https://\ntechcrunch.com/2022/09/14/the-alternative-asset-class-needs-new-infrastructure-who-will-build-it/?\n5\nHow can investors access alternative\ninvestments?\nThere are two primary channels for mass affluent and high-net-worth\ninvestors to access alternative investments. Each has its strengths and\nweaknesses.\nAggregation Platforms\nHigh-net-worth individuals (and their advisors) can take advantage of\nB2B2C / B2C aggregation platforms such as iCapital, CAIS, and Moonfare,\nwhich provide access to feeder funds that invest in underlying funds provided\nby an asset manager.\nMany of these platforms enable lower investment minimums compared\nto registered investment advisors, putting investments within\ncomfortable reach for the millionaire class. They perform due diligence\nand provide access to blue-chip asset managers, so investors can be\npartly assured of product quality. Tools such as portfolio trackers and\ndocument managers make managing investments easy, and features\nlike secondary marketplaces (while still largely underdeveloped) aim to\nprovide liquidity opportunities.\nThough these platforms provide more investment choices than the\ntypical product range offered to the mass affluent sector, they still offer\nfewer options compared to traditional private investing, since investors\nare limited to funds available on-platform. And even though high-net-\nworth individuals have larger portfolios and may be able to allocate\nassets to alternatives for longer periods of time, the issue of illiquidity\nremains—capital calls and lock-up periods are still to be expected.\nInvestors also need to pay fees for both the asset managers and the\nplatforms themselves, and capital is often called entirely up-front.\nUltimately, we believe these products are suitable for sophisticated investors\nand those who already work with wealth managers. While these platforms\nleverage technology to reduce the barriers to accessing alternative investments,\nthey do not help to educate less-sophisticated investors on how to incorporate\nalternatives into their wealth strategies. Moreover, these individuals will still\nrequire separate platforms to access their non-alternative assets. In our view,\nthe need for multiple investment platforms will create friction and ultimately act\nas a barrier to adoption.\n6\nHow can investors access alternative\ninvestments? (cont.)\nB2C Liquid Alternatives\nFor the mass affluent sector, B2C liquid alternatives are mutual funds or ETF\nproducts that attempt to package private investments into liquid products\nand make them accessible to anyone who can afford the minimum investment.\nThese investment opportunities, such as the Fidelity Macro Opportunities Fund\nand the AGF Systematic Global Infrastructure ETF, provide a general level of\nportfolio diversification from public securities. There are no restrictions on who\ncan invest, the investment minimums are very low, and the assets are liquid,\ngiving investors a great deal of flexibility.\nThis is an exciting space, with new funds working to bring sophisticated\ninvestment strategies to the mass affluent market. Unlimited, which uses\nmachine learning to break down alternative asset indices to replicate their\nreturns, recently raised $8 million in a Series A funding round.8 The StepStone\nPrivate Markets Fund similarly gives individual investors broad access to the\nprivate markets, with greater liquidity and asset diversification through a single\ninvestment. Major firms such as Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan also offer a\nvariety of alternative funds to help investors diversify their portfolios.\nHowever, the composition of B2C liquid alternatives can be opaque, and investors\nhave little choice in selecting the underlying investments. The combined fund\nand asset manager fees may make such investments economically unattractive.\nAnd there is considerable risk: if too many investors exit, managers could be\nforced to sell assets at a loss, or investors may be subject to gating.\nAs we have noted, educating investors on how to incorporate alternatives into\ntheir overall wealth strategies is particularly important for accessing the mass\naffluent sector. However, we are yet to see a well-positioned business in the\necosystem today that is providing the kind of information and advice that mass\naffluent investors need via technology.\nFor us, success in this space requires the same level of simplification we have\nseen in the zero-commission brokerage space, paired with curation and\neducational tools to help investors access alternative asset classes as part of an\noverall wealth strategy.\n8.

Retrieved from: https://www.unlimitedetfs.com/\nunlimited-raises-series-a/\n7\nKeys to success\nin the alternative asset space\nWe have spoken with many leading and emerging alternative investment\nproviders and platforms targeting retail investors. Given the different needs\nof mass affluent and high-net-worth investors, we expect winners to emerge\nin both parts of the market.\nPlatforms that offer one-off fund access and investment opportunities as a\npart of a broader “crowdfunding-esque” campaign may struggle to find\nadoption, since we do not believe asset managers or founders will enter into\nexclusive distribution agreements with any one “access provider.” New\ninfrastructure tools are making it easier to onboard investors and evaluate\nopportunities, but there needs to be more differentiation in the market across\nthese solutions. Technology providers offering liquidity should position\nthemselves as able to work across platforms, aggregating supply and demand\nfor both individual positions as well as larger “baskets” of positions.\nBelow, we outline some of the specific challenges that companies focused on\nthe mass affluent and high-net-worth sectors will face.\nMass Affluent Focused Players\nWe believe the greatest pain point in onboarding mass affluent investors is\nthat many don’t know how to think of alternatives as a part of their portfolios\nin the same way they understand more traditional asset classes — in terms of\nboth the liquidity profile of the asset class (“What do you mean I can’t sell\nwhenever I want?”) and how alternatives can represent a powerful\ndiversification tool with upside in the form of potentially higher returns.\nAs such, companies targeting mass affluent investors might face challenges in\nattracting customers without appropriate liquidity mechanisms in place. With\nthat context, we believe winners will provide a diversified alternatives strategy\n(not single fund or single asset class) as part of a more comprehensive wealth\nstrategy with an emphasis on education. In many ways, this will mirror the value\nproposition of robo-advisors, providing the mass market with passive, “plug-and-\nplay” solutions to help investors optimize their diversification and returns.\n8\nKeys to success\nin the alternative asset space (cont.)\nIn our view, the mass affluent market will be best served by at-scale B2C\nbusinesses with established brand trust, who can educate and cross-sell\nalternative products to existing customers as a one-stop solution. Several\nincumbent consumer fintech platforms such as Betterment and Portage portfolio\ncompany Wealthsimple already offer alternative investment products, and have\nseen their customers’ existing trust extend directly to new alternative product\nofferings.\nWealthsimple, in particular, has made multiple notable forays\ninto the alternative space. In 2022, it launched its Venture\nFund I in partnership with Accolade Partners.9 In March 2023,\nit launched a private credit fund with Sagard, which has a\n$10,000 investment minimum, in contrast with the $5,000\nminimum recommended for the venture fund.10 And in\nNovember 2023 it introduced a private equity fund with the\nLGT Group.11\nSince launching last year, Wealthsimple’s private credit fund\nhas amassed more than $200 million12 in assets under\nmanagement (as of November 2023). This exceeded their\ninitial expectations and highlights the strong demand for\naccess to alternatives, particularly when an existing platform\ndesigned for the mass affluent sector creates a specifically\ncurated investment opportunity. We predict that companies\nthat can be a one-stop shop for investment needs for the mass\naffluent will also generate stickiness, as users may prefer to\nmanage their entire portfolio on one convenient platform.\nIn general, we believe the strongest platforms can deliver both individual\nopportunities as well as suitable basket funds for investors to choose from. We\nnote, however, that no platforms offer an attractive, comprehensive alternatives\nsolution for the mass affluent market today.\n9. Wealthsimple (2022, April 6).

For\nthis segment, liquidity, education, and one-stop investment tools become\nless important product features. Instead, these investors will seek exposure\nto more aggressive alternative strategies provided by best-in-class asset\nmanagers.\nProducts for high-net-worth investors are best\ndistributed through traditional wealth platforms like\nRIAs, in partnership with platform entrants like iCapital,\nCAIS, and Moonfare, that provide a more diversified\nproduct shelf paired with the required infrastructure for\na modern, integrated experience.\nIn our view, the space displays winner-takes-most\ndynamics, and teams that are highly skilled at acquiring\nand onboarding complementary assets will be able to\nimprove their technology stacks and network effects\nfurther. This can be seen with iCapital’s 12 acquisitions\nto date, which include the additions of Artivest and its\noffering of alternative products and strategies, as well as\nSIMON, a distribution platform focused on structured\ninvestments.13\nWe still see tremendous emerging opportunities in this\nspace across key enabling technologies around portfolio\nand risk management, with leading players such as\nEdgEvooq and Canoe Intelligence.\n13.

In the coming years, we expect to see many\nnew companies and platforms provide access to alternatives.\nStrong technology-driven solutions are likely to stand out in the\nmarketplace, and the most attractive offerings will likely combine\naccess with information and education. Mass affluent investors in\nparticular will benefit from education around alternative\ninvestments. But no matter where they fall on the wealth ladder,\nfew investors are well-positioned to invest in alternatives\nresponsibly without some level of advice and curation.\n11"

Much of this growth has been fueled by venture capital investments, which grew\nfrom $17 billion in 2015 to over $120 billion in 20235.\nRecently, the end of low interest rates and resulting abundance of capital that characterized the\nbeginning of the decade have led to a market correction. Private fintech fundraising dropped to\n$62 billion in 2023 from $164 billion in 2021 and valuations have come down from lofty levels\nseen in 2020/20216,7. The market correction has created an opportunity for fintech investors with\ncontinued access to capital: the decline in funding and deal volume has driven valuations down,\nand capital constraints have reduced competition, but this has not coincided with a decline in new\nfintech creation. The number of fintechs created in 2023 in North America and EMEA was over\n2.5k, far surpassing the ~1.3k created in 20228.\nThe summer of 2020 into 2021 saw pent-up investor demand, low cost of capital, and accelerated\ntechnology adoption due to the pandemic, which led to a significant number of IPOs in the United\nStates (1,035 in 2021 vs. 232 in 2019)9. The market was characterized by high valuations and\ngeneralist investors, many of whom overlooked profitability in a rush to invest in fast growing tech\ncompanies10. Fintech companies that IPO’d in 2020 and 2021, at the peak of the market, are on\naverage trading 60%+ below their IPO prices11. While some have interpreted the underperformance\nof the fintech companies that came to market in 2020-2021 as a reason to steer away from fintech,\nin reality this trend underscores the importance of sector specific investors. While generalist\ninvestors may allocate to the space, we believe verticalized knowledge is paramount to returns.\nVerticals within fintech are diverse and require specific expertise to navigate successfully.\nExperienced fintech investors understand the regulatory environment, local market dynamics,\nand nuances of business operations within each vertical.\n5.

Fintechs born in the\nlow cost of capital environment of recent decades have had to adapt,\nwith cost containment and reduction becoming key priorities while\npursuing capital efficient growth. While challenging, times of\neconomic downturn have historically produced more resilient and\nsuccessful startups. We believe that the simultaneous creation of\ncompanies with strong, sustainable fundamentals and lower\nvaluations make today an opportune time for fintech investors.\nMoreover, we see an opportunity to leverage verticalized expertise\nand value creation resources to differentiate our portfolio companies\nas they navigate current economic conditions.\nUS$1,150B\nEstimated Fintech\nIndustry Valuation\nin 2032\n12.

Meanwhile, a cohort of cloud native disruptors emerged focused on\ngoing direct to the consumer with a new offering and a consumer experience equivalent to those\noutside of financial services. Today, the dynamic has become more balanced than prior years.\nMost incumbents are now cloud native and in a much better position to modernize their technology\nstack and remain competitive with their peers and disruptors alike. Large financial institutions are\nmaking significant investment in technology, either through digital transformation initiatives or\nM&A. JP Morgan alone is investing $12 billion a year to fuel a team of 50,000 technologists, citing\nthe importance of continued innovation to keep up with consumer preferences13. We expect the\ncloud to continue to be a core focus area, which will allow incumbents to take advantage of new\nemerging technology like AI whereby they can harness their incumbent data advantage.\nThe return of the incumbent is not lost on investors, as illustrated by the notable increase in the\namount invested in B2B fintechs compared to B2C in recent years14. While this trend has shifted\nindustry dynamics, fintech investors occupy a unique position in the market where it is possible to\nbenefit from both disruptor and incumbent success. As incumbents deploy capital to transition off\nlegacy systems and innovate, they become potential partners or potential acquirers of start-ups.\nMore than being agnostic to who wins between disruptors and incumbents, we believe fintech\ninvestors can create significant synergy potential in connecting portfolio companies to a network\nof financial institutions in their broader ecosystem.\nFintech is unique in this regard, as portfolio companies and investors in the fund operate as a part\nof the same broader financial services sector.\n13.

Portage analysis of Pitchbook data. www.pitchbook.com\n7\nWhy Invest in Fintech Today (cont.)\nRepeatable Models in Regional Markets\nDeep sector expertise provides an advantage in the context of geographically diverse\nmandates.\nEmerging markets present enormous potential for fintech. A large portion of the global population\nremains unbanked and without access to basic financial services, leaving room for innovative\nsolutions from fintech companies to bridge the gap15. Emerging markets are expected to contribute\na large share of growth in the fintech industry in coming years16. Africa, Asia–Pacific (excluding\nChina), Latin America, and the Middle East contributed 15% of global fintech revenues in 2022\nand are estimated to reach 29% by 202817. As fintech expands in new markets, we are seeing the\nemergence of similar business models across geographies. Investors with global mandates have\nthe ability to leverage learnings from one market to investment opportunities in another. There\nare numerous avenues to benefit from this trend: winners in one geography can be used to assess\ninvestment opportunities in another, knowledge can be shared across portfolio companies with\nsimilar models, and there is potential for consolidation in the long-term. To benefit from this trend,\nhowever, understanding of idiosyncrasies across markets and verticals is highly important.\n15. International Finance Corporation (2022, January).

Our definition of AUM is not based on any definition contained in our fund management agreements.\nFurthermore, our calculation may differ from the manner in which the SEC defines “Regulatory Assets Under Management* on Form ADV and\nfrom the AUM definition used by other asset managers.\nThe Enterprise Value for Portfolio Companies calculation of Enterprise Value (EV) revenue includes revenue generated from all strategic\npartnerships facilitated by Portage with portfolio companies of Portage Ventures I, Portage Ventures II, and Portage Ventures III, including\nDiagram as of December 31, 2023; EV assumes a 8x annualized recurring revenue (ARR) multiple and is denominated in Canadian dollars.\nFund I performance data includes Springboard I and Springboard II.\n# of Investments (Companies) excludes founder’s shares in Diagram companies. # of Investments (Funds) includes Diagram.\nNet Fund IRR represents the annualized IRR on the total Limited Partners’ capital contributions, distributions, and the Fund’s net asset value\nafter management fees, fund expenses, and carried interest as of December 31, 2023. Net Fund ITD IRR incorporates the performance results of\ncertain investors who pay no or reduced management fees and/or no or reduced carried interest, and accordingly some investors may earn lower\nreturns than those set out herein.\nPerformance Reporting Disclosure\nPast Performance Disclosure\nPast performance should not be relied upon as an indication of future results. It should not be assumed that recommendations made in the future\nwill be profitable or will equal the performance of the investments herein. Investment in a fund involves significant risks, including loss of the\nentire investment.\nGross performance information does not reflect management fees or performance fees (i.e., carried interest) charged by Sagard or its affiliates, or\nany other fund-level expenses borne indirectly by investors in a fund, which will reduce returns and in the aggregate are expected to be substantial.\nNet performance is aggregated for all fee-paying investors and deducts management fees or performance fees (i.e., carried interest) charged by\nSagard or its affiliates, or any other fund-level expenses. Net performance is based on contributions, distributions and ending unrealized value.\nThe returns presented herein include all returns generated by reinvested capital and profit. Without such reinvested capital, the returns presented\nherein could be materially lower.\nPortage Ventures Fund II and III borrow under a credit facility (sometimes referred to as a “subscription line”) to make investments and pay\nexpenses and for other purposes to the extent permitted by the fund’s partnership agreement. Fund-level borrowing to fund investments does\nnot impact the portfolio total metrics presented, because those metrics measure a fund’s cash outlays to and returns from its investments\nregardless of whether the cash outlays came from investor capital contributions or borrowings under the fund’s credit facility. By contrast, fund-\nlevel borrowing to fund investments does impact the investor’s gross and net metrics presented, because -those metrics reflect investors’ cash\noutlays to, and returns from, the fund and as such, returns depend on the amount and timing of investor capital contributions. To the extent a fund\nuses borrowed funds in advance of, or in lieu of calling capital, investors make correspondingly later or smaller capital contributions. Accordingly,\nfund-level borrowing results in higher investor gross and net metrics than if capital had been called, even after taking into account the associated\ninterest expense of the borrowing.\nThe values of unrealized investments are estimated as of December 31, 2023 are inherently uncertain and subject to change. There is no guarantee\nthat such value will be ultimately realized by an investment or that such value reflects the actual value of the investment. Actual realized proceeds\non unrealized investments will depend on, among other factors, future operating costs, the value of the assets and market conditions at the\ntime of disposition, any related transaction costs and the timing and manner of sale, all of which may differ from the assumptions on which the\nvaluations reflected in the historical performance data contained herein are based.

These are our\nfocus areas for investment in 2024.\nFintech is not a homogeneous sector. With some exceptions, like AI or core\ninfrastructure, the trends that shape opportunities in specific verticals can differ\nsignificantly. Wealthtech is not like Insurtech; Consumer Finance differs from\nSMB Finance.\nBecause of that reality, identifying opportunities for outsized returns requires\ndeep knowledge of each vertical. At Portage, fintech is all we think about and all\nwe invest in.\nWhat follows is an overview of the trends and “investable themes” the Portage\nteam is actively exploring this year. Our hope is that telling you where we’re\nlooking for our next portfolio company will, in turn, help you think about your own\nplans and strategies for 2024 and beyond.\nAs always, for those who want to take a deeper dive into any of the verticals below\nto help inform their internal plans and strategies, we love talking about fintech\nand are here to help our partners understand the implications and opportunities\nof how the space is evolving.\nÎ GenAI Summary\nÎ Consumer Finance Summary\nÎ SMB Finance Summary\nÎ Insurtech Summary\nÎ Wealth and Asset Management tech Summary\nÎ Payments Summary\nÎ Regtech Summary\nStrictly Private & Confidential.\nBy accepting receipt of this document and reviewing the content herein,\nyou acknowledge and agree to the terms set forth on the last page of this document.\n2\nGenAI\nGenAI was the biggest tech story of 2023 not only in the\npublic markets, but also in venture capital.\nAI deals attracted more than US$40 billion in venture funding\nlast year1, and we expect the trend to continue through 2024. So\nfar, the big tech incumbents, which largely own the foundational\nmodels and cloud infrastructure supporting GenAI, appear to\nhave a data and distribution advantage in the space, but it is\nobviously early days.\nUse cases in fintech and financial services are still largely in the\nexperimental phase. Yet, we take the view, that every company is now\nan AI company, and GenAI will increasingly be embedded in everything\nthat Portage invests in.\nUS$40Bn\nWe are particularly focused on solutions that have the potential to:\nÌ Drive disruptive business models.\nAI deals\nin venture funding Ì Support incumbents in implementing AI in a compliant manner.\nin 2023\nÌ Synthesize or copilot human advisors.\nÌ Accelerate the transition from legacy to new tech.\nSeveral of these areas of focus are touched upon in the following\ndiscussion of fintech verticals.\n1. State of AI 2023 Report. CB Insights. February 1, 2024. www.cbinsights.com/research/report/ai-trends-2023\n3\nConsumer Finance\nConsumer finance has seen a sharp pullback from the heyday of\n2020-2021, accounting for only four of the Top ten deals last year\n(compared with eight of the Top ten in 2021).2\nMultiples in 2023 improved only slightly on already low 2022 levels.\nThe pullback reflected a more general decline in consumer tech\ninvesting (it comprised only 7% of overall seed capital raised in 2023),3\nas well as the predominance of balance-sheet-intensive companies\n(especially insurance and banking/lending) in the space.\nWe are cautiously contrarian on consumer fintech in 2024, however.\nOn a macro level, despite high household debt, consumer sentiment is\nstrong across the U.S., Canada and Europe, inflation appears to have\npeaked, and unemployment is low. As well, two significant private-\nmarket deals (Monzo, Bilt) may signal a recovery in the space, and early\ndata, albeit a small sample size, suggest a slight rebound in consumer\nmultiples this year.\nThese factors support a case for highly selective investor interest, with\na focus on companies that offer the potential for high growth metrics\n(>50% YOY), market leadership, robust margins and revenue\ndiversification, as well as differentiated distribution models.\n“\nConsumer finance accounted for only\n”\nfour of the Top ten deals last year\n(compared with eight of the Top ten in 2021)\n2.

December 19, 2023. carta.com/blog/vc-shifts-2023\n4\nConsumer Finance (cont.)\nAmong our investable themes in consumer finance, the shutdown of Mint in\nMarch of this year may create market opportunities in the personal financial\nmanagement (PFM) space for companies like Albert, a Portage portco. Multi-\nproduct companies continue to evolve, although in general the trend towards\nconsolidation of fintech solutions into unified bundles has progressed more slowly\nthan many expected. But GenAI’s potential to bridge different data silos and\nsynthesize information could accelerate the rebundling of solutions. We also\nthink the macro consumer fundamentals, as previously mentioned, and a\npotentially more benign interest rate environment favour allocations to selective\nopportunities in lending; portfolio companies Achieve and Borrowell are examples\nof promising plays in this set.\nOther consumer trends we are watching include pay-by-bank (including new\nmerchant initiatives), and new e-commerce and buying experiences (for example,\nsocial commerce and text-based buying).\nAI generates its own set of investable themes in the consumer space. Given\nregulatory constraints and the need for accuracy, it is no surprise that there have\nbeen few consumer-facing fintech AI applications to date, but the potential is\nthere, particularly for AI and AI-powered “agents” to enable new customer\nexperiences. Hyper-personalization, natural language interfaces, streamlined\nonboarding processes and simplified, consolidated customer journeys are areas\nwe are focused on for capital deployment.\n5\nSMB Finance\nThe global economic footprint of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs)\ncontinues to expand.\nSince 2010, the number of small businesses globally has grown at 2.3% CAGR,4\nand last year SMBs accounted for 44% of U.S. GDP.5 With the advent of vertical\nSaaS, gig work platforms and e-commerce enablement, it is our opinion that SMB\ngrowth is poised to continue. Those factors have driven a shift in the funding\nlandscape: before 2021, B2B fintechs raised an average of $0.90 for every dollar\nraised by B2C fintechs; in 2023, B2B plays raised $1.90 for every B2C funding\ndollar.6 We see further opportunities in the space through AI, which is increasingly\nembedded directly into SMB financial workflows to automate such tasks as cash\nflow, treasury and accounts receivable/payable management.\nUS$1.90\nraised by B2B plays\nfor every B2C funding dollar\nin 2023\n4.

Portage analysis of Pitchbook data.\n6\nSMB Finance (cont.)\nIn a higher rate environment, many SMBs are struggling to access credit, which\nsupports one of our key investable themes for 2024: differentiated credit. We are\nseeing the emergence of innovative capital pools to provide end-to-end solutions\nsuch as software spend financing and B2B “buy now, pay later” (BNPL), which can\nsupport SMBs throughout the supply and value chains. Examples include Portage\nportfolio companies Oatfi, a provider of end-to-end credit infrastructure for B2B\npayments, and Kontempo, an embedded BNPL solution for B2B marketplaces,\nwholesalers and distributors in Mexico.\nEmbedded finance companies like Kontempo also represent another priority\ntheme. Embedded solutions can reduce administrative burden for SMBs and help\nthem think more efficiently about their financial needs in the context of workflow,\nwhile improving customer retention and expanding Annual Contract Value (ACV)\nand Average Revenue Per User (ARPU). Payments, loyalty, lending and insurance\nare growing categories of solutions being embedded in vertical SaaS platforms,\nlike CRMs or accounting platforms. For example, our newest portfolio company\nWalnut Insurance offers insurance-as-a-service (IaaS), allowing any business to\nsell insurance products digitally via open API.\nOur last investable theme is e-commerce enablement, which has helped drive\nSMB growth generally and we believe, is poised for expansion in the fintech-specific\nspace. Focus areas include fraud prevention, returns and loyalty. Another growing\nenablement trend we’re following is “re-commerce”; portfolio company Croissant,\nfor instance, provides an embedded resale platform targeting high-end apparel\nand premium consumer electronics.\n7\nInsurtech\nA heightened focus on efficiency defines the landscape for insurance.\nProperty and casualty (P&C) revenues have been constrained by slow GDP growth, tight\nfinancial conditions, high inflation and climate-related risks, as well as the transition to the\nIFRS-17 reporting regime.\nInsurers are experimenting with digital-first business models to meet customer expectations\nfor access, speed, customization and end-to-end service. This trend coincides with plummeting\nInsurtech valuations, which in 2023 fell to their lowest levels since 2017.7 As a result, the\ncurrent environment seems ripe for M&A, allowing incumbents to acquire digital capabilities\nor new business models to power their transformation.\nWe are focused on four investable themes in Insurtech, driven by the dual trends of efficiency\nand digital-first business models. The first is claims management optimization through AI and\nadvanced analytics, which can help firms improve workflow management and process claims\ndata more efficiently.\nThe second, fraud identification and mitigation, addresses growing\nconcern among insurers over ever-more sophisticated types of\nUS$40Bn\nfraud, from AI-generated photos and voice replication to deepfake\nvideos. Fraud already costs the insurance industry more than US$40\nFraud cost billion annually,8 but digital solutions that enable faster and more\nin insurance industry accurate fraud identification and mitigation are rapidly maturing.\nannually Meanwhile, new regulatory pressures have created a need for better\nunderwriting and risk management solutions which can help\ninsurers better manage the evolving regulatory and policy\nenvironment.\nFinally, we are focusing on Insurtech solutions for distribution through digitally native\napplications. Selling insurance to large, captive user bases is already a standard business\nmodel, but among the proliferation of embedded offerings there is opportunity for Insurtechs\nthat solve for verticalized distribution to niche customer segments. Portage portfolio company\nCovertree, a digital managing general agency (MGA) that provides insurance for residents of\nmanufactured homes in the U.S., is a good example of an innovative solution serving a\nhistorically overlooked—but growing—niche market.\n7. State of Insurtech 2023 Report. CB Insights. February 9, 2024. www.cbinsights.com/research/report/insurtech-trends-2023/\n8. U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation. Insurance Fraud. www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/insurance-fraud\n8\nWealth & Asset Management\nWe believe two demographic megatrends are driving the evolution of the\nwealth and asset management (WAM) space.\nOne is the aging of the baby boomer generation, the youngest of whom turns 60 in\n2024. This cohort’s focus will increasingly shift from accumulating wealth to\nnavigating retirement, transitioning to decumulation of assets and optimizing\ntheir estates. Those estates are substantial: boomers hold half of all personal net\nwealth in the U.S.,9 making boomers a still-significant economic force—and one\nthat is often overlooked by digital solution providers.\nThe other megatrend is the so-called Great Wealth Transfer\nUS$68Tn\nfrom baby boomers to Millennials, the oldest of whom are in\ntheir prime earning years. The transfer of wealth (estimated at\nSize of potential US$68 trillion10) could make Millennials the richest generation\nwealth of Millenials ever. They have grown up in an environment defined by\npersonalized digital experiences, and they expect the same\nfrom their financial service providers.\nIn this environment, WAM incumbents face twin challenges. On the one hand,\nthey are grappling with fee compression11 as new competitive threats emerge;\nreducing operating costs is a key goal. On the other hand, while financial\ninstitutions understand that new technologies can lead to better outcomes and\nmargins, legacy tech infrastructure poses a barrier to innovation and a continuity\nrisk in its own right. Without a migration to modern tech stacks, FIs may be unable\nto apply AI and other advanced tools to take full advantage of perhaps their most\nvaluable asset: data.\n9. U.S. Federal Reserve.

What is fee compression and how does it affect asset managers? IG Prime. November 24, 2022. www.ig.com/en-ch/prime/insights/articles/\nfee-compression-asset-managers-220826\n9\nWealth & Asset Management (cont.)\nInvestable themes in WAM reflect these emerging realities. Our focus is on core\ninfrastructure innovations, particularly solutions that may replace legacy\ntechnologies and take advantage of the urgency to address the continuity risk of\nexisting infrastructure. Areas of interest are wide-ranging, spanning capital\nmarkets (e.g., order management and clearing, alternative trading systems for\nequities and fixed income), asset management (e.g., transfer agencies, portfolio\nmanagement systems) and wealth management (e.g., financial and estate\nplanning, tax, compliance and client reporting). Portfolio companies in these\nspaces include Alpaca, which provides end-to-end brokerage infrastructure for\nany company to add commission-free equities trading to their own products;\nLiquidly, a platform that enables liquidity for illiquid assets; and Zilo, a fund\nadministration platform-as-a-service (PaaS) for transfer agents and their clients.\n10\nPayments\nPayments is a very broad area with considerable geographic idiosyncrasies—\nthe payments landscape in the U.S., for example, is very different from that in\nthe UK, France or Canada.\nYet some general themes still apply. Most notably, the commoditization of\nfunctions is increasing across the payments value chain, which is putting pressure\non margins and unit economics. This, we believe, sets the stage for consolidation\nacross the industry; markets will reward scale and profitability, and customers will\nincreasingly look to partners with multiple products to serve their expanding\npayments needs. As the ecosystem shifts toward a few incumbents, however, our\nview is that consolidation may open up opportunities for non-incumbent ventures\nto develop solutions that offer large payments platforms value-adds by increasing\nthe stickiness of their core payments offerings and acting as a hook for additional\ngrowth.\nOne of our key investable themes is verticalized payments\nas a value-creation tool for SaaS providers. Capturing part\nof the payments spread through an embedded platform\nprovides an opportunity to generate revenue and enhance\nthe stickiness of the underlying software. This has been a\npromising area for some time, and identifying segments\nthat are not served well by large incumbents will be key.\nOne of those segments is gas stations, which have a very\nspecific set of payments needs; P97, a portfolio company,\nprovides a cloud-based mobile commerce and digital\nmarketing solution that connects fuel retailers to\ncustomers. We are also focusing on healthcare, where the\nimplementation of SaaS-embedded payment platforms is\nstill far behind other sectors.\n11\nPayments (cont.)\nA sub-theme to verticalized payments is embedded\npayments in the B2B space. Because most B2B payments\nare still manual, there is plenty of room for digital innovation,\nand embedding payments into AP/AR automation tools and\nother financial software is a growing opportunity. Among\nour portfolio companies in this area is Notch, an operating\nsystem for restaurant back-of-house that enables digitized\nprocurement, invoicing and payments.\nFinally, we note that the market penetration of real-time\nrails is progressing more slowly than expected in the U.S.\nFraud is a continuing challenge, because banks do not have\nthe risk and compliance infrastructure to support real-time\npayments implementation. Nevertheless, the adoption of\nISO 20022, the new international standard for data\ninterchange between financial institutions, could lead to\nnew use cases for real-time rail and attract more solutions\nto the space over the long term.\n+280%\nValue of transactions using\ninstant payments rails\nthrough 203012\n12.

Statista. 1 August 2023\n12\nRegtech\nIn the wake of the Great Financial Crisis, financial institutions navigated more\nthan a decade of regulatory proliferation and escalating costs of compliance.\nThat trend has accelerated in recent years, driven by bank failures, the rise of\ncrypto, geopolitical and economic instability, and new technologies. Payments and\nother fintechs have also come under increased regulatory scrutiny. At the same\ntime, however, budgets for compliance are under pressure, and skilled compliance\nprofessionals are in increasingly short supply. The field, therefore, appears wide\nopen for modern solutions.\nWe see a significant opportunity for AI in this space as banks invest in solutions to\nmake compliance more efficient and cost-effective. Examples include AI-assisted\ndrafting of high-frequency regulatory reports and compliant customer\ncommunications; flagging suspicious customer or employee activity; building\ncomprehensive customer risk profile and anticipating operational risk events. The\nnear-term winners will offer FIs usable data, cost-efficiency and/or the ability to\npursue higher-risk market opportunities. An allowance for effective human\noversight will also be key.\nMajor concerns for regulators (and therefore banks) are customer intelligence\nand anti-money laundering (AML). In 2023, AML fines in the crypto industry\ntotaled US$5.8 billion,13 and in recent years numerous banks have faced billion-\ndollar-plus AML fines as well.
