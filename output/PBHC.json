Announces Third Quarter 2024 Results\n\nOctober 30, 2024\n\n[PDF Version](/node/9346/pdf)\n\n_Results reflect branch-acquisition-related expenses, as well as provision expense resulting from a_ _comprehensive loan portfolio review that significantly reduced nonperformers, as_ _Pathfinder positions the Bank for organic growth in its Central New York markets_\n\nOSWEGO, N.Y., Oct. 30, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pathfinder Bancorp, Inc. (“Pathfinder” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: PBHC) announced its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\nThe holding company for Pathfinder Bank (“the Bank”) reported a third quarter 2024 net loss attributable to common shareholders of $4.6 million or $0.75 per share, compared to net income available to common shareholders of $2.0 million or $0.32 per share in the second quarter of 2024 and $2.2 million or $0.35 per share in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Highlights and Key Developments**\n\n  * The net loss reflected $9.0 million in provision expense that primarily resulted from a comprehensive loan portfolio review that the Bank elected to undertake as part of its commitment to continuously improve its credit risk management approach. Following its conclusion, the Company recorded net charge offs of $8.7 million in the quarter and reduced nonperforming loans by 34.0% to $16.2 million at period end, or 1.8% of total loans. The allowance for credit losses on September 30, 2024 represented 1.87% and 106.8% of total and nonperforming loans, respectively.\n  * Net interest income increased for the third consecutive quarter to $11.7 million, including the benefit of a catch-up interest payment of $887,000. Net interest income increased $2.3 million from $9.5 million in the linked quarter ended June 30, 2024 and $1.7 million from $10.1 million in the third quarter of 2023. Net interest margin (“NIM”) expanded for the third consecutive quarter to 3.34%, including the benefit of 25 basis points from the catch-up interest payment. NIM increased 56 basis points from the linked quarter and 27 basis points from the year-ago period.\n  * Non-interest income was $1.7 million, including a net death benefit of $175,000 on bank owned life insurance (\"BOLI\"), compared to $1.2 million in each of the linked and year-ago quarters.\n  * Non-interest expense was $10.3 million, including $1.6 million in transaction-related expenses for the previously announced July 2024 closing of the East Syracuse branch acquisition, in addition to third quarter 2024 operating costs of approximately $462,000 associated with Pathfinder’s newest location. Non-interest expense was $7.9 million in the linked quarter and $7.7 million in the year-ago period.\n  * Pre-tax, pre-provision net income was $3.4 million, including the effect of transaction-related expenses, compared to $2.8 million in the linked quarter and $3.6 million in the year-ago period. Pre-tax, pre-provision net income, which is not a financial metric under generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), is a measure that the Company believes is helpful to understanding profitability without giving effect to income taxes and provision for credit losses.\n  * Total deposits were $1.20 billion at period end, compared to $1.10 billion on June 30, 2024 and $1.13 billion on September 30, 2023. The Bank’s loan-to-deposit ratio was 77.1% on September 30, 2024.\n  * Total loans were $921.7 million at period end, compared to $888.3 million on June 30, 2024 and $896.1 million on September 30, 2023.\n\n\n\n“Pathfinder is well positioned for organic growth opportunities in our attractive Central New York markets, having closed the third quarter with significantly reduced levels of nonperformers, healthy reserves, strong capital ratios, and abundant liquidity,” said President and Chief Executive Officer James A. Dowd. “Having completed a thorough, top-to-bottom review of the loan portfolio at the end of September, we believe it is sufficiently collateralized and reserved. Going forward, we intend to take a more exacting loss-mitigation approach, and Pathfinder's ongoing underwriting and credit risk management processes can be expected to reflect the combined expertise of our entire management team and professional staff, including our recently appointed Chief Credit Officer Joseph Serbun and Chief Financial Officer Justin Bigham.”\n\nDowd added, “Our financial performance also reflects the positive impact of Pathfinder Bank’s in-market core deposit franchise and immediate contributions from our recent East Syracuse branch acquisition, including higher loan and deposit balances, lower funding costs, revenue growth, and NIM expansion. Looking ahead, as we end 2024 and begin the new year, we intend to tightly manage operating expenses and expect continued benefits from our core deposit franchise as a source of low-cost, relationship-based funding for commercial and retail loan growth in our local markets.”\n\n**_East Syracuse Branch Acquisition_** As previously announced, Pathfinder Bank completed the purchase of its East Syracuse branch on July 19, 2024, assuming $186.0 million in associated deposits and acquiring $30.6 million in assets including $29.9 million in loans. Acquired assets include a core deposit intangible (“CDI”) valued at $6.3 million, and the valuation of acquired loans resulted in an estimated discount of $1.8 million.\n\nThe addition of the East Syracuse branch significantly increased the Bank's customer base, which expanded the number of Pathfinder's relationships by approximately 25% and grew non-brokered deposits by 21.5%.\n\nAt acquisition, the average cost of deposits assumed with the branch acquisition was 1.99% (excluding the CDI) and as of September 30, 2024, the Bank retained approximately 97% of deposit balances. The Company utilized a portion of the low-cost liquidity provided by the transaction to pay down $74.4 million in borrowings and $106.0 million in high-cost brokered deposits during the third quarter of 2024.\n\n**_Insurance Business Divestiture_** On October 15, 2024, Pathfinder announced that it sold its interest in the FitzGibbons Agency, LLC, which contributed $28,000 to the Company’s net income and 24 basis points to its consolidated efficiency ratio in the third quarter of 2024, to Marshall & Sterling Enterprises, Inc. Reflecting an active insurance brokerage market and the FitzGibbons Agency’s success since initiating its partnership with the Bank 13 years ago, Pathfinder will receive approximately $2.0 million from the sale, which closed on October 1, 2024, and the Company expects to recognize a portion of that amount as a net gain in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\n**_Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin_** Third quarter 2024 net interest income was $11.7 million, an increase of 23.8% from the second quarter of 2024. An increase in interest and dividend income of $2.2 million was primarily attributed to average yield increases of 67 basis points on loans including 39 basis points from an $887,000 catch-up interest payment associated with purchased loan pool positions, 97 basis points on fed funds sold and interest-earning deposits, and 45 basis points on all earning assets. The corresponding increase in loan interest income and federal funds sold and interest-earning deposits was $1.9 million and $371,000, respectively. A decrease in interest expense of $75,000 was attributed to reductions in brokered deposits and short-term borrowings expense associated with paydowns of brokered deposits and borrowings utilizing a portion of the low-cost liquidity provided by the Bank’s East Syracuse branch acquisition.\n\nNet interest margin was 3.34% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2.78% in the second quarter of 2024. The increase of 56 basis points was driven by improvements in earning asset yields and funding costs, as well as 25 basis points attributed to the catch-up interest payment received in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nThird quarter 2024 net interest income was $11.7 million, an increase of 16.6% from the third quarter of 2023. An increase in interest and dividend income of $3.5 million was primarily attributed to average yield increases of 74 basis points on loans including 39 basis points from the catch-up interest payment, 67 basis points on taxable investment securities, 227 basis points on fed funds sold and interest-earning deposits, and 65 basis points on all earning assets. The corresponding increase in loan interest income, taxable investment securities, and federal funds sold and interest-earning deposits was $2.0 million, $1.2 million, and $426,000, respectively. Increased interest and dividend income was partially offset by an increase in interest expense of $1.9 million. This increase in interest expense was predominantly the result of higher interest rates and balances associated with borrowing and higher average rates paid on interest-bearing deposits, compared to the third quarter of 2023.\n\nNet interest margin was 3.34% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 3.07% in the third quarter of 2023. The increase of 27 basis points was driven by improvements in earning asset yields and lower average borrowings, partially offset by higher funding costs, as well as 25 basis points attributed to the catch-up interest payment received in the third quarter of 2024.\n\n**_Noninterest Income_** Noninterest income totaled $1.7 million in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $496,000 or 41.0% from the second quarter of 2024 and an increase of $514,000 or 43.1% from the third quarter of 2023.\n\nCompared to the linked quarter, noninterest income growth included increases of $194,000 in earnings and gain on BOLI including the net death benefit of $175,000, $109,000 in debit card interchange fees, and $62,000 in service charges on deposit accounts, as well as a $33,000 decrease in loan servicing fees. Noninterest income growth from the linked quarter also reflected an increase of $204,000 in net realized losses on sales and redemptions of investment securities, as well as increases of $201,000 in net realized gains on sales of marketable equity securities and $50,000 in gains on sales of loans and foreclosed real estate.\n\nCompared to the year-ago quarter, noninterest income growth for the third quarter of 2024 included increases of $278,000 in interchange fees, $196,000 in earnings and gain on BOLI including the net death benefit of $175,000 on BOLI, and $49,000 in service charges on deposit accounts, as well as a $20,000 decrease in loan servicing fees. Noninterest income growth from the year-ago quarter also reflected a $178,000 increase in net realized losses on sales and redemptions of investment securities, as well as increases of $101,000 in net realized gains on sales of marketable equity securities and $49,000 in gains on sales of loans and foreclosed real estate.\n\nPrior to the October 1, 2024 sale of the Company’s insurance agency asset, it contributed $367,000 to noninterest income in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $260,000 and $310,000 in the linked and year-ago quarters, respectively. ** _Noninterest Expense_** Noninterest expense totaled $10.3 million in the third quarter of 2024, increasing $2.4 million and $2.6 million from the linked and year-ago quarters, respectively. The increase was primarily due to $1.6 million in transaction-related expenses for the East Syracuse branch acquisition, in addition to third quarter 2024 operating costs of approximately $462,000 associated with operating Pathfinder Bank’s newest location.\n\nProfessional and other services expense was $1.8 million in the third quarter, increasing $1.1 million and $1.3 million from the linked and year-ago quarters, respectively. The increase was primarily attributed to branch acquisition-related expenses.\n\nSalaries and benefits were $5.0 million in the third quarter of 2024, increasing $560,000 and $805,000 from the linked and year-ago quarters, respectively. The increase was primarily due to $141,000 transaction-related bonuses to employees, $115,000 reduced salary cost deferrals (“ASC 310-20”) associated with reduced lending volumes, and $80,000 of ongoing personnel-related costs associated with operating the branch acquired early in the third quarter of 2024. The remaining increase was primarily driven by higher salaries and benefits costs associated with merit increases and wage inflation.\n\nBuilding and occupancy was $1.1 million in the third quarter of 2024, increasing $220,000 and $266,000 from the linked and year-ago quarters, respectively. These increases were due to ongoing facilities-related costs of approximately $322,000 associated with operating the branch acquired early in the third quarter of 2024, partially offset by seasonal reductions in building and occupancy expense categories when compared to the second quarter of 2024.\n\nPrior to the October 1, 2024 sale of the Company’s insurance agency asset, it incurred $308,000 of noninterest expense in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $232,000 and $273,000 in the linked and year-ago quarters, respectively. For the third quarter of 2024, annualized noninterest expense represented 2.75% of average assets, including 8 basis points from insurance agency expense and 43 basis points from acquisition-related expenses. The efficiency ratio was 75.28%, including 24 basis points and 1,186 basis points attributed to the insurance business and acquisition-related expenses, respectively. The efficiency ratio, which is not a financial metric under GAAP, is a measure that the Company believes is helpful to understanding its level of non-interest expense as a percentage of total revenue. For the linked and year-ago quarters, annualized noninterest expense represented 2.19% and 2.20% of average assets, respectively. The efficiency ratio was 74.08% and 67.93% in the linked and year-ago periods.\n\n**_Statement of Financial Condition_** As of September 30, 2024, the Company’s statement of financial condition reflects total assets of $1.48 billion, compared to $1.45 billion and $1.40 billion recorded on June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively.\n\nThe increase in assets during the third quarter of 2024 was primarily due to higher total loan balances, including $29.9 million in primarily consumer, residential, and home equity loans acquired with the East Syracuse branch transaction in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nLoans totaled $921.7 million on September 30, 2024, increasing 3.8% during the third quarter and 2.9% from one year prior. Consumer and residential loans totaled $388.7 million, increasing 7.6% during the third quarter and 4.8% from one year prior. Commercial loans totaled $534.5 million, increasing 1.4% during the third quarter and 1.7% from one year prior.\n\nWith respect to liabilities, deposits totaled $1.20 billion on September 30, 2024, increasing 8.6% during the third quarter and 6.1% from one year prior. The increase in deposits during the third quarter of 2024 reflects $186.0 million assumed with the East Syracuse branch acquisition, offset by a reduction of $106.0 million in brokered deposits utilizing lower-cost liquidity provided by the transaction, as well as seasonal fluctuations in municipal deposits. The Company also utilized liquidity provided by the transaction to reduce short-term borrowings, which totaled $60.3 million on September 30, 2024 as compared to $127.6 million on June 30, 2024 and $56.7 million on September 30, 2023.\n\nShareholders equity totaled $120.3 million on September 30, 2024, down $3.1 million or 2.5% in the third quarter and $6.5 million or 5.7% from one year prior. The decrease reflects lower retained earnings attributed primarily to the elevated third quarter 2024 provision expense’s impact on net income in the period, which more than offset a significant reduction in accumulated other comprehensive loss (“AOCL”). AOCL improved to $6.7 million on September 30, 2024, declining $2.1 million or 23.6% during the third quarter and $6.6 million or 49.7% from one year prior, reflecting a favorable change in the interest rate environment.\n\n**_Asset Quality_** The Company’s asset quality metrics reflect the comprehensive loan portfolio review completed at the end of the third quarter of 2024.\n\nNonperforming loans were reduced by 34.0% in the third quarter of 2024 to $16.2 million or 1.75% of total loans on September 30, 2024. Nonperforming loans were $24.5 million or 2.76% of total loans on June 30, 2024 and $16.2 million or 1.80% of total loans on September 30, 2023.\n\nGross loan charge offs totaled $8.8 million in the third quarter of 2024, following completion of the portfolio review. Gross loan charge offs included $4.9 million for 13 nonperforming commercial loans, as well as $2.5 million for nonperforming positions primarily associated with secured solar purchased loan pools acquired in 2021.\n\nNet charge offs (“NCOs”) after recoveries were $8.7 million or an annualized 1.29% of average loans in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $66,000 or 0.02% in the linked quarter and $3.8 million or 0.61% in the prior year period.\n\nThe $9.0 million provision for credit losses expense in the third quarter of 2024 primarily resulted from a replenishment of the allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) for commercial loan reserves and an adjustment to the lifetime loss estimate for solar purchased loan pool positions, which followed completion of the Company’s loan portfolio review. The Company believes it is sufficiently collateralized and reserved, with its ACL of $17.3 million on September 30, 2024 increasing by $382,000 from June 30, 2024 and $1.5 million from September 30, 2023. As a percentage of total loans, ACL represented 1.87% on September 30, 2024, 1.90% on June 30, 2024, and 1.76% on September 30, 2023.\n\n**_Liquidity_** The Company has diligently ensured a strong liquidity profile as of September 30, 2024 to meet its ongoing financial obligations. The Bank’s liquidity management, as evaluated by its cash reserves and operational cash flows from loan repayments and investment securities, remains robust and is effectively managed by the institution’s leadership.\n\nThe Bank’s analysis indicates that expected cash inflows from loans and investment securities are more than sufficient to meet all projected financial obligations. Total deposits increased to $1.20 billion on September 30, 2024 from $1.10 billion on June 30, 2024 and $1.13 billion on September 30, 2023. Core deposits increased to 77.45% of total deposits on September 30, 2024, from 67.98% on June 30, 2024 and 69.83% on September 30, 2023. This further underscores the success of the Bank’s strategic initiatives to enhance its core deposit franchise, including targeted marketing campaigns and customer engagement programs aimed at deepening banking relationships and enhancing deposit stability.\n\nAt the end of the current quarter, Pathfinder Bancorp had an available additional funding capacity of $105.2 million with the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, which complements its liquidity reserves. Moreover, the Bank maintains additional unused credit lines totaling $27.3 million, which provide a buffer for additional funding needs. These facilities, including access to the Federal Reserve’s Discount Window, are part of a comprehensive liquidity strategy that ensures flexibility and readiness to respond to any funding requirements.\n\n**_Cash Dividend Declared_** On September 30, 2024, Pathfinder’s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.10 per share for holders of both voting common and non-voting common stock.\n\nIn addition, this dividend also extends to the notional shares of the Company’s warrants. Shareholders registered by October 18, 2024 will be eligible for the dividend, which is scheduled for disbursement on November 8, 2024. This distribution aligns with Pathfinder Bancorp’s philosophy of consistent and reliable delivery of shareholder value.\n\nEvaluating the Company’s market performance, the closing stock price as of September 30, 2024 stood at $15.83 per share. This positions the dividend yield at an attractive 2.53%.\n\n**_About Pathfinder Bancorp, Inc._** Pathfinder Bancorp, Inc.

Announces Second Quarter 2024 Net Income of $2.0 Million\n\nJuly 29, 2024\n\n[PDF Version](/node/9281/pdf)\n\n**Net interest margin expanded for the second consecutive quarter, and low-cost deposits acquired with the recently completed East Syracuse branch purchase are expected to benefit total funding costs**\n\nOSWEGO, N.Y., July 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pathfinder Bancorp, Inc. (\"Company\") (NASDAQ: PBHC), the holding company for Pathfinder Bank (\"Bank\"), announced second quarter 2024 net income available to common shareholders of $2.0 million, or $0.32 per basic and diluted share, consistent with the $2.0 million, or $0.32 per basic and diluted share, earned in the second quarter of 2023. The Company's total revenue, which is comprised of net interest income, before provision for credit losses, and total noninterest income, for the second quarter of 2024, was $10.7 million, decreasing by $128,000, or 1.2%, compared to the same quarter in 2023.\n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Key Results:**\n\n  * Net Interest Income of $9.5 million in the quarter decreased by $252,000, or 2.6% from June 30, 2023.\n  * Non-Interest Income of $1.2 million in the quarter increased by $124,000, or 11.4% from June 30, 2023 driven by various fees associated with our loan and deposit accounts.\n  * Non-Interest Expense of $7.9 million in the quarter increased by $734,000, or 10.2% from June 30, 2023 due primarily to increases in salaries and benefits and professional and other services.\n  * Total Deposits were $1.10 billion at the end of the second quarter, relatively flat to June 30, 2023.\n  * Total Loans were $888.3 million at the end of the second quarter, reflecting a $2.8 million decrease from June 30, 2023.\n\n\n\n“Our outlook remains positive, bolstered by the recent acquisition of the East Syracuse branch completed last week, strategically strengthening Pathfinder’s presence in Central New York. This region is positioned for outstanding economic growth through significant public and private investments in the semiconductor industry and its supporting infrastructure. With $186 million in deposits and $30 million in loans, the branch acquisition is designed to improve our liquidity profile and earnings, while enhancing our ability to serve the community in this dynamic market,” said President and Chief Executive Officer James A. Dowd. “We are also pleased with the improvement in net interest margin, which has modestly expanded for two consecutive quarters in what continues to be an unprecedented interest rate environment.”\n\nThe average cost of deposits acquired in the East Syracuse branch acquisition was approximately 1.99% (excluding Core Deposit Intangible), and the Company intends to utilize the additional liquidity to pay down approximately $150 million of borrowings that have an average cost of approximately 5.33% in three months ending June 30, which is expected to benefit total funding costs in the third quarter of 2024.\n\n“In addition, we are making measured strategic investments in customer-facing technologies to better serve our customers and improve operational efficiencies, while continuing to benefit from our interactions with Castle Creek Capital’s ecosystem of financial institutions and fintech companies to help us control noninterest expenses and serve customers in new ways.\"\n\n“From an asset quality perspective, we continue to manage the risk of our nonperforming loans by maintaining what we believe is a prudent allowance for credit losses, which increased during the second quarter to 1.90% of loans at period end. While net loan charge offs represented just 0.02% of average loans in the second quarter and provision expense declined to $290,000 for the three months ended June 30, we intend to further enhance the Bank’s approach to managing credit risk as part of our commitment to continuous improvement and long-term shareholder value creation.”\n\nDowd also took the opportunity to welcome Justin K. Bigham, CPA, who as previously announced was named Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, effective at the end of last month. \"Justin brings deep financial expertise and a broad understanding of the banking sector, including comprehensive knowledge and experience across finance, accounting, retail and small business banking, wealth management, insurance and marketing. Justin’s experience, leadership skills, and shared values will help drive our strategy and growth ambitions and deliver value. I am excited to work with Justin and welcome him to the Pathfinder family,\" Dowd said.\n\n**_East Syracuse, New York Branch Purchase _**\n\nThe Company filed Form 8-K on July 22, 2024, and announced that it completed the purchase and assumption of the East Syracuse branch of Berkshire Bank, the banking subsidiary of Berkshire Hills Bancorp, Inc. In connection with the purchase, the Company assumed approximately $186 million in deposits and acquired approximately $30 million in loans.\n\n**_Components of Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin_**\n\nIn the second quarter of 2024, the Bank's net interest income, before provision for credit losses, was reported at $9.5 million, a 2.6% decrease, or a reduction of $252,000, from the corresponding quarter in 2023. An increase in interest and dividend income of $2.4 million was more than offset by an increase in interest expense of almost $2.7 million.\n\nThis increase in interest and dividend income of $2.4 million was primarily attributed to loan yield increases of 44 basis points, investment securities and federal funds sold average balance increases of $68.3 million, and investment securities and federal funds sold average yield increases of 75 basis points. The corresponding increase in loan interest income and investment securities and federal funds sold interest income was $698,000 and $1.7 million, respectively.\n\nThe increase in interest expense of $2.7 million, compared to the prior quarter, was predominantly the result of a change in the Bank's deposit mix and a rise in average rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, reflecting the competitive conditions in the current interest rate environment.\n\nAs a result, the net interest margin for the second quarter of 2024 was 2.78%, compared to 2.75% in the first quarter of 2024, and 2.96% in the second quarter of 2023. The increase of three basis points compared to the first quarter was driven by asset yield improvements partially offset by deposit cost increases. The decline in net interest margin compared to the second quarter of 2023 was primarily attributed to higher funding costs related to the current high interest rate environment and repricing within the deposit portfolio, partially offset by an increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets.\n\n**_Provision for Credit Losses_**\n\nThe provision for credit losses was $290,000 in the second quarter, reflecting a decrease of $850,000 compared to the same period in 2023. The June 30, 2023, provision for credit losses of $1.14 million was attributed to two large commercial real estate and commercial loan relationships experiencing credit deterioration. The June 30, 2024 provision for credit losses included an increase in specific reserves of approximately $665,000, partially offset by improvement in certain qualitative and other factors that resulted in a net increase in the provision for loans of $304,000. The remaining components in provision for credit losses was a net reduction of $14,000. \n\nThe Bank continues to diligently monitor credit portfolios, particularly those considered sensitive to prevailing economic stressors, and apply conservative loan classification and reserve building methodologies.\n\n**_Noninterest Income_**\n\nPathfinder's noninterest income for the second quarter of 2024 amounted to $1.2 million, reflecting an increase of $124,000 compared to the same quarter of 2023. This increase can primarily be attributed to the factors influencing recurring noninterest income, which excludes volatile items such as unrealized gains or losses on equity securities, as well as nonrecurring gains on sales of loans, investment securities, foreclosed real estate, premises, and equipment.\n\nRecurring noninterest income during the quarter ended June 30, 2024 increased $155,000, or 13.6%, as compared to the same quarter in 2023. This is primarily due to an increase of $79,000 in debit card interchange fees, as a result of increased gross interchange revenues related to higher levels of consumer activity. Other components of noninterest income that also increased during the quarter ended June 30, 2024 include a $45,000 increase in loan servicing fees, a $27,000 increase in service charges on deposit accounts, and a $24,000 increase in earnings and gain on bank owned life insurance. These modest increases were partially offset by an aggregate decrease of $20,000 in other noninterest income categories.\n\nThe $31,000 year-over-year decrease in all other (nonrecurring) categories of noninterest income was primarily the result of a $77,000 decrease in sales of loans and foreclosed real estate during the three months ended June 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. Partially offsetting this decrease were lower losses on marketable equity securities in the amount of $30,000, and a $16,000 increase in gains on sales and redemptions of investment securities.\n\nSecond quarter results reflect the Bank’s strategy to proactively seek out and capitalize on new opportunities to diversify and enhance recurring noninterest income’s contribution to total revenue. As the Bank moves forward with its growth strategy, noninterest income is anticipated to play an increasingly vital role in maintaining a well-balanced and resilient financial profile.\n\nThe following table details the components of noninterest income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, and 2023:\n\n**Unaudited** | For the three months ended | For the six months ended  \n---|---|---  \n_(In thousands)_ | June 30, 2024 | June 30, 2023 | Change | June 30, 2024 | June 30, 2023 | Change  \nService charges on deposit accounts | $ | 330 | $ | 303 | $ | 27 | 8.9 | % | $ | 639 | $ | 570 | $ | 69 | 12.1 | %  \nEarnings and gain on bank owned life insurance | 167 | 143 | 24 | 16.8 | % | 324 | 301 | 23 | 7.6 | %  \nLoan servicing fees | 112 | 67 | 45 | 67.2 | % | 200 | 139 | 61 | 43.9 | %  \nDebit card interchange fees | 191 | 112 | 79 | 70.5 | % | 310 | 433 | (123 | ) | -28.4 | %  \nInsurance agency revenue | 260 | 271 | (11 | ) | -4.1 | % | 657 | 691 | (34 | ) | -4.9 | %  \nOther charges, commissions and fees | 234 | 243 | (9 | ) | -3.7 | % | 678 | 499 | 179 | 35.9 | %  \nNoninterest income before gains | 1,294 | 1,139 | 155 | 13.6 | % | 2,808 | 2,633 | 175 | 6.6 | %  \nGains (losses) on sales and redemptions of investment securities | 16 | - | 16 | 0.0 | % | (132 | ) | 73 | (205 | ) | -280.8 | %  \nGain on sales of loans and foreclosed real estate | 40 | 117 | (77 | ) | -65.8 | % | 58 | 142 | (84 | ) | -59.2 | %  \nNon-recurring gain on lease renegotiations | - | - | - | 0.0 | % | 245 | - | 245 | 100.0 | %  \nLosses on marketable equity securities | (139 | ) | (169 | ) | 30 | -17.8 | % | (31 | ) | (169 | ) | 138 | -81.7 | %  \nTotal noninterest income | $ | 1,211 | $ | 1,087 | $ | 124 | 11.4 | % | $ | 2,948 | $ | 2,679 | $ | 269 | 10.0 | %  \n  \n**_Noninterest Expense_**\n\nFor the second quarter of 2024, Pathfinder Bank reported noninterest expenses of $7.9 million. This represents an increase of approximately $734,000, or 10.2%, compared to the same period in 2023.\n\nSalaries and benefits increased $493,000, or 12.6% during the quarter ended June 30, 2024, as compared to June 30, 2023. Headcount increases drove approximately $285,000 and salary adjustments related to merit and wage inflation accounted for approximately $208,000. These adjustments for merit and wage inflation are crucial in maintaining competitive remuneration packages to attract and retain talent in the dynamic banking sector.\n\nProfessional and other services increased $193,000 during the second quarter of 2024, as compared to the same quarter in 2023. This increase is primarily due to $116,000 of nonrecurring expenses associated with a review of technology enhancements meant to drive improvements in operational efficiencies. The remaining increase in professional and other services of $77,000 is spread across several smaller consulting engagements. All other remaining noninterest expense categories had an aggregate increase of $48,000, or 1.7%.\n\nThe following table details the components of noninterest expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, and 2023:\n\n**Unaudited** | For the three months ended | For the six months ended  \n---|---|---  \n_(In thousands)_ | June 30, 2024 | June 30, 2023 | Change | June 30, 2024 | June 30, 2023 | Change  \nSalaries and employee benefits | $ | 4,399 | $ | 3,906 | $ | 493 | 12.6 | % | $ | 8,728 | $ | 8,089 | $ | 639 | 7.9 | %  \nBuilding and occupancy | 914 | 979 | (65 | ) | -6.6 | % | 1,730 | 1,831 | (101 | ) | -5.5 | %  \nData processing | 550 | 483 | 67 | 13.9 | % | 1,078 | 1,036 | 42 | 4.1 | %  \nProfessional and other services | 696 | 503 | 193 | 38.4 | % | 1,258 | 1,039 | 219 | 21.1 | %  \nAdvertising | 116 | 166 | (50 | ) | -30.1 | % | 221 | 372 | (151 | ) | -40.6 | %  \nFDIC assessments | 228 | 222 | 6 | 2.7 | % | 457 | 441 | 16 | 3.6 | %  \nAudits and exams | 123 | 158 | (35 | ) | -22.2 | % | 293 | 317 | (24 | ) | -7.6 | %  \nInsurance agency expense | 232 | 283 | (51 | ) | -18.0 | % | 517 | 544 | (27 | ) | -5.0 | %  \nCommunity service activities | 39 | 66 | (27 | ) | -40.9 | % | 91 | 96 | (5 | ) | -5.2 | %  \nForeclosed real estate expenses | 30 | 18 | 12 | 66.7 | % | 55 | 32 | 23 | 71.9 | %  \nOther expenses | 581 | 390 | 191 | 49.0 | % | 1,186 | 901 | 285 | 31.6 | %  \nTotal noninterest expenses | $ | 7,908 | $ | 7,174 | $ | 734 | 10.2 | % | $ | 15,614 | $ | 14,698 | $ | 916 | 6.2 | %  \n  \n**_Statement of Financial Condition at June 30, 2024_**\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, Pathfinder Bancorp, Inc.'s statement of financial condition reflects total assets of $1.45 billion. This represents a slight decrease from the $1.47 billion recorded at December 31, 2023, a contraction of $19.6 million, or 1.3%. The observed reduction in assets since December 31, 2023 is primarily due to a decrease in total loan balances, which declined from $897.2 million to $888.3 million, representing a decrease of $8.9 million or approximately 1.0%. This contraction in the loan portfolio reflects both normal fluctuations in loan repayments and a strategic recalibration to focus on higher-yielding products with high quality, in-market borrowers.\n\nAdditionally, interest-earning deposits experienced a significant reduction since December 31, 2023 from $36.4 million to $19.8 million, contributing to the decrease in total cash and cash equivalents, which fell from $48.7 million to $31.8 million. A deliberate shift in investments reduced held-to maturity securities from $179.3 million at December 31, 2023 to $166.3 million at June 30, 2024, a decrease of $13.0, or 7.3%. Conversely, the Bank saw growth in its available-for-sale securities from $258.7 million to $275.0 million, at December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2024, respectively, and an increase in other assets, which grew by $3.1 million in the current quarter.\n\nWith respect to liabilities, total deposits demonstrated stability, with a slight decrease of $18.8 million or 1.7%, from $1.12 billion at December 31, 2023 to $1.10 billion at June 30, 2024. The decrease in deposits was primarily due to seasonal fluctuations of municipal depositors. The stability reflects the Company's ability to maintain strong customer relationships and a solid funding base amidst competitive pressures. \n\nShareholders' equity saw a rise of $3.9 million or about 3.2%, increasing from $119.5 million at the end of 2023 to $123.3 million by the end of June 2024. This uptrend was primarily fueled by the Bank's profitable operations, with net income contributing to the increment in retained earnings, which increased from $76.1 million to $78.9 million, net of dividends distributed to shareholders.\n\n**_Asset Quality_**\n\nThe Bank reported an increase in the nonperforming loans ratio from 1.92% at the end of December 2023 to 2.76% at the end of June 2024. This was recognized within the Company’s $917,000 increase to the allowance for credit losses (\"ACL\") of $16.9 million, or 1.90% of loans, as of June 30, 2024, compared to $16.0 million, or 1.78% of loans, at the end of 2023. This reserve underscores the Bank’s prudent approach to potential credit risks and its capacity to absorb potential loan losses.\n\nThe Company remains vigilant in its oversight of asset quality and maintenance of what it believes are prudent reserves for credit losses. Management continues to proactively monitor and address asset quality, including the close surveillance of nonaccrual loans. The reported ACL as of June 30, 2024, incorporates management’s estimates of future collectability, adjusting for current conditions and forward-looking economic forecasts. The Bank’s strategies, including the ongoing refinement of its credit risk practices, aim to bolster the loan portfolio against future uncertainties.\n\nThe following table summarizes nonaccrual loans by category and status at June 30, 2024:\n\n(In thousands)  \n---  \nLoan Type | Collateral Type | Number of Loans | Loan Balance | Average Loan Balance | Weighted LTV at Origination/ Modification | Status  \n**Secured residential mortgage:**  \nReal Estate | 23 | $ | 1,737 | $ | 76 | 71 | % | Individual loans are under active resolution management by the Bank.  \n**Secured commercial real estate:**  \nPrivate Museum | 1 | 1,339 | 1,339 | 77 | % | The borrower is making interest only and escrow payments. Strategic initiatives are being implemented by the borrower that will provide cash flow for future debt requirements under a modified debt restructure; inclusive of the sale of the building to a qualified buyer.  \nOffice Space | 1 | 1,665 | 1,665 | 77 | % | The loan is secured by a first mortgage with strong tenancy and a long-term lease. The borrower is in the process of securing grants and tax credit funding. The Bank is in regular communication with the borrower.  \nRecreation/Golf Course/Marina | 1 | 1,368 | 1,368 | 55 | % | The borrower is in the process of restructuring debt and loan payments for its seasonal business.  \nAll other | 10 | 2,049 | 205 | 132 | % | Individual loans are under active resolution management by the Bank.  \n**Commercial lines of credit:** | 11 | 2,312 | 210 | (1 | ) | Individual lines are under active resolution management by the Bank.  \n**Commercial and industrial loans:** | 21 | 9,783 | 466 | (1 | ) | Individual loans are under active resolution management by the Bank.  \n**Consumer loans:** | 136 | 4,237 | 31 | (1 | ) | Individual loans are under active resolution management by the Bank.  \n204 | $ | 24,490  \n  \n(1) These loans were originated as unsecured or with minimal collateral.\n\n**_Liquidity_**\n\nThe Company has diligently ensured a strong liquidity profile as of June 30, 2024, to meet its ongoing financial obligations. The Bank's liquidity management, as evaluated by its cash reserves and operational cash flows from loan repayments and investment securities, remains robust and is effectively managed by the institution's leadership.\n\nThe Bank's analysis indicates that expected cash inflows from loans and investment securities are more than sufficient to meet all projected financial obligations. In the second quarter of 2024, the Bank's non-brokered deposit balances decreased modestly to $865.7 million at June 30, 2024 from $877.4 million at June 30, 2023. In line with this strong liquidity stance, the Bank's total deposits remain stable and were $1.10 billion at June 30, 2024 as compared to $1.10 billion and $1.12 billion at June 20, 2023 and December 31, 2023, respectively. This further underscores the success of the Bank’s strategic initiatives in deposit gathering, including targeted marketing campaigns and customer engagement programs aimed at deepening banking relationships and enhancing deposit stability.\n\nThe Bank continues to fortify its liquidity position through established alliances, including its longstanding partnership with the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (\"FHLB-NY\"). By the end of the current quarter, Pathfinder Bancorp had an available additional funding capacity of $42.1 million with the FHLB-NY, which complements its liquidity reserves. Moreover, the Bank maintains additional unused credit lines totaling $29.4 million, which provide a buffer for additional funding needs. These facilities, including access to the Federal Reserve’s Discount Window, are part of a comprehensive liquidity strategy that ensures flexibility and readiness to respond to any funding requirements.\n\nPathfinder Bancorp's oversight extends to continuous liquidity monitoring, ensuring that it is positioned to withstand financial market fluctuations. The Bank's deposit base remained stable at $1.10 billion as of June 30, 2024. Out of this amount, the portion above the FDIC insurance limits is well-managed, with $56.7 million safeguarded by a reciprocal deposit program and $100.0 million in municipal deposits fully collateralized by high-quality securities at June 30, 2024. This leaves the remaining fraction of $82.4 million, or 7.5%, of total deposits, as uninsured. Pathfinder Bancorp’s liquidity management strategies and comprehensive risk mitigation measures demonstrate the Bank’s capacity to maintain liquidity and financial resilience, ensuring operational continuity and the continuing growth of stakeholder confidence.\n\n**_Cash Dividend Declared_**\n\nOn July 1, 2024, Pathfinder Bancorp declared its quarterly cash dividend, a testament to the Company’s enduring commitment to shareholder returns within a framework of risk management and financial stability. Consistent with the Company’s tradition of sharing success, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.10 per share for holders of both voting common and non-voting common stock reflective of the Company’s solid performance and optimistic outlook.\n\nIn addition, this dividend also extends to the notional shares of the Company's warrants. Shareholders registered by July 19, 2024 will be eligible for the dividend, which is scheduled for disbursement on August 9, 2024. This distribution aligns with Pathfinder Bancorp’s philosophy of consistent and reliable delivery of shareholder value.\n\nEvaluating the Company's market performance, the closing stock price as of June 28, 2024, stood at $13.19 per share. This positions the dividend yield at an attractive 3.03%. The annualized dividend payout ratio, based on the current dividend, is calculated to be 30.2%, underscoring the Board’s strategic approach to capital allocation, shareholder returns and the preservation of a fortified balance sheet.\n\nPathfinder Bancorp continues to navigate through economic cycles with a prudent and disciplined approach, ensuring that its capital distribution strategy is well calibrated to support sustained growth and long-term shareholder wealth creation.\n\n**_About Pathfinder Bancorp, Inc._**\n\nPathfinder Bank is a New York State chartered commercial Bank headquartered in Oswego, whose deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

Announces First Quarter 2024 Net Income of $2.1 Million\n\nApril 29, 2024\n\n[PDF Version](/node/9111/pdf)\n\n**Strategic Growth and Prudent Expense Management Shape Bank Performance Despite Economic Challenges**\n\nOSWEGO, N.Y., April 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pathfinder Bancorp, Inc. (“Company”) (NASDAQ: PBHC), the holding company for Pathfinder Bank (“Bank”), announced first quarter 2024 net income available to common shareholders of $2.1 million, or $0.34 per basic and diluted share, compared to $2.6 million, or $0.43 per basic and diluted share, for the first quarter of 2023. The Company's total revenue, which is comprised of net interest income, before provision for credit losses, and total noninterest income, for the first quarter of 2024 was $11.1 million, a decrease of $423,000, or 3.7%, when compared to the same quarter in 2023.\n\n**Performance Highlights for Three Months Ended March 31, 2024: **\n\n  * The Bank's Board of Directors announced an 11.1% increase in its quarterly dividend to $0.10 per share.\n  * Pathfinder Bancorp, Inc. reported an increase in interest and dividend income of 23.7% to $18.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, up from $15.0 million in the same period of 2023.\n  * Total interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024, increased to $9.2 million, up 81.5% from $5.1 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n  * Net interest income after provision for credit losses totaled $8.7 million for the quarter, a decrease from the $9.3 million after provision reported for the corresponding quarter of 2023.\n  * Net interest margin for the quarter decreased to 2.75%, a 27 basis points change from 3.02% reported in the same prior year quarter.\n  * Noninterest income for the quarter reached $1.7 million and reflected modest growth from $1.6 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n  * Noninterest expenses for the quarter totaled $7.7 million, a slight increase from $7.5 million in the same period last year.\n  * The Company’s net income for the quarter decreased to $2.1 million from the $2.6 million reported in the same period of 2023.\n  * Total loans decreased to $891.5 million at the end of the first quarter of 2024, down $18.6 million, or 2.0%, from March 31, 2023, and $5.7 million or 0.6% from December 31, 2023.\n\n\n\nPathfinder Bancorp, Inc. entered the first quarter of 2024 with a foundation grounded in effective risk management and guided by its measured plans for continued strategic growth. In a financial landscape marked by elevated interest rates and frequent shifts in economic forecasts, the Bank has adeptly navigated these challenges, reinforcing its commitment to enhancing shareholder value. James A. Dowd, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented: \"Leveraging proactive financial management and strategic foresight, we successfully navigated the complexities of this quarter, affirming our path toward continued progress.\"\n\nDowd noted that the Treasury yield curve remained inverted (short term interest rates higher than long term interest rates) for the entirety of the first quarter of 2024, as it was in all of 2023. The Treasury yield curve was inverted by an average of 0.37% for the quarter between the 2-year and 5-year tenors. He further stated that the average effective Fed funds rate of 5.33% remained well above the prevailing rates of all term Treasury rates throughout the quarter creating another significant element of yield curve inversion. “This has been a difficult environment for the vast majority of depository institutions. Our adept handling of fluctuating interest rates demonstrates the benefits of our market insights and our risk management focus,” added Dowd.\n\n“The Company’s financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, were notably strong, considering this economic backdrop, displaying a significant 23.7% increase in interest and dividend income to $18.6 million, up from $15.0 million the previous year. This growth, fueled by a diverse portfolio of interest-earning assets, underscores our balance sheet’s built-in resilience and our capacity to generate profitability within a broad range of interest rate environments. Despite interest expenses nearly doubling to $9.2 million from $5.1 million, reflecting the industry’s broader trend of rising funding costs, our net interest income, before provisions for credit losses remained relatively stable at $9.4 million.”\n\nDowd stated that the relatively modest decline in net income to $2.1 million from $2.6 million the previous year underscores the effectiveness of the Company’s strategic initiatives and comprehensive risk management protocols, including a prudent provision for credit losses of $726,000. Dowd elaborated on the Bank's asset quality, noting a modest deterioration in nonperforming loans to period-end loans at 2.20%, which he characterized as transitory, that has been conservatively accounted for within in the Company’s allowance for credit losses to period-end loans, which stand at 1.87%. \"These figures reflect our rigorous management of the loan portfolio and our commitment to stringent risk management practices,\" he remarked.\n\nDespite quarter-over-quarter decreases in key profitability metrics - return on average assets at 0.59% and return on average common equity at 7.01%, along with a net interest margin of 2.75%, the Bank continues to demonstrate a focused commitment to long-term financial health and responsible management, as Dowd highlighted. Dowd further stated that \"Our balance sheet reflects the Bank's financial strength, with total assets reaching $1.45 billion and shareholders' equity increasing to $121.8 million. Tangible book value per common share grew to $19.21, further emphasizing our ongoing success in increasing that measure of underlying shareholder value.\"\n\nLooking forward, Dowd expressed optimism, \"We remain strategically positioned at the forefront of emerging opportunities within our markets in 2024 and beyond, and are focused on maintaining superior asset quality, making sound credit decisions, and responding to our customers' evolving needs. Although direct comparisons year-over-year should be viewed in the context of current market conditions, our core strengths and the adaptability of our dedicated team prepare us to confront immediate challenges and seize the opportunities on the horizon.\" He highlighted recent strategic initiatives, including a significant branch acquisition announced in the first quarter of 2024, and discussed below, that underscores the Company’s commitment to excellence in all facets of our operations. “As Central New York undergoes what we believe will be a very impressive economic revitalization, Pathfinder is primed to leverage its significant regional investments,” Dowd stated.\n\n“Moreover, our operational efficiency is evident in the stable management of noninterest expenses, highlighting our cost control measures and investments in technological solutions poised to enhance future operational efficiency. Additionally, the competitive landscape, with pressures from non-local deposit gathering entities, challenges us to maintain deposit levels, prioritizing liquidity to support a base for continued growth and service enhancement.”\n\n“Pathfinder’s forward-looking statements are grounded in recent strategic actions, most notably, the announced signing of a purchase and assumption agreement for a branch in East Syracuse. The branch will add nearly $200 million in established deposits and provide an outstanding service location for the Bank’s new and existing customers. This acquired branch is viewed as being ideally located with respect to the Bank’s current Syracuse branch network and will not only complement the Bank’s existing geographic footprint but also tap into high-potential market areas. Subject to regulatory approval, associated system conversion timelines, and satisfaction of certain customary closing conditions, the purchase is expected to be completed in the third quarter 2024. This branch expansion, coupled with our strong capital position, evidenced by an 11.1% increase in our declared quarterly dividend, also announced in this quarter, underscores Pathfinder’s commitment to delivering value to its shareholders and enhancing its longer term market competitiveness.”\n\n\"Looking ahead, the Bank’s management and Board of Directors maintain a positive outlook, bolstered by recent strategic successes like the pending East Syracuse branch acquisition and an increasingly robust presence in the swiftly evolving Central New York economic landscape. The Bank's leadership remains committed to navigating the ongoing economic challenges while seizing the opportunities for growth and profitability that will undoubtedly arise. With careful management of assets, liabilities, and a steady approach to cost control, Pathfinder Bancorp, Inc. is poised to continue its trajectory of responsible growth and shareholder value enhancement,” Mr. Dowd concluded.\n\n**_Income Statement for the Quarter Ended March 31, 2024_**\n\nNet income for the quarter was $2.1 million, marking a decline from the $2.6 million reported in the first quarter of the previous year. This represented a decrease of $479,000 or approximately 18.4%. Net interest income before the provision for credit losses saw a decrease to $9.4 million, down by 5.7% from the $10.0 million reported in the first quarter of 2023. The decrease in net interest income was largely due to an 81.5% increase in interest expenses, totaling $9.2 million, which considerably exceeded the previous year's $5.1 million. Partially offsetting the sharp increase in interest expenses, was a 23.7% growth in interest and dividend income which reached $18.6 million in the first quarter of 2024, up from $15.0 million in the first quarter of 2023, due in large part to a diversified and performing portfolio of loans and securities.\n\nThe provision for credit losses for the quarter stood marginally higher at $726,000 compared to $692,000 in the prior year, mirroring the Bank's cautious yet assertive strategy in managing its credit exposure. This provision resulted in net interest income after provision for credit losses of $8.7 million, slightly lower than the $9.3 million recorded for the same period in the previous year. \n\nNoninterest income experienced modest growth, rising to $1.7 million from $1.6 million, which represents a 9.1% increase. This uptick was propelled by higher service charges on deposit accounts, net realized gains on marketable equity securities, and other operating income. This increase was partially offset by a reduction in debit card interchange fees and losses on sales and redemption of investment securities compared to the previous year. Total revenues, after considering the provision for credit losses, were reported at $10.4 million, reflecting a modest decline from $10.9 million in the prior year's first quarter.\n\nNoninterest expense witnessed a slight escalation to $7.7 million, which is an increase of 2.4% over the first quarter of 2023. The higher expenses were in line with generally reported inflationary trends, especially in the labor markets. In addition, the Bank continued to manage investments in strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing its market reach and operational efficiency. The Bank remains steadfast in its commitment to diligently evaluate strategic solutions aimed at reducing noninterest expenses in upcoming quarters.\n\nAs the quarter closed, key profitability ratios such as the return on average assets were calculated at 0.59%, and the return on average common equity was at 7.01%, both reflecting the competitive and operational pressures of the period. These figures underscored a modest compression from the prior year's ratios, primarily attributable to the compressed net interest margins in a highly competitive deposits environment.\n\n**_Components of Net Interest Income_**\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2024 Pathfinder Bancorp, Inc. navigated through a financial environment with mixed outcomes reflected in its net interest income components. The Company's net interest income before provision for credit losses experienced a downturn and contracted by $568,000, or 5.7%, to $9.4 million when compared with the corresponding period in 2023.\n\nThe interest and dividend income for the quarter stood at $18.6 million, a considerable increase of $3.6 million, or 23.7%, from the $15.0 million reported in the first quarter of 2023. This increase was multifaceted; a $1.6 million increase was noted in loan interest income, supplemented by a $1.9 million increase in interest income from taxable and tax-exempt securities. Contributing to these figures was a 74 basis points increase in the average yield of the loan portfolio, only slightly offset by a marginal decline of $3.9 million in the average balance of outstanding loans. In the quarter ended March 31, 2024, the yields on taxable investment securities increased by 117 basis points, accompanied by a $62.7 million increase in their average balance, when compared to the same quarter in 2023.\n\nHowever, these positive trends were counterbalanced by a pronounced increase in total interest expense, which increased to $9.2 million, a steep increase of 81.5% from the $5.1 million seen in the first quarter of the preceding year. This emanated primarily from an elevated average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, which increased by 138 basis points, and was further compounded by a $50.4 million augmentation in the average balance of such liabilities. This upsurge in interest expenses was largely attributed to the intensified cost of deposits, fueled by escalating competition in the rising interest rate environment. A notable change in the deposit composition was observed with a $69.4 million increase in average time deposit balances, in conjunction with a 163 basis points increase in the paid interest rates on those deposits. Many deposit customers, while still remaining with the Bank, have elected to move significant portions of their deposits to time deposits as a component of their personal financial management strategies. The Bank’s internal tracking indicated that approximately 15.3% of the Bank’s time deposit growth for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 has been the result of an internal shift from nonmaturity deposits to time deposits when compared to the same period in 2023. \n\nThe net result was a net interest margin of 2.75% for the quarter, a decline of 27 basis points from the net interest margin of 3.02% in the first quarter of 2023. The Bank's management team has been actively adjusting the institution's asset and liability management strategies to uphold the net interest margin in a challenging and evolving rate landscape.\n\n**_Provision for Credit Losses_**\n\nPathfinder Bancorp, Inc. demonstrated its cautious and prudent risk management philosophy, and reported a provision for credit losses of $726,000 for the first quarter of 2024. This figure represents a slight increase of $34,000, or 4.9%, from the $692,000 provision for credit losses recorded in the same quarter of the previous year. Such an increment is indicative of the Bank’s vigilant approach to the current economic conditions and its commitment to conservative financial practices.\n\nThe Bank's management continues to diligently monitor credit portfolios, particularly those considered sensitive to prevailing economic stressors. The Bank steadfastly applies conservative loan classification and reserve building methodologies, which are deeply ingrained in its operational framework. This steadfast approach is deemed essential in maintaining the integrity of the loan portfolio and in safeguarding the Bank’s long-term financial stability.\n\n**_Noninterest Income_**\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Pathfinder Bancorp, Inc. demonstrated a notable advancement in its financial strategy, as evidenced by the growth in noninterest income to $1.7 million. This represents an increase of 9.1% over the same quarter last year, underscoring a successful period of revenue diversification and enhancement of customer-centric services. The surge in service charges on deposit accounts is a clear indication of the Bank’s expanding customer engagement and the effective adoption of fee-based products.\n\nEnhancements to the Bank’s noninterest income streams, which exclude the less predictable components such as market-driven gains or losses on securities, point to Pathfinder’s commitment to fortifying its revenue base against economic fluctuations. A deepened focus on areas such as wealth management, payment processing services, and treasury management has been central to this growth. Notably, other operating income has seen a healthy increase, likely bolstered by the Bank’s strategic initiatives in technological innovation and expanded service offerings.\n\nThis steady growth in noninterest income highlights the efficacy of the Bank's strategies in an environment where interest-based revenue can be uncertain. Pathfinder Bancorp's deliberate emphasis on broadening its income-generating activities demonstrates foresight and adaptability, ensuring that it can continue to thrive even amidst shifting financial tides.\n\nLooking to the future, the Bank is well-positioned to continue this trajectory, with plans to invest further in areas that promise robust fee income potential. As Pathfinder Bancorp harnesses opportunities in digital banking, asset management, and other emergent financial services, it maintains a solid foundation to support sustainable growth. The Bank is resolute in its commitment to leveraging its strengths in these areas to continue providing value to its shareholders and enhancing its market competitiveness.\n\nThe increased noninterest income reflects not just the Bank's ability to adapt to changing economic landscapes, but also its proactive approach in seeking out and capitalizing on new revenue opportunities. As the Bank moves forward with its growth strategy, noninterest income is anticipated to play an increasingly vital role in maintaining a well-balanced and resilient financial profile.\n\nThe following table details the components of noninterest income for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023:\n\nFor the three months ended,  \n---  \n_(In thousands)_ | March 31, 2024 | March 31, 2023 | Change  \nService charges on deposit accounts | $ | 309 | $ | 267 | $ | 42 | 15.7 | %  \nEarnings and gain on bank owned life insurance | 157 | 158 | (1 | ) | -0.6 | %  \nLoan servicing fees | 88 | 72 | 16 | 22.2 | %  \nDebit card interchange fees | 119 | 321 | (202 | ) | -62.9 | %  \nInsurance agency revenue | 397 | 420 | (23 | ) | -5.5 | %  \nOther charges, commissions and fees | 444 | 256 | 188 | 73.4 | %  \nNoninterest income before gains | 1,514 | 1,494 | 20 | 1.3 | %  \n(Losses) gains on sales and redemptions of investment securities | (148 | ) | 73 | (221 | ) | -302.7 | %  \nGain on sales of loans and foreclosed real estate | 18 | 25 | (7 | ) | -28.0 | %  \nNon-recurring gain on lease renegotiations | 245 | - | 245 | 100%+  \nGains on marketable equity securities | 108 | - | 108 | 100%+  \nTotal noninterest income | $ | 1,737 | $ | 1,592 | $ | 145 | 9.1 | %  \n  \nThe aggregate increase of $145,000, or 9.1%, in noninterest income during the quarter ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the same quarter in 2023, was the result of a $20,000, or 1.3%, net increase in recurring noninterest income, supplemented by a $125,000 aggregate increase in all other categories of noninterest income. Within the category of recurring noninterest income, year over year revenues increased $222,000, or 18.9%, excluding debit interchange fees. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in net debit card interchange fees of $202,000, or 62.9%. Debit card interchange income declined in the first quarter of 2024, as compared to the same quarter in 2023, as a result of reduced gross interchange revenues related to declining levels of consumer activity and increased rewards program expenses in the higher interest rate environment.\n\nOther charges, commissions and fees increased by $188,000, or 73.4%, in the quarter ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the same three month period in 2023, primarily as a result of New York State cumulative mortgage recording tax refunds in the amount of $141,000 and other miscellaneous fees.\n\nThe $125,000, or 127.6%, year-over-year increase in all other (nonrecurring) categories of noninterest income was primarily due to the recognition of a $245,000 refund received from cumulative lessor related pass-through operating expense charges for a leased branch location. This nonrecurring gain was partially offset by a $221,000 decline in either gains recognized on the sale or early redemption of investment securities, which were a loss of $148,000 in the first quarter of 2024 as compared to a gain of $73,000 in the same quarter of the previous year. This reduction in the gains recorded related to the sale or early redemption of investment securities was partially offset by a $108,000 year over year increase in realized gains on marketable equity securities. \n\n**_Noninterest Expense_**\n\nPathfinder Bancorp, Inc. experienced a modest increase in total noninterest expenses, which climbed to $7.7 million in the first quarter of 2024, marking an uptick of $182,000, or 2.4%, compared to the same period last year. This rise was driven primarily by a $146,000, or 3.5%, increase in salaries and employee benefits. The adjustments to salary structures and commissions, particularly tied to insurance and investment services, reflect the Bank's strategic efforts to enhance its competitive edge in the market and address the demands of an inflationary environment with respect to attracting and retaining employees.\n\nThe remainder of the increase in noninterest expenses during the first quarter of 2024, as compared to the first quarter of 2023, totaling $36,000, or 1.0%, was distributed across various categories, reflecting the Bank's ongoing investments in operational efficiency and technology enhancements. These investments are critical to sustaining the Bank's agility and responsiveness to market conditions and customer needs.\n\nPathfinder anticipates further increases in personnel expenses as it continues to fill vacancies and make targeted compensation adjustments. These planned investments in its workforce are key to retaining top talent and ensuring the Bank's personnel are well-equipped to deliver exceptional service. Such strategic staffing enhancements are integral to maintaining Pathfinder Bancorp's competitive position and achieving long-term success in the dynamic banking landscape.\n\nOverall, the Bank's prudent management of noninterest expenses, coupled with strategic investments in its branches and staff, underscores its commitment to operational excellence and robust financial health. As Pathfinder Bancorp continues to expand and refine its operations, these expenditures are expected to yield significant benefits in customer satisfaction and operational efficiency thereby supporting the Bank's broader strategic objectives.\n\nThe following table details the components of noninterest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023:\n\n**Unaudited** | For the three months ended  \n---|---  \n_(In thousands)_ | March 31, 2024 | March 31, 2023 | Change  \nSalaries and employee benefits | $ | 4,329 | $ | 4,183 | $ | 146 | 3.5 | %  \nBuilding and occupancy | 816 | 852 | (36 | ) | -4.2 | %  \nData processing | 528 | 553 | (25 | ) | -4.5 | %  \nProfessional and other services | 562 | 536 | 26 | 4.9 | %  \nAdvertising | 105 | 206 | (101 | ) | -49.0 | %  \nFDIC assessments | 229 | 219 | 10 | 4.6 | %  \nAudits and exams | 170 | 159 | 11 | 6.9 | %  \nInsurance agency expense | 285 | 261 | 24 | 9.2 | %  \nCommunity service activities | 52 | 30 | 22 | 73.3 | %  \nForeclosed real estate expenses | 25 | 14 | 11 | 78.6 | %  \nOther expenses | 605 | 511 | 94 | 18.4 | %  \nTotal noninterest expenses | $ | 7,706 | $ | 7,524 | $ | 182 | 2.4 | %  \n  \n**_Statement of Financial Condition at March 31, 2024_**\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, Pathfinder Bancorp, Inc.'s statement of financial condition reflects total assets of $1.45 billion. This represents a slight decrease from the $1.47 billion recorded at December 31, 2023, a marginal contraction of $12.1 million, or 0.8%. The observed reduction in assets since December 31, 2023 is primarily due to a decrease in total loan balances, which declined from $897.2 million to $891.5 million, representing a decrease of $5.7 million or approximately 0.6%. This contraction in the loan portfolio reflects both normal fluctuations in loan repayments and a strategic recalibration in response to the prevailing economic environment.\n\nAdditionally, interest-earning deposits experienced a significant reduction since December 31, 2023 from $36.4 million to $15.7 million, contributing to the decrease in total cash and cash equivalents, which fell from $48.7 million to $29.2 million. Conversely, the Bank saw growth in its available-for-sale securities from $258.7 million to $279.0 million, at December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, respectively, and an increase in other assets, which grew by $1.9 million in the current quarter.\n\nWith respect to liabilities, total deposits demonstrated strength, growing by $26.0 million or 2.3%, from $1.12 billion at December 31, 2023 to $1.15 billion at March 31, 2024. This growth was supported by an increase in interest-bearing deposits from $949.9 million to $969.7 million and noninterest-bearing deposits, which increased from $170.2 million to $176.4 million. These increases in deposits underscore Pathfinder's strategic emphasis on cultivating a stable and dependable liquidity profile, critical for supporting its lending and operational activities.\n\nShareholders' equity saw a rise of $2.3 million or about 1.9%, increasing from $119.5 million at the end of 2023 to $121.8 million by the end of March 2024. This uptrend is primarily fueled by the Bank's profitable operations, with net income contributing to the increment in retained earnings, which increased from $76.1 million to $77.6 million, net of dividends distributed to shareholders.\n\nAs previously noted, the quarter also saw Pathfinder Bancorp, Inc. continue its growth strategy with the execution of an agreement to acquire an existing branch from another financial institution exiting the market. This branch has a large deposit base and will extend The Bank’s market presence and enhance accessibility for its customers. The strategic addition of this branch is anticipated to foster new customer relationships, deepen community ties, and stimulate future growth in both deposits and loan originations.\n\n**_Asset Quality_**\n\nPathfinder Bancorp, Inc. remains vigilant in its oversight of asset quality, a cornerstone of the Bank’s risk management framework. As of the end of first quarter of 2024, the Bank has observed an improvement in asset quality metrics, indicative of effective credit risk controls and strategic loan portfolio management.\n\nThe Bank reported an increase in the nonperforming loans ratio from 1.92% at the end of December 2023 to 2.20% at the end of March 2024, indicating a modestly deteriorating trend in overall loan portfolio health. This modest decline in asset quality was recognized within the Company’s robust allowance for credit losses to non-performing loans ratio, which was 84.75% at March 31, 2024. The Company’s ACL to non-performing loans ratio at March 31, 2024 remains reflective of Pathfinder Bancorp’s commitment to a conservative and transparent approach to credit risk. This commitment is fundamental to the Bank’s promise to uphold strong asset quality and to safeguard its financial standing against the dynamic backdrop of the current economic environment. This substantial reserve underscores the Bank’s prudent approach to potential credit risks and its capacity to absorb potential loan losses.\n\nManagement continues to proactively monitor and address asset quality, including the close surveillance of nonaccrual loans. The reported ACL as of March 31, 2024, incorporates management’s estimates of future collectability, adjusting for current conditions and forward-looking economic forecasts. The Bank’s strategies, including the ongoing refinement of its credit risk practices, aim to bolster the loan portfolio against future uncertainties.\n\nThe following table summarizes nonaccrual loans by category and status at March 31, 2024:\n\n(In thousands)  \n---  \nLoan Type | Collateral Type | Number of Loans | Loan Balance | Average Loan Balance | Weighted LTV at Origination/ Modification | Status  \n**Secured residential mortgage:**  \nReal Estate | 24 | $ | 1,775 | $ | 74 | 71 | % | Individual loans are under active resolution management by the Bank.  \n**Secured commercial real estate:**  \nPrivate Museum | 1 | 1,357 | 1,357 | 78 | % | The borrower is making interest only and escrow payments. Strategic initiatives are being implemented by the borrower that will provide cash flow for future debt requirements under a modified debt restructure.  \nOffice Space | 1 | 1,682 | 1,682 | 78 | % | The loan is secured by a first mortgage with strong tenancy and a long-term lease. The borrower is seeking outside financing and the Bank is in regular communication with the borrower.  \nRecreation/Golf Course/Marina | 1 | 1,375 | 1,375 | 55 | % | The borrower is in the process of restructuring debt and loan payments for its seasonal business.  \nAll other | 10 | 2,134 | 213 | 130 | % | Individual loans are under active resolution management by the Bank.  \n**Commercial lines of credit:** | 6 | 951 | 159 | (1 | ) | Individual lines are under active resolution management by the Bank.  \n**Commercial and industrial loans:** | 19 | 6,806 | 358 | (1 | ) | Individual loans are under active resolution management by the Bank.  \n**Consumer loans:** | 114 | 3,572 | 31 | (1 | ) | Individual loans are under active resolution management by the Bank.  \n176 | $ | 19,652  \n  \n(1) These loans were originated as unsecured or with minimal collateral.\n\n**_Liquidity_**\n\nPathfinder Bancorp, Inc. has diligently ensured a strong liquidity profile as of March 31, 2024, to meet its ongoing financial obligations. The Bank's liquidity management, as evaluated by its cash reserves and operational cash flows from loan repayments and investment securities, remains robust and is effectively managed by the institution's leadership.\n\nIn line with this strong liquidity stance, the Bank reported a modest rise in its nonbrokered deposit balances, which increased by $313,900 or 0.4%, from $876.8 million to $877.1 million, at December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, respectively. This increase underscores the success of the Bank’s strategic initiatives in deposit gathering, including targeted marketing campaigns and customer engagement programs aimed at deepening banking relationships and enhancing deposit stability.\n\nThe Bank continues to fortify its liquidity position through established alliances, including its longstanding partnership with the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (\"FHLB-NY\"). By the end of the current quarter, Pathfinder Bancorp had an available additional funding capacity of $58.7 million with the FHLB-NY, which complements its liquidity reserves. Moreover, the Bank maintains additional unused credit lines totaling $29.4 million, which provide a buffer for additional funding needs. These facilities, including access to the Federal Reserve’s Discount Window, are part of a comprehensive liquidity strategy that ensures flexibility and readiness to respond to any funding requirements.\n\nPathfinder Bancorp's vigilant oversight extends to continuous liquidity monitoring, ensuring that it is positioned to withstand financial market fluctuations. The Bank's deposit base remained demonstrably stable at $1.15 billion as of March 31, 2024. Out of this amount, a portion above the FDIC insurance limits is meticulously managed, with $72.7 million safeguarded by a reciprocal deposit program and $140.5 million in municipal deposits fully collateralized by high-quality securities at March 31, 2024. This leaves the remaining fraction of $126.9 million, or 11.1%, of total deposits, as uninsured. Pathfinder Bancorp’s robust liquidity management strategies and comprehensive risk mitigation measures demonstrate the Bank’s capacity to maintain liquidity and financial resilience, ensuring operational continuity and the continuing growth of stakeholder confidence.\n\n**_Cash Dividend Declared_**\n\nOn April 1, 2024, Pathfinder Bancorp, Inc. proudly declared its quarterly cash dividend, a testament to the Company’s enduring commitment to shareholder returns within a framework of risk management and financial stability. Consistent with the Company’s tradition of sharing success, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.10 per share for holders of both voting common and non-voting common stock reflective of the Company’s solid performance and optimistic outlook.\n\nIn addition, this dividend also extends to the notional shares of the Company's warrants, ensuring comprehensive inclusivity of all stakeholders in the Company's distribution of profits. Shareholders registered by April 19, 2024, will be eligible for the dividend, which is scheduled for disbursement on May 10, 2024. This distribution aligns with Pathfinder Bancorp, Inc.’s philosophy of consistent and reliable delivery of shareholder value.\n\nEvaluating the Company's market performance, the closing stock price as of March 31, 2024, stood at $12.38 per share. This positions the dividend yield at an attractive 3.2%, signifying a compelling investment proposition compared to industry benchmarks. The annualized dividend payout ratio, based on the current dividend, is calculated to be 29.3%, underscoring the Board’s strategic approach to capital allocation, shareholder returns and the preservation of a fortified balance sheet.\n\nPathfinder Bancorp, Inc. continues to navigate through economic cycles with a prudent and disciplined approach, ensuring that its capital distribution strategy is well-calibrated to support sustained growth and long-term shareholder wealth creation.\n\n**_About Pathfinder Bancorp, Inc._**\n\nPathfinder Bank is a New York State chartered commercial Bank headquartered in Oswego, whose deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

Announces First Quarter 2024 Net Income of $2.1 Million\n\nApril 29, 2024\n\n[PDF Version](/node/9111/pdf)\n\n**Strategic Growth and Prudent Expense Management Shape Bank Performance Despite Economic Challenges**\n\nOSWEGO, N.Y., April 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pathfinder Bancorp, Inc. (“Company”) (NASDAQ: PBHC), the holding company for Pathfinder Bank (“Bank”), announced first quarter 2024 net income available to common shareholders of $2.1 million, or $0.34 per basic and diluted share, compared to $2.6 million, or $0.43 per basic and diluted share, for the first quarter of 2023. The Company's total revenue, which is comprised of net interest income, before provision for credit losses, and total noninterest income, for the first quarter of 2024 was $11.1 million, a decrease of $423,000, or 3.7%, when compared to the same quarter in 2023.\n\n**Performance Highlights for Three Months Ended March 31, 2024: **\n\n  * The Bank's Board of Directors announced an 11.1% increase in its quarterly dividend to $0.10 per share.\n  * Pathfinder Bancorp, Inc. reported an increase in interest and dividend income of 23.7% to $18.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, up from $15.0 million in the same period of 2023.\n  * Total interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024, increased to $9.2 million, up 81.5% from $5.1 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n  * Net interest income after provision for credit losses totaled $8.7 million for the quarter, a decrease from the $9.3 million after provision reported for the corresponding quarter of 2023.\n  * Net interest margin for the quarter decreased to 2.75%, a 27 basis points change from 3.02% reported in the same prior year quarter.\n  * Noninterest income for the quarter reached $1.7 million and reflected modest growth from $1.6 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n  * Noninterest expenses for the quarter totaled $7.7 million, a slight increase from $7.5 million in the same period last year.\n  * The Company’s net income for the quarter decreased to $2.1 million from the $2.6 million reported in the same period of 2023.\n  * Total loans decreased to $891.5 million at the end of the first quarter of 2024, down $18.6 million, or 2.0%, from March 31, 2023, and $5.7 million or 0.6% from December 31, 2023.\n\n\n\nPathfinder Bancorp, Inc. entered the first quarter of 2024 with a foundation grounded in effective risk management and guided by its measured plans for continued strategic growth. In a financial landscape marked by elevated interest rates and frequent shifts in economic forecasts, the Bank has adeptly navigated these challenges, reinforcing its commitment to enhancing shareholder value. James A. Dowd, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented: \"Leveraging proactive financial management and strategic foresight, we successfully navigated the complexities of this quarter, affirming our path toward continued progress.\"\n\nDowd noted that the Treasury yield curve remained inverted (short term interest rates higher than long term interest rates) for the entirety of the first quarter of 2024, as it was in all of 2023. The Treasury yield curve was inverted by an average of 0.37% for the quarter between the 2-year and 5-year tenors. He further stated that the average effective Fed funds rate of 5.33% remained well above the prevailing rates of all term Treasury rates throughout the quarter creating another significant element of yield curve inversion. “This has been a difficult environment for the vast majority of depository institutions. Our adept handling of fluctuating interest rates demonstrates the benefits of our market insights and our risk management focus,” added Dowd.\n\n“The Company’s financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, were notably strong, considering this economic backdrop, displaying a significant 23.7% increase in interest and dividend income to $18.6 million, up from $15.0 million the previous year. This growth, fueled by a diverse portfolio of interest-earning assets, underscores our balance sheet’s built-in resilience and our capacity to generate profitability within a broad range of interest rate environments. Despite interest expenses nearly doubling to $9.2 million from $5.1 million, reflecting the industry’s broader trend of rising funding costs, our net interest income, before provisions for credit losses remained relatively stable at $9.4 million.”\n\nDowd stated that the relatively modest decline in net income to $2.1 million from $2.6 million the previous year underscores the effectiveness of the Company’s strategic initiatives and comprehensive risk management protocols, including a prudent provision for credit losses of $726,000. Dowd elaborated on the Bank's asset quality, noting a modest deterioration in nonperforming loans to period-end loans at 2.20%, which he characterized as transitory, that has been conservatively accounted for within in the Company’s allowance for credit losses to period-end loans, which stand at 1.87%. \"These figures reflect our rigorous management of the loan portfolio and our commitment to stringent risk management practices,\" he remarked.\n\nDespite quarter-over-quarter decreases in key profitability metrics - return on average assets at 0.59% and return on average common equity at 7.01%, along with a net interest margin of 2.75%, the Bank continues to demonstrate a focused commitment to long-term financial health and responsible management, as Dowd highlighted. Dowd further stated that \"Our balance sheet reflects the Bank's financial strength, with total assets reaching $1.45 billion and shareholders' equity increasing to $121.8 million. Tangible book value per common share grew to $19.21, further emphasizing our ongoing success in increasing that measure of underlying shareholder value.\"\n\nLooking forward, Dowd expressed optimism, \"We remain strategically positioned at the forefront of emerging opportunities within our markets in 2024 and beyond, and are focused on maintaining superior asset quality, making sound credit decisions, and responding to our customers' evolving needs. Although direct comparisons year-over-year should be viewed in the context of current market conditions, our core strengths and the adaptability of our dedicated team prepare us to confront immediate challenges and seize the opportunities on the horizon.\" He highlighted recent strategic initiatives, including a significant branch acquisition announced in the first quarter of 2024, and discussed below, that underscores the Company’s commitment to excellence in all facets of our operations. “As Central New York undergoes what we believe will be a very impressive economic revitalization, Pathfinder is primed to leverage its significant regional investments,” Dowd stated.\n\n“Moreover, our operational efficiency is evident in the stable management of noninterest expenses, highlighting our cost control measures and investments in technological solutions poised to enhance future operational efficiency. Additionally, the competitive landscape, with pressures from non-local deposit gathering entities, challenges us to maintain deposit levels, prioritizing liquidity to support a base for continued growth and service enhancement.”\n\n“Pathfinder’s forward-looking statements are grounded in recent strategic actions, most notably, the announced signing of a purchase and assumption agreement for a branch in East Syracuse. The branch will add nearly $200 million in established deposits and provide an outstanding service location for the Bank’s new and existing customers. This acquired branch is viewed as being ideally located with respect to the Bank’s current Syracuse branch network and will not only complement the Bank’s existing geographic footprint but also tap into high-potential market areas. Subject to regulatory approval, associated system conversion timelines, and satisfaction of certain customary closing conditions, the purchase is expected to be completed in the third quarter 2024. This branch expansion, coupled with our strong capital position, evidenced by an 11.1% increase in our declared quarterly dividend, also announced in this quarter, underscores Pathfinder’s commitment to delivering value to its shareholders and enhancing its longer term market competitiveness.”\n\n\"Looking ahead, the Bank’s management and Board of Directors maintain a positive outlook, bolstered by recent strategic successes like the pending East Syracuse branch acquisition and an increasingly robust presence in the swiftly evolving Central New York economic landscape. The Bank's leadership remains committed to navigating the ongoing economic challenges while seizing the opportunities for growth and profitability that will undoubtedly arise. With careful management of assets, liabilities, and a steady approach to cost control, Pathfinder Bancorp, Inc. is poised to continue its trajectory of responsible growth and shareholder value enhancement,” Mr. Dowd concluded.\n\n**_Income Statement for the Quarter Ended March 31, 2024_**\n\nNet income for the quarter was $2.1 million, marking a decline from the $2.6 million reported in the first quarter of the previous year. This represented a decrease of $479,000 or approximately 18.4%. Net interest income before the provision for credit losses saw a decrease to $9.4 million, down by 5.7% from the $10.0 million reported in the first quarter of 2023. The decrease in net interest income was largely due to an 81.5% increase in interest expenses, totaling $9.2 million, which considerably exceeded the previous year's $5.1 million. Partially offsetting the sharp increase in interest expenses, was a 23.7% growth in interest and dividend income which reached $18.6 million in the first quarter of 2024, up from $15.0 million in the first quarter of 2023, due in large part to a diversified and performing portfolio of loans and securities.\n\nThe provision for credit losses for the quarter stood marginally higher at $726,000 compared to $692,000 in the prior year, mirroring the Bank's cautious yet assertive strategy in managing its credit exposure. This provision resulted in net interest income after provision for credit losses of $8.7 million, slightly lower than the $9.3 million recorded for the same period in the previous year. \n\nNoninterest income experienced modest growth, rising to $1.7 million from $1.6 million, which represents a 9.1% increase. This uptick was propelled by higher service charges on deposit accounts, net realized gains on marketable equity securities, and other operating income. This increase was partially offset by a reduction in debit card interchange fees and losses on sales and redemption of investment securities compared to the previous year. Total revenues, after considering the provision for credit losses, were reported at $10.4 million, reflecting a modest decline from $10.9 million in the prior year's first quarter.\n\nNoninterest expense witnessed a slight escalation to $7.7 million, which is an increase of 2.4% over the first quarter of 2023. The higher expenses were in line with generally reported inflationary trends, especially in the labor markets. In addition, the Bank continued to manage investments in strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing its market reach and operational efficiency. The Bank remains steadfast in its commitment to diligently evaluate strategic solutions aimed at reducing noninterest expenses in upcoming quarters.\n\nAs the quarter closed, key profitability ratios such as the return on average assets were calculated at 0.59%, and the return on average common equity was at 7.01%, both reflecting the competitive and operational pressures of the period. These figures underscored a modest compression from the prior year's ratios, primarily attributable to the compressed net interest margins in a highly competitive deposits environment.\n\n**_Components of Net Interest Income_**\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2024 Pathfinder Bancorp, Inc. navigated through a financial environment with mixed outcomes reflected in its net interest income components. The Company's net interest income before provision for credit losses experienced a downturn and contracted by $568,000, or 5.7%, to $9.4 million when compared with the corresponding period in 2023.\n\nThe interest and dividend income for the quarter stood at $18.6 million, a considerable increase of $3.6 million, or 23.7%, from the $15.0 million reported in the first quarter of 2023. This increase was multifaceted; a $1.6 million increase was noted in loan interest income, supplemented by a $1.9 million increase in interest income from taxable and tax-exempt securities. Contributing to these figures was a 74 basis points increase in the average yield of the loan portfolio, only slightly offset by a marginal decline of $3.9 million in the average balance of outstanding loans. In the quarter ended March 31, 2024, the yields on taxable investment securities increased by 117 basis points, accompanied by a $62.7 million increase in their average balance, when compared to the same quarter in 2023.\n\nHowever, these positive trends were counterbalanced by a pronounced increase in total interest expense, which increased to $9.2 million, a steep increase of 81.5% from the $5.1 million seen in the first quarter of the preceding year. This emanated primarily from an elevated average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, which increased by 138 basis points, and was further compounded by a $50.4 million augmentation in the average balance of such liabilities. This upsurge in interest expenses was largely attributed to the intensified cost of deposits, fueled by escalating competition in the rising interest rate environment. A notable change in the deposit composition was observed with a $69.4 million increase in average time deposit balances, in conjunction with a 163 basis points increase in the paid interest rates on those deposits. Many deposit customers, while still remaining with the Bank, have elected to move significant portions of their deposits to time deposits as a component of their personal financial management strategies. The Bank’s internal tracking indicated that approximately 15.3% of the Bank’s time deposit growth for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 has been the result of an internal shift from nonmaturity deposits to time deposits when compared to the same period in 2023. \n\nThe net result was a net interest margin of 2.75% for the quarter, a decline of 27 basis points from the net interest margin of 3.02% in the first quarter of 2023. The Bank's management team has been actively adjusting the institution's asset and liability management strategies to uphold the net interest margin in a challenging and evolving rate landscape.\n\n**_Provision for Credit Losses_**\n\nPathfinder Bancorp, Inc. demonstrated its cautious and prudent risk management philosophy, and reported a provision for credit losses of $726,000 for the first quarter of 2024. This figure represents a slight increase of $34,000, or 4.9%, from the $692,000 provision for credit losses recorded in the same quarter of the previous year. Such an increment is indicative of the Bank’s vigilant approach to the current economic conditions and its commitment to conservative financial practices.\n\nThe Bank's management continues to diligently monitor credit portfolios, particularly those considered sensitive to prevailing economic stressors. The Bank steadfastly applies conservative loan classification and reserve building methodologies, which are deeply ingrained in its operational framework. This steadfast approach is deemed essential in maintaining the integrity of the loan portfolio and in safeguarding the Bank’s long-term financial stability.\n\n**_Noninterest Income_**\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Pathfinder Bancorp, Inc. demonstrated a notable advancement in its financial strategy, as evidenced by the growth in noninterest income to $1.7 million. This represents an increase of 9.1% over the same quarter last year, underscoring a successful period of revenue diversification and enhancement of customer-centric services. The surge in service charges on deposit accounts is a clear indication of the Bank’s expanding customer engagement and the effective adoption of fee-based products.\n\nEnhancements to the Bank’s noninterest income streams, which exclude the less predictable components such as market-driven gains or losses on securities, point to Pathfinder’s commitment to fortifying its revenue base against economic fluctuations. A deepened focus on areas such as wealth management, payment processing services, and treasury management has been central to this growth. Notably, other operating income has seen a healthy increase, likely bolstered by the Bank’s strategic initiatives in technological innovation and expanded service offerings.\n\nThis steady growth in noninterest income highlights the efficacy of the Bank's strategies in an environment where interest-based revenue can be uncertain. Pathfinder Bancorp's deliberate emphasis on broadening its income-generating activities demonstrates foresight and adaptability, ensuring that it can continue to thrive even amidst shifting financial tides.\n\nLooking to the future, the Bank is well-positioned to continue this trajectory, with plans to invest further in areas that promise robust fee income potential. As Pathfinder Bancorp harnesses opportunities in digital banking, asset management, and other emergent financial services, it maintains a solid foundation to support sustainable growth. The Bank is resolute in its commitment to leveraging its strengths in these areas to continue providing value to its shareholders and enhancing its market competitiveness.\n\nThe increased noninterest income reflects not just the Bank's ability to adapt to changing economic landscapes, but also its proactive approach in seeking out and capitalizing on new revenue opportunities. As the Bank moves forward with its growth strategy, noninterest income is anticipated to play an increasingly vital role in maintaining a well-balanced and resilient financial profile.\n\nThe following table details the components of noninterest income for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023:\n\nFor the three months ended,  \n---  \n_(In thousands)_ | March 31, 2024 | March 31, 2023 | Change  \nService charges on deposit accounts | $ | 309 | $ | 267 | $ | 42 | 15.7 | %  \nEarnings and gain on bank owned life insurance | 157 | 158 | (1 | ) | -0.6 | %  \nLoan servicing fees | 88 | 72 | 16 | 22.2 | %  \nDebit card interchange fees | 119 | 321 | (202 | ) | -62.9 | %  \nInsurance agency revenue | 397 | 420 | (23 | ) | -5.5 | %  \nOther charges, commissions and fees | 444 | 256 | 188 | 73.4 | %  \nNoninterest income before gains | 1,514 | 1,494 | 20 | 1.3 | %  \n(Losses) gains on sales and redemptions of investment securities | (148 | ) | 73 | (221 | ) | -302.7 | %  \nGain on sales of loans and foreclosed real estate | 18 | 25 | (7 | ) | -28.0 | %  \nNon-recurring gain on lease renegotiations | 245 | - | 245 | 100%+  \nGains on marketable equity securities | 108 | - | 108 | 100%+  \nTotal noninterest income | $ | 1,737 | $ | 1,592 | $ | 145 | 9.1 | %  \n  \nThe aggregate increase of $145,000, or 9.1%, in noninterest income during the quarter ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the same quarter in 2023, was the result of a $20,000, or 1.3%, net increase in recurring noninterest income, supplemented by a $125,000 aggregate increase in all other categories of noninterest income. Within the category of recurring noninterest income, year over year revenues increased $222,000, or 18.9%, excluding debit interchange fees. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in net debit card interchange fees of $202,000, or 62.9%. Debit card interchange income declined in the first quarter of 2024, as compared to the same quarter in 2023, as a result of reduced gross interchange revenues related to declining levels of consumer activity and increased rewards program expenses in the higher interest rate environment.\n\nOther charges, commissions and fees increased by $188,000, or 73.4%, in the quarter ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the same three month period in 2023, primarily as a result of New York State cumulative mortgage recording tax refunds in the amount of $141,000 and other miscellaneous fees.\n\nThe $125,000, or 127.6%, year-over-year increase in all other (nonrecurring) categories of noninterest income was primarily due to the recognition of a $245,000 refund received from cumulative lessor related pass-through operating expense charges for a leased branch location. This nonrecurring gain was partially offset by a $221,000 decline in either gains recognized on the sale or early redemption of investment securities, which were a loss of $148,000 in the first quarter of 2024 as compared to a gain of $73,000 in the same quarter of the previous year. This reduction in the gains recorded related to the sale or early redemption of investment securities was partially offset by a $108,000 year over year increase in realized gains on marketable equity securities. \n\n**_Noninterest Expense_**\n\nPathfinder Bancorp, Inc. experienced a modest increase in total noninterest expenses, which climbed to $7.7 million in the first quarter of 2024, marking an uptick of $182,000, or 2.4%, compared to the same period last year. This rise was driven primarily by a $146,000, or 3.5%, increase in salaries and employee benefits. The adjustments to salary structures and commissions, particularly tied to insurance and investment services, reflect the Bank's strategic efforts to enhance its competitive edge in the market and address the demands of an inflationary environment with respect to attracting and retaining employees.\n\nThe remainder of the increase in noninterest expenses during the first quarter of 2024, as compared to the first quarter of 2023, totaling $36,000, or 1.0%, was distributed across various categories, reflecting the Bank's ongoing investments in operational efficiency and technology enhancements. These investments are critical to sustaining the Bank's agility and responsiveness to market conditions and customer needs.\n\nPathfinder anticipates further increases in personnel expenses as it continues to fill vacancies and make targeted compensation adjustments. These planned investments in its workforce are key to retaining top talent and ensuring the Bank's personnel are well-equipped to deliver exceptional service. Such strategic staffing enhancements are integral to maintaining Pathfinder Bancorp's competitive position and achieving long-term success in the dynamic banking landscape.\n\nOverall, the Bank's prudent management of noninterest expenses, coupled with strategic investments in its branches and staff, underscores its commitment to operational excellence and robust financial health. As Pathfinder Bancorp continues to expand and refine its operations, these expenditures are expected to yield significant benefits in customer satisfaction and operational efficiency thereby supporting the Bank's broader strategic objectives.\n\nThe following table details the components of noninterest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023:\n\n**Unaudited** | For the three months ended  \n---|---  \n_(In thousands)_ | March 31, 2024 | March 31, 2023 | Change  \nSalaries and employee benefits | $ | 4,329 | $ | 4,183 | $ | 146 | 3.5 | %  \nBuilding and occupancy | 816 | 852 | (36 | ) | -4.2 | %  \nData processing | 528 | 553 | (25 | ) | -4.5 | %  \nProfessional and other services | 562 | 536 | 26 | 4.9 | %  \nAdvertising | 105 | 206 | (101 | ) | -49.0 | %  \nFDIC assessments | 229 | 219 | 10 | 4.6 | %  \nAudits and exams | 170 | 159 | 11 | 6.9 | %  \nInsurance agency expense | 285 | 261 | 24 | 9.2 | %  \nCommunity service activities | 52 | 30 | 22 | 73.3 | %  \nForeclosed real estate expenses | 25 | 14 | 11 | 78.6 | %  \nOther expenses | 605 | 511 | 94 | 18.4 | %  \nTotal noninterest expenses | $ | 7,706 | $ | 7,524 | $ | 182 | 2.4 | %  \n  \n**_Statement of Financial Condition at March 31, 2024_**\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, Pathfinder Bancorp, Inc.'s statement of financial condition reflects total assets of $1.45 billion. This represents a slight decrease from the $1.47 billion recorded at December 31, 2023, a marginal contraction of $12.1 million, or 0.8%. The observed reduction in assets since December 31, 2023 is primarily due to a decrease in total loan balances, which declined from $897.2 million to $891.5 million, representing a decrease of $5.7 million or approximately 0.6%. This contraction in the loan portfolio reflects both normal fluctuations in loan repayments and a strategic recalibration in response to the prevailing economic environment.\n\nAdditionally, interest-earning deposits experienced a significant reduction since December 31, 2023 from $36.4 million to $15.7 million, contributing to the decrease in total cash and cash equivalents, which fell from $48.7 million to $29.2 million. Conversely, the Bank saw growth in its available-for-sale securities from $258.7 million to $279.0 million, at December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, respectively, and an increase in other assets, which grew by $1.9 million in the current quarter.\n\nWith respect to liabilities, total deposits demonstrated strength, growing by $26.0 million or 2.3%, from $1.12 billion at December 31, 2023 to $1.15 billion at March 31, 2024. This growth was supported by an increase in interest-bearing deposits from $949.9 million to $969.7 million and noninterest-bearing deposits, which increased from $170.2 million to $176.4 million. These increases in deposits underscore Pathfinder's strategic emphasis on cultivating a stable and dependable liquidity profile, critical for supporting its lending and operational activities.\n\nShareholders' equity saw a rise of $2.3 million or about 1.9%, increasing from $119.5 million at the end of 2023 to $121.8 million by the end of March 2024. This uptrend is primarily fueled by the Bank's profitable operations, with net income contributing to the increment in retained earnings, which increased from $76.1 million to $77.6 million, net of dividends distributed to shareholders.\n\nAs previously noted, the quarter also saw Pathfinder Bancorp, Inc. continue its growth strategy with the execution of an agreement to acquire an existing branch from another financial institution exiting the market. This branch has a large deposit base and will extend The Bank’s market presence and enhance accessibility for its customers. The strategic addition of this branch is anticipated to foster new customer relationships, deepen community ties, and stimulate future growth in both deposits and loan originations.\n\n**_Asset Quality_**\n\nPathfinder Bancorp, Inc. remains vigilant in its oversight of asset quality, a cornerstone of the Bank’s risk management framework. As of the end of first quarter of 2024, the Bank has observed an improvement in asset quality metrics, indicative of effective credit risk controls and strategic loan portfolio management.\n\nThe Bank reported an increase in the nonperforming loans ratio from 1.92% at the end of December 2023 to 2.20% at the end of March 2024, indicating a modestly deteriorating trend in overall loan portfolio health. This modest decline in asset quality was recognized within the Company’s robust allowance for credit losses to non-performing loans ratio, which was 84.75% at March 31, 2024. The Company’s ACL to non-performing loans ratio at March 31, 2024 remains reflective of Pathfinder Bancorp’s commitment to a conservative and transparent approach to credit risk. This commitment is fundamental to the Bank’s promise to uphold strong asset quality and to safeguard its financial standing against the dynamic backdrop of the current economic environment. This substantial reserve underscores the Bank’s prudent approach to potential credit risks and its capacity to absorb potential loan losses.\n\nManagement continues to proactively monitor and address asset quality, including the close surveillance of nonaccrual loans. The reported ACL as of March 31, 2024, incorporates management’s estimates of future collectability, adjusting for current conditions and forward-looking economic forecasts. The Bank’s strategies, including the ongoing refinement of its credit risk practices, aim to bolster the loan portfolio against future uncertainties.\n\nThe following table summarizes nonaccrual loans by category and status at March 31, 2024:\n\n(In thousands)  \n---  \nLoan Type | Collateral Type | Number of Loans | Loan Balance | Average Loan Balance | Weighted LTV at Origination/ Modification | Status  \n**Secured residential mortgage:**  \nReal Estate | 24 | $ | 1,775 | $ | 74 | 71 | % | Individual loans are under active resolution management by the Bank.  \n**Secured commercial real estate:**  \nPrivate Museum | 1 | 1,357 | 1,357 | 78 | % | The borrower is making interest only and escrow payments. Strategic initiatives are being implemented by the borrower that will provide cash flow for future debt requirements under a modified debt restructure.  \nOffice Space | 1 | 1,682 | 1,682 | 78 | % | The loan is secured by a first mortgage with strong tenancy and a long-term lease. The borrower is seeking outside financing and the Bank is in regular communication with the borrower.  \nRecreation/Golf Course/Marina | 1 | 1,375 | 1,375 | 55 | % | The borrower is in the process of restructuring debt and loan payments for its seasonal business.  \nAll other | 10 | 2,134 | 213 | 130 | % | Individual loans are under active resolution management by the Bank.  \n**Commercial lines of credit:** | 6 | 951 | 159 | (1 | ) | Individual lines are under active resolution management by the Bank.  \n**Commercial and industrial loans:** | 19 | 6,806 | 358 | (1 | ) | Individual loans are under active resolution management by the Bank.  \n**Consumer loans:** | 114 | 3,572 | 31 | (1 | ) | Individual loans are under active resolution management by the Bank.  \n176 | $ | 19,652  \n  \n(1) These loans were originated as unsecured or with minimal collateral.\n\n**_Liquidity_**\n\nPathfinder Bancorp, Inc. has diligently ensured a strong liquidity profile as of March 31, 2024, to meet its ongoing financial obligations. The Bank's liquidity management, as evaluated by its cash reserves and operational cash flows from loan repayments and investment securities, remains robust and is effectively managed by the institution's leadership.\n\nIn line with this strong liquidity stance, the Bank reported a modest rise in its nonbrokered deposit balances, which increased by $313,900 or 0.4%, from $876.8 million to $877.1 million, at December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, respectively. This increase underscores the success of the Bank’s strategic initiatives in deposit gathering, including targeted marketing campaigns and customer engagement programs aimed at deepening banking relationships and enhancing deposit stability.\n\nThe Bank continues to fortify its liquidity position through established alliances, including its longstanding partnership with the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (\"FHLB-NY\"). By the end of the current quarter, Pathfinder Bancorp had an available additional funding capacity of $58.7 million with the FHLB-NY, which complements its liquidity reserves. Moreover, the Bank maintains additional unused credit lines totaling $29.4 million, which provide a buffer for additional funding needs. These facilities, including access to the Federal Reserve’s Discount Window, are part of a comprehensive liquidity strategy that ensures flexibility and readiness to respond to any funding requirements.\n\nPathfinder Bancorp's vigilant oversight extends to continuous liquidity monitoring, ensuring that it is positioned to withstand financial market fluctuations. The Bank's deposit base remained demonstrably stable at $1.15 billion as of March 31, 2024. Out of this amount, a portion above the FDIC insurance limits is meticulously managed, with $72.7 million safeguarded by a reciprocal deposit program and $140.5 million in municipal deposits fully collateralized by high-quality securities at March 31, 2024. This leaves the remaining fraction of $126.9 million, or 11.1%, of total deposits, as uninsured. Pathfinder Bancorp’s robust liquidity management strategies and comprehensive risk mitigation measures demonstrate the Bank’s capacity to maintain liquidity and financial resilience, ensuring operational continuity and the continuing growth of stakeholder confidence.\n\n**_Cash Dividend Declared_**\n\nOn April 1, 2024, Pathfinder Bancorp, Inc. proudly declared its quarterly cash dividend, a testament to the Company’s enduring commitment to shareholder returns within a framework of risk management and financial stability. Consistent with the Company’s tradition of sharing success, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.10 per share for holders of both voting common and non-voting common stock reflective of the Company’s solid performance and optimistic outlook.\n\nIn addition, this dividend also extends to the notional shares of the Company's warrants, ensuring comprehensive inclusivity of all stakeholders in the Company's distribution of profits. Shareholders registered by April 19, 2024, will be eligible for the dividend, which is scheduled for disbursement on May 10, 2024. This distribution aligns with Pathfinder Bancorp, Inc.’s philosophy of consistent and reliable delivery of shareholder value.\n\nEvaluating the Company's market performance, the closing stock price as of March 31, 2024, stood at $12.38 per share. This positions the dividend yield at an attractive 3.2%, signifying a compelling investment proposition compared to industry benchmarks. The annualized dividend payout ratio, based on the current dividend, is calculated to be 29.3%, underscoring the Board’s strategic approach to capital allocation, shareholder returns and the preservation of a fortified balance sheet.\n\nPathfinder Bancorp, Inc. continues to navigate through economic cycles with a prudent and disciplined approach, ensuring that its capital distribution strategy is well-calibrated to support sustained growth and long-term shareholder wealth creation.\n\n**_About Pathfinder Bancorp, Inc._**\n\nPathfinder Bank is a New York State chartered commercial Bank headquartered in Oswego, whose deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
