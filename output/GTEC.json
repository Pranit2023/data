This includes launching our game changing all electric vehicle, model H65L, which was the largest electric wheel loader available in North America at launch. As with all HEVI products, customers can expect the same reliable performance they demand with fewer costs and zero emissions. Our focus on delivering maximum productivity with minimal environmental impact is resonating with customers. We expect that as the broader economy continues to rebound and demand for our electric vehicles will increase further. We are confident in our outlook for the coming quarters based on discussions with customers, our backlog of orders and the tailwinds benefiting the Company from supportive regulatory and subsidy.\"\n\nJing Jin, Chief Financial Officer of Greenland, commented, \"For the first nine months of 2024, we drove operating expenses down 15.6% and net income up 75.3% compared to the first nine months of 2023, all with a corresponding 4.4% decrease in revenue over the same period. This surge in profitability is a testament to the durability of our business model and our unwavering focus on driving costs down across our operations and profits up. We have emerged from a challenging period in global business in a stronger position, with a healthy balance sheet to support our growth strategy, as we continue to prioritize building shareholder value.\"\n\n**Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\nGreenland's revenue was approximately $64.57 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease of approximately $2.99 million, or 4.4%, as compared to that of approximately $67.56 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in revenue was primarily a result of the decrease of approximately $3.60 million in the Company's sales volume of transmission products for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. On an Renminbi (\"RMB\") basis, our revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by approximately 2.2% as compared to that for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nGreenland's cost of goods sold consists primarily of material costs, freight charges, purchasing and receiving costs, inspection costs, internal transfer costs, wages, employee compensation, amortization, depreciation and related costs, which are directly attributable to the Company's manufacturing activities. The total cost of goods sold was approximately $47.19 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease by approximately $1.65 million, or 3.4%, as compared to that of approximately $48.84 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nGreenland's gross profit was approximately $17.39 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease by approximately $1.33 million, or 7.1%, as compared to that of approximately $18.72 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Greenland's gross margins were approximately 26.9% and 27.7%, respectively. The decrease in gross profit in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to a decrease in our sales volume.\n\nTotal operating expenses were $8.55 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 15.6% from $10.13 million in the first nine months of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower advertising and marketing expenses, shipping fees, staffing costs, general and administrative expenses, and research and development expenses.\n\nIncome from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately $8.84 million, representing an increase of approximately $0.25 million, as compared to that of approximately $8.59 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nNet income was approximately $9.80 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, representing an increase of approximately $4.21 million, as compared to that of approximately $5.59 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net income per basic and diluted share was $0.48 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, representing an increase of 118.2%, as compared to $0.22 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nCash equivalents refers to all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturity of three months or less. As of September 30, 2024, Greenland had approximately $17.63 million of cash and cash equivalents, representing a decrease of approximately $5.35 million, or 23.27%, as compared to approximately $22.98 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease of cash and cash equivalents was mainly due to a decrease in short-term bank loans and notes payable, as compared to that as of December 31, 2023.\n\nRestricted cash represents the amount held by a bank as security for bank acceptance notes and therefore is not available for use until the bank acceptance notes are fulfilled or expired, which typically takes less than twelve months. As of September 30, 2024, Greenland had approximately $3.09 million of restricted cash, representing a decrease of approximately $2.12 million, or 40.64%, as compared to that of approximately $5.21 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease of restricted cash was due to a decrease of notes payable.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company's PRC subsidiary, Zhejiang Zhongchai Machinery Co. Ltd., paid off approximately $8.56 million in bank loans, and approximately $0.69 million associated with loans to third parties, while maintaining $17.63 million cash on hand. The Company plans to maintain the current debt structure and rely on governmentally supported loans with lower costs, if necessary.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, Greenland had approximately $20.27 million of accounts receivables, an increase of approximately $3.79 million, or 22.97%, as compared to approximately $16.48 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase in accounts receivables was due to the increase in our sales volume and our slowed-down efforts in receivables collections.\n\n**3Q 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\nGreenland's revenue was approximately $18.83 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease of approximately $3.01 million, or 13.8%, as compared to that of approximately $21.84 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in revenue was primarily a result of the decrease of approximately $2.88 million in the Company's sales volume of transmission products for the three months ended September 30, 2024. On an RMB basis, our revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by approximately 14.9% as compared to that for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nGreenland's cost of goods sold consists primarily of material costs, freight charges, purchasing and receiving costs, inspection costs, internal transfer costs, wages, employee compensation, amortization, depreciation and related costs, which are directly attributable to the Company's manufacturing activities. The write down of inventory using the net realizable value impairment test is also recorded in cost of goods sold. The total cost of goods sold was approximately $13.87 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease by approximately $1.70 million, or 10.9%, as compared to that of approximately $15.57 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Cost of goods sold decreased due to the decrease in our sales volume.\n\nGreenland's gross profit was approximately $4.97 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease by approximately $1.30 million, or 20.8%, as compared to that of approximately $6.27 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Greenland's gross margin were approximately 26.4% and 28.7%, respectively. The decrease in gross profit in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the decrease in our sales volume.\n\nTotal operating expenses were $2.04 million, a decrease of 41% from $3.46 million in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower advertising and marketing expenses, shipping fees, staffing costs, general and administrative expenses, and research and development expenses.\n\nIncome from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately $2.93 million, representing an increase of approximately $0.12 million, as compared to that of approximately $2.81 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nNet income was approximately $0.36 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, representing an increase of approximately $0.17 million, as compared to that of approximately $0.19 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net loss per basic and diluted share was $0.05 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, representing a 29% improvement, as compared to a net loss of $0.07 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n**About Greenland Technologies Holding Corporation**\n\nGreenland Technologies Holding Corporation (Nasdaq: GTEC) is a developer and a manufacturer of drivetrain systems for material handling machineries and electric vehicles, as well as electric industrial vehicles.

(\"HEVI\" or the \"Company\"), a manufacturer of all-electric heavy equipment, today unveiled its game changing all electric vehicle, model H65L. With a nearly 50,000 pound operating weight, HEVI's new flagship H65L all electric wheel loader is the largest electric wheel loader available in North America today. As with all HEVI products, customers can expect the same reliable performance they demand with fewer costs and zero emissions, as the H65L all electric loader delivers maximum productivity with minimal environmental impact.\n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/Greenland Technologies Holding Corporation\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2393838/HEVI_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2393838/HEVI_Logo.html)\n\nHEVI's H65L boasts up to nine hours of continuous operation, tailored to offer full-shift uptime based on specific application and tasks. Equally important, HEVI's H65L was designed to charge significantly faster, with a dynamic CCS1 charging port that enhances the SAE J1772 connector by integrating an original AC plug with a DC power option. Its state-of-the-art on-board display eliminates the need for guesswork, offering the operator a real-time feed of the equipment's operational status, including battery levels, pressure readings, and more.\n\nRaymond Wang, CEO of HEVI, commented, \"This marks another major achievement for us as we introduce North America's largest all-electric wheel loader. The purpose-designed H65L meets customer demands with extended runtime, faster charging, and cutting-edge display technology. Building on our legacy of zero-emission, all-electric industrial vehicles, the game-changing H65L delivers high performance while offering zero emissions, reduced operating and maintenance costs, lower noise levels, and enhanced operator comfort. Added together this is an important expansion of our fast growing industrial electric vehicle portfolio that strengthens our competitive position and, we believe, will help us build shareholder value.\"\n\n**About HEVI Corporation**\n\nHEVI is a developer and manufacturer of sustainable heavy machinery such as all-electric heavy construction and farm machinery.
