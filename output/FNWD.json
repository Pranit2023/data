Business\nGeneral\nFinward Bancorp, an Indiana corporation (the “Bancorp” or “Finward”), was incorporated on January 31, 1994, and is the holding company\nfor Peoples Bank, an Indiana-chartered commercial bank (the “Bank”). The Bank is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bancorp. The Bancorp’s\nbusiness activities include being a holding company for the Bank and the Bank's wholly owned subsidiaries, as well as a holding company for\nNWIN Risk Management, Inc., a captive insurance company.\nThe Bank is primarily engaged in the business of attracting deposits from the general public and the origination of loans, mostly upon the\nsecurity of single family residences and commercial real estate, as well as, construction loans and various types of consumer loans, commercial\nbusiness loans and municipal loans, within its primary market areas of Lake and Porter Counties, in Northwest Indiana, and Cook County,\nIllinois. In addition, the Bancorp's Wealth Management Group provides estate and retirement planning, guardianships, land trusts, profit sharing\nand 401(k) retirement plans, IRA and Keogh accounts, investment agency accounts, and serves as the personal representative of estates and\nacts as trustee for revocable and irrevocable trusts.\nThe Bank’s deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”), which is administered by the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), an agency of the federal government. As the holding company for the Bank, the Bancorp is subject to\ncomprehensive examination, supervision and regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“FRB”), while the Bank is\nsubject to comprehensive examination, supervision and regulation by both the FDIC and the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions (“DFI”).\nThe Bank is also subject to regulation by the FRB governing reserves required to be maintained against certain deposits and other matters. The\nBank is also a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) of Indianapolis, which is one of the eleven regional banks comprising the\nsystem of Federal Home Loan Banks.\nOn January 31, 2022, the Bancorp completed its acquisition of Royal Financial, Inc. (“RYFL”) pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger\ndated July 28, 2021 (the “Merger Agreement”) between the Bancorp and RYFL. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, RYFL merged\nwith and into the Bancorp, with the Bancorp as the surviving corporation (the “RYFL Merger”). Simultaneous with the RYFL Merger, Royal\nSavings Bank, an Illinois state-chartered savings bank and wholly-owned subsidiary of RYFL, merged with and into the Bank, with the Bank as\nthe surviving institution.\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, RYFL stockholders who owned 101 or more shares of RYFL common stock were permitted to\nelect to receive either 0.4609 shares of Finward common stock or $20.14 in cash, or a combination of both, for each share of RYFL common\nstock owned, subject to proration and allocation provisions, such that 65% of the shares of RYFL common stock outstanding immediately prior to\nthe closing of the merger were converted into the right to receive shares of Finward common stock and the remaining 35% of the outstanding\nRYFL shares were converted into the right to receive cash. Stockholders holding less than 101 shares of RYFL common stock received fixed\nconsideration of $20.14 in cash and no stock consideration for each share of RYFL common stock.\nAs a result of RYFL stockholder stock and cash elections and the related allocation and proration provisions of the Merger Agreement,\nFinward issued 795,423 shares of its common stock and paid cash consideration of approximately $18.7 million in the RYFL Merger. Based on\nthe closing price of Finward’s common stock on January 28, 2022, the transaction had an implied valuation of approximately $56.7 million. The\nacquisition further expanded the Bank’s banking center network in Cook County and DuPage County, Illinois, expanding the Bank’s full-service\nretail banking network.\n4 of 113\nThe Bancorp maintains its corporate office at 9204 Columbia Avenue, Munster, Indiana, from which it oversees the operation of its 26 branch\nlocations. For further information, see “Properties.” The Bancorp’s Internet address is www.ibankpeoples.com.\nForward-Looking Statements\nStatements contained in this filing on Form 10-K that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private\nSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The words or phrases “would be,” “will allow,” “intends to,” “will likely result,” “are expected to,” “will\ncontinue,” “is anticipated,” “estimate,” “project,” or similar expressions are also intended to identify “forward-looking statements” within the\nmeaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. The Bancorp cautions readers that forward-looking statements, including without\nlimitation those relating to the Bancorp’s future business prospects, interest income and expense, net income, liquidity, and capital needs are\nsubject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements\ndue to a number of factors, including those set forth above in “Recent Developments” and below in “Regulation and Supervision” of this Form 10-\nK.\nCertain of the statements made in this report are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning and protections of Section 27A of the\nSecurities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including\nstatements regarding our financial position, business strategy, and the plans and objectives of our management for future operations, are\nforward-looking statements. You can identify these forward-looking statements through our use of words such as “may,” “will,” “anticipate,”\n“assume,” “should,” “indicate,” “would,” “believe,” “contemplate,” “expect,” “estimate,” “continue,” “plan,” “point to,” “project,” “could,” “intend,”\n“target,” and other similar words and expressions relating to the future.\nAlthough management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, actual results may differ\nmaterially, and adversely or positively, from the expectations of the Bancorp that are expressed or implied by any forward-looking statement.\nRisks, uncertainties, and factors that could cause the Bancorp’s actual results to vary materially from those expressed or implied by any forward-\nlooking statement include but are not limited to:\n● changes in interest rates, market liquidity, and capital markets, as well as the magnitude of such changes, which may reduce net\ninterest margins;\n● continuing increases in inflation;\n● current financial conditions within the banking industry, including the effects of recent failures of other financial institutions, liquidity\nlevels, and responses by the Federal Reserve, Department of the Treasury, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to\naddress these issues;\n● the use of proceeds of future offerings of securities;\n● capital management activities, including possible future sales of new securities, or possible repurchases or redemptions by the\nBancorp of outstanding debt or equity securities;\n● changes in asset quality and credit risk;\n● our ability to sustain revenue and earnings growth;\n● customer acceptance of the Bancorp’s products and services;\n● customer borrowing, repayment, investment, and deposit practices;\n● customer disintermediation;\n5 of 113\n● the introduction, withdrawal, success, and timing of asset/liability management strategies or of mergers and acquisitions and other\nbusiness initiatives and strategies;\n● competitive conditions;\n● our ability to realize cost savings or revenues or to implement integration plans and other consequences associated with mergers,\nacquisitions, and divestitures;\n● changes in fiscal, monetary, and tax policies;\n● factors that may cause the Bancorp to incur impairment charges on its investment securities;\n● electronic, cyber, and physical security breaches;\n● claims and litigation liabilities, including related costs, expenses, settlements, and judgments, or the outcome of matters before\nregulatory agencies, whether pending or commencing in the future;\n● changes in accounting principles and interpretations;\n● economic conditions;\n● loss of key personnel;\n● continuing risks and uncertainties relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and government responses thereto;\n● the impact, extent, and timing of technological changes, capital management activities, and other actions of the Federal Reserve\nBoard and legislative and regulatory actions and reforms; and\n● other factors and risks described under the heading “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K, as may be updated from time\nto time in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended (the “Exchange Act”).\nIn addition to the above factors, we also caution that the actual amounts and timing of any future common stock dividends or share\nrepurchases will be subject to various factors, including our capital position, financial performance, capital impacts of strategic initiatives, market\nconditions, and regulatory and accounting considerations, as well as any other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant in making such\na determination. Therefore, there can be no assurance that we will repurchase shares or pay any dividends to holders of our common stock, or\nas to the amount of any such repurchases or dividends.\nBecause such forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or\nimplied by such statements. The foregoing list of important factors is not exclusive and you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these\nforward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report or, in the case of documents incorporated by reference, the dates of\nthose documents. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time\nby or on behalf of us. The “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 of this Form 10-\nK lists some of the factors that could cause the Bancorp’s actual results to vary materially from those expressed in or implied by any forward-\nlooking statements. We direct your attention to this discussion. Other risks and uncertainties that could affect the Bancorp’s future performance\nare set forth below in Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”\n6 of 113\nLending Activities\nGeneral. The Bancorp’s product offerings include residential mortgage loans, construction loans, commercial real estate loans, consumer\nloans, commercial business loans and loans to municipalities. The Bancorp’s lending strategy stresses quality growth, product diversification,\nand competitive and profitable pricing. While lending efforts include both fixed and adjustable rate products, the focus has been on products with\nadjustable rates and/or shorter terms to maturity. It is management’s goal that all programs are marketed effectively to our primary market area.\nThe Bancorp is primarily a portfolio lender. Mortgage banking activities are limited to the sale of fixed rate mortgage loans with contractual\nmaturities generally exceeding fifteen years and greater. These loans are sold, on a case-by-case basis, in the secondary market as part of the\nBancorp’s efforts to manage interest rate risk. All loan sales are made to Freddie Mac or to the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis. All\nloans held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or market value.\nUnder Indiana Law, an Indiana bank generally may not make any loan to a borrower or its related entities if the total of all such loans by the\nbank exceeds 15% of its unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus (plus up to an additional 10% of unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus,\nin the case of loans fully collateralized by readily marketable collateral); provided, however, that certain specified types of loans are exempted\nfrom these limitations or subject to different limitations. The maximum amount that the Bank could have loaned to one borrower and the\nborrower’s related entities at December 31, 2022, under the 15% of capital and surplus limitation, was approximately $26.1 million. At December\n31, 2022, the Bank had no loans that exceeded the regulatory limitations.\nAt December 31, 2022, there were no concentrations of loans in any type of industry that exceeded 10% of total loans that were not\notherwise disclosed as a loan category.\n7 of 113\nLoan Portfolio. The following table sets forth selected data relating to the composition of the Bancorp’s loan portfolio by type of loan at the\nend of each of the last two years. The amounts are stated in thousands (000’s).\n(Dollars in thousands)\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2022 2021\nLoans secured by real estate:\nResidential real estate $ 484,595 $ 260,134\nHome equity 38,978 34,612\nCommercial real estate 486,431 317,145\nConstruction and land development 108,926 123,822\nMultifamily 251,014 61,194\nTotal loans secured by real estate 1,369,944 796,907\nCommercial business 93,278 115,772\nConsumer 918 582\nManufactured homes 34,882 37,887\nGovernment 9,549 8,991\nLoans receivable 1,508,571 960,139\nAdd (less):\nNet deferred loan origination costs 5,083 6,810\nUndisbursed loan funds (23) (229)\nLoans receivable, net of deferred fees and costs.. $ 1,513,631 $ 966,720\n8 of 113\nLoan Maturity Schedule. The following table sets forth certain information at December 31, 2022, regarding the dollar amount of loans in\nthe Bancorp’s portfolio based on their contractual terms to maturity. Demand loans, loans having no schedule of repayments and no stated\nmaturity, and overdrafts are reported as due in one year or less. Contractual principal repayments of loans do not necessarily reflect the actual\nterm of the loan portfolio. The average life of mortgage loans is substantially less than their contractual terms because of loan prepayments and\nbecause of enforcement of due-on-sale clauses, which give the Bancorp the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in the event,\namong other things, that the borrower sells the property subject to the mortgage.

The primary lending area of the Bancorp encompasses Lake County in northwest Indiana and Cook County in northeast\nIllinois, where collectively a majority of loan activity is concentrated. The Bancorp is also an active lender in Porter County, and to a lesser\nextent, LaPorte, Newton, and Jasper counties in Indiana; and DuPage, Lake, and Will counties in Illinois.\nLoan Origination Fees. All loan origination and commitment fees, as well as incremental direct loan origination costs, are deferred and\namortized into income as yield adjustments.\nLoan Origination Procedure. The primary sources for loan originations are referrals from commercial customers, real estate brokers and\nbuilders, solicitations by the Bancorp’s lending and retail staff, and advertising of loan programs and rates. The Bancorp employs no staff\nappraisers. All appraisals are performed by fee appraisers that have been approved by the Board of Directors and who meet all federal\nguidelines and state licensing and certification requirements.\n9 of 113\nDesignated officers have authorities, established by the Board of Directors, to approve loans. Loans up to $4,000,000 are approved by the\nloan officers’ loan committee. Loans from $4,000,000 to $7,000,000 are approved by the senior officers’ loan committee (SOLC). Loans from\n$7,000,000 to $15,000,000 are approved the executive officer’s loan committee. All loans in excess of $15,000,000, up to the legal lending limit\nof the Bank, must be approved by the Bank’s Board of Directors or its Credit Committee. (All members of the Bank’s Board of Directors and\nCredit Committee are also members of the Bancorp’s Board of Directors and Credit Committee, respectively.) Certain loan renewals and\nextensions may not require approval by the Board of Directors or the Credit Committee as long as there is no material change, credit\ndowngrade, significant change in borrower or guarantor status, material release or change in collateral value or the eligible loan renewal or\nextension is not outside the current concentration limits set by the Board of Directors. The maximum in-house legal lending limit as set by the\nBoard of Directors is the lower of 10% of the Bank’s risk based capital or $15,000,000. Requests that exceed this amount will be considered on a\ncase-by-case basis, after taking into consideration the legal lending limit, by specific Board action. The Bank will not extend credit to any of its\nexecutive officers, directors, or principal shareholders or to any related interest of that person, except in compliance with the insider lending\nrestrictions of Regulation O under the Federal Reserve Act and in an amount that, when aggregated with all other extensions of credit to that\nperson, exceeds $1.000,000 unless: (1) the extension of credit has been approved in advance by a majority of the entire Board of Directors of\nthe Bank, and (2) the interested party has abstained from participating directly or indirectly in the voting.\nAll loans secured by personal property must be covered by insurance in an amount sufficient to cover the full amount of the loan. All loans\nsecured by real estate must be covered by insurance in an amount sufficient to cover the full amount of the loan or restore the property to its\noriginal state. First mortgage loans must be covered by a lender’s title insurance policy in the amount of the loan.\nThe Current Lending Programs\nResidential Mortgage Loans. The primary lending activity of the Bancorp has been the granting of conventional mortgage loans to enable\nborrowers to purchase existing homes, refinance existing homes, or construct new homes. Conventional loans are made up to a maximum of\n97% of the purchase price or appraised value, whichever is less. For loans made in excess of 80% of value, private mortgage insurance is\ngenerally required in an amount sufficient to reduce the Bancorp’s exposure to 80% or less of the appraised value of the property. Loans insured\nby private mortgage insurance companies can be made for up to 97% of value. During 2022, 69.9% of mortgage loans closed were conventional\nloans with borrowers having 20% or more equity in the property. This type of loan does not require private mortgage insurance because of the\nborrower’s level of equity investment.\nFixed rate loans currently originated generally conform to Freddie Mac guidelines for loans purchased under the one‑to‑four family program.\nLoan interest rates are determined based on secondary market yield requirements and local market conditions. Fixed rate mortgage loans with\ncontractual maturities generally exceeding fifteen years and greater may be sold and/or classified as held for sale to control exposure to interest\nrate risk.\nThe 15 year mortgage loan program has gained wide acceptance in the Bancorp’s primary market area. As a result of the shortened maturity\nof these loans, this product has been priced below the comparable 20 and 30 year loan offerings. Mortgage applicants for 15 year loans tend to\nhave a larger than normal down payment; this, coupled with the larger principal and interest payment amount, has caused the 15 year mortgage\nloan portfolio to consist, to a significant extent, of second time home buyers whose underwriting qualifications tend to be above average.\nThe Bancorp’s Adjustable Rate Mortgage Loans (“ARMs”) include offerings that reprice annually or are “Mini-Fixed.” The “Mini‑Fixed”\nmortgage reprices annually after a one, three, five, seven or ten year period. ARM originations totaled $44.6 million for 2022 and $11.5 million for\n2021. During 2022, ARMs represented 35.8% of total mortgage loan originations. The ability of the Bancorp to successfully market ARM’s\ndepends upon loan demand, prevailing interest rates, volatility of interest rates, public acceptance of such loans and terms offered by\ncompetitors.\nConstruction Loans. Construction loans on residential properties are made primarily to individuals and contractors who are under contract\nwith individual purchasers. These loans are personally guaranteed by the borrower. The maximum loan-to-value ratio is 89% of either the current\nappraised value or the cost of construction, whichever is less. Residential construction loans are typically made for periods of six months to one\nyear.\nLoans are also made for the construction of commercial properties. All such loans are made in accordance with well-defined underwriting\nstandards. Generally if the properties are not owner occupied, these types of loans require proof of intent to lease and a confirmed end-loan\ntakeout. In general, loans made do not exceed 80% of the appraised value of the property. Commercial construction loans are typically made for\nperiods not to exceed two years or date of occupancy, whichever is less.\n10 of 113\nCommercial Real Estate and Multifamily Loans. Commercial real estate loans are typically made to a maximum of 80% of the appraised\nvalue. Such loans are generally made on an adjustable rate basis. These loans are typically made for terms of 15 to 20 years. Loans with an\namortizing term exceeding 15 years normally have a balloon feature calling for a full repayment within seven to ten years from the date of the\nloan. The balloon feature affords the Bancorp the opportunity to restructure the loan if economic conditions so warrant. Commercial real estate\nloans include loans secured by commercial rental units, apartments, condominium developments, small shopping centers, owner occupied\ncommercial/industrial properties, hospitality units and other retail and commercial developments.\nWhile commercial real estate lending is generally considered to involve a higher degree of risk than single‑family residential lending due to\nthe concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and the effects of general economic conditions on real estate developers and\nmanagers, the Bancorp has endeavored to reduce this risk in several ways. In originating commercial real estate loans, the Bancorp considers\nthe feasibility of the project, the financial strength of the borrowers and lessees, the managerial ability of the borrowers, the location of the project\nand the economic environment. Management evaluates the debt coverage ratio and analyzes the reliability of cash flows, as well as the quality\nof earnings. All such loans are made in accordance with well-defined underwriting standards and are generally supported by personal\nguarantees, which represent a secondary source of repayment.\nLoans for the construction of commercial properties are generally located within an area permitting physical inspection and regular review of\nbusiness records. Projects financed outside of the Bancorp’s primary lending area generally involve borrowers and guarantors who are or were\nprevious customers of the Bancorp or projects that are underwritten according to the Bank’s underwriting standards.\nConsumer Loans. The Bancorp offers consumer loans to individuals for personal, household or family purposes. Consumer loans are either\nsecured by adequate collateral, or unsecured. Unsecured loans are based on the strength of the applicant’s financial condition. All borrowers\nmust meet current underwriting standards. The consumer loan program includes both fixed and variable rate products.\nHome Equity Line of Credit. The Bancorp offers a fixed and variable rate revolving line of credit secured by the equity in the borrower’s\nhome. Both products offer an interest only option where the borrower pays interest only on the outstanding balance each month. Equity lines will\ntypically require a second mortgage appraisal and a second mortgage lender’s title insurance policy. Loans are generally made up to a maximum\nof 89% of the appraised value of the property less any outstanding liens.\nHome Improvement Loans and Equity Loans—Fixed Term. Home improvement and equity loans are made up to a maximum of 85% of\nthe appraised value of the improved property, less any outstanding liens. These loans are offered on both a fixed and variable rate basis with a\nmaximum term of 240 months. All home equity loans are made on a direct basis to borrowers.\nManufactured Homes. The Bancorp purchases fixed rate closed loans from a third party that are subject to Bancorp’s underwriting\nrequirements and secured by manufactured homes. The maturity date on these loans can range up to 25 years. In addition, these loans have a\nreserve account held at the Bancorp; further detail regarding this reserve can be found in Note 4 – Loans Receivable.\nCommercial Business Loans. Although the Bancorp’s priority in extending various types of commercial business loans changes from time\nto time, the basic considerations in determining the makeup of the commercial business loan portfolio are economic factors, regulatory\nrequirements and money market conditions. The Bancorp seeks commercial loan relationships from the local business community and from its\npresent customers. Conservative lending policies based upon sound credit analysis governs the extension of commercial credit. The following\nloans, although not inclusive, are considered preferable for the Bancorp’s commercial loan portfolio, loans collateralized by liquid assets; loans\nsecured by general use machinery and equipment; secured short‑term working capital loans to established businesses secured by business\nassets; short‑term loans with established sources of repayment and secured by sufficient equity and real estate; and unsecured loans to\ncustomers whose character and capacity to repay are firmly established.\n11 of 113\nGovernment Loans. The Bancorp is permitted to purchase non-rated municipal securities, tax anticipation notes, and warrants within the\nlocal market area.\nNon‑Performing Assets, Asset Classification and Provision for Loan Losses\nLoans are reviewed on a regular basis and are generally placed on a non‑accrual status when, in the opinion of management, serious doubt\nexists as to the collectability of a loan. Loans are generally placed on non‑accrual status when either principal or interest is 90 days or more past\ndue. Consumer non-residential loans are generally charged off when the loan becomes over 120 days delinquent. Interest accrued and unpaid\nat the time a loan is placed on non‑accrual status is charged against interest income. Subsequent payments are either applied to the outstanding\nprincipal balance, tax and insurance reserve or recorded as interest income, depending on the assessment of the ultimate collectability of the\nloan.\nThe Bancorp’s mortgage loan collection procedures provide that, when a mortgage loan is 15 days or more delinquent, the borrower will be\ncontacted by mail and payment requested. If the delinquency continues, subsequent efforts will be made to contact the delinquent borrower. In\ncertain instances, the Bancorp will recast the loan or grant a limited moratorium on loan payments to enable the borrower to reorganize his, her,\nor its financial affairs. If the loan continues in a delinquent status for 120 days, the Bancorp will generally initiate foreclosure proceedings. Any\nproperty acquired as the result of foreclosure or by voluntary transfer of property made to avoid foreclosure is classified as foreclosed real estate\nuntil such time as it is sold or otherwise disposed of by the Bancorp. Foreclosed real estate is recorded at fair value at the date of foreclosure. At\nforeclosure, any write-down of the property is charged to the allowance for loan losses. Costs relating to improvement of property are capitalized,\nwhereas holding costs are expensed. Valuations are periodically performed by management, and a valuation allowance is established by a\ncharge to operations if the carrying value of a property exceeds its estimated fair value less selling costs. Subsequent gains or losses on\ndisposition, including expenses incurred in connection with the disposition, are charged to operations. Collection procedures for consumer loans\nprovide that when a consumer loan becomes ten days delinquent, the borrower will be contacted by mail and payment requested. If the\ndelinquency continues, subsequent efforts will be made to contact the delinquent borrower. In certain instances, the Bancorp may grant a\npayment deferral. If a loan continues to be delinquent after 60 days and all collection efforts have been exhausted, the Bancorp will initiate legal\nproceedings. Collection procedures for commercial business loans provide that when a commercial loan becomes ten days delinquent, the\nborrower will be contacted by mail and payment requested. If the delinquency continues, subsequent efforts will be made to contact the\ndelinquent borrower pursuant to the commercial loan collection policy. In certain instances, the Bancorp may grant a payment deferral or\nrestructure the loan. Once it has been determined that collection efforts are unsuccessful, the Bancorp will initiate legal proceedings.\n12 of 113\nThe following table sets forth information regarding the Bancorp’s non-performing assets as of December 31, for each period indicated.

Interest on such loans included in income during the period amounted to $43 thousand.\nFederal regulations require banks to classify their own loans and to establish appropriate general and specific allowances, subject to\nregulatory review. These regulations are designed to encourage management to evaluate loans on a case-by-case basis and to discourage\nautomatic classifications. Loans classified as substandard or doubtful must be evaluated by management to determine loan loss reserves. Loans\nclassified as loss must either be written off or reserved for by a specific allowance. Amounts reported in the general loan loss reserve are\nincluded in the calculation of the Bancorp’s total risk-based capital requirement (to the extent that the amount does not exceed 1.25% of total\nrisk-based assets), but are not included in Tier 1 leverage ratio calculations and Tier 1 risk-based capital requirements.\n13 of 113\nSubstandard loans include non-performing loans and potential problem loans, where information about possible credit issues or other\nconditions causes management to question the ability of such borrowers to comply with loan covenants or repayment terms. No loans were\ninternally classified as doubtful or loss at December 31, 2022 or December 31, 2021.\nThe Bancorp's substandard loans are summarized below:\n(Dollars in thousands)\nDecember 31,\nLoan Segment 2022 December 31, 2021\nResidential real estate $ 6,035 $ 3,722\nHome equity 612 632\nCommercial real estate 7,421 3,562\nConstruction and land development - -\nMultifamily 7,064 384\nCommercial business 1,881 387\nConsumer - -\nManufactured homes - -\nGovernment - -\nTotal $ 23,013 $ 8,687\nIn addition to identifying and monitoring non-performing and other classified loans, management maintains a list of special mention loans.\nSpecial mention loans represent loans management is closely monitoring due to one or more factors that may cause the loan to become\nclassified as substandard.\nThe Bancorp's special mention loans are summarized below:\n(Dollars in thousands)\nDecember 31,\nLoan Segment December 31, 2022 2021\nResidential real estate $ 1,338 $ 2,940\nHome equity 385 415\nCommercial real estate 4,955 12,011\nConstruction and land development 2,346 3,630\nMultifamily 1,859 153\nCommercial business 703 1,915\nConsumer - -\nManufactured homes - 59\nGovernment - -\nTotal $ 11,586 $ 21,123\nA loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that a borrower will be unable to pay all amounts\ndue according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Typically, management does not individually classify smaller-balance\nhomogeneous loans, such as residential mortgages or consumer loans, as impaired, unless they are troubled debt restructurings.\n14 of 113\nPurchased loans acquired in a business combination are recorded at estimated fair value on their purchase date. Purchased loans with\nevidence of credit quality deterioration since origination are considered purchased credit impaired loans. Expected future cash flows at the\npurchase date in excess of the fair value of loans are recorded as interest income over the life of the loans if the timing and amount of the future\ncash flows is reasonably estimable (“accretable yield”). The difference between contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to\nbe collected at acquisition is referred to as the non-accretable difference and represents probable losses in the portfolio. In determining the\nacquisition date fair value of purchased credit impaired loans, and in subsequent accounting, the Bancorp aggregates these purchased loans\ninto pools of loans by common risk characteristics, such as credit risk rating and loan type. Subsequent to the purchase date, increases in cash\nflows over those expected at the purchase date are recognized as interest income prospectively. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash\nflows will generally result in a provision for loan losses.\nThe Bancorp's impaired loans, including purchased credit impaired loans, are summarized below:\n(Dollars in thousands)\nDecember 31,\nLoan Segment 2022 December 31, 2021\nResidential real estate $ 2,506 $ 1,771\nHome equity 419 284\nCommercial real estate 5,327 1,600\nConstruction and land development - -\nMultifamily 7,121 556\nCommercial business 2,711 1,597\nConsumer 17 -\nManufactured homes - -\nGovernment - -\nTotal $ 18,101 $ 5,808\nAt times, the Bancorp will modify the terms of a loan to forego a portion of interest or principal or reduce the interest rate on the loan to a rate\nmaterially less than market rates, or materially extend the maturity date of a loan as part of a troubled debt restructuring. The valuation basis for\nthe Bancorp’s troubled debt restructurings is based on the present value of expected future cash flows; unless consistent cash flows are not\npresent, then the fair value of the collateral securing the loan is the basis for valuation.\nThe Bancorp's troubled debt restructured loans are summarized below:\n(Dollars in thousands)\nLoan Segment December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021\nResidential real estate $ 1,190 $ 342\nHome equity 261 83\nCommercial real estate 1,984 747\nConstruction and land development - -\nMultifamily - -\nCommercial business 476 694\nConsumer - -\nManufactured homes - -\nGovernment. - -\nTotal $ 3,911 $ 1,866\n15 of 113\nThe table that follows sets forth the allowance for loan losses and related ratios for the periods indicated.

Securities can be classified as trading, held-to-maturity (HTM), or available-for-sale (AFS) at the\ntime of purchase. No securities are classified as trading or as held-to-maturity. AFS securities are those the Bancorp may decide to sell if needed\nfor liquidity, asset-liability management or other reasons. During 2022, the Bancorp did not hold as investments any derivative instruments and\nwas not involved in hedging activities as defined by Accounting Standards Codification Topic 815 Derivatives and Hedging. It has been the policy\nof the Bancorp to invest its excess cash in U.S. government agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations,\nmunicipal securities, and treasury securities. In addition, short-term funds are generally invested as interest bearing balances in financial\ninstitutions and federal funds. At December 31, 2022, the Bancorp’s investment portfolio totaled $370.9 million. In addition, the Bancorp had $6.5\nmillion in FHLB stock.\nThe table below shows the carrying values of the components of the investment securities portfolio at December 31, on the dates indicated.\nThe amounts are stated in thousands (000’s).\n2022 2021\nU.S. government sponsored agencies:\nAvailable-for-sale 7,625 8,669\nU.S. treasury securities:\nAvailable-for-sale 389 400\nCollateralized Mortgage Obligations: and Mortgage-backed securities\nAvailable-for-sale 134,116 184,701\nMunicipal Securities:\nAvailable-for-sale 227,718 332,127\nCollateralized Debt Securities:\nAvailable-for-sale 1,048 992\nTotals $ 370,896 $ 518,220\nThe contractual maturities and weighted average yields for the U.S. government securities, agency securities, municipal securities, treasury\nsecurity, and trust preferred securities at December 31, 2022, are summarized in the table below.

Payment in kind status results in a temporary delay in the payment of interest. As a result of a delay in the collection of the interest\npayments, management placed these securities in non-accrual status. At December 31, 2022, the cost basis of the two trust preferred securities\non non-accrual status totaled $2.2 million.\nUnrealized losses on securities have not been recognized into income because the securities are of high credit quality, have undisrupted\ncash flows, or have been independently evaluated for other-than-temporary impairment and appropriate write downs taken. Management has\nthe intent and ability to hold the securities for the foreseeable future, and the decline in fair value is largely due to changes in interest rates and\nvolatility in the securities markets. The fair values are expected to recover as the securities approach maturity.\n17 of 113\nSources of Funds\nGeneral. Deposits are the major source of the Bancorp’s funds for lending and other investment purposes. In addition to deposits, the\nBancorp derives funds from maturing investment securities and certificates of deposit, dividend receipts from the investment portfolio, loan\nprincipal repayments, repurchase agreements, advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis (FHLB) and other borrowings. Loan\nrepayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows are significantly influenced by general interest rates and\nmoney market conditions. Borrowings may be used on a short-term basis to compensate for reductions in the availability of other sources of\nfunds. They may also be used on a longer-term basis for general business purposes. The Bancorp uses repurchase agreements, as well as a\nline-of-credit and advances from the FHLB for borrowings. At December 31, 2022, the Bancorp had $120.0 million in FHLB fixed rate advances\nand $15.5 million in repurchase agreements. The Bancorp had no other borrowed funds as of December 31, 2022.\nDeposits. Retail and commercial deposits are attracted principally from within the Bancorp’s primary market area. The Bancorp offers a\nbroad selection of deposit instruments including non-interest bearing demand accounts, interest bearing demand accounts, savings accounts,\nmoney market deposit accounts, certificate accounts and retirement savings plans. Deposit accounts vary as to terms, with the principal\ndifferences being the minimum balance required, the time period the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate. Certificate account\nofferings typically range in maturity from ten days to 42 months. The deregulation of federal controls on insured deposits has allowed the\nBancorp to be more competitive in obtaining funds and to be flexible in meeting the threat of net deposit outflows. The Bancorp does not obtain\nfunds through brokers, however, the Bancorp did acquire brokered deposits through the acquisition of Royal Financial.\nThe following table presents the average daily amount of deposits and average rates paid on such deposits for the years indicated.

Borrowed money is used on a short-term basis to compensate for reductions in the availability of other sources of funds and is\ngenerally accomplished through repurchase agreements, as well as, through a line of credit and advances from the FHLB. Repurchase\nagreements generally mature within one year and are generally secured by U.S. government securities or U.S. agency securities, under the\nBancorp’s control. FHLB advances with maturities ranging from one year to five years are used to fund securities and loans of comparable\nduration, as well as to reduce the impact that movements in short-term interest rates have on the Bancorp’s overall cost of funds. Fixed rate\nadvances are payable at maturity, with a prepayment penalty.\nThe following tables set forth certain information regarding borrowing and repurchase agreements by the Bancorp at the end of and during\nthe periods indicated.

The subsidiary provides captive insurance for the subsidiaries of\nthe Bancorp.\nPeoples Service Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank was incorporated under the laws of the State of Indiana. The subsidiary\ncurrently provides insurance and annuity investments to the Bank’s wealth management customers.\nNWIN, LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank. NWIN, LLC was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada as an investment\nsubsidiary. The investment subsidiary currently holds security investments, which are managed by a professional portfolio manager. In addition,\nthe investment subsidiary is the parent of a real estate investment trust, NWIN Funding, Inc., that invests in real estate loans originated by the\nBank.\nNWIN Funding, Inc. is a subsidiary of NWIN, LLC, and was formed as an Indiana Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT). The formation of\nNWIN Funding, Inc. provides the Bancorp with a vehicle that may be used to raise capital utilizing portfolio mortgages as collateral, without\ndiluting stock ownership.\nColumbia Development Company, LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank and was incorporated under the laws of the State of\nIndiana. The subsidiary holds real estate properties that the Bank has acquired through the foreclosure process.\nThe consolidated financial statements include the Bancorp, its wholly owned subsidiaries, the Bank, NWIN Risk Management, Inc, and the\nBank’s wholly owned subsidiaries, Peoples Service Corporation, NWIN, LLC and Columbia Development Company, LLC. The Bancorp’s\nbusiness activities include being a holding company for the Bank as well as a holding company for NWIN Risk Management, Inc. The Bancorp’s\nearnings are dependent upon the earnings of the Bank. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in\nconsolidation.\nCompetition\nThe Bancorp’s primary market area for deposits, loans and financial services encompasses Lake and Porter Counties, in Northwest Indiana,\nand Cook County in northeast Illinois. All of the Bancorp’s banking centers and offices are located in its primary market area. Approximately\nninety-two percent of the Bancorp’s business activities are within this area.\nThe Bancorp faces strong competition in its primary market area for the attraction and retention of deposits and in the origination of loans.\nThe Bancorp’s most direct competition for deposits has historically come from commercial banks, savings associations, and credit unions\nlocated in its primary market area. Particularly in times of high interest rates, the Bancorp has had significant competition from mutual funds and\nother firms offering financial services. The Bancorp’s competition for loans comes principally from savings associations, commercial banks,\nmortgage banking companies, credit unions, insurance companies, and other institutional lenders.\nThe Bancorp competes for loans principally through the interest rates and loan fees it charges and the efficiency and quality of the services it\nprovides borrowers and other third-party sources. It competes for deposits by offering depositors a wide variety of savings accounts, checking\naccounts, competitive interest rates, convenient banking center locations, drive-up facilities, automatic teller machines, tax deferred retirement\nprograms, digital banking, and other miscellaneous services.\nThe activities of the Bancorp and the Bank in the geographic market served involve competition with other banks as well as with other\nfinancial institutions and enterprises, many of which have substantially greater resources than those available to the Bancorp. In addition, non-\nbank financial services companies with which the Bancorp and Bank compete, while subject to regulation by the CFPB, are generally not subject\nto the same type of extensive regulation by the federal and state banking agencies applicable to the Bancorp and the Bank.\n22 of 113\nEmployees and Human Capital Resources\nWe believe that the foundation of our success in the banking business lies with the quality of our employees, the development of our\nemployees’ skills and career goals, and our ability to provide a comprehensive rewarding experience and work environment for our employees.\nWe encourage and support the development of our employees and, wherever possible, strive to fill positions from within the organization. As of\nDecember 31, 2022, the Bank had 281 full-time and 45 part-time employees. The employees are not represented by a collective bargaining\nagreement. Management believes its employee relations are good. The Bancorp has six executive officers and has no other employees. The\nBancorp’s officers also are full-time employees of the Bank, and are compensated by the Bank.\nRegulation and Supervision\nBank Holding Company Regulation. The Bancorp is registered as a bank holding company for the Bank and has elected to be a financial\nholding company under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999. As a bank holding company and financial holding company, the Bancorp is subject\nto the regulation and supervision of the FRB under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the \"BHCA\"). Bank holding companies\nare required to file periodic reports with and are subject to periodic examination by the FRB.\nUnder the BHCA, without the prior approval of the FRB, the Bancorp may not acquire direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the voting\nstock or substantially all of the assets of any company, including a bank, and may not merge or consolidate with another bank holding company.\nIn addition, the Bancorp is generally prohibited by the BHCA from engaging in any nonbanking business unless such business is determined by\nthe FRB to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto. Under the BHCA, the FRB has the authority to require a bank\nholding company to terminate any activity or relinquish control of a nonbank subsidiary (other than a nonbank subsidiary of a bank) upon the\nFRB's determination that such activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness and stability of any bank subsidiary of the\nbank holding company.\nThe Change in Bank Control Act (“CBCA”) prohibits a person or group of persons from acquiring “control” of a bank holding company unless\nthe FRB has been notified and has not objected to the transaction. Under a rebuttable presumption established by the FRB, the acquisition of\n10% or more of a class of voting stock of a bank holding company with a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act,\nsuch as the Bancorp, would, under the circumstances set forth in the presumption, constitute acquisition of control of the Bancorp. In addition,\nthe CBCA prohibits any entity from acquiring 25% (the BHCA has a lower limit for acquirers that are existing bank holding companies) or more of\na bank holding company’s or bank’s voting securities, or otherwise obtaining control or a controlling influence over a bank holding company or\nbank without the approval of the FRB. On April 1, 2021, the FRB’s final rule clarifying the standards for determining whether one company has\ncontrol over another became effective. The final rule establishes four categories of tiered presumptions of noncontrol that are based on the\npercentage of voting shares held by the investor (less than 5%, 5-9.9%, 10-14.9% and 15-24.9%) and the presence of other indicia of control. As\nthe percentage of ownership increases, fewer indicia of control are permitted without falling outside of the presumption of noncontrol. These\nindicia of control include nonvoting equity ownership, director representation, management interlocks, business relationship and restrictive\ncontractual covenants. Under the final rule, investors can hold up to 24.9% of the voting securities and up to 33% of the total equity of a\ncompany without necessarily having a controlling influence.\nUnder the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), a bank holding company is\nexpected to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary bank(s). Pursuant to this requirement, a bank holding\ncompany should stand ready to use its resources to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary bank(s) during periods of financial stress or\nadversity. This support may be required by the FRB at times when the Bancorp may not have the resources to provide it or, for other reasons,\nwould not be inclined to provide it. Additionally, under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (\"FDICIA\"), a bank\nholding company is required to provide limited guarantee of the compliance by any insured depository institution subsidiary that may become\n\"undercapitalized\" (as defined in the statute) with the terms of any capital restoration plan filed by such subsidiary with its appropriate federal\nbanking agency.\n23 of 113\nState Bank Regulation. As an Indiana commercial bank, the Bank is subject to federal regulation and supervision by the FDIC and to state\nregulation and supervision by the DFI. The Bank's deposit accounts are insured by the DIF, which is administered by the FDIC. The Bank is not a\nmember of the Federal Reserve System.\nBoth federal and Indiana law extensively regulate various aspects of the banking business such as reserve requirements, truth-in-lending\nand truth-in-savings disclosures, equal credit opportunity, fair credit reporting, trading in securities and other aspects of banking operations.\nCurrent federal law also requires banks, among other things, to make deposited funds available within specified time periods.\nUnder FDICIA, insured state chartered banks are prohibited from engaging as principal in activities that are not permitted for national banks,\nunless: (i) the FDIC determines that the activity would pose no significant risk to the appropriate deposit insurance fund, and (ii) the bank is, and\ncontinues to be, in compliance with all applicable capital standards.\nBranches and Acquisitions. Branching by the Bank requires the approval of the Federal Reserve and the DFI. Under current law, Indiana\nchartered banks may establish branches throughout the state and in other states, subject to certain limitations. Congress authorized interstate\nbranching, with certain limitations, beginning in 1997. Indiana law authorizes an Indiana bank to establish one or more branches in states other\nthan Indiana through interstate merger transactions and to establish one or more interstate branches through de novo branching or the\nacquisition of a branch. The Dodd-Frank Act permits the establishment of de novo branches in states where such branches could be opened by\na state bank chartered by that state. The consent of the state is no longer required.\nTransactions with Affiliates. Under Indiana law, the Bank is subject to Sections 22(h), 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, which\nrestrict financial transactions between banks and affiliated companies, such as the Bancorp. The statute limits credit transactions between a\nbank and its executive officers and its affiliates, prescribes terms and conditions for bank affiliate transactions deemed to be consistent with safe\nand sound banking practices, and restricts the types of collateral security permitted in connection with a bank's extension of credit to an affiliate.\nCapital Requirements. Federal regulations require FDIC insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: (i) a\ncommon equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%; (iii) a total capital to risk-\nbased assets ratio of 8%; and (iv) a 4% Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio.\nCommon equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common shareholders’ equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined\nas common equity Tier 1 and Additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital generally includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock\nand related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity\nTier 1 capital plus Additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus meeting\nspecified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities,\nintermediate preferred stock, and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a\nmaximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated\nOther Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”), up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair\nmarket values. Institutions that have not exercised the AOCI opt-out have AOCI incorporated into common equity Tier 1 capital (including\nunrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale-securities). Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and\nadjustments specified in the regulations.\nIn determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, assets, including certain off-balance\nsheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, and residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the\nregulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present\ngreater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0% is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50% is generally assigned to\nprudently underwritten first lien one to four-family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100% is assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a\nrisk weight of 150% is assigned to certain past due loans and a risk weight of between 0% to 600% is assigned to permissible equity interests,\ndepending on certain specified factors.\n24 of 113\nIn addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions by the institution and certain\ndiscretionary bonus payments to management if an institution does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity\nTier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements.\nThe FRB and FDIC have authority to establish individual minimum capital requirements in appropriate cases upon a determination that an\ninstitution’s capital level is or may become inadequate in light of the particular risks or circumstances. As of December 31, 2022, the Bank met all\napplicable capital adequacy requirements.\nBank holding companies are generally subject to consolidated capital requirements established by the FRB. The Dodd-Frank Act required\nthe FRB to set minimum capital levels for bank holding companies that are as stringent as those required for insured depository subsidiaries.\nHowever, under the FRB’s “Small Bank Holding Company” exemption from consolidated bank holding company capital requirements, bank\nholding companies and savings and loan holding companies with less than $3 billion in consolidated assets, such as the Bancorp, are exempt\nfrom consolidated regulatory capital requirements, unless the FRB determines otherwise in particular cases.\nFederal law establishes a system of prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions. The law requires that\ncertain supervisory actions be taken against undercapitalized institutions, the severity of which depends on the degree of undercapitalization.\nThe FDIC has adopted regulations to implement the prompt corrective action legislation as to insured state banks. An institution is deemed to be\n“well capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of\n5.0% or greater, and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5% or greater. An institution is “adequately capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital\nratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater, and a common equity Tier 1 ratio\nof 4.5% or greater. An institution is “undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of\nless than 6.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 4.0%, or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5%. An institution is deemed to be “significantly\nundercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a leverage ratio of\nless than 3.0%, or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0%. An institution is considered to be “critically undercapitalized” if it has a ratio of\ntangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%.\nSubject to a narrow exception, a receiver or conservator is required to be appointed for an institution that is “critically undercapitalized” within\nspecified time frames. The regulations also provide that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the FDIC within 45 days of the date an\ninstitution is deemed to have received notice that it is “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized,” or “critically undercapitalized.”\nCompliance with the plan must be guaranteed by any parent holding company up to the lesser of 5% of the institution’s total assets when it was\ndeemed to be undercapitalized or the amount necessary to achieve compliance with applicable capital requirements. In addition, numerous\nmandatory supervisory actions become immediately applicable to an undercapitalized institution including, but not limited to, increased\nmonitoring by regulators and restrictions on growth, capital distributions and expansion. The FDIC could also take any one of a number of\ndiscretionary supervisory actions, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors.\nSignificantly and critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to additional mandatory and discretionary measures.\nSection 201 of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 (the “Economic Growth Act”) directed federal\nbanking agencies to draft regulations establishing a new optional Community Bank Leverage Ratio (“CBLR”). The Economic Growth Act\nprovides that the CBLR will apply to a “qualifying community bank” which the Economic Growth Act defines as a bank with consolidated assets\nof less than $10 billion and satisfying additional criteria designed to disqualify institutions with a higher risk profile. Under the Economic Growth\nAct, qualifying community banks that meet or exceed the CBLR and elect to follow the alternative regulatory capital structure will be deemed to\nhave satisfied all generally applicable leverage capital and risk-based capital requirements and will be considered “well capitalized” under the\nFDIC prompt corrective action provisions. The Economic Growth Act directed the FRB, the FDIC, and the Office of the Comptroller of the\nCurrency (“OCC”) to jointly determine a community bank leverage ratio percentage, not less than 8% nor more than 10%, that must be\nmaintained to be deemed to have satisfied all generally applicable leverage capital and risk-based capital requirements and be considered well\ncapitalized. The Economic Growth Act also directed agencies to establish procedures for dealing with a qualifying bank that subsequently falls\nbelow the new ratio.\n25 of 113\nThe final regulation implementing Section 201 became effective on January 1, 2021 (the “Final Rule”). Under the Final Rule, to be eligible to\nuse the CBLR framework, a banking organization must not be an advanced approaches organization and must have (i) a leverage ratio of\ngreater than 9%; (ii) total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion; (iii) total off-balance sheet exposures of 25% or less of total consolidated\nassets; and (iv) total trading assets plus trading liabilities of 5% or less of total consolidated assets. A qualifying institution may opt in and out of\nthe CBLR framework on its quarterly call report. An institution that ceases to meet any qualifying criteria is provided with a two-quarter grace\nperiod to either comply with the CBLR requirements or comply with the general capital regulations, including the risk-based capital requirements.\nSection 4012 of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act of 2021 (the “CARES Act”) required that the CBLR be temporarily\nlowered to 8%. The federal regulators issued a rule implementing the lower ratio effective April 23, 2021. The rule also established a two-quarter\ngrace period for a qualifying institution whose leverage ratio falls below the 8% CBLR requirement so long as the bank maintains a leverage ratio\nof 7% or greater. Another rule was issued to transition back to the 9% CBLR by increasing the ratio to 8.5% for calendar year 2022 and 9%\nthereafter. The Bank did not elect to opt in to the CBLR framework.\nThe following table shows that, at December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, the Bank’s capital exceeded all applicable regulatory capital\nrequirements. The dollar amounts are in millions.\n(Dollars in millions) Minimum Required To Be\nMinimum Required For Well Capitalized Under Prompt\nActual Capital Adequacy Purposes Corrective Action Regulations\nDecember 31, 2022 Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio\nCommon equity tier 1 capital\nto risk-weighted assets $ 161.3 10.1% $ 71.6 4.5% $ 103.4 6.5%\nTier 1 capital to risk-weighted\nassets $ 161.3 10.1% $ 95.5 6.0% $ 127.3 8.0%\nTotal capital to risk-weighted\nassets $ 174.2 10.9% $ 127.3 8.0% $ 159.1 10.0%\nTier 1 capital to adjusted\naverage assets $ 161.3 7.7% $ 84.3 4.0% $ 105.4 5.0%\n(Dollars in millions) Minimum Required To Be\nMinimum Required For Well Capitalized Under Prompt\nActual Capital Adequacy Purposes Corrective Action Regulations\nAt December 31, 2021 Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio\nCommon equity tier 1 capital\nto risk-weighted assets $ 133.7 12.6% $ 47.8 4.5% $ 69.0 6.5%\nTier 1 capital to risk-weighted\nassets $ 133.7 12.6% $ 63.7 6.0% $ 85.0 8.0%\nTotal capital to risk-weighted\nassets $ 147.0 13.9% $ 85.0 8.0% $ 106.2 10.0%\nTier 1 capital to adjusted\naverage assets $ 133.7 8.4% $ 64.1 4.0% $ 80.1 5.0%\nIn December 2017, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision published the last version of the Basel III accord, generally referred to as\n“Basel IV.” The Basel Committee stated that a key objective of the revisions incorporated into the framework is to reduce excessive variability of\nrisk-weighted assets (“RWA”), which will be accomplished by enhancing the robustness and risk sensitivity of the standardized approaches for\ncredit risk and operational risk, which will facilitate the comparability of banks’ capital ratios; constraining the use of internally modeled\napproaches; and complementing the risk-weighted capital ratio with a finalized leverage ratio and a revised and robust capital floor. The\nleadership of the FRB, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), and FDIC, who are tasked with implementing Basel IV, supported the\nrevisions. Under the current U.S. capital rules, operational risk capital requirements and a capital floor apply only to advanced approaches\ninstitutions, and not to the Bancorp. The impact of Basel IV on the Bancorp will depend on the manner in which it is implemented by the federal\nbanking regulators.\n26 of 113\nBanking regulators may change these capital requirements from time to time, depending on the economic outlook generally and the outlook\nfor the banking industry. The Bancorp is unable to predict whether and when any such further capital requirements would be imposed and, if so,\nto what levels and on what schedule.\nNew Accounting Standards With Regulatory Effect. In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued an accounting\nstandard update, “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,” which replaces the\ncurrent “incurred loss” model for recognizing credit losses with an “expected loss” model referred to as the Current Expected Credit Loss\n(“CECL”) model. Under the CECL model, the Bancorp will be required to present certain financial assets carried at amortized cost, such as loans\nheld for investment and held-to-maturity debt securities, at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses\nis to be based on information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts\nthat affect the collectability of the reported amount. On December 21, 2018, the federal banking agencies approved a final rule modifying their\nregulatory capital rules and providing an option to phase in over a period of three years the day-one regulatory capital effects of the CECL\nmodel. The final rule also revises the agencies’ other rules to reflect the update to the accounting standards. The final rule took effect April 1,\n2019. The new CECL standard will become effective for the Bancorp for fiscal year ending December 31, 2023 and for interim periods within the\nfiscal year. The Bancorp’s management expects the one-time cumulative effect adjustment to the allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) will be\nbetween $3.8 million and $6.8 million upon adoption as of January 1, 2023. Additional detail can be found in Note 1 to the financial statements,\nunder ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.\nDividend Limitations. The Bancorp is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. The primary source of the Bancorp’s cash flow,\nincluding cash flow to pay dividends on the Bancorp’s Common Stock, is the payment of dividends to the Bancorp by the Bank. Under Indiana\nlaw, the Bank may pay dividends of so much of its undivided profits (generally, earnings less losses, bad debts, taxes and other operating\nexpenses) as is considered expedient by the Bank’s Board of Directors. However, the Bank must obtain the approval of the DFI for the payment\nof a dividend if the total of all dividends declared by the Bank during the current year, including the proposed dividend, would exceed the sum of\nretained net income for the year to date plus its retained net income for the previous two years. For this purpose, “retained net income” means\nnet income as calculated for call report purposes, less all dividends declared for the applicable period. An exemption from DFI approval would\nrequire that the Bank have been assigned a composite uniform financial institutions rating of 1 or 2 as a result of the most recent federal or state\nexamination; the proposed dividend would not result in a Tier 1 leverage ratio below 7.5%; and that the Bank not be subject to any corrective\naction, supervisory order, supervisory agreement, or board approved operating agreement.\nThe FDIC has the authority to prohibit the Bank from paying dividends if, in its opinion, the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe\nor unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the Bank. In addition, under FRB supervisory policy, a bank holding company generally\nshould not maintain its existing rate of cash dividends on common shares unless (i) the organization’s net income available to common\nshareholders over the past year has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and (ii) the prospective rate of earnings retention appears\nconsistent with the organization’s capital needs, assets, quality, and overall financial condition. The FRB expects bank holding companies to\nconsult with it in advance of declaring dividends that could raise safety and soundness concerns (i.e., such as when the dividend is not\nsupported by earnings or involves a material increase in the dividend rate) and in advance of repurchasing shares of common or preferred stock.\nFederal Deposit Insurance. Deposits in the Bank are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC up to a maximum amount, which\nis generally $250,000 per depositor, subject to aggregation rules. There is no unlimited insurance coverage for noninterest bearing transaction\naccounts. Rather, deposits held in noninterest bearing transaction accounts are aggregated with interest bearing deposits the owner may hold in\nthe same ownership category, and the combined are insured up to at least $250,000. The Bank is subject to deposit insurance assessments by\nthe FDIC pursuant to its regulations establishing a risk-related deposit insurance assessment system, based on the institution’s capital levels\nand risk profile. Under the FDIC’s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk-weighted categories based\non supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels, and certain other factors with less risky institutions paying lower assessments. An\ninstitution’s initial assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned. There are also adjustments to a bank’s initial assessment\nrates based on levels of long-term unsecured debt, secured liabilities in excess of 25% of domestic deposits and, for certain institutions,\nbrokered deposit levels. Pursuant to FDIC rules adopted under the Dodd-Frank Act (described below), initial assessments ranged from 5 to 35\nbasis points of the institution’s total assets minus its tangible equity. The Bank paid net deposit insurance assessments of $861 thousand during\nthe year ended December 31, 2022. For 2022, the deposit insurance assessment rate before applying one-time assessment credits was\napproximately 0.068% of insured deposits. No institution may pay a dividend if it is in default of the federal deposit insurance assessment.\n27 of 113\nUnder the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC is authorized to set the reserve ratio for the Deposit Insurance Fund at no less than 1.35% of estimated\ninsured deposits, which is increased from the previous ratio of 1.15%. The FDIC must offset the effect of the increase in the minimum designated\nreserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35% on insured depository institutions of less than $10 billion, and may declare dividends to depository institutions\nwhen the reserve ratio at the end of a calendar quarter is at least 1.5%, although the FDIC has the authority to suspend or limit such permitted\ndividend declarations. The FDIC has set the designated reserve ratio for the deposit insurance fund at 2% of estimated insured deposits, which\nthe FDIC has established as a long-term goal. As of September 30, 2021, the FDIC had announced that the ratio had declined to 1.30% due\nlargely to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The FDIC adopted a plan to restore the fund to the 1.35% ratio within eight years but did not\nchange its assessment schedule.\nUnder the Dodd-Frank Act, the assessment base for deposit insurance premiums is calculated as average consolidated total assets minus\naverage tangible equity. Tangible equity for this purpose means Tier 1 capital. The rate schedules set forth in the rule governing the assessment\nbase are scaled to the increase in the assessment base, including schedules that go into effect as the reserve ratio reaches 1.15%, 2%, and\n2.5%.\nThe schedules reduce the initial base assessment rate in each of the four risk-based pricing categories.\n● For small Risk category I banks, the rates range from 5-9 basis points.\n● The rates for small institutions in Risk Categories II, III and IV are 14, 23 and 35 basis points, respectively.\n● For large institutions and large, highly complex institutions, the rate schedule ranges from 5 to 35 basis points.\nThere are also adjustments made to the initial assessment rates based on long-term unsecured debt, depository institution debt, and\nbrokered deposits. The FDIC also provides for an assessment system for large depository institutions with over $10 billion in assets.\nThe FDIC has the authority to increase insurance assessments. A significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse\neffect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Bank. Management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in\nthe future.\nThe FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution if the FDIC determines, after a hearing, that the\ninstitution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe and unsound condition to continue operations or has\nviolated any applicable law, regulation, order or any condition imposed in writing by, or written agreement with, the FDIC. The FDIC may also\nsuspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for a permanent termination of insurance if the institution has no tangible\ncapital.\nFederal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis, which is one of eleven regional\nFederal Home Loan Banks. Each Federal Home Loan Bank serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. It is\nfunded primarily from funds deposited by member institutions and proceeds from the sale of consolidated obligations of the Federal Home Loan\nBank system. It makes loans to members (i.e., advances) in accordance with policies and procedures established by the board of trustees of the\nFederal Home Loan Bank. As a member, the Bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis in\nan amount equal to the greater of 1% of its aggregate unpaid residential mortgage loans, home purchase contracts or similar obligations at the\nbeginning of each year or 5% of our outstanding advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank. At December 31, 2022, the Bank was in\ncompliance with this requirement.\n28 of 113\nAt December 31, 2022, the Bancorp owned $6.5 million of stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis (“FHLBI”). The FHLBI stock\nentitles the Bancorp to dividends from the FHLBI. The Bancorp recognized dividend income of approximately $84 thousand in 2022. At\nDecember 31, 2022, the Bancorp’s excess borrowing capacity based on collateral from the FHLBI was $391.1 million. Generally, the loan terms\nfrom the FHLBI are better than the terms the Bancorp can receive from other sources making it cheaper to borrow money from the FHLBI.\nFederal Reserve System. Under regulations of the FRB, the Bank is required to maintain reserves against its transaction accounts\n(primarily checking accounts) and non-personal money market deposit accounts. The effect of these reserve requirements is to increase the\nBank’s cost of funds. The Bank is in compliance with its reserve requirements.\nCommunity Reinvestment Act. Under the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”), the Bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation\nconsistent with its safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income\nneighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution’s\ndiscretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. The\nCRA requires the FDIC in connection with its examination of the Bank, to assess its record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to\ntake that record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by the Bank. For example, the regulations specify that a bank’s CRA\nperformance will be considered in its expansion (e.g., branching) proposals and may be the basis for approving, denying or conditioning the\napproval of an application. As of the date of its most recent regulatory examination, the Bank was rated “satisfactory” with respect to its CRA\ncompliance.\nGramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (\"Gramm-Leach\"), bank holding companies are permitted to offer their\ncustomers virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting) and\nmerchant banking. In order to engage in these new financial activities, a bank holding company must qualify and register with the FRB as a\n\"financial holding company\" by demonstrating that each of its bank subsidiaries is well capitalized, well managed and has at least a satisfactory\nrating under the CRA. As previously discussed, the Bancorp has elected to become a financial holding company under Gramm-Leach.\nGramm-Leach established a system of functional regulation, under which the federal banking agencies regulate the banking activities of\nfinancial holding companies, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regulates their securities activities and state insurance regulators\nregulate their insurance activities.\nUnder Gramm-Leach, federal banking regulators adopted rules limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose\nnonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. The rules require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some\ncircumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to nonaffiliated third parties. The privacy provisions of\nGramm-Leach affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial services companies and conveyed to outside\nvendors.\nThe Bancorp does not disclose any nonpublic information about any current or former customers to anyone except as permitted by law and\nsubject to contractual confidentiality provisions which restrict the release and use of such information.\nCybersecurity Guidelines. The federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines for establishing information security standards and\ncybersecurity programs for implementing safeguards under the supervision of the board of directors. These guidelines, along with related\nregulatory materials, increasingly focus on risk management and processes related to information technology and the use of third parties in the\nprovision of financial services. In October 2016, the federal banking agencies issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on enhanced\ncybersecurity risk-management and resilience standards that would apply to large and interconnected banking organizations and to services\nprovided by third parties to these firms. These enhanced standards would apply only to depository institutions and depository institution holding\ncompanies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, which would not currently include the Bancorp. However, similar standards\nand/or regulations may be adopted or implemented by federal and state banking agencies in the future which may be applicable to community\nbanking organizations such as the Bancorp.\n29 of 113\nRecent cyberattacks against banks and other financial institutions that resulted in unauthorized access to confidential customer information\nhave prompted the federal banking regulators to issue extensive guidance on cybersecurity. Among other things, financial institutions are\nexpected to design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and ensure that their risk management processes address\nthe risks posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to authenticate customers accessing internet-based\nservices. A financial institution also should have a robust business continuity program to recover from a cyberattack and procedures for\nmonitoring the security of third-party service providers that may have access to nonpublic data at the institution. During 2022, the Bancorp did\nnot discover any material cybersecurity incidents.\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) within the\nFederal Reserve, which is granted broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection\nlaws, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Truth in Lending Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Fair\nDebt Collection Act, the Consumer Financial Privacy provisions of Gramm-Leach and certain other statutes. Many of the consumer financial\nprotection functions formerly assigned to the federal banking and other designated agencies are now performed by the CFPB. The CFPB has a\nlarge budget and staff, and has the authority to implement regulations under federal consumer protection laws and enforce those laws against,\nand examine, financial institutions. The CFPB has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with $10\nbillion or more in assets. Smaller institutions are subject to rules promulgated by the CFPB but continue to be examined and supervised by the\nfederal banking regulators for consumer compliance purposes. The CFPB has the authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive practice in\nconnection with the offering of consumer financial products. Additionally, this bureau is authorized to collect fines and provide consumer\nrestitution in the event of violations, engage in consumer financial education, track consumer complaints, request data, and promote the\navailability of financial services to underserved consumers and communities.\nMoreover, the Dodd-Frank Act authorized the CFPB to establish certain minimum standards for the origination of residential mortgages\nincluding a determination of the borrower’s ability to repay. In addition, the CFPB has published several final regulations impacting the mortgage\nindustry, including rules related to ability-to-pay, mortgage servicing, and mortgage loan originator compensation. The ability-to-repay rule makes\nlenders liable if they fail to assess ability to repay under a prescribed test, but also creates a safe harbor for so-called “qualified mortgages.”\nFailure to comply with the ability-to-repay rule may result in possible CFPB enforcement action and special statutory damages plus actual, class\naction, and attorneys’ fees damages, all of which a borrower may claim in defense of a foreclosure action at any time. The Dodd-Frank Act also\npermits states to adopt consumer protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level and, in certain\ncircumstances, permits state attorneys general to enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations. Federal preemption\nof state consumer protection law requirements, traditionally an attribute of the federal savings association charter, also was modified by the\nDodd-Frank Act and requires a case-by-case determination of preemption by the OCC and eliminates preemption for subsidiaries of a bank.\nDepending on the implementation of this revised federal preemption standard, the operations of the Bank could become subject to additional\ncompliance burdens in the states in which it operates.\nMortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending. Title XIV of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act,\nincludes a series of amendments to the Truth In Lending Act with respect to mortgage loan origination standards affecting, among other things,\noriginator compensation, minimum repayment standards and pre-payments. With respect to mortgage loan originator compensation, except in\nlimited circumstances, an originator is prohibited from receiving compensation that varies based on the terms of the loan (other than the principal\namount). The amendments to the Truth In Lending Act also prohibit a creditor from making a residential mortgage loan unless it determines,\nbased on verified and documented information of the consumer’s financial resources, that the consumer has a reasonable ability to repay the\nloan. The amendments also prohibit certain pre-payment penalties and require creditors offering a consumer a mortgage loan with a pre-\npayment penalty to offer the consumer the option of a mortgage loan without such a penalty. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act expands the\ndefinition of a “high-cost mortgage” under the Truth In Lending Act, and imposes new requirements on high-cost mortgages and new disclosure,\nreporting and notice requirements for residential mortgage loans, as well as new requirements with respect to escrows and appraisal practices.\n30 of 113\nInterchange Fees for Debit Cards. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, interchange fees for debit card transactions must be reasonable and\nproportional to the issuer’s incremental cost incurred with respect to the transaction plus certain fraud related costs. Although institutions with\ntotal assets of less than $10 billion are exempt from this requirement, competitive pressures have required smaller depository institutions to\nreduce fees with respect to these debit card transactions.\nFederal Securities Law. The shares of Common Stock of the Bancorp have been registered with the SEC under the Exchange Act. The\nBancorp is subject to the periodic reporting, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements of the Exchange Act and the\nrules of the SEC promulgated there under. If the Bancorp has fewer than 1,200 record shareholders, it may deregister its shares under the\nExchange Act and cease to be subject to the foregoing requirements.\nShares of the Bancorp's Common Stock held by persons who are affiliates of the Bancorp may not be resold without registration unless sold\nin accordance with the resale restrictions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933. If the Bancorp meets the current public information\nrequirements under Rule 144, each affiliate of the Bancorp who complies with the other conditions of Rule 144 (including those that require the\naffiliate’s sale to be aggregated with those of certain other persons) would be able to sell in the public market, without registration, a number of\nshares not to exceed, in any three-month period, the greater of (i) 1% of the outstanding shares of the Bancorp or (ii) the average weekly volume\nof trading in such shares during the preceding four calendar weeks.\nUnder the Dodd-Frank Act, the Bancorp is required to provide its shareholders an opportunity to vote on the executive compensation\npayable to its named executive officers and on golden parachute payments in connection with mergers and acquisitions. These votes are non-\nbinding and advisory. At least once every six years, the Bancorp must also permit shareholders to determine on an advisory basis whether such\nvotes should be held every one, two, or three years.\nFederal Reserve Monetary Policies. The Bancorp’s earnings and growth, as well as the earnings and growth of the banking industry in\ngeneral, are affected by the monetary and credit policies of monetary authorities, including the FRB. An important function of the FRB is to\nregulate the national supply of bank credit in order to combat recession and curb inflationary pressures. Among the instruments of monetary\npolicy used by the FRB to implement these objectives are open market operations in U.S. government securities, changes in reserve\nrequirements against member bank deposits, and changes in the Federal Reserve discount rate. These instruments are used in varying\ncombinations to influence overall growth of bank loans, investments, and deposits, and may also affect interest rates charged on loans or paid\nfor deposits. The monetary policies of the FRB have had a significant impact on the operating results of financial institutions in the past and are\nexpected to continue to have effects in the future.\nIn view of continually changing conditions in the national economy and in money markets, as well as the effect of credit policies by monetary and\nfiscal authorities, including the FRB, it is difficult to predict the impact of possible future changes in interest rates, deposit levels, and loan\ndemand, or their effect on the Bancorp’s business and earnings or on the financial condition of the Bancorp’s various customers.\nOther Future Legislation and Change in Regulations. Various other legislation, including proposals to expand or contract the powers of\nbanking institutions and bank holding companies, is from time to time introduced. This legislation may change banking statutes and the operating\nenvironment of the Bancorp and the Bank in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost\nof doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions and\nother financial institutions. The Bancorp cannot accurately predict whether any of this potential legislation will ultimately be enacted, and, if\nenacted, the ultimate effect that it, or implementing regulations, would have upon the financial condition or results of operations of the Bancorp or\nthe Bank.\n31 of 113\nFederal Taxation\nFor federal income tax purposes, the Bank reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting. The Bancorp and the\nBank file a consolidated federal income tax return for each fiscal year ending December 31.\nState Taxation\nThe Bank is subject to Indiana’s Financial Institutions Tax (“FIT”), which is imposed at a flat rate on “adjusted gross income,” subject to\nscheduled decreases as described herein. For 2022, this rate was 5.0%, and for 2023 and thereafter the rate will be 4.9%. Additionally, the Bank\nis subject to Illinois state tax which is imposed at a flat rate of 9.5%. “Adjusted gross income,” for purposes of the FIT begins with taxable income\nas defined by Section 63 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) and, thus, incorporates federal tax law to the extent\nthat it affects the computation of taxable income. Federal taxable income is then adjusted by several Indiana and Illinois modifications. Other\napplicable state taxes include generally applicable sales and use taxes plus real and personal property taxes.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nAt December 31, 2022, the Bancorp has consolidated total deferred tax assets of $32.7 million and consolidated total deferred tax liabilities\nof $3.5 million, resulting in a consolidated net deferred tax asset of $29.2 million. The Bancorp does not have a valuation allowance associated\nwith the deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2022.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock involves risks. Before making any decision whether to invest in our common stock, you should carefully\nconsider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this report. These risks are not the only ones we will\nface. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business operations, financial condition,\nand results of operations. Our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.\nThe trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Also, please read\n“Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”\nRisks Related to Our Business\nAs a financial institution, the Bancorp is subject to a number of risks relating to its daily business.\nAs a financial institution, we are subject to a number of risks relating to our daily business. Although we undertake a variety of efforts to\nmanage and control those risks, many of the risks are outside of our control. Among the risks we face are the following:\n● Credit Risk – the risk that loan customers or other parties will be unable to perform their contractual repayment obligations.\n● Market Risk – the risk that changes in market rates and prices will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n● Liquidity Risk – the risk that the Bancorp or the Bank will have insufficient cash or access to cash to meet its operating needs.\n● Operational Risk – the risk of financial and reputational loss resulting from fraud, inadequate or failed internal processes, cyber-\nsecurity breaches, people and systems, or external events.\n● Economic Risk – the risk that the economy in our markets could decline, resulting in increased unemployment, decreased real\nestate values, and increased loan charge-offs.\n● Compliance Risk – the risk of additional action by our regulators or additional regulation that could hinder our ability to do business\nprofitably.\n32 of 113\n● Regulatory Risk – the risk presented by the need to comply with all laws, rules, and regulations from multiple regulatory agencies,\nincluding but not limited to the FDIC, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the IDFI, the FRB, the SEC, and the U.S.\nDepartment of Labor.\n● Fiduciary Risk – the risk of failing to act in our fiduciary capacity in the best interests of the grantors and beneficiaries of trust\naccounts and benefit plans.\nThe Bancorp is subject to liquidity risk in its operations, which could adversely affect the ability to fund various obligations.\nLiquidity risk is the possibility of being unable to meet obligations as they come due, pay deposits when withdrawn, capitalize on growth\nopportunities as they arise, or pay dividends because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding on a timely basis, at a\nreasonable cost and within acceptable risk tolerances. Liquidity is derived primarily from retail deposit growth and retention, principal and interest\npayments on loans and investment securities, net cash provided from operation, and access to other funding sources. Liquidity is essential to\nour business. We must maintain sufficient funds to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers. An inability to raise funds through\ndeposits, borrowings, the sale or pledging as collateral of loans and other assets could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. Our\naccess to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial\nservices industry in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our\nbusiness activity due to a market downturn, failures of other financial institutions which reduces overall market confidence in the banking and\nfinancial services industry, or regulatory action that limits or eliminates our access to alternate funding sources. Our ability to borrow could also\nbe impaired by factors that are nonspecific to us, such as severe disruption of the financial markets or negative expectations about the prospects\nfor the financial services industry, as evidenced by the recent failures of certain depository institutions and the resulting market turmoil and\nvolatility stemming from such failures.\nUnrealized losses in the Bancorp’s investment portfolio could affect liquidity.\nAs market interest rates increased during 2022 and continued into the early months of 2023, the Bancorp has experienced increased\nunrealized losses within its investment portfolio. The Bancorp’s investment portfolio consists of federal funds, interest bearing balances in other\nfinancial institutions, U.S. government securities, federal agency obligations, obligations of state and local municipalities, and corporate\nsecurities. All of the instruments held in the Bancorp’s investment portfolio are designated as available-for-sale, and many of these instruments\nare particularly sensitive to interest rate fluctuations, especially long-term fixed-income securities, including U.S. Treasury notes and bonds and\ncorporate and municipal bonds. As of December 31, 2022, the Bancorp held approximately $227.7 million of municipal securities within the\ninvestment portfolio, which comprised approximately 61.3% of the portfolio, and approximately $134.1 million of collateralized mortgage\nobligations and residential mortgage-backed securities within the portfolio, which comprised approximately 36.2% of the portfolio. From\nDecember 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022, the investment portfolio experienced unrealized losses of approximately $90.0 million, which\ncoincided with an increase by the Federal Reserve in the federal funds target rate from 0.25% as of December 31, 2021 to 4.50% as of\nDecember 31, 2022. The increase in unrealized losses is reflected in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) (AOCI) on the\nBancorp’s balance sheet and reduces the Bancorp’s book capital and tangible common equity ratio. However, unrealized losses do not affect the\nBancorp’s regulatory capital ratios.\nManagement continues to actively monitor the investment portfolio and does not currently anticipate the need to realize losses from the\ninvestment portfolio, and it is unlikely the Bancorp will be required to sell the securities before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may\nbe at maturity. However, the Bancorp’s access to liquidity sources could be affected by unrealized losses if securities within the investment\nportfolio must be sold at a loss or tangible capital ratios decline from an increase in unrealized losses or realized credit losses.\n33 of 113\nAbove average interest rate risk associated with fixed-rate loans may have an adverse effect on our financial position or results of\noperations.\nPeoples Bank’s loan portfolio includes a significant amount of loans with fixed rates of interest. At December 31, 2022, $809.7 million, or\n53.7% of the Bank’s total loans receivable had fixed interest rates. The Bank offers adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) loans and fixed-rate loans.\nUnlike ARM loans, fixed-rate loans carry the risk that, because they do not reprice to market interest rates, their yield may be insufficient to offset\nincreases in the Bank’s cost of funds during a rising interest rate environment. Accordingly, a material and prolonged increase in market interest\nrates could be expected to have a greater adverse effect on the Bank’s net interest income compared to other institutions that hold a materially\nlarger portion of their assets in ARM loans or fixed-rate loans that are originated for committed sale in the secondary market.\nHigher loan losses could require the Bancorp to increase its allowance for loan losses through a charge to earnings.\nWhen we loan money, we incur the risk that our borrowers will not repay their loans. We reserve for loan losses by establishing an allowance\nthrough a charge to earnings. The amount of this allowance is based on our assessment of loan losses inherent in our loan portfolio. The\nprocess for determining the amount of the allowance is critical to our financial results and condition. It requires subjective and complex\njudgments about the future, including forecasts of economic or market conditions that might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their\nloans. We might underestimate the loan losses inherent in our loan portfolio and have loan losses in excess of the amount reserved. We might\nincrease the allowance because of changing economic conditions. For example, in a rising interest rate environment, borrowers with adjustable\nrate loans could see their payments increase. There may be a significant increase in the number of borrowers who are unable or unwilling to\nrepay their loans, resulting in our charging off more loans and increasing our allowance. In addition, when real estate values decline, the\npotential severity of loss on a real estate-secured loan can increase significantly, especially in the case of loans with high combined loan-to-value\nratios. Our allowance for loan losses at any particular date may not be sufficient to cover future loan losses. We may be required to increase our\nallowance for loan losses, thus reducing earnings.\nCommercial business lending may expose the Bancorp to increased lending risks.\nAt December 31, 2022, the Bank’s commercial business loan portfolio amounted to $93.3 million, or 6.2% of total loans. Subject to market\nconditions and other factors, the Bank intends to expand its commercial business lending activities within its primary market areas. Commercial\nbusiness lending is inherently riskier than residential mortgage lending. Although commercial business loans are often collateralized by\nequipment, inventory, accounts receivable, or other business assets, the liquidation value of these assets in the event of a borrower default is\noften an insufficient source of repayment because accounts receivable may be uncollectible and inventories and equipment may be obsolete or\nof limited use, among other things.\nCommercial real estate lending may expose the Bancorp to increased lending risks.\nAt December 31, 2022, the Bank’s commercial real estate loan portfolio amounted to $486.4 million, or 32.2% of total loans. Commercial real\nestate lending is inherently riskier than residential mortgage lending. Because payments on loans secured by commercial properties often\ndepend upon the successful operation and management of the properties, repayment of such loans may be affected by adverse conditions in the\nreal estate market or the economy, among other things.\nOur mortgage lending profitability could be significantly reduced if we are not able to resell mortgages at a reasonable gain on sale or\nexperience other problems with the secondary market process or we are unable to retain our mortgage loan sales force due to\nregulatory changes.\nCurrently, we sell a large portion of the mortgage loans we originate. The profitability of our mortgage banking operations depends in large\npart upon our ability to aggregate a high volume of loans and to sell them in the secondary market at a gain. Thus, we are dependent upon the\nexistence of an active secondary market and our ability to profitably sell loans into that market.\n34 of 113\nOur ability to sell mortgage loans readily is dependent upon the availability of an active secondary market for single-family mortgage loans,\nwhich in turn depends in part upon the continuation of programs currently offered by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae (the “Agencies”)\nand other institutional and non-institutional investors. These entities account for a substantial portion of the secondary market in residential\nmortgage loans. Some of the largest participants in the secondary market, including the Agencies, are government-sponsored enterprises whose\nactivities are governed by federal law. Any future changes in laws that significantly affect the activity of such government-sponsored enterprises\ncould, in turn, adversely affect our operations.\nIn September 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were placed into conservatorship by the U.S. government. Although to date, the\nconservatorship has not had a significant or adverse effect on our operations, and during 2010 and 2012 the Federal Housing Finance Agency\nindicated that the Treasury Department is committed to funding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to levels needed in order to sufficiently meet their\nfunding needs, it is currently unclear whether further changes would significantly and adversely affect our operations. In addition, our ability to\nsell mortgage loans readily is dependent upon our ability to remain eligible for the programs offered by the Agencies and other institutional and\nnon-institutional investors. Our ability to remain eligible may also depend on having an acceptable peer-relative delinquency ratio for the Federal\nHousing Administration (“FHA”) and maintaining a delinquency rate with respect to Ginnie Mae pools that are below Ginnie Mae guidelines.\nAny significant impairment of our eligibility with any of the Agencies could materially and adversely affect our operations. Further, the criteria\nfor loans to be accepted under such programs may be changed from time-to-time by the sponsoring entity which could result in a lower volume\nof corresponding loan originations. The profitability of participating in specific programs may vary depending on a number of factors, including\nour administrative costs of originating and purchasing qualifying loans and our costs of meeting such criteria.\nOur mortgage lending profitability could be significantly reduced as changes in interest rates could affect mortgage origination\nvolume and pricing for selling mortgages on the secondary market.\nCurrently, we sell a large portion of the mortgage loans we originate. The profitability of our mortgage banking operations depends in large\npart upon our ability to originate and sell mortgages to the secondary market at a gain. A higher interest rate environment can negatively affect\nthe volume of loan originations and refinanced loans reducing the dollar amount of loans available to be sold to the secondary market. Higher\ninterest rates can also negatively affect the premium received on loans sold to the secondary market as competitive pressures to originate loans\ncan reduce pricing.\nOur information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security.\nThe Bank relies heavily on internal and outsourced digital technologies, communications, and information systems to conduct its business.\nAs our reliance on technology systems increases, the potential risks of technology-related operation interruptions in our customer relationship\nmanagement, general ledger, deposit, loan, or other systems or the occurrence of cyber incidents also increases. Cyber incidents can result\nfrom deliberate attacks or unintentional events including (i) unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or\nsensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruptions; (ii) denial-of-service attacks on websites; or (iii) intelligence gathering\nand social engineering aimed at obtaining information. The occurrence of operational interruption, cyber incident, or a deficiency in the cyber\nsecurity of our technology systems (internal or outsourced) could negatively impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have policies and procedures expressly designed to prevent or limit the effect of a failure, interruption, or security breach of our systems\nand maintain cyber security insurance. However, such policies, procedures, or insurance may prove insufficient to prevent, repel, or mitigate a\ncyber incident. Significant interruptions to our business from technology issues could result in expensive remediation efforts and distraction of\nmanagement. Although we have not experienced any material losses related to a technology-related operational interruption or cyber-attack,\nthere can be no assurance that such failures, interruptions, or security breaches will not occur in the future or, if they do occur, that the impact\nwill not be substantial.\n35 of 113\nThe occurrence of any failures, interruptions, or security breaches of our technology systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of\ncustomer business, result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss, or destruction of proprietary information, subject us to\nadditional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on\nour financial condition, results of operations, or stock price. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may also be required to spend significant\nadditional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security\nvulnerabilities.\nWe are subject to certain operational risks, including, but not limited to, customer or employee fraud and data processing system\nfailures and errors.\nEmployee errors and employee and/or customer misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm\nour reputation or financial performance. Misconduct by our employees could include, but is not limited to, hiding unauthorized activities from us,\nimproper or unauthorized activities on behalf of our customers, or improper use of confidential information. It is not always possible to prevent\nemployee errors and misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Employee\nerrors could also subject us to financial claims for negligence.\nWe maintain a system of internal controls and insurance coverage to mitigate against operational risks, including data processing system\nfailures and errors and customer or employee fraud. If our internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence, or if any resulting loss is not\ninsured or exceeds applicable insurance limits, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\nWe depend on outside third parties for processing and handling of our records and data.\nThe Bank relies on software developed by third party vendors to process various transactions. In some cases, we have contracted with third\nparties to run their proprietary software on our behalf. These systems include, but are not limited to, general ledger, payroll, employee benefits,\nloan and deposit processing, and securities portfolio management. While we perform a review of controls instituted by the vendors over these\nprograms in accordance with industry standards and perform our own testing of user controls, we must rely on the continued maintenance of\nthese controls by the outside party, including safeguards over the security of customer data. In addition, we maintain backups of key processing\noutput daily in the event of a failure on the part of any of these systems. Nonetheless, we may incur a temporary disruption in the ability to\nconduct our business or process our transactions or incur damage to our reputation if the third party vendor fails to adequately maintain internal\ncontrols or institute necessary changes to systems. Such disruption or breach of security may have a material adverse effect on our financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nWe continually encounter technological change.\nThe banking and financial services industry continually undergoes technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-\ndriven products and services. In addition to better meeting customer needs, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables\nfinancial institutions to reduce costs. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to address the needs of our customers by using\ntechnology to provide products and services that enhance customer convenience and that create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many\nof our competitors have greater resources to invest in technological improvements, and we may not effectively implement new technology-driven\nproducts and services or do so as quickly as our competitors, which could reduce our ability to effectively compete. Failure to successfully keep\npace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,\nand results of operations.\nWe may not be able to attract and retain skilled people.\nThe Bank’s success depends on its ability to attract and retain skilled people. Competition for the best people in most activities in which we\nengage can be intense, and we may not be able to hire people or retain them. The unexpected loss of services of certain of our skilled personnel\ncould have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills, knowledge of our market, years of industry experience, customer\nrelationships, and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.\n36 of 113\nLoss of key employees may disrupt relationships with certain customers.\nOur customer relationships are critical to the success of our business, and loss of key employees with significant customer relationships may\nlead to the loss of business if the customers were to follow that employee to a competitor. While we believe our relationships with key personnel\nare strong, we cannot guarantee that all of our key personnel will remain with the organization, which could result in the loss of some of our\ncustomers and could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future, and such capital may not be available when needed or at all.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future to fund acquisitions and to provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to\nmeet our commitments, regulatory capital requirements, and business needs, particularly if our asset quality or earnings were to deteriorate\nsignificantly. We periodically explore acquisition opportunities with other financial institutions, some of which may be in a less favorable financial\ncondition than we are. Any future acquisition, particularly the acquisition of a significantly troubled institution or an institution of comparable size\nto us, may require us to raise additional capital in order to obtain regulatory approval and/or to remain well capitalized.\nOur ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on, among other things, conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are\noutside of our control, and our financial performance. Economic conditions and the loss of confidence in financial institutions may increase our\ncost of funding and limit access to certain customary sources of capital, including inter-bank borrowings, repurchase agreements, and\nborrowings from the discount window of the Federal Reserve.\nWe cannot guarantee that such capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all. Any occurrence that may limit our access to the capital\nmarkets, such as a decline in the confidence of debt purchasers, our depositors or counterparties participating in the capital markets, may\nadversely affect our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and, in turn, our liquidity. Moreover, if we need to raise capital in the future, we\nmay have to do so when many other financial institutions are also seeking to raise capital and would have to compete with those institutions for\ninvestors. An inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a materially adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations and may restrict our ability to grow.\nWe may be exposed to risk of environmental liabilities with respect to real property to which we take title.\nIn the course of our business, we may own or foreclose and take title to real estate, and could be subject to environmental liabilities with\nrespect to these properties (including liabilities for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in\nconnection with environmental contamination), or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances, or chemical\nreleases at a property.\nWe are exposed to intangible asset risk in that our goodwill may become impaired.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had $27.2 million of goodwill and other intangible assets. A significant and sustained decline in our stock price\nand market capitalization, a significant decline in our expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the business climate, or slower\ngrowth rates could result in impairment of goodwill. If we were to conclude that a future write-down of our goodwill is necessary, then we would\nrecord the appropriate charge, which could be materially adverse to our operating results and financial position. For further discussion, see\nNotes 1 and 6, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” and “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements included in Item 8 this report.\n37 of 113\nDamage to our reputation could damage our business.\nOur business depends upon earning and maintaining the trust and confidence of our customers, investors, and employees. Damage to our\nreputation could cause significant harm to our business and prospects. Harm to our reputation can arise from numerous sources, including,\namong others, employee misconduct, compliance failures, litigation, regulatory outcomes, or governmental investigations. In addition, a failure to\ndeliver appropriate standards of service and quality, or a failure or perceived failure to treat customers and clients fairly, can result in customer\ndissatisfaction, litigation, privacy breach, and heightened regulatory scrutiny, all of which can lead to lost revenue, higher operating costs, and\nharm to our reputation. Adverse publicity about the Bancorp, whether or not true, may result in harm to our existing business, customer\nrelationships and prospects. Should any events or factors that can undermine our reputation occur, there is no assurance that the additional\ncosts and expenses that we may need to incur to address the issues giving rise to the reputational harm would not adversely affect our earnings\nand results of operations.\nPotential acquisitions may disrupt our business and dilute stockholder value.\nWe periodically evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other\nfinancial institutions and financial services companies. We generally seek merger or acquisition partners that are culturally similar and possess\neither significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management, economies of scale, or expanded\nservices. Acquiring other banks, businesses, or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among other\nthings:\n● potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company;\n● exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company;\n● potential disruption to our business;\n● potential diversion of our management’s time and attention away from day-to-day operations;\n● the possible loss of key employees, business, and customers of the target company;\n● difficulty in estimating the value of the target company; and\n● potential problems in integrating the target company’s data processing and ancillary systems, customers, and employees with ours.\nAs a result, merger or acquisition discussions and, in some cases, negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving\nthe payment of cash or the issuance of our debt or equity securities may occur at any time. Acquisitions typically involve the payment of a\npremium over book, and, therefore, some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with\nany future transaction. To the extent we were to issue additional shares of common stock in any such transaction, our current shareholders\nwould be diluted and such an issuance may have the effect of decreasing our stock price, perhaps significantly. Furthermore, failure to realize\nthe expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits from an acquisition\ncould have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, merger and acquisition costs incurred by the\nBancorp may temporarily increase operating expenses.\n38 of 113\nRisks Related to the Banking Industry\nOur business may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally.\nOur financial performance depends to a large extent on the business environment in our geographically concentrated eight-county market\narea of Lake, Porter, LaPorte, and Newton counties in Indiana, and Cook, DuPage, Lake, and Will counties in Illinois, the nearby suburban\nmetropolitan Chicagoland market, the states of Indiana and Illinois, and the U.S. as a whole. In particular, the current environment impacts the\nability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans as well as the value of collateral securing those loans. A favorable\nbusiness environment is generally characterized by economic growth, low unemployment, efficient capital markets, low inflation, high business\nand investor confidence, strong business earnings, and other factors. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused\nby declines in economic growth, business activity, or investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of\ncredit and capital; increases in inflation or interest rates; high unemployment; natural disasters; or a combination of these or other factors.\nIn the recent past, our market area, the suburban metropolitan Chicagoland market, the states of Indiana and Illinois, and the U.S. as a\nwhole experienced a downward economic cycle. Significant weakness in market conditions adversely impacted all aspects of the economy.\nBusiness activity across a wide range of industries and regions was greatly reduced, and local governments and many businesses experienced\nserious difficulty due to the lack of consumer spending and the lack of liquidity in the credit markets. In addition, unemployment increased\nsignificantly during that period, which further contributed to the adverse business environment for households and businesses.\nWhile economic conditions have improved, significant challenges remain, including continued elevated inflation levels and recent uncertainty\nin the financial institutions industry. As a result, there can be no assurance that the economic recovery will continue, and future deterioration\nwould likely exacerbate the adverse effects of recent difficult market conditions on us and others in the financial institutions industry. Market\nstress could have a material adverse effect on the credit quality of our loans, and therefore, our financial condition and results of operations as\nwell as other potential adverse impacts including:\n● There could be an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies, lack of consumer confidence, increased market\nvolatility, and widespread reduction of business activity generally.\n● There could be an increase in write-downs of asset values by financial institutions, such as the Bank.\n● There could be the loss of collateral value on commercial and real estate loans that are secured by real estate located in our market\narea. A further significant decline in real estate values in our market would mean that the collateral for many of our loans would\nprovide less security. As a result, we would be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans because our ability to fully recover on\ndefaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral would be diminished.\n● Our ability to assess the creditworthiness of customers could be impaired if the models and approaches they use to select, manage,\nand underwrite credits become less predictive of future performance.\n● The process we use to estimate losses inherent in our loan portfolio requires difficult, subjective, and complex judgments. This\nprocess includes analysis of economic conditions and the impact of these economic conditions on borrowers’ ability to repay their\nloans. The process could no longer be capable of accurate estimation and may, in turn, impact its reliability.\n● The Bank could be required to pay significantly higher FDIC premiums in the future if losses further deplete the Deposit Insurance\nFund.\n● We could face increased competition due to intensified consolidation of the financial services industry. If current levels of market\ndisruption and volatility continue or worsen, there can be no assurance that we will not experience an adverse effect, which may be\nmaterial, on our ability to access capital and on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFuture economic conditions in our market area will depend on factors outside of our control, such as political and market conditions, broad\ntrends in industry and finance, legislative and regulatory changes, changes in government, military, and fiscal policies, and inflation.\n39 of 113\nConcern by customers over deposit insurance may cause a decrease in deposits and changes in the mix of funding sources available\nto the Bancorp.\nWith increased concerns regarding certain recent high profile bank failures, customers increasingly are concerned about the extent to which\ntheir deposits are insured by the FDIC. Customers may have insecurity regarding the extent to which their deposits exceed the current FDIC\ndeposit insurance threshold of $250,000 per depositor and therefore are uninsured. The FDIC has extended deposit insurance relief to\nuninsured depositors in certain recent high profile bank failures, but there is no assurance the FDIC will extend such relief in connection with any\nother failure of a financial institution, which may cause uncertainty among customers regarding the safety of their deposits. Customers may\nwithdraw deposits in an effort to ensure the amount they have on deposit with their bank is fully insured and some may seek deposit products or\nother bank savings and investment products that are collateralized. Decreases in deposits and changes in the mix of funding sources,\nparticularly in light of recent high profile bank failures and customers’ responses to such events, may adversely affect the Bancorp’s liquidity,\nfunding costs, and net income.\nTurmoil in the financial markets could result in lower fair values for our investment securities.\nMajor disruptions in the capital markets experienced in recent years have adversely affected investor demand for all classes of securities,\nexcluding U.S. Treasury securities, and resulted in volatility in the fair values of our investment securities. Significant prolonged reduced investor\ndemand could manifest itself in lower fair values for these securities and may result in recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment\n(“OTTI”), which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nMunicipal securities can also be impacted by the business environment of their geographic location. Although this type of security historically\nexperiences extremely low default rates, municipal securities are subject to systemic risk since cash flows generally depend on (i) the ability of\nthe issuing authority to levy and collect taxes; or (ii) the ability of the issuer to charge for and collect payment for essential services rendered. If\nthe issuer defaults on its payments, it may result in the recognition of OTTI or a total loss, which could have a material adverse effect on our\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nWe face strong competition in all phases of our business from other banks, financial institutions, and non-banks.\nThe banking and financial services business in our market areas is highly competitive. Our competitors include large regional banks, local\ncommunity banks, savings and loan associations, securities and brokerage companies, mortgage companies, insurance companies, finance\ncompanies, money market mutual funds, credit unions, neo-banks (a digital or mobile-only bank that exists without any physical bank branches),\nand other non-bank financial and digital service providers, many of which have greater financial, marketing, and technological resources than us.\nMany of these competitors are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions that we are and may be able to compete more effectively as a\nresult.\nAlso, technology and other changes have lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for customers to complete financial transactions\nusing neo-banks, non-banks, and financial technology (“FinTech”) companies that historically have involved banks at one or both ends of the\ntransaction. These entities now offer products and services traditionally provided by community banks and often at lower costs. The wide\nacceptance of Internet-based commerce has resulted in a number of alternative payment processing systems, deposit, and lending platforms in\nwhich banks play only minor roles. For example, consumers can maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in\nbrokerage accounts or mutual funds. Consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and/or transferring funds directly without\nthe assistance of banks. Use of emerging alternative payment platforms, such as Apple Pay or Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, can alter\nconsumer credit card behavior and consequently impact our interchange fee income.\n40 of 113\nThe process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as “disintermediation,” could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss\nof customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. The effects of disintermediation can also impact the lending\nbusiness because of the fast growing body of FinTech companies that use software to deliver mortgage lending and other financial services. A\nrelated risk is the migration of bank personnel away from the traditional bank environments into neo-banks, FinTech companies, and other non-\nbanks.\nIncreased competition in our market may result in a decrease in the amounts of our loans and deposits, reduced spreads between loan rates\nand deposit rates or loan terms that are more favorable to the borrower. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our ability\nto maintain our earnings record, grow our loan portfolios, and obtain low-cost funds. If increased competition causes us to significantly discount\nthe interest rates we offer on loans or increase the amount we pay on deposits, our net interest income could be adversely impacted. If\nincreased competition causes us to relax our underwriting standards, we could be exposed to higher losses from lending activities. Additionally,\nmany of our competitors are larger in total assets and capitalization, have greater access to capital markets, and offer a broader range of\nfinancial services than we can offer.\nThe Bancorp also is experiencing an increase in competition to acquire other banks, due to the overall strength of financial institutions and\ntheir high capital levels. In addition, credit unions and FinTech companies are now actively pursuing small bank acquisitions. Increased\ncompetition for bank acquisitions may slow the Bancorp’s ability to grow earning assets at comparable historical growth rates.\nWe are subject to federal regulations that seek to protect the Deposit Insurance Fund and the depositors and borrowers of the Bank,\nand our federal regulators may impose restrictions on our operations that are detrimental to holders of the Bancorp’s common stock.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision, and examination by the FRB, IDFI, and FDIC, our primary regulators. Such regulation\nand supervision governs the activities in which an institution and its holding company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of\nthe insurance fund and the depositors and borrowers of the Bank rather than for holders of the Bancorp’s common stock. Our regulators may\nsubject us to supervisory and enforcement actions, such as the imposition of certain restrictions on our operations, requirements that we take\nremedial action, the classification of our assets and the determination of the level of our allowance for loan losses, that are aimed at protecting\nthe insurance fund and the depositors and borrowers of the Bank but that are detrimental to holders of the Bancorp’s common stock. Any change\nin our regulation or oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation, or supervisory action, may have a material impact\non our operations.\nAcquisitions and the addition of branch facilities may not produce revenue enhancements or cost savings at levels or within\ntimeframes originally anticipated and may result in unforeseen integration difficulties and dilution to existing shareholder value.\nWe regularly explore opportunities to establish branch facilities and acquire other banks or financial institutions. New or acquired branch\nfacilities and other facilities may not be profitable. We may not be able to correctly identify profitable locations for new branches. The costs to\nstart up new branch facilities or to acquire existing branches, and the additional costs to operate these facilities, may increase our noninterest\nexpense and decrease earnings in the short term. It may be difficult to adequately and profitably manage growth through the establishment of\nthese branches. In addition, we can provide no assurance that these branch sites will successfully attract enough deposits to offset the expenses\nof operating these branch sites. Any new or acquired branches will be subject to regulatory approval, and there can be no assurance that we will\nsucceed in securing such approvals.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to many\ndifferent industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including\nbrokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions\nexpose us to credit risk in the event of default by our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral\nheld by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us. There is\nno assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations or earnings. In addition, failures of other\nfinancial institutions, including regional and community banks, could decrease customer confidence in the banking industry as a whole and\ncommunity banks in particular. Reduced confidence in the financial institutions sector could result in customer disintermediation and the loss of\ndeposit and borrowing relationships, among other effects, which could result in a material adverse effect on the Bancorp’s financial condition and\nresults of operations.\n41 of 113\nRisks Related to the Bancorp’s Common Stock\nAn investment in the Bancorp’s common stock is not an insured deposit.\nThe Bancorp’s common stock is not a bank deposit and, therefore, is not insured against loss by the FDIC, any other deposit insurance fund,\nor by any other public or private entity. Investment in the Bancorp’s common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described in this “Risk\nFactors” section and elsewhere in this prospectus and is subject to the same market forces that affect the price of common stock in any public\ncompany. As a result, if you acquire the Bancorp’s common stock, you could lose some or all of your investment.\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate, sometimes significantly, and this may make it difficult for you to resell our common\nstock at times or at prices you find attractive.\nAlthough our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, our stock price constantly changes, and we expect our stock price to\ncontinue to fluctuate in the future. Our stock price is impacted by a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors\ninclude:\n● variations in our operating results or the quality of our assets;\n● operating results that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts, and investors;\n● increases in loan losses, non-performing loans, and other real estate owned;\n● changes in the U.S. corporate tax rates;\n● changes in expectations as to our future financial performance;\n● announcements of new products, strategic developments, new technology, acquisitions, and other material events by us or our\ncompetitors;\n● ability to fund the Bancorp’s assets through core deposits and/or wholesale funding;\n● the operating and securities price performance of other companies that investors believe are comparable to us;\n● actual or anticipated sales of our equity or equity-related securities;\n● our past and future dividend practices;\n● our creditworthiness;\n● interest rates;\n● the credit, mortgage, and housing markets, and the markets for securities relating to mortgages or housing;\n● developments with respect to financial institutions generally; and\n42 of 113\n● economic, financial, geopolitical, regulatory, congressional, or judicial events that affect us or the financial markets.\nIn addition, the stock market in general has experienced price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the\nmarket price of securities issued by many companies and particularly those in the financial services and banking sector, including for reasons\nunrelated to their operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect our stock price, notwithstanding our operating\nresults.\nThe trading volume in the Bancorp’s common stock is less than that of other larger financial institutions.\nAlthough the Bancorp’s common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, the trading volume in the common stock may be less than that\nof other, larger financial services companies. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity, and orderliness\ndepends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of the Bancorp’s common stock at any given time. This presence\ndepends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which the Bancorp has no control. During\nany period of lower trading volume of the Bancorp’s common stock, significant sales of shares of the Bancorp’s common stock, or the\nexpectation of these sales, could cause the Bancorp’s common stock price to fall.\nThe Bancorp’s Articles of Incorporation, Indiana law, and certain banking laws may have an anti-takeover effect.\nProvisions of the Bancorp’s Articles of Incorporation, the Indiana Business Corporation Law, and the federal banking laws, including\nregulatory approval requirements, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the Bancorp, even if doing so would be perceived to be\nbeneficial by the Bancorp’s shareholders. The combination of these provisions could have the effect of inhibiting a non-negotiated merger or\nother business combination, which, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of the Bancorp’s common stock.\nThe Bancorp may issue additional securities, which could dilute the ownership percentage of holders of the Bancorp’s common stock.\nThe Bancorp may issue additional securities to, among other reasons, raise additional capital or finance acquisitions, and, if it does, the\nownership percentage of holders of the Bancorp’s common stock could be diluted potentially materially.\nWe may not be able to pay dividends in the future in accordance with past practice.\nThe Bancorp has traditionally paid a quarterly dividend to common shareholders. The payment of dividends is subject to legal and regulatory\nrestrictions. Any payment of dividends in the future will depend, in large part, on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, and other\nfactors considered relevant by the Bancorp’s board of directors. The board may, at its discretion, reduce or eliminate dividends or change its\ndividend policy in the future.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNot applicable.\nItem 2. Properties\nThe Bancorp maintains its corporate office at 9204 Columbia Avenue, Munster, Indiana, from which it oversees the operation of the Bank’s\n26 banking locations. The Bancorp owns all of its office properties.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Bank operated 14 branches in Northwest Indiana, with 13 of the branches located in Lake County and 1\nbranch located in Porter County, Indiana, and 12 branches located in Cook County, Illinois. The Bank owns all of its branch properties. All of the\nBank’s branches are equipped with automated teller machines and have drive-through facilities.\nThe Bank outsources its core processing activities to Fidelity National Information Services, Inc., or FIS Corporation located in Jacksonville,\nFlorida. FIS provides real time services for loans, deposits, retail delivery systems, card solutions, digital banking, and wealth management. The\nnet book value of the Bank’s property, premises and equipment totaled $40.2 million at December 31, 2022.\n43 of 113\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings\nThe Bancorp and its subsidiaries, from time to time, are involved in legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business against its debtors\nand are defendants in legal actions arising from normal business activities. Management, after consultation with legal counsel believes that the\nultimate liabilities, if any, resulting from these actions will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Bank or on the\nconsolidated financial position of the Bancorp.\nItem 4.

[Reserved]\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGeneral\nThe Bancorp's earnings are dependent upon the earnings of the Bank. The Bank's earnings are primarily dependent upon net interest\nmargin. The net interest margin is the difference between interest income earned on loans and investments and interest expense paid on\ndeposits and borrowings stated as a percentage of average interest earning assets. The net interest margin is perhaps the clearest indicator of a\nfinancial institution's ability to generate core earnings. Fees and service charges, wealth management operations income, gains and losses from\nthe sale of assets, provisions for loan losses, income taxes and operating expenses also affect the Bancorp's profitability.\nA summary of the Bancorp’s significant accounting policies are detailed in Note 1 to the Bancorp’s consolidated financial statements\nincluded in this report. Preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America\nrequires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosure of contingent\nassets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period, as\nwell as the disclosures provided. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates associated with the allowance for loan losses are\nparticularly susceptible to material change in the near term.\nAt December 31, 2022, the Bancorp had total assets of $2.1 billion and total deposits of $1.8 billion. The Bancorp's deposit accounts are\ninsured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) that is administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), an\nagency of the federal government. At December 31, 2022, stockholders' equity totaled $136.4 million, with book value per share at $31.73. Net\nincome for 2022 was $15.1 million, or $3.60 diluted earnings per common share. The return on average assets was 0.74%, while the return on\naverage stockholders’ equity was 10.47%.\nOn January 31, 2022, the Bancorp completed its acquisition of Royal Financial, Inc. (“RYFL”) pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger\ndated July 28, 2021 (the “Merger Agreement”) between the Bancorp and RYFL. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, RYFL merged\nwith and into the Bancorp, with the Bancorp as the surviving corporation (the “RYFL Merger”). Simultaneous with the RYFL Merger, Royal\nSavings Bank, an Illinois state-chartered savings bank and wholly-owned subsidiary of RYFL, merged with and into the Bank, with the Bank as\nthe surviving institution.\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, RYFL stockholders who owned 101 or more shares of RYFL common stock were permitted to\nelect to receive either 0.4609 shares of Finward common stock or $20.14 in cash, or a combination of both, for each share of RYFL common\nstock owned, subject to proration and allocation provisions, such that 65% of the shares of RYFL common stock outstanding immediately prior to\nthe closing of the merger were converted into the right to receive shares of Finward common stock and the remaining 35% of the outstanding\nRYFL shares were converted into the right to receive cash. Stockholders holding less than 101 shares of RYFL common stock received fixed\nconsideration of $20.14 in cash and no stock consideration for each share of RYFL common stock.\nAs a result of RYFL stockholder stock and cash elections and the related allocation and proration provisions of the Merger Agreement,\nFinward issued 795,423 shares of its common stock and paid cash consideration of approximately $18.7 million in the RYFL Merger. Based on\nthe closing price of Finward’s common stock on January 28, 2022, the transaction had an implied valuation of approximately $56.7 million. The\nacquisition further expanded the Bank’s banking center network in Cook County and DuPage County, Illinois, expanding the Bank’s full-service\nretail banking network.\n47 of 113\nFinancial Condition\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, total assets increased by $449.6 million (27.7%), to $2.1 billion, with interest-earning assets\nincreasing by $382.4 million (25.1%). At December 31, 2022, interest‑earning assets totaled $1.9 billion and represented 92.1% of total assets.\nLoans totaled $1.5 billion and represented 79.4% of interest-earning assets, 73.1% of total assets and 85.3% of total deposits. The loan portfolio,\nwhich is the Bancorp’s largest asset, is a significant source of both interest and fee income.\nDecember 31, December 31,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2022 2021\nBalance % Loans Balance % Loans\nResidential real estate $ 484,595 32.1% 260,134 27.1%\nHome equity 38,978 2.6% 34,612 3.6%\nCommercial real estate 486,431 32.2% 317,145 33.0%\nConstruction and land development 108,926 7.2% 123,822 12.9%\nMultifamily 251,014 16.6% 61,194 6.4%\nConsumer 918 0.1% 582 0.1%\nManufactured Homes 34,882 2.3% 37,887 3.9%\nCommercial business 93,278 6.2% 115,772 12.1%\nGovernment 9,549 0.7% 8,991 0.9%\nLoans receivable 1,508,571 100.0% 960,139 100.0%\nPlus:\nNet deferred loans origination costs 5,083 6,810\nUndisbursed loan funds (23) (229)\nLoans receivable, net of deferred fees and costs $ 1,513,631 $ 966,720\nAdjustable rate loans / loans receivable $ 698,842 46.3% $ 542,975 56.6%\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2022 2021\nLoans receivable to total assets 73.1% 59.6%\nLoans receivable to earning assets 79.4% 63.4%\nLoans receivable to total deposits 85.3% 67.4%\nThe Bancorp is primarily a portfolio lender. Mortgage banking activities historically have been limited to the sale of fixed rate mortgage loans\nwith contractual maturities greater than 15 years. These loans are identified as held for sale when originated and sold, on a loan-by-loan basis,\nin the secondary market. The Bancorp will also retain fixed rate mortgage loans with a contractual maturity greater than 15 years on a limited\nbasis. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the Bancorp originated $44.9 million in new fixed rate mortgage loans for sale,\ncompared to $153.1 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the\nBancorp originated $105.4 million in new mortgage loans retained in its portfolio, compared to $45.1 million during the twelve months ended\nDecember 31, 2021. These retained loans are primarily construction loans and adjustable-rate loans with a fixed-rate period of 7 years or less,\nand the Bank continues to sell longer-duration fixed rate mortgages into the secondary market. Net gains realized from the mortgage loan sales\ntotaled $1.4 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $5.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021.\nAt December 31, 2022, the Bancorp had $1.5 million in loans that were classified as held for sale, compared to $5.0 million at December 31,\n2021.\nNon-performing loans include those loans that are 90 days or more past due and accruing and those loans that have been placed on non-\naccrual status. At December 31, 2022, all non-performing loans are also accounted for on a non-accrual basis, except for two residential real\nestate loans totaling $166 thousand, and one consumer manufactured loan totaling $82 thousand that remained accruing and more than 90 days\npast due.\n48 of 113\nThe Bancorp's nonperforming loans are summarized below:\n(Dollars in thousands)\nDecember 31, December 31,\nLoan Segment 2022 2021\nResidential real estate $ 5,513 $ 4,682\nHome equity 594 657\nCommercial real estate 3,242 1,031\nConstruction and land development - -\nMultifamily 7,064 455\nCommercial business 1,881 436\nConsumer - -\nManufactured homes 82 -\nGovernment - -\nTotal $ 18,376 $ 7,261\nNonperforming loans to total loans 1.21% 0.75%\nNonperforming loans to total assets 0.89% 0.45%\nSubstandard loans include non-performing loans and potential problem loans, where information about possible credit issues or other\nconditions causes management to question the ability of such borrowers to comply with loan covenants or repayment terms.

Typically, management does not individually classify smaller-balance\nhomogeneous loans, such as residential mortgages or consumer loans, as impaired, unless they are troubled debt restructurings.\nPurchased loans acquired in a business combination are recorded at estimated fair value on their purchase date. Purchased loans with\nevidence of credit quality deterioration since origination are considered purchased credit impaired loans. Expected future cash flows at the\npurchase date in excess of the fair value of loans are recorded as interest income over the life of the loans if the timing and amount of the future\ncash flows is reasonably estimable (“accretable yield”). The difference between contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to\nbe collected at acquisition is referred to as the non-accretable difference and represents probable losses in the portfolio. In determining the\nacquisition date fair value of purchased credit impaired loans, and in subsequent accounting, the Bancorp aggregates these purchased loans\ninto pools of loans by common risk characteristics, such as credit risk rating and loan type. Subsequent to the purchase date, increases in cash\nflows over those expected at the purchase date are recognized as interest income prospectively. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash\nflows will generally result in a provision for loan losses.\nThe Bancorp's impaired loans, including purchased credit impaired loans, are summarized below:\n(Dollars in thousands)\nDecember 31, December 31,\nLoan Segment 2022 2021\nResidential real estate $ 2,506 $ 1,771\nHome equity 419 284\nCommercial real estate 5,327 1,600\nConstruction and land development - -\nMultifamily 7,121 556\nCommercial business 2,711 1,597\nConsumer 17 -\nManufactured homes - -\nGovernment - -\nTotal $ 18,101 $ 5,808\nAt times, the Bancorp will modify the terms of a loan to forego a portion of interest or principal or reduce the interest rate on the loan to a rate\nmaterially less than market rates, or materially extend the maturity date of a loan as part of a troubled debt restructuring. The valuation basis for\nthe Bancorp’s troubled debt restructurings is based on the present value of expected future cash flows; unless consistent cash flows are not\npresent, then the fair value of the collateral securing the loan is the basis for valuation.\n50 of 113\nThe Bancorp's troubled debt restructured loans are summarized below:\n(Dollars in thousands)\nDecember 31, December 31,\nLoan Segment 2022 2021\nResidential real estate $ 1,190 $ 342\nHome equity 261 83\nCommercial real estate 1,984 747\nConstruction and land development - -\nMultifamily - -\nCommercial business 476 694\nConsumer - -\nManufactured homes - -\nGovernment - -\nTotal $ 3,911 $ 1,866\nAt December 31, 2022, management is of the opinion that there are no loans, except certain of those discussed above, where known\ninformation about possible credit problems of borrowers causes management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to\ncomply with the present loan repayment terms and which will imminently result in such loans being classified as past due, non-accrual or a\ntroubled debt restructure. Management does not presently anticipate that any of the non-performing loans or classified loans would materially\naffect future operations, liquidity or capital resources.\nThe allowance for loan losses (ALL) is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit losses, increased by the provision for loan losses,\nand decreased by charge-offs net of recoveries. A loan is charged off against the allowance by management as a loss when deemed\nuncollectible, although collection efforts continue and future recoveries may occur. The determination of the amounts of the ALL and provisions\nfor loan losses is based on management’s current judgments about the credit quality of the loan portfolio with consideration given to all known\nrelevant internal and external factors that affect loan collectability as of the reporting date. The appropriateness of the current period provision\nand the overall adequacy of the ALL are determined through a disciplined and consistently applied quarterly process that reviews the Bancorp’s\ncurrent credit risk within the loan portfolio and identifies the required allowance for loan losses given the current risk estimates.\nThe Bancorp's provision for loan losses for the twelve months ended are summarized below:\n(Dollars in thousands)\nDecember 31, December 31,\nLoan Segment 2022 2021\nResidential real estate $ 517 $ 220\nHome equity 53 81\nCommercial real estate 700 639\nConstruction and land development (866) 714\nMultifamily 159 222\nCommercial business (676) (377)\nConsumer 113 10\nManufactured homes - -\nGovernment - -\nTotal $ - $ 1,509\n51 of 113\nThe Bancorp's charge-off and recovery information is summarized below:\n(Dollars in thousands)\nAs of the twelve months ended December 31, 2022\nLoan Segment Charge-off Recoveries Net Charge-offs\nResidential real estate $ (29) $ 53 $ 24\nHome equity - - -\nCommercial real estate (431) - (431)\nConstruction and land development - - -\nMultifamily - - -\nCommercial business (57) 89 32\nConsumer (91) 20 (71)\nManufactured homes - -\nGovernment - - -\nTotal $ (608) $ 162 $ (446)\nThe ALL provisions take into consideration management’s current judgments about the credit quality of the loan portfolio, loan portfolio\nbalances, changes in the portfolio mix and local economic conditions. In determining the provision for loan losses for the current period,\nmanagement has considered risks associated with the local economy, changes in loan balances and mix, and asset quality.\nIn addition, management considers reserves that are not part of the ALL that have been established from acquisition activity. The Bancorp\nacquired loans for which there was evidence of credit quality deterioration since origination and it was determined that it was probable that the\nBancorp would be unable to collect all contractually required principal and interest payments. At December 31, 2022, total purchased credit\nimpaired loans nonaccretable and accretable discount totaled $1.5 million compared to $1.4 million at December 31, 2021. Additionally, the\nBancorp has acquired loans where there was no evidence of credit quality deterioration since origination and has marked these loans to their fair\nvalues. As part of the fair value of loans receivable, a net fair value discount was established for loans acquired and has a balance of $5.5 million\nat December 31, 2022, compared to $1.1 million at December 31, 2021. Details on these fair value marks and the additional reserves created\ncan be found in Note 4, Loans Receivable.\nA deferred cost reserve is maintained for the portfolio of manufactured home loans that have been purchased. This reserve is available for\nuse for manufactured home loan nonperformance and costs associated with nonperformance. If the segment performs in line with expectation,\nthe deferred cost reserve is paid as an origination cost to the third party originator of the loan.\nThe Bancorp's allowance to total loans and non-performing loans are\nsummarized below:\n(Dollars in thousands)\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2022 2021\nAllowance for loan losses $ 12,897 $ 13,343\nTotal loans $ 1,513,631 $ 966,720\nNon-performing loans $ 18,376 $ 7,261\nALL-to-total loans 0.85% 1.38%\nALL-to-non-performing loans (coverage ratio) 70.2% 183.8%\nThe December 31, 2022, balance in the ALL account is considered adequate by management after evaluation of the loan portfolio, past\nexperience and current economic and market conditions. While management may periodically allocate portions of the allowance for specific\nproblem loans, the whole allowance is available for any loan charge offs that occur. The allocation of the ALL reflects performance and growth\ntrends within the various loan categories, as well as consideration of the facts and circumstances that affect the repayment of individual loans,\nand loans which have been pooled as of the evaluation date, with particular attention given to non-performing loans and loans which have been\nclassified as substandard, doubtful or loss. Management has allocated reserves to both performing and non-performing loans based on current\ninformation available.\n52 of 113\nDuring 2022, net sales of foreclosed real estate totaled $93 thousand and net gains from the 2022 sales totaled $16 thousand.\nThe primary objective of the Bancorp’s investment portfolio is to provide for the liquidity needs of the Bancorp and to contribute to profitability\nby providing a stable flow of dependable earnings. Funds are generally invested in federal funds, interest bearing balances in other financial\ninstitutions, U.S. government securities, U.S. treasury securities, federal agency obligations, obligations of state and local municipalities and\ncorporate securities. The securities portfolio totaled $370.9 million at December 31, 2022, compared to $526.9 million at December 31, 2021, a\ndecrease of $156.0 million or 29.6%. The decrease is attributable to increased unrealized losses within the portfolio and the use of cashflows\nfrom the securities portfolio to fund loan growth. At December 31, 2022, the securities portfolio represented 19.5% of interest-earning assets and\n17.9% of total assets compared to 34.6% of interest-earning assets and 32.5% of total assets at December 31, 2021.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Bancorp’s two investments in trust preferred securities were in “payment in kind” status. Payment in kind\nstatus results in a temporary delay in the payment of interest. As a result of a delay in the collection of the interest payments, management\nplaced these securities on non-accrual status. At December 31, 2022, the cost basis of the two trust preferred securities on non-accrual status\ntotaled $2.2 million.\nThe Bancorp’s end-of-period investment portfolio and other short-term investments and stock balances were as follows:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2022 2021\nBalance % Securities Balance % Securities\nU.S. government sponsored entities $ 7,625 2.1% $ 8,669 1.6%\nU.S. treasury securities 389 0.1% 400 0.1%\nCollateralized mortgage obligations and residential\nmortgage-backed securities 134,116 36.2% 184,701 35.1%\nMunicipal securities 227,718 61.3% 332,127 63.0%\nCollateralized debt obligations 1,048 0.3% 992 0.2%\nTotal securities available-for-sale $ 370,896 100.0% $ 526,889 100.0%\nDecember 31, December 31, YTD\n(Dollars in thousands) 2022 2021 Change\nBalance Balance $ %\nInterest bearing deposits in other financial institutions $ 11,210 $ 19,987 $ (8,777) -43.9%\nFed funds sold 107 464 (357) -76.9%\nCertificates of deposit in other financial institutions 2,456 1,709 747 43.7%\nFederal Home Loan Bank stock 6,547 3,247 3,300 101.6%\nThe net decrease in interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions is primarily the result of the timing of investments in interest\nearning assets relative to the inflow and outflow of deposits and repurchase agreements.\nDeposits are a fundamental and cost-effective source of funds for lending and other investment purposes.

Borrowed funds increased as short-term FHLB\nadvances were taken during the year, due to cyclical inflows and outflows of interest-earnings assets and interest-bearing liabilities.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFor the Bancorp, liquidity management refers to the ability to generate sufficient cash to fund current loan demand, meet deposit\nwithdrawals, and pay dividends and operating expenses. Because profit and liquidity are often conflicting objectives, management attempts to\nmaximize the Bank’s net interest margin by making adequate, but not excessive, liquidity provisions. Furthermore, funds are managed so that\nfuture profits will not be significantly impacted as funding costs increase.\nChanges in the liquidity position result from operating, investing and financing activities. Cash flows from operating activities are generally\nthe cash effects of transactions and other events that enter into the determination of net income. The primary investing activities include loan\noriginations, loan repayments, investments in interest bearing balances in financial institutions, and the purchase, sale, and maturity of\ninvestment securities. Financing activities focus almost entirely on the generation of customer deposits. In addition, the Bancorp utilizes\nborrowings (i.e., repurchase agreements, FHLB advances and federal funds purchased) as a source of funds.\nDuring 2022, cash and cash equivalents decreased $1.9 million compared to an increase of $13.3 million for 2021. The primary sources of\ncash and cash equivalents were cash and cash equivalents from acquisition activity, the sale of loans originated for sale, proceeds from the sale\nof securities, proceeds from the maturity and paydown of securities, and proceeds from FHLB advances. The primary uses of cash and cash\nequivalents were the purchase of securities, change in deposits, and loan originations. During 2022, net cash from operating activities totaled\n$17.8 million, compared to $18.8 million for 2021. Cash provided from operating activities was primarily a result of net income and sale of loans\noriginated for sale, offset by loans originated for sale and net change in other assets, accrued expenses, and other liabilities. Net cash outflows\nfrom investing activities totaled $1.1 million during 2022, compared to outflows of $127.7 million during 2021. Cash outflows from investing\nactivities were primarily related to the net change in loans receivable and purchase of securities, offset against the cash and cash equivalents\nfrom acquisition activity, net, and proceeds from the sales and maturities of securities. Net cash outflows from financing activities totaled $18.5\nmillion in 2022, compared to net cash inflows of $122.1 million in 2021. The net cash outflows from financing activities were primarily a result of\nnet change in deposits and repayment of FHLB advances, offset against the change in proceeds from FHLB advances. During 2022, the\nBancorp’s Board of Directors maintained dividends as earnings and capital continued to be sufficient to warrant the current dividend.\n54 of 113\nManagement strongly believes that safety and soundness is enhanced by maintaining a high level of capital. Stockholders' equity totaled\n$136.4 million at December 31, 2022, compared to $156.6 million at December 31, 2021, a decrease of $20.2 million (3.2%). The decrease was\nprimarily the result of an increase in net unrealized losses of available for sale securities of $68.6 million and dividends of $5.3 million, offset\nagainst issuance of shares for the acquisition of Royal of $38.0 million and net income of $15.1 million. At December 31, 2022, book value per\nshare was $31.73 compared to $45.00 for 2021.\nThe following table shows that, at December 31, 2022, the Bank’s capital exceeded all regulatory capital requirements.

However, the Bank must obtain the approval of the Indiana Department\nof Financial Institutions (DFI) if the total of all dividends declared by the Bank during the current year, including the proposed dividend, would\nexceed the sum of retained net income for the year to date plus its retained net income for the previous two years. For this purpose, “retained\nnet income,” means net income as calculated for call report purposes, less all dividends declared for the applicable period. An exemption from\nDFI approval would require that the Bank have been assigned a composite uniform financial institutions rating of 1 or 2 as a result of the most\nrecent federal or state examination; the proposed dividend would not result in a Tier 1 leverage ratio below 7.5%; and that the Bank not be\nsubject to any corrective action, supervisory order, supervisory agreement, or board approved operating agreement. The aggregate amount of\ndividends that may be declared by the Bank in 2022, without the need for qualifying for an exemption or prior DFI approval, is its 2023 net profits.\nMoreover, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve Board may prohibit the payment of dividends if it determines that the payment of dividends would\nconstitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the Bank. On November 29, 2022, the Board of Directors of the\nBancorp declared a fourth quarter dividend of $0.31 per share. The Bancorp’s fourth quarter dividend was paid to shareholders on January 6,\n2023.\nResults of Operations –\nComparison of 2022 to 2021\nNet income for 2022 was $15.1 million, compared to $15.0 million for 2021, an increase of $117 thousand (0.8%). The twelve-month\nearnings increase is primarily related to higher net interest income, offset again higher noninterest expense and lower noninterest income. The\nearnings represent a return on average assets of 0.74% for 2022, compared to 0.95% for 2021. The return on average equity was 10.47% for\n2022, compared to 9.61% for 2021.\n55 of 113\nNet interest income for 2022, was $67.1 million, an increase of $18.6 million (38.2%) from $48.6 million for 2021. The increased net interest\nmargin is primarily related to increased loan balances from the acquisition of Royal, organic loan growth, and the ability to manage deposit and\nborrowing costs to support earning asset growth. The weighted-average yield on interest-earning assets was 3.81% for 2022, compared to\n3.44% for 2021. The weighted-average cost of funds was 0.26% for 2022, compared to 0.15% for 2021. The impact of the 3.81% return on\ninterest earning assets and the 0.26% cost of funds resulted in a net interest spread of 3.55% for 2022, compared to a net interest spread of\n3.29% for 2021. During 2022, total interest income increased by $21.4 million (42.2%) while total interest expense increased by $2.8 million\n(134.9%). The net interest margin was 3.56% for 2022, compared to 3.29% for 2021. The Bancorp’s tax equivalent net interest margin for 2022,\nwas 3.74% compared to 3.51% for 2021. Comparing the net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis more accurately compares the returns on\ntax-exempt loans and securities to those on taxable interest-earning assets.\nThe increase in interest earning asset income for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, is\nprimarily related to increased reinvestment rates in 2022 for loans, securities, and excess cash balances, as a result of the Federal Reserve rate\nincreases occurring though out 2022. The increase in interest bearing liability expense is primarily the result of the Bancorp adjusting deposit\nand repurchase agreement pricing to align with the current interest rate cycle, along with increased borrowing costs as a result of the Federal\nReserve rate increases.\nThe following table shows the change in noninterest income for the year ending December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021.\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Twelve Months Ended December 31, 12/31/2022 vs. 12/31/2021\n2022 2021 $ Change % Change\nNoninterest income:\nFees and service charges 6,257 5,388 869 16.1%\nWealth management operations 2,113 2,375 (262) -11.0%\nGain on sale of loans held-for-sale, net 1,368 5,296 (3,928) -74.2%\nGain on sale of securities, net 662 1,987 (1,325) -66.7%\nIncrease in cash value of bank owned life insurance 810 715 95 13.3%\nGain on sale of foreclosed real estate 16 47 (31) -66.0%\nOther 283 139 144 103.6%\nTotal noninterest income 11,509 15,947 (4,438) -27.8%\nThe increase in fees and service charges is primarily the result of the acquisition of Royal and the resulting increase in our customer base.\nThe decrease in wealth management operations is the result of lower fee income year over year due to market conditions. The decrease in gain\non sale of loans is the result of significant refinance activity in 2021 due to the economic and low-rate environment, which resulted in more loans\noriginated and sold in 2021 compared to 2022. We expect demand for fixed rate mortgage loans held-for-sale in the secondary market to be\nlower as borrowing rates on loans increase. The decrease in gains on the sale of securities is a result of current market conditions and actively\nrepositioning the portfolio.\nThe following table shows the change in noninterest expense for the year ending December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021.\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Twelve Months Ended December 31, 12/31/2022 vs. 12/31/2021\n2022 2021 $ Change % Change\nNoninterest expense:\nCompensation and benefits 28,990 24,241 4,749 19.6%\nOccupancy and equipment 6,785 5,537 1,248 22.5%\nData processing 6,750 3,648 3,102 85.0%\nMarketing 1,907 1,085 822 75.8%\nImpairment charge on assets held for sale 1,232 - 1,232 0.0%\nFederal deposit insurance premiums 1,228 861 367 42.6%\nProfessional services 1,211 1,205 6 0.5%\nNet loss recognized on sale of premises and equipment 303 - 303 0.0%\nOther 13,694 10,059 3,635 36.1%\nTotal noninterest expense 62,100 46,636 15,464 33.2%\n56 of 113\nThe increase in compensation and benefits is primarily the result of the Royal acquisition, management’s continued focus on talent\nmanagement, and wage inflation. The increase in data processing expense is primarily the result of data conversion expenses related to the\nacquisition of Royal, increased system utilization due to growth of the Bank, and continued investment in technological advancements such as\nSalesforce and nCino. The increase in occupancy and equipment expense is primarily related to the Royal acquisition and higher operating\ncosts. Marketing expenses have increased to enhance brand recognition in new markets and gain more wallet share. The increase in\nimpairment charge on assets held for sale is the result of impairment on the carrying value of branches held for sale. The increase in federal\ndeposit insurance premiums is primarily the result of growth of the bank’s average assets. The increase in net loss recognized on sale of\npremises and equipment is the result of the sale of a branch to reduce future fixed costs, allowing for redeployment of a portion of occupancy\nexpenses into building a digital-forward foundation so that Finward can better serve its customers. The increase in other operating expenses is\nprimarily the result of one-time expenses related to the acquisition of Royal, continued investments in strategic initiatives focusing on growth of\nthe organization, and inflationary pressures.\nIncome tax expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022, totaled $1.5 million, compared to income tax expense of $1.4 for the year\nended December 31, 2021, an increase of $64 thousand (4.5%). The combined effective federal and state tax rates for the Bancorp was 8.9%\nfor the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 8.6% for the year ended December 31, 2021. The Bancorp’s higher current effective tax\nrate is a result of higher earnings relative to tax preferred income.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nCritical accounting policies are those accounting policies that management believes are most important to the portrayal of the Bancorp’s\nfinancial condition and that require management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. The Bancorp’s most critical accounting\npolicies are summarized below. Other accounting policies, including those related to the fair values of financial instruments and the status of\ncontingencies, are summarized in Note 1 to the Bancorp’s consolidated financial statements.\nValuation of Investment Securities – The fair values of securities available for sale are determined on a recurring basis by obtaining quoted\nprices on nationally recognized securities exchanges or pricing models utilizing significant observable inputs such as matrix pricing, which is a\nmathematical technique widely used in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities\nbut rather by relying on the securities’ relationship to other benchmark quoted securities. Different judgments and assumptions used in pricing\ncould result in different estimates of value. In certain cases where market data is not readily available because of lack of market activity or little\npublic disclosure, values may be based on unobservable inputs and classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\nAt the end of each reporting period securities held in the investment portfolio are evaluated on an individual security level for other-than-\ntemporary impairment in accordance with the Investments – Debt and Equity Securities Topic of the Accounting Standards Codification.\nSignificant judgments are required in determining impairment, which include making assumptions regarding the estimated prepayments, loss\nassumptions and the change in interest rates.\nWe consider the following factors when determining an other-than-temporary impairment for a security: The length of time and the extent to\nwhich the market value has been less than amortized cost; the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; the underlying\nfundamentals of the relevant market and the outlook for such market for the near future; and an assessment of whether the Bancorp has (1) the\nintent to sell the debt securities or (2) more likely than not will be required to sell the debt securities before its anticipated market recovery. If\neither of these conditions is met, management will recognize other-than-temporary impairment. If, in management’s judgment, an other-than-\ntemporary impairment exists, the cost basis of the security will be written down for the credit loss, and the unrealized loss will be transferred from\naccumulated other comprehensive loss as an immediate reduction of current earnings. Management will utilize an independent valuation\nspecialist to value securities semi-annually for other-than-temporary impairment.\nAllowance for Loan Losses – The Bancorp maintains an Allowance for Loan Losses (“ALL”) to absorb probable incurred credit losses that\narise from the loan portfolio. The ALL is increased by the provision for loan losses, and decreased by charge-offs net of recoveries. The\ndetermination of the amounts of the ALL and provisions for loan losses is based upon management’s current judgments about the credit quality\nof the loan portfolio with consideration given to all known relevant internal and external factors that affect loan collectability. The methodology\nused to determine the current year provision and the overall adequacy of the ALL includes a disciplined and consistently applied quarterly\nprocess that combines a review of the current position with a risk assessment worksheet. Factors that are taken into consideration in the\nanalysis include an assessment of national and local economic trends, a review of current year loan portfolio growth and changes in portfolio\nmix, and an assessment of trends for loan delinquencies and loan charge-off activity. Particular attention is given to non-accruing loans and\naccruing loans past due 90 days or more, and loans that have been classified as substandard, doubtful, or loss. Changes in the provision are\ndirectionally consistent with changes in observable data.\n57 of 113\nCommercial and industrial, and commercial real estate loans that exhibit credit weaknesses and loans that have been classified as impaired\nare subject to an individual review. Where appropriate, ALL allocations are made to these loans based on management’s assessment of financial\nposition, current cash flows, collateral values, financial strength of guarantors, industry trends, and economic conditions. ALL allocations for\nhomogeneous loans, such as residential mortgage loans and consumer loans, are based on historical charge-off activity and current delinquency\ntrends. Management has allocated general reserves to both performing and non-performing loans based on historical data and current\ninformation available.\nRisk factors for non-performing and internally classified loans are based on an analysis of either the projected discounted cash flows or the\nestimated collateral liquidation value for individual loans defined as substandard or doubtful. Estimated collateral liquidation values are based on\nestablished loan underwriting standards and adjusted for current mitigating factors on a loan-by-loan basis. Aggregate substandard loan\ncollateral deficiencies are determined for residential, commercial real estate, commercial business, and consumer loan portfolios. These\ndeficiencies are then stated as a percentage of the total substandard balances to determine the appropriate risk factors.\nRisk factors for performing and non-classified loans are based on a weighted average of net charge-offs for the most recent three years,\nwhich are then stated as a percentage of average loans for the same period. Historical risk factors are calculated for residential, commercial real\nestate, commercial business, and consumer loans. The three year weighted average historical factors are then adjusted for current subjective\nrisks attributable to: regional and national economic factors; loan growth and changes in loan composition; organizational structure; composition\nof loan staff; loan concentrations; policy changes and out of market lending activity.\nThe risk factors are applied to these types of loans to determine the appropriate level for the ALL. Adjustments may be made to these\nallocations that reflect management’s judgment on current conditions, delinquency trends, and charge-off activity. Based on the above\ndiscussion, management believes that the ALL is currently adequate, but not excessive, given the risk inherent in the loan portfolio.\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars,\nwithout considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary assets and liabilities of the\nBancorp are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on the Bancorp’s performance than the effects of\ngeneral levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or magnitude as the prices of goods and services.\nItem 7A.

Financial Statements\nReport of Independent Registered\nPublic Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders, Board of Directors and Audit Committee\nFinward Bancorp\nMunster, Indiana\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Finward Bancorp (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the\nrelated consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years then\nended and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred\nto above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, and the results of its\noperations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s\nfinancial statements based on our audits.\nWe are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to\nbe independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain\nreasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audit\nincluded performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and\nperforming procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by\nmanagement, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for\nour opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were\ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the\nfinancial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters\ndoes not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters\nbelow, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n59 of 113\nAllowances for Loan Losses\nDescription of the Matter\nAs described in Note 4 to the financial statements, the Company’s consolidated allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL) was $12.9 million at\nDecember 31, 2022. The Company also describes in Note 1 of the financial statements the accounting policy around this estimate. The ALLL is\nan estimate of losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. The determination of the reserve requires significant judgment reflecting the\nCompany’s best estimate of probable loan and lease losses. The estimate consists of several key elements, which include: specific reserves for\nimpaired loans, general reserves for each business lending division portfolio including percentage allocations for special attention loans and\nleases not deemed impaired, and reserves for pooled homogenous loans and leases, among others. The Company’s evaluation is based upon a\ncontinuing review of these portfolios, estimates of customer performance, collateral values and dispositions, and assessments of economic and\ngeopolitical events, all of which are subject to judgment and will change.\nWe identified the valuation of the ALLL as a critical audit matter. Auditing the ALLL involves a high degree of subjectivity in evaluating\nmanagement’s estimates, such as evaluating management’s assessment of economic conditions and other environmental factors used to adjust\nhistorical loss rates, evaluating the adequacy of specific reserves associated with impaired loans and assessing the appropriateness of loan\ngrades.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the estimated allowance for loan losses included:\n● Testing the design of internal controls, including those related to technology, over the ALLL including data completeness and accuracy,\nclassifications of loans by loan segment, historical loss data, the calculation of a loss rate, the establishment of qualitative adjustments,\ngrading and risk classification of loans and establishment of specific reserves on impaired loans and management’s review controls over\nthe ALLL balance.\n● Testing clerical/computational accuracy of the formulas within the ALLL model.\n● Testing of completeness and accuracy of the information and reports utilized in the ALLL, including reports used in management review\ncontrols over the ALLL.\n● Computing an independent calculation of an acceptable range and comparing it to the Company’s estimate.\n● Evaluating the qualitative adjustment to the historical loss rates, including assessing the basis for the adjustments and the\nreasonableness of the significant assumptions.\n● Testing of the loan review function and the accuracy of loan grades determined. Specifically, utilizing internal loan grading professionals\nto assist us in evaluating the appropriateness of loan grades and to assess the reasonableness of specific impairments on loans.\n● Evaluating the overall reasonableness of qualitative factors and the appropriateness of their direction and magnitude and the Company’s\nsupport for the direction and magnitude compared to previous years.\nAcquisition\nAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company completed the acquisition of Royal Financial, Inc. during the year\nended December 31, 2022, with an acquisition price of $56.7 million, including the recognition of $11.3 million of Goodwill. Management\ndetermined that the acquisition qualified as a business and accordingly all identifiable assets and liabilities acquired were valued at fair value as\npart of the purchase price allocation as of the acquisition date. The identification and valuation of such acquired assets and assumed liabilities\nrequired management to exercise significant judgment and consider the use of outside vendors to estimate the fair value allocations.\n60 of 113\nWe identified the acquisition and the valuation of acquired assets and assumed liabilities a critical audit matter. Auditing the acquisition\ntransaction involved a high degree of subjectivity in evaluating management’s operational assumptions, fair value estimates, purchase price\nallocations and assessing the appropriateness of outside vendor valuation models.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:\n● Testing the design of internal controls over the acquisition\n● Obtaining and reviewing executed Plan and Agreement of Merger documents to gain an understanding of the underlying terms of the\nconsummated acquisition\n● Obtaining and reviewing management’s reconciliation procedures of significant accounts and testing of existence and completeness\nprocedures performed and asset/liability identification considerations made\n● Testing management’s computation of purchase price and determination of goodwill recognized focusing on the completeness and\naccuracy of the balance sheet acquired and related fair value purchase price allocations made to identified assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed\n● Obtaining and reviewing significant outside vendor valuation estimates and challenging management’s review of the appropriateness of\nthe valuations assessed/allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed; including but not limited to, testing critical inputs, including\nassumptions applied and valuation models utilized by the outside vendors\n● Utilization of our internal valuation professionals to assist with testing and challenging the related fair value purchase price allocations\nmade to identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed\n● Reviewing and evaluating the adequacy of the disclosures made in the footnotes of the Company’s SEC filings\n/s/ FORVIS, LLP (Formerly, BKD, LLP)\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2021.\nIndianapolis, Indiana\nMarch 30, 2023\n61 of 113\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nDecember 31,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2022 2021\nASSETS\nCash and non-interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions $ 19,965 $ 12,725\nInterest bearing deposits in other financial institutions 11,210 19,987\nFederal funds sold 107 464\nTotal cash and cash equivalents 31,282 33,176\nCertificates of deposit in other financial institutions 2,456 1,709\nSecurities available-for-sale 370,896 526,889\nLoans held-for-sale 1,543 4,987\nLoans receivable, net of deferred fees and costs 1,513,631 966,720\nLess: allowance for loan losses (12,897) (13,343)\nNet loans receivable 1,500,734 953,377\nFederal Home Loan Bank stock 6,547 3,247\nAccrued interest receivable 7,421 5,444\nPremises and equipment 40,212 31,385\nCash value of bank owned life insurance 31,936 31,440\nGoodwill 22,395 11,109\nOther intangible assets 4,794 3,126\nOther assets 50,123 14,854\nTotal assets $ 2,070,339 $ 1,620,743\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\nDeposits:\nNon-interest bearing $ 359,092 $ 295,294\nInterest bearing 1,415,925 1,138,907\nTotal 1,775,017 1,434,201\nRepurchase agreements 15,503 14,581\nBorrowed funds 120,000 -\nAccrued expenses and other liabilities 23,426 15,346\nTotal liabilities 1,933,946 1,464,128\nCommitments and contingencies\nStockholders' Equity:\nPreferred stock, no par or stated value; 10,000,000 shares authorized, none outstanding -

(a captive insurance subsidiary) and Peoples Bank (the “Bank”), and the Bank’s wholly owned\nsubsidiaries, Peoples Service Corporation, NWIN, LLC, NWIN Funding, Incorporated, and Columbia Development Company, LLC. The\nBancorp’s business activities include being a holding company for the Bank as well as a holding company for NWIN Risk Management, Inc. The\nBancorp’s earnings are dependent upon the earnings of the Bank. Peoples Service Corporation provides insurance and annuity investments to\nthe Bank’s wealth management customers. NWIN, LLC is located in Las Vegas, Nevada and serves as the Bank’s investment subsidiary and\nparent of a real estate investment trust, NWIN Funding, Inc. NWIN Funding, Inc. was formed as an Indiana Real Estate Investment Trust. The\nformation of NWIN Funding, Inc. provides the Bancorp with a vehicle that may be used to raise capital utilizing portfolio mortgages as collateral,\nwithout diluting stock ownership. In addition, NWIN Funding, Inc. receives favorable state tax treatment for income generated by its operations.\nColumbia Development Company is a limited liability company that serves to hold certain real estate properties that are acquired through\nforeclosure. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates – Preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosure of\ncontingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting\nperiod, as well as the disclosures provided. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates associated with the allowance for loan\nlosses are particularly susceptible to material change in the near term.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk – The Bancorp grants residential, commercial real estate, commercial business and installment loans to\ncustomers primarily in Lake County, in northwest Indiana, and Cook County, in northeast Illinois. The Bancorp is also an active lender in Porter\nCounty, and to a lesser extent, LaPorte, Newton and Jasper counties in Indiana; and DuPage, Lake, and Will counties in Illinois. Substantially all\nloans are secured by specific items of collateral including residences, commercial real estate, land development, business assets and consumer\nassets.\nCash Flow Reporting – For purposes of the statements of cash flows, the Bancorp considers cash on hand, noninterest bearing deposits in\nother financial institutions, all interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions with original maturities of 90 days or less, and federal funds\nsold to be cash and cash equivalents. The Bancorp reports net cash flows for customer loan and deposit transactions and short-term borrowings\nwith maturities of 90 days or less.\nCertificates of deposits in other financial institutions – Certificates of deposits in other financial institutions generally mature within 5 years\nand are carried at cost.\nSecurities – The Bancorp classifies securities into held-to-maturity, available-for-sale, or trading categories. Held-to-maturity securities are\nthose which management has the positive intent and the Bancorp has the ability to hold to maturity, and are reported at amortized cost.\nAvailable-for-sale securities are those the Bancorp may decide to sell if needed for liquidity, asset-liability management or other reasons.\nAvailable-for-sale securities are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in other comprehensive (loss) income, net of\ntax. At December 31, 2022, and 2021, all of the Bancorp’s securities were classified as available-for-sale. The Bancorp does not have a held to\nmaturity or trading portfolio. Realized gains and losses resulting from the sale of securities recorded on the trade date are computed by the\nspecific identification method. Interest and dividend income, adjusted by amortization of premiums or discounts on a level yield method, are\nincluded in earnings. Securities are reviewed for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis.\n66 of 113\nThe Bancorp considers the following factors when determining an other-than-temporary impairment for a security: the length of time and the\nextent to which the market value has been less than amortized cost; the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; the underlying\nfundamentals of the relevant market and the outlook for such market for the near future; and an assessment of whether the Bancorp has (1) the\nintent to sell the debt security or (2) it is more likely than not that the Bancorp will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated\nmarket recovery. If either of these conditions are met, management will recognize other-than-temporary impairment. If, in management’s\njudgment, an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the cost basis of the security will be written down for the credit loss, and the unrealized\ncredit loss will be transferred from accumulated other comprehensive loss as an immediate reduction of current earnings.\nLoans Held-for-Sale – Mortgage loans originated and intended for sale in the secondary market are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or\nfair value, as determined by outstanding commitments from investors. Net unrealized losses, if any, are recorded as a valuation allowance and\ncharged to earnings.\nMortgage loans held-for-sale can be sold with servicing rights retained or released. The carrying value of mortgage loans sold is reduced by\nthe amount allocated to the servicing rights. Gains and losses on sales of mortgage loans are based on the difference between the selling price\nand the carrying value of the related loan sold.\nLoans and Loan Interest Income – Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or\npayoff are reported at the principal balance outstanding, net of unearned interest, and net deferred loan fees and costs. Interest income is\naccrued on the unpaid principal balance. Loan origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, are deferred and recognized in interest\nincome using the level‑yield method without anticipating prepayments.\nThe accrual of interest income on mortgage and commercial loans is discontinued at the time the loan is 90 days delinquent unless the loan is\nwell-secured and in process of collection. Consumer loans are typically charged-off no later than when they reach 120 days past due. Past due\nstatus is based on the contractual terms of the loan. In all cases, loans are placed on non-accrual or charged-off status at an earlier date if\ncollection of principal or interest is considered doubtful.\nGenerally, interest accrued but not received for loans placed on non-accrual status is reversed against interest income. Interest received on\nsuch loans is accounted for on the cash-basis or cost‑recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual. Loans are returned to accrual status\nwhen all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.\nAllowance for Loan Losses – The allowance for loan losses (“allowance”) is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit losses. Loan\nlosses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries,\nif any, are credited to the allowance. Management estimates the allowance balance required using past loan loss experience, the nature and\nvolume of the portfolio, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, economic conditions, and other factors.\nAllocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans, but the entire allowance is available for any loan that, in management’s judgment,\nshould be charged‑off.\nA loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Bancorp will be unable to collect the\nscheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by\nmanagement in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest\npayments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired.\nManagement determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case by case basis, taking into consideration all of the\ncircumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower’s prior payment\nrecord, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis by either\nthe present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, the loan’s obtainable market price, or the fair\nvalue of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. Large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are normally collectively evaluated\nfor impairment, unless part of a larger relationship or a trouble debt restructuring.\n67 of 113\nTroubled Debt Restructures – A troubled debt restructuring of a loan is undertaken to improve the likelihood that the loan will be repaid in full\nunder the modified terms in accordance with a reasonable repayment schedule. All modified loans are evaluated to determine whether the loan\nshould be reported as a troubled debt restructure (TDR). A loan is a TDR when the Bancorp, for economic or legal reasons related to the\nborrower's financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower by modifying or renewing a loan under terms that the Bancorp would not\notherwise consider. To make this determination, the Bancorp must determine whether (a) the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and\n(b) the Bancorp granted the borrower a concession. This determination requires consideration of all of the facts and circumstances surrounding\nthe modification. An overall general decline in the economy or some level of deterioration in a borrower's financial condition does not inherently\nmean the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties.\nSome of the factors considered by management when determining whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties are: (1) is the\nborrower currently in default on any of its debts, (2) has the borrower declared or is the borrower in the process of declaring bankruptcy, and (3)\nabsent the current modification, the borrower would likely default.\nFederal Home Loan Bank Stock – The Bank is a member of the FHLB system. Members are required to own a certain amount of stock\nbased on the level of borrowings and other factors, and may invest in additional amounts. FHLB stock is carried at cost, classified as a restricted\nsecurity, and periodically evaluated for impairment based on ultimate recovery of par value. Both cash and stock dividends are reported as\nincome.\nTransfers of Financial Assets – Transfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when control over the assets has been surrendered.\nControl over transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when (1) the assets have been isolated from the Bancorp, (2) the transferee\nobtains the right (free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of the right) to pledge or exchange the transferred assets, and (3) the\nBancorp does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity.\nPremises and Equipment – Land is carried at cost. Premises and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Premises\nand related components are depreciated using the straight-line method with useful lives ranging from 15 to 39 years. Furniture and equipment\nare depreciated using the straight-line method with useful lives ranging from 2 to 10 years.\nForeclosed Real Estate – Assets acquired through or instead of loan foreclosure are initially recorded at fair value less estimated costs to\nsell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis. If fair value declines subsequent to foreclosure, a valuation allowance is recorded through\nexpense. Operating costs after acquisition are expensed.\nLong-term Assets – Premises and equipment and other long-term assets are reviewed for impairment when events indicate their carrying\namount may not be recoverable from future undiscounted cash flows. If impaired, the assets are recorded at fair value.\nBank Owned Life Insurance – The Bancorp has purchased life insurance policies on certain key executives. In accordance with accounting\nfor split-dollar life insurance, Bank owned life insurance is recorded at the amount that can be realized under the insurance contract at the\nbalance sheet date, which is the cash surrender value adjusted for other charges or other amounts due that are probable at settlement.\nGoodwill and Intangibles – The Bancorp records the assets acquired, including identified intangible assets, and the liabilities assumed in\nacquisitions at their fair values. These fair values often involve estimates based on third-party valuations, such as appraisals, or internal\nvaluations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques that may include estimates of attrition, inflation, asset growth\nrates or other relevant factors. In addition, the determination of the useful lives over which an intangible asset will be amortized is subjective.\nUnder the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 350, goodwill and indefinite-lived assets\nrecorded are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis, as well as on an interim basis if events or changes indicate that the asset might be\nimpaired. An impairment loss is recognized for any excess of carrying value over fair value of the goodwill or the indefinite-lived intangible asset.\nRepurchase Agreements – Substantially, all repurchase agreement liabilities represent amounts advanced by various customers that are not\ncovered by federal deposit insurance and are secured by securities owned by the Bancorp.\n68 of 113\nIncome Taxes – Income tax expense is the total of the current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and\nliabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary differences between carrying amounts and tax\nbasis of assets and liabilities, computed using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces deferred tax assets to the amount\nexpected to be realized.\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Bancorp evaluated tax positions taken for filing with the Internal Revenue Service and all state\njurisdictions in which it operates. The Bancorp believes that income tax filing positions will be sustained under examination and does not\nanticipate any adjustments that would result in a material adverse effect on the Bancorp's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nAccordingly, the Bancorp has not recorded any reserves or related accruals for interest and penalties for uncertain tax positions at December 31,\n2022 and 2021.\nLoan Commitments and Related Financial Instruments – Financial instruments include off-balance sheet credit instruments, such as\ncommitments to make loans and standby letters of credit, issued to meet customer financing needs. The face amount for these items represents\nthe exposure to loss, before considering customer collateral or ability to repay. Such financial instruments are recorded when they are funded.\nAs part of mortgage banking operations, the Company enters into commitments to originate loans whereby the interest rate on these loans is\ndetermined prior to funding (“interest rate lock commitments”). Similar to loans held for sale, the fair value of rate lock commitments is subject to\nchange primarily due to changes in interest rates. The interest rate lock commitments on mortgage loans intended to be sold are recorded at fair\nvalue with changes in fair value recorded in current earnings as part of gain on sale of loans held-for-sale, net.\nEarnings Per Common Share – Basic earnings per common share is net income divided by the weighted-average number of common\nshares outstanding during the period. The restricted shares issued provide for dividend and voting rights and are therefore considered\nparticipating securities. Accordingly, all restricted stock is included in basic earnings per share.\nComprehensive (Loss) Income – Comprehensive (loss) income consists of net income and other comprehensive (loss) income. Other\ncomprehensive (loss) income includes unrealized gains and losses on securities available-for-sale.\nLoss Contingencies – Loss contingencies, including claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business, are recorded as\nliabilities when the likelihood of loss is probable and an amount or range of loss can be reasonably estimated. Management does not believe\nsuch matters currently exist that will have a material effect on the financial statements.\nRestrictions on Cash –– As of March 26, 2021, the Federal Reserve Bank eliminated reserve requirements for certain depository institutions,\nincluding the Bank. As such, there was no reserve requirement at December 31, 2022. As part of derivative contracts entered into by the\nBancorp, $3.9 million was pledged as collateral at December 31, 2022 and 2021. These balances are included in interest bearing deposits. At\nDecember 31, 2022, the Company’s correspondent cash accounts exceeded federally insured limits by $13.5 million. Additionally, the Company\nhad approximately $3.2 million of cash held by the FRB and the FHLB, which is not federally insured.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments – Fair values of financial instruments are estimated using relevant market information and other\nassumptions, as more fully disclosed in a separate note. Fair value estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment regarding\ninterest rates, credit risk, prepayments and other factors, especially in the absence of broad markets for particular instruments. Changes in\nassumptions or in market conditions could significantly affect the estimates.\nOperating Segments – While the Bancorp's executive management monitors the revenue streams of the various products and services, the\nidentifiable segments are not material and operations are managed and financial performance is evaluated on a company-wide basis.\nAccordingly, all of the Bancorp's financial service operations are considered by management to be aggregated in one reportable operating\nsegment.\nReclassification – Certain amounts appearing in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31,\n2021, may have been reclassified to conform to the December 31, 2022 presentation.\n69 of 113\nTrust Assets – Assets of the Bancorp’s wealth management department, other than cash on deposit at the Bancorp, are not included in these\nconsolidated financial statements because they are not assets of the Bancorp.\nAdoption of New Accounting Pronouncements –\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12 which remove specific exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 in GAAP. It\neliminates the need for an organization to analyze whether the following apply in a given period: exception to the incremental approach for\nintraperiod tax allocation; exceptions to accounting for basis differences where there are ownership changes in foreign investments; and\nexception in interim period income tax accounting for year-to-date losses that exceed anticipated losses. It also improves financial statement\npreparers’ application of income tax-related guidance and simplifies GAAP for: franchise taxes that are partially based on income; transactions\nwith a government that result in a step up in the tax basis of goodwill; separate financial statements of legal entities that are not subject to tax;\nand enacts changes in tax laws in interim periods. The guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods\nwithin those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. Early adoption is permitted. The Bancorp adopted ASU 2019-12 on January 1,\n2021, and it did not have a material impact on its accounting and disclosures.\nUpcoming Accounting Pronouncements -\nIn June 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial\nInstruments. The ASU includes increased disclosures and various changes to the accounting and measurement of financial assets including the\nBancorp’s loans and available-for-sale debt securities. Each financial asset presented on the balance sheet would have a unique allowance for\ncredit losses valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be\ncollected on the financial asset. The amendments in this ASU also eliminate the probable initial recognition threshold in current GAAP and\ninstead, reflect an entity’s current estimate of all expected credit losses using reasonable and supportable forecasts. In October 2019, the FASB\nvoted and approved proposed changes to the effective date of this ASU for smaller reporting companies, such as the Bancorp, and other non-\nSEC reporting entities. The approval changed the effective date of the ASU to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim\nperiods within those fiscal periods. The new credit loss guidance will be effective for the Bancorp as of January 1, 2023. Upon adoption, the ASU\nwill be applied using a modified retrospective transition method to the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. A\nprospective transition approach is required for debt securities for which an other-than-temporary impairment had been recognized before the\neffective date.\nThe Bancorp has completed data and model validation testing, determined qualitative adjustments, established additional supporting\nanalytics, and developed related internal controls over model inputs (data and assumptions) and model operations. While the model is\noperational, approval of certain governance related matters, procedures and policies are being finalized. The final effective date estimate for our\nCurrent Expected Credit Loss (“CECL”) has not been determined and the required financial reporting disclosures are being completed for review.\nInternal controls over financial reporting specifically related to CECL have been designed and are being evaluated, however, all internal\ncontrols related to CECL implementation are not operational. The final step of completing the formal governance and approval process is in its\nfinal stages.\nWe expect the one-time cumulative effect adjustment to the ACL will be between $3.8 million and $6.8 million upon adoption as of January 1,\n2023. The majority of the increase is related to including our acquired loan portfolios in the model and the addition of using economic forecasts in\nestimating future losses. As we continue to evaluate and refine our CECL model during the first quarter of 2023, the estimated range of impact to\nthe ACL as of January 1, 2023, could change.\n70 of 113\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04 “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform\non Financial Reporting.” These amendments provide temporary optional guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate\nreform. The ASU provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contract modifications\nand hedging relationships, subject to meeting certain criteria, that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. It is\nintended to help stakeholders during the global market-wide reference rate transition period. In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01\nwhich clarifies that certain optional expedients and exceptions in Topic 848 for contract modifications and hedge accounting apply to derivatives\nthat are affected by the discounting transition. The guidance is effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020, through December 31, 2022. The\nBancorp is implementing a transition plan to identify and modify its loans and other financial instruments with attributes that are either directly or\nindirectly influenced by LIBOR. The Bancorp believes the adoption of this guidance on activities after December 31, 2020, through December\n31, 2022, will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08 related to accounting for acquired revenue contracts with customers in a business\ncombination. The amendments in this update address diversity in practice and inconsistency related to recognition of an acquired contract\nliability and the effect of payment terms on subsequent revenue recognition for the acquirer. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning\nafter December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We plan to adopt this pronouncement for our fiscal year beginning\nJanuary 1, 2023, and we do not expect it to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-01 related to the portfolio layer method of hedge accounting. The amendments in this update\nclarify the accounting and promote consistency in reporting for hedges where the portfolio layer method is applied. This update is effective for\nfiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, and interim periods within those fiscal years. As we currently do not have items accounted for\nunder the portfolio layer method of hedge accounting, we do not expect the update to have an effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage\nDisclosures, which addresses and amends areas identified by the FASB as part of its post-implementation review of the accounting standard\nthat introduced the CECL model. The amendments eliminate the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings by companies that have\nadopted the CECL model and enhance the disclosure requirements for loan refinancings and restructurings made with borrowers experiencing\nfinancial difficulty. In addition, the amendments require disclosure of current-period gross writeoffs for financing receivables and net investment in\nleases by year of origination in the vintage disclosures. ASU 2022-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including\ninterim periods within those fiscal years for entities that have adopted the CECL accounting standard. Early adoption, however, is permitted if an\nentity has adopted the CECL accounting standard. The Bancorp is assessing ASU 2022-02 and its impact on its accounting and disclosures.\nIn June 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-03 “Fair Value Measurements (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities\nSubject to Contractual Sale Restrictions.” These amendments clarify that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not\nconsidered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value. This guidance is effective\nfor public business entities for fiscal years, including interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2023. Early adoption\nis permitted. The Bancorp has assessed ASU 2022-03 and does not expect it to have a material impact on its accounting and disclosures.\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04 “Liabilities - Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50)” enhancing the\ntransparency of supplier finance programs and the related financial statement disclosures. The amendments require that a buyer in a supplier\nfinance program disclose information about the key terms of the program, outstanding confirmed amounts as of the end of the period, a\nrollforward of such amounts during each annual period, and a description of where in the financial statements outstanding amounts are\npresented. ASU 2022-04 is effective January 1, 2023, except for the disclosure of rollforward information, which is effective January 1, 2024, and\nis not expected to have an impact on the Bancorp’s consolidated financial statements.\n71 of 113\nIn December 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-06 \"Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) - Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848\",\nwhich extends the optional transition relief to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform on financial reporting. The\ntransition relief is provided through December 30, 2024 based on the expectation that the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) will cease to\nbe published as of June 30, 2023. During the year, we applied the transition guidance to our interest rate swap portfolio transitioning from LIBOR\nto the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”). There was no material impact on our consolidated financial statements in the periods\npresented.\nNOTE 2 – Acquisition Activity\nOn January 31, 2022, Finward Bancorp (“Finward”) completed its previously announced acquisition of Royal Financial, Inc., a Delaware\ncorporation (“RYFL”), pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated July 28, 2021 (the “Merger Agreement”) between Finward and RYFL.\nThe stockholders of both Finward and RYFL approved the Merger Agreement at the respective stockholder meetings of the companies held on\nDecember 13, 2021. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, RYFL merged with and into Finward, with Finward as the surviving corporation (the\n“Merger”), and Royal Savings Bank, an Illinois state-chartered savings bank and wholly-owned subsidiary of RYFL, merged with and into\nPeoples Bank, the wholly-owned Indiana state-chartered commercial bank subsidiary of Finward, with Peoples Bank as the surviving bank.\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement, RYFL stockholders who owned 101 or more shares of RYFL common stock were permitted to\nelect to receive either 0.4609 shares of Finward common stock or $20.14 in cash, or a combination of both, for each share of RYFL common\nstock owned, subject to proration and allocation provisions such that 65% of the shares of RYFL common stock outstanding immediately prior to\nthe closing of the merger were converted into the right to receive shares of Finward common stock and the remaining 35% of the outstanding\nRYFL shares were converted into the right to receive cash. Stockholders holding less than 101 shares of RYFL common stock received fixed\nconsideration of $20.14 in cash per share and no stock consideration.\nAs a result of RYFL stockholder stock and cash elections and the related allocation and proration provisions of the merger agreement,\nFinward issued 795,423 shares of its common stock and paid cash consideration of approximately $18.7 million in the Merger. Based on the\nJanuary 28, 2022, closing price of $47.75 per share of Finward common stock, the transaction had an implied valuation of approximately $56.7\nmillion. In connection with the acquisition, Robert W. Youman, was appointed to the boards of directors of Finward and Peoples Bank effective as\nof the closing of the Merger. RYFL had a home office and eight branch offices in Cook County and DuPage County, Illinois. The acquisition has\nfurther expanded the Bank’s banking center network in Cook County and DuPage County, Illinois.\nUnder the acquisition method of accounting, the total purchase price is allocated to net tangible and intangible assets based on their current\nestimated fair values on the date of the acquisition. Based on the valuations of the fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed, which are based on estimates and assumptions that are subject to change, the final purchase price for the RYFL acquisition\nis allocated as follows (in thousands):\nASSETS\nCash and due from banks $ 52,524\nInvestment securities, available for sale -\nCertificate of deposit in other financial institutions 245\nTotal Loans 450,757\nPremises and equipment, net 13,896\nFHLB stock 1,303\nGoodwill 11,286\nCore deposit intangible 3,220\nInterest receivable 1,836\nOther assets 7,978\nTotal assets purchased $ 543,045\nCommon shares issued 37,981\nCash paid 18,725\nTotal purchase price $ 56,706\nLIABILITIES\nDeposits\nNon-interest bearing $ 32,095\nNOW accounts 63,639\nSavings and money market 184,149\nCertificates of deposits 195,153\nTotal Deposits 475,036\nInterest payable 75\nOther liabilities 11,228\nTotal liabilities assumed $ 486,339\n72 of 113\nDuring the year-ended December 31, 2022, an adjustment was made to the carrying value of other assets of $409 thousand, due to the\nvaluation of prepaids and deferred tax assets brought over in the acquisition, and premises and equipment, net, of $48 thousand, due to a\ncorrection in the valuation of buildings, in addition, a correction was made to the valuation of shares issued increasing the value by $79\nthousand. The resulting impact of these changes was a decrease to the goodwill balance related to the RYFL acquisition of $378 thousand.\nGoodwill related to the RYFL transaction is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.\nGross loans acquired during the RYFL transaction totaled $456.7 million. As of December 31, 2022, the remaining outstanding principal of\nloans directly related to the RYFL acquisition total $363.0 million, of which $5.0 million are expected to be uncollectable.\nThe following pro-forma and earnings (unaudited) of the combined company are presented as if the RYFL merger had occurred on January\n1, 2022 and January 1, 2021:\nFor the twelve months ended For the twelve months ended\n(in thousands) December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021\nSelected Financial Data\nInterest income $ 73,730 $ 70,585\nInterest expense (4,987) (3,538)\nRecovery of (provision for) loan losses - (1,181)\nNon-interest income 11,648 16,607\nNon-interest expense (1) (60,228) (57,290)\nIncome before provision for income taxes 20,163 25,183\nIncome tax expense (2,235) (3,525)\nNet income $ 17,928 $ 21,658\nEarnings per common share:\nBasic $ 4.29 $ 6.23\nDiluted $ 4.28 $ 6.23\n(1) Excludes $2.9 million in pre-tax merger expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2022.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the Bancorp has recorded $2.9 million in pre-tax one-time merger expenses related to the\nRYFL acquisition, and these expenses have been allocated to the following non-interest expense line items within the income statement:\n(in thousands) Twelve months ended\nNoninterest expense: December 31, 2022\nCompensation and benefits $ 132\nData processing 1,929\nMarketing 135\nOther 656\nPeriod merger expense $ 2,852\n73 of 113\nNOTE 3 – Securities\nThe estimated fair value of available-for-sale securities and the related gross unrealized gains and losses recognized in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss) were as follows:\n(Dollars in thousands)\nGross Gross Estimated\nCost Unrealized Unrealized Fair\nBasis Gains Losses Value\nDecember 31, 2022\nU.S. government sponsored entities $ 8,883 $ - $ (1,258) 7,625\nU.S. treasury securities 389 - - 389\nCollateralized mortgage obligations and residential\nmortgage-backed securities 163,000 - (28,884) 134,116\nMunicipal securities 281,032 7 (53,321) 227,718\nCollateralized debt obligations 2,173 - (1,125) 1,048\nTotal securities available-for-sale $ 455,477 $ 7 $ (84,588) $ 370,896\n(Dollars in thousands)\nGross Gross Estimated\nCost Unrealized Unrealized Fair\nBasis Gains Losses Value\nDecember 31, 2021\nU.S. government sponsored entities $ 8,883 $ - $ (214) $ 8,669\nU.S. treasury securities 400 - - 400\nCollateralized mortgage obligations and residential\nmortgage-backed securities 187,279 961 (3,539) 184,701\nMunicipal securities 322,750 9,904 (527) 332,127\nCollateralized debt obligations 2,173 - (1,181) 992\nTotal securities available-for-sale $ 521,485 $ 10,865 $ (5,461) $ 526,889\nThe cost basis, estimated fair value of available-for-sale securities, and carrying amount, if different, at December 31, 2022, by contractual\nmaturity were as follows.

The use and application of these grades by the Bancorp is uniform and conforms to regulatory definitions.\nDuring the year, the Bancorp reassessed its risk ratings, and while the credit quality indicators have not change the naming conventions have.\nThe loan grading system is as follows:\n1 – Superior Quality\nLoans in this category are substantially risk free. Loans fully collateralized by a Bank certificate of deposit or Bank deposits with a hold are\nsubstantially risk free.\n2 – Excellent Quality\nThe borrower generates excellent and consistent cash flow for debt coverage, excellent average credit scores, excellent liquidity and net worth\nand are reputable operators with over 15 years experience. Current and debt to tangible net worth ratios are excellent. Loan to value is\nsubstantially below policy and collateral condition is excellent.\n3 – Great Quality\nThe borrower generates more than sufficient cash flow to fund debt service and cash flow is improving. Average credit scores are very strong.\nOperators are reputable with significant years of experience. Liquidity, net worth, current and debt to tangible net worth ratios are very strong.\nLoan to value is significantly below policy and collateral condition is significantly above average.\n4 – Above Average Quality\nThe borrower generates more than sufficient cash flow to fund debt service but cash flow trends may be stable or slightly declining. Average\ncredit scores are strong. The borrower is a reputable operator with many years of experience. Liquidity, net worth, current and debt to tangible\nnet worth ratios are strong. Loan to value is below policy and collateral condition is above average.\n5 – Average Quality\nBorrowers are considered creditworthy and can repay the debt in the normal course of business, however, cash flow trends may be inconsistent\nor fluctuating. Average credit scores are satisfactory and years of experience is acceptable. Liquidity and net worth are satisfactory. Current and\ndebt to tangible net worth ratios are average. Loan to value is slightly below policy and the collateral condition is slightly above average.\n6 – Pass\nBorrowers are considered credit worthy but financial condition may show signs of weakness due to internal or external factors. Cash flow trends\nmay be declining annually. Average credit scores may be low but remain acceptable. Borrower has limited years of experience. Liquidity, net\nworth, current and debt to tangible net worth ratios are below average. Loan to value is nearing policy limits and collateral condition is average.\n7 – Special Mention\nA special mention asset has identified weaknesses that deserve Management’s close attention. If left uncorrected, these weaknesses may result\nin deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the institution’s credit position at some future date. Special mention assets are not\nadversely classified and do not expose an institution to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification. There is still adequate protection by the\ncurrent sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged. The Special Mention rating is viewed as transitional and will\nbe monitored closely.\nLoans in this category may exhibit some of the following risk factors. Cash flow trends may be consistently declining or may be questionable.\nDebt coverage ratios may be at or near 1:1. Average credit scores may be very weak or the borrower may have minimal years of experience.\nLiquidity, net worth, current and debt to tangible net worth ratios may be very weak. Loan to value may be at policy limits or may exceed policy\nlimits. Collateral condition may be below average.\n80 of 113\n8 – Substandard\nThis classification consists of loans which are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the\ncollateral pledged. Financial statements normally reveal some or all of the following: poor trends, lack of earnings and cash flow, excessive debt,\nlack of liquidity, and the absence of creditor protection. Loans are still considered collectible, but due to increased risks and defined weaknesses\nof the credit, some loss could be incurred in collection if the deficiencies are not corrected.\n9 – Doubtful\nSuch loans have been placed on nonaccrual status and may be heavily dependent upon collateral possessing a value that is difficult to\ndetermine or based upon some near-term event which lacks clear certainty. These loans have all of the weaknesses of those classified as\nSubstandard; however, based on existing conditions, these weaknesses make full collection of the principal balance highly improbable.\n10 – Loss\nLoans that are considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuing to carry them as assets is not warranted.\nPerforming loans are loans that are paying as agreed and are approximately less than ninety days past due on payments of interest and\nprincipal.\nDuring the twelve months ending December 31, 2022, nine residential real estate loans to nine customers totaling $743 thousand were\nmodified to include deferral of principal or interest resulting in troubled debt restructuring classification.

Shares were surrendered with a total value of $120 thousand and $131 thousand in 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively.\nA summary of changes in the Bancorp’s non-vested restricted stock for the year ended December 31, 2022, follows:\nWeighted\nAverage\nGrant Date\nNon-vested Shares Shares Fair Value\nNon-vested at January 1, 2022 44,235 $ 42.33\nGranted 24,555 45.64\nVested (11,158) 41.63\nForfeited (1,799) 44.20\nNon-vested at December 31, 2022 55,833 $ 43.87\nAs of December 31, 2022, there was approximately $1.2 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested restricted\nshares granted under the Incentive Plan. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.3 years.\nNote 12 – Regulatory Capital\nThe Bank is subject to regulatory capital guidelines adopted by the FDIC. Capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action\nregulations involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting\npractices. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators. Failure to meet various capital\nrequirements can initiate regulatory action. Prompt corrective action regulations provide five classifications, including well capitalized, adequately\ncapitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized, although these terms are not used to represent\noverall financial condition. If adequately capitalized, regulatory approval is required to accept brokered deposits. If undercapitalized, capital\ndistributions are limited, as is asset growth and expansion, and capital restoration plans are required. At December 31, 2022, and 2021, the most\nrecent regulatory notifications categorized the Bank is well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. There are no\nconditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the Bank’s category.\nIn addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions by the institution and certain\ndiscretionary bonus payments to management if an institution does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity\nTier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements.\n91 of 113\nIn addition, the following table shows that, at December 31, 2022, and 2021, the Bank’s capital exceeded all applicable regulatory capital\nrequirements.

However, the Bank must obtain the approval of the Indiana Department\nof Financial Institutions (DFI) if the total of all dividends declared by the Bank during the current year, including the proposed dividend, would\nexceed the sum of retained net income for the year to date plus its retained net income for the previous two years. For this purpose, “retained\nnet income,” means net income as calculated for call report purposes, less all dividends declared for the applicable period. An exemption from\nDFI approval would require that the Bank have been assigned a composite uniform financial institutions rating of 1 or 2 as a result of the most\nrecent federal or state examination; the proposed dividend would not result in a Tier 1 leverage ratio below 7.5%; and that the Bank not be\nsubject to any corrective action, supervisory order, supervisory agreement, or board approved operating agreement. The aggregate amount of\ndividends that may be declared by the Bank in 2022, without the need for qualifying for an exemption or prior DFI approval, is its 2023 net profit.\nMoreover, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve Board may prohibit the payment of dividends if it determines that the payment of dividends would\nconstitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the Bank. On November 29, 2022, the Board of Directors of the\nBancorp declared a fourth quarter dividend of $0.31 per share. The Bancorp’s fourth quarter dividend totaling $1.3 million was paid to\nshareholders on January 6, 2023.\nNote 13 – Earnings per Common Share\nEarnings per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. A\nreconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic earnings per common share and diluted earnings per common share\ncomputations for 2022 and 2021 is presented below.\n(dollars in thousands except per share data)\n2022 2021\nBasic earnings per common share:\nNet income as reported $ 15,080 $ 14,963\nWeighted average common shares outstanding 4,176,125 3,477,309\nBasic earnings per common share $ 3.61 $ 4.30\nDiluted earnings per common share:\nNet income as reported $ 15,080 $ 14,963\nWeighted average common shares outstanding 4,176,125 3,477,309\nAdd: Dilutive effect of unvested restricted stock awards 17,357 -\nWeighted average common and dilutive potential common shares outstanding 4,193,482 3,477,309\nDiluted earnings per common share $ 3.60 $ 4.30\n92 of 113\nNote 14 – Related Party Transactions\nThe Bancorp had aggregate loans outstanding to directors and executive officers (with individual balances exceeding $120 thousand) of\napproximately $3.5 million at December 31, 2022, and approximately $3.9 million at December 31, 2021. For the year ended December 31,\n2022, the following activity occurred on these loans:\n(Dollars in thousands)\nAggregate balance at the beginning of the year $ 3,883\nNew loans -\nRepayments (354)\nAggregate balance at the end of the year $ 3,529\nDeposits from directors and executive officers totaled approximately $3.7 million and $3.9 million at December 31, 2022, and 2021,\nrespectively.\nNote 15 – Commitments and Contingencies\nThe Bancorp is a party to financial instruments in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These\nfinancial instruments, which include commitments to make loans and standby letters of credit, are not reflected in the accompanying\nconsolidated financial statements. Such financial instruments are recorded when they are funded.\nThe Bancorp’s exposure to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to\noriginate loans and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. Commitments generally have fixed\nexpiration dates or other termination clauses and may require the payment of a fee. The Bancorp uses the same credit policy to make such\ncommitments as it uses for on-balance sheet items. Since commitments to make loans may expire without being used, the amount does not\nnecessarily represent future cash commitments.\nThe Bancorp had outstanding commitments to originate loans as follows:\n(Dollars in thousands)\nDecember 31, 2022:\nResidential real estate $ 21,983\nHome equity 54,432\nCommercial real estate 14,776\nConstruction and land development 46,723\nMultifamily 2,222\nConsumer 29,586\nCommercial business 76,446\nLot 6,143\nTotal $ 252,311\nDecember 31, 2021:\nResidential real estate $ 19,295\nHome equity 49,010\nCommercial real estate 10,778\nConstruction and land development 59,308\nMultifamily 1,187\nConsumer 23,422\nCommercial business 61,985\nLot 9,399\nTotal $ 234,384\nStandby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Bancorp to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. At\nDecember 31, 2022, and 2021, the Bancorp had standby letters of credit totaling approximately $13.7 and $12.3 million which are not included in\nthe tables above, respectively. The Bancorp evaluates each customer’s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral\nobtained, if deemed necessary by the Bancorp upon extension of credit, is based on management’s credit evaluation of the borrower. Collateral\nobtained may include accounts receivable, inventory, property, land or other assets.\n93 of 113\nNote 16 – Derivative Financial Instruments\nThe Bancorp uses derivative financial instruments to help manage exposure to interest rate risk and the effects that changes in interest rates\nmay have on net income and the fair value of assets and liabilities. The Bancorp has certain interest rate derivative positions that are not\ndesignated as hedging instruments. Derivative assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and do not\ntake into account the effects of master netting agreements. Master netting agreements allow the Bancorp to settle all derivative contracts held\nwith a single counterparty on a net basis, and to offset net derivative positions with related collateral, where applicable. These derivative\npositions relate to transactions in which the Bancorp enters into an interest rate swap with a client while at the same time entering into an\noffsetting interest rate swap with another financial institution. In connection with each transaction, the Bancorp agrees to pay interest to the client\non a notional amount at a variable interest rate and receive interest from the client on the same notional amount at a fixed interest rate. At the\nsame time, the Bancorp agrees to pay another financial institution the same fixed interest rate on the same notional amount and receive the\nsame variable interest rate on the same notional amount. The transaction allows the client to effectively convert a variable rate loan to a fixed\nrate. Because the terms of the swaps with the customers and the other financial institutions offset each other, with the only difference being\ncounterparty credit risk, changes in the fair value of the underlying derivative contracts are not materially different and do not significantly impact\nthe Bancorp’s results of operations.\nThe Bancorp enters into commitments to originate loans whereby the interest rate on the loan is determined prior to funding (i.e., interest\nrate lock commitment). The interest rate lock commitments are considered derivatives and are recorded on the accompanying consolidated\nbalance sheets at fair value in accordance with FASB ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging.\nThe following table shows the amounts of non-hedging derivative financial instruments:\nDecember 31, 2022\nAsset derivatives Liability derivatives\nStatement of Financial Condition Statement of Financial\n(Dollars in thousands) classification Fair value Condition classification Fair value\nInterest rate swap contracts Other assets $ 8,972 Other liabilties $ 8,972\nInterest rate lock\ncommitments Other assets 38 N/A -\nTotal $ 9,010 $ 8,972\nDecember 31, 2021\nAsset derivatives Liability derivatives\nStatement of Financial Condition Statement of Financial\n(Dollars in thousands) classification Fair value Condition classification Fair value\nInterest rate swap contracts Other assets $ 2,686 Other liabilties $ 2,686\nInterest rate lock\ncommitments Other assets 141 N/A -\nTotal $ 2,827 $ 2,686\nThe following table shows the amounts included in the Statements of Income for non-hedging derivative financial instruments:\nYear-ended\nStatement of Income\n(Dollars in thousands) Classification 2022 2021\nInterest rate swap contracts Fees and service charges $ 267 $ 379\nGain on sale of loans held-for-\nInterest rate lock commitments sale, net (103) (233)\nTotal $ 164 $ 146\n94 of 113\nThe following table shows the offsetting of financial assets and derivative assets:\nGross Amounts not Offset in the\nStatement of Financial Condition\nGross Amounts of Gross Amounts Offset in the Net Amounts of Assets Presented Cash Collateral\nStatement of Financial in the Statement of Financial Financial\n(Dollars in thousands) Recognized Assets Condition Condition Instruments Received Net Amount\nDecember 31, 2022\nInterest rate swap contracts $ 8,972 $ - $ 8,972 $ - $ - $ 8,972\nInterest rate lock commitments 38 - 38 - - 38\nTotal $ 9,010 $ - $ 9,010 $ - $ - $ 9,010\nGross Amounts not Offset in the\nStatement of Financial Condition\nNet Amounts of Liabilities\nGross Amounts of Gross Amounts Offset in the Presented Cash Collateral\nRecognized in the Statement of Financial Financial\n(Dollars in thousands) Liabilities Statement of Financial Condition Condition Instruments Received Net Amount\nDecember 31, 2021\nInterest rate swap contracts $ 2,686 $ - $ 2,686 $ - $ - $ 2,686\nInterest rate lock commitments 141 - 141 - - 141\nTotal $ 2,827 $ - $ 2,827 $ - $ - $ 2,827\nThe following table shows the offsetting of financial liabilities and derivative liabilities:\nGross Amounts not Offset in the\nStatement of Financial Condition\nNet Amounts of Liabilities\nGross Amounts of Gross Amounts Offset in the Presented Cash Collateral\nRecognized Statement of Financial in the Statement of Financial Financial\n(Dollars in thousands) Liabilities Condition Condition Instruments Pledged Net Amount\nDecember 31, 2022\nInterest rate swap contracts $ 8,972 $ - $ 8,972 $ - $ 3,930 $ 5,042\nTotal $ 8,972 $ - $ 8,972 $ - $ 3,930 $ 5,042\nGross Amounts not Offset in the\nStatement of Financial Condition\nNet Amounts of Liabilities\nGross Amounts of Gross Amounts Offset in the Presented Cash Collateral\nRecognized Statement of Financial in the Statement of Financial Financial\n(Dollars in thousands) Liabilities Condition Condition Instruments Pledged Net Amount\nDecember 31, 2021\nInterest rate swap contracts $ 2,686 $ - $ 2,686 $ - $ 3,930 $ (1,244)\nTotal $ 2,686 $ - $ 2,686 $ - $ 3,930 $ (1,244)\nNote 17 – Fair Values of Financial Instruments\nThe Fair Value Measurements Topic (the “Topic”) establishes a hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and\nminimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The Topic describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair\nvalue:\nLevel 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the\nmeasurement date.\nLevel 2: Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in\nmarkets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.\nLevel 3: Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a reporting entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would\nuse in pricing an asset or liability.\nThe fair values of securities available for sale are determined on a recurring basis by obtaining quoted prices on nationally recognized\nsecurities exchanges or pricing models utilizing significant observable inputs such as matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique widely\nused in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities, but rather by relying on the\nsecurities’ relationship to other benchmark quoted securities. Different judgments and assumptions used in pricing could result in different\nestimates of value. In certain cases where market data is not readily available because of lack of market activity or little public disclosure, values\nmay be based on unobservable inputs and classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\n95 of 113\nAt the end of each reporting period, securities held in the investment portfolio are evaluated on an individual security level for other-than-\ntemporary impairment in accordance with the Investments – Debt and Equity Securities Topic. Impairment is other-than-temporary if the decline\nin the fair value of the security is below its amortized cost and it is probable that all amounts due according to the contractual terms of a debt\nsecurity will not be received. Significant judgments are required in determining impairment, which include making assumptions regarding the\nestimated prepayments, loss assumptions and the change in interest rates. The Bancorp considers the following factors when determining other-\nthan-temporary impairment for a security: the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than amortized cost; the\nfinancial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; the underlying fundamentals of the relevant market and the outlook for such market for\nthe near future; an assessment of whether the Bancorp (1) has the intent to sell the debt securities or (2) more likely than not will be required to\nsell the debt securities before their anticipated market recovery. If either of these conditions are met, management will recognize other-than-\ntemporary impairment. If, in management’s judgment, an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the cost basis of the security will be written\ndown for the credit loss, and the unrealized loss will be transferred from accumulated other comprehensive loss as an immediate reduction of\ncurrent earnings.\nThe Bancorp’s management utilizes a specialist to perform an other-than-temporary impairment analysis for each of its two pooled trust\npreferred securities, with a cost basis of $2.2 million and fair value of $1.0 million as of December 31, 2022. The analysis is performed annually\non December 31 and utilizes analytical models used to project future cash flows for the pooled trust preferred securities based on current\nassumptions for prepayments, default and deferral rates, and recoveries. The projected cash flows are then tested for impairment consistent with\nthe Investments – Other Topic and the Investments – Debt and Equity Securities Topic. The other-than-temporary impairment testing compares\nthe present value of the cash flows from quarter to quarter to determine if there is a “favorable” or “adverse” change. Other-than-temporary\nimpairment is recorded if the projected present value of cash flows is lower than the book value of the security. To perform the annual other-than-\ntemporary impairment analysis, management utilizes current reports issued by the trustee, which contain principal and interest tests, waterfall\ndistributions, note valuations, collection detail and credit ratings for each pooled trust preferred security. In addition, a detailed review of the\nperforming collateral (which consists of banks) was performed. The review of the collateral began with a review of financial information provided\nby S&P Global Capital IQ, a comprehensive database, widely used in the industry, which gathers financial data on banks from U.S. GAAP\nfinancial statements for public companies (annual and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q), as well as regulatory reports for private\ncompanies, including consolidated financial statements for bank holding companies (FR Y-9C reports) and parent company-only financial\nstatements for bank holding companies (FR Y-9SP reports) filed with the Federal Reserve and bank call reports filed with the FDIC and OCC.\nUsing the information sources described above, for each bank and thrift examined, the following items were examined: nature of the issuer’s\nbusiness, years of operating history, corporate structure, loan composition and loan concentrations, deposit mix, asset growth rates, geographic\nfootprint and local economic environment. The issuers’ historical financial performance was reviewed and their financial ratios were compared to\nappropriate peer groups of regional banks or thrifts with similar asset sizes. The analysis focused on six broad categories: profitability (revenue\nstreams and earnings quality, return on assets and shareholder’s equity, net interest margin and interest rate sensitivity), credit quality (charge-\noffs and recoveries, non-current loans and total non-performing assets as a percentage of total loans, loan loss reserve coverage and the\nadequacy of the loan loss provision), operating efficiency (noninterest expense compared to total revenue), capital adequacy (Tier-1, total capital\nand leverage ratios and equity capital growth), leverage (tangible equity as a percentage of tangible assets, short-term and long-term borrowings\nand double leverage at the holding company) and liquidity (the nature and availability of funding sources, net non-core funding dependence and\nquality of deposits). In addition, for publicly traded companies, stock price movements were reviewed and the market price of publicly traded\ndebt instruments was examined. The current other-than-temporary impairment analysis indicated that the Bancorp’s two pooled trust preferred\nsecurities had no additional other-than-temporary impairment for the years ending December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nThe table below shows the credit loss roll forward for the Bancorp’s pooled trust preferred securities that have been classified with other-\nthan-temporary impairment:\n(Dollars in thousands)\nCollateralized debt obligations\nother-than-temporary impairment\nEnding balance, December 31, 2021 $ 173\nAdditions not previously recognized -\nEnding balance, December 31, 2022 $ 173\n96 of 113\nThe Bancorp’s subordination for each trust preferred security is calculated by taking the total performing collateral and subtracting the sum of\nthe total collateral within the Bancorp’s class and the total collateral within all senior classes, and then stating this result as a percentage of the\ntotal performing collateral. This measure is an indicator of the level of collateral that can default before potential cash flow disruptions may occur.\nIn addition, management calculates subordination assuming future collateral defaults by utilizing the default/deferral assumptions in the\nBancorp’s other-than-temporary impairment analysis. Subordination assuming future default/deferral assumptions is calculated by deducting\nfuture defaults from the current performing collateral. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, management reviewed the subordination levels for each\nsecurity in context of the level of current collateral defaults and deferrals within each security; the potential for additional defaults and deferrals\nwithin each security; the length of time that the security has been in “payment in kind” status; and the Bancorp’s class position within each\nsecurity.\nManagement calculated the other-than-temporary impairment model assumptions based on the specific collateral underlying each individual\nsecurity. The following assumption methodology was applied consistently to each of the two pooled trust preferred securities: For collateral that\nhas already defaulted, no recovery was assumed; no cash flows were assumed from collateral currently in deferral, with the exception of the\nrecovery assumptions. The default and recovery assumptions were calculated based on the detailed collateral review. The discount rate\nassumption used in the calculation of the present value of cash flows is based on the discount margin (i.e., credit spread) at the time each\nsecurity was purchased using the original purchase price. The discount margin is then added to the appropriate 3-month Secured Overnight\nFinancing Rate (SOFR) forward rate obtained from the forward SOFR curve.\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, the trust preferred securities with a cost basis of $2.2 million have been placed in “payment in kind” status.\nThe Bancorp’s securities that are classified as “payment in kind” are a result of not receiving the scheduled quarterly interest payments. For the\nsecurities in “payment in kind” status, management anticipates to receive the unpaid contractual interest payments from the issuer, because of\nthe self-correcting cash flow waterfall provisions within the structure of the securities. When a tranche senior to the Bancorp’s position fails the\ncoverage test, the Bancorp’s interest cash flows are paid to the senior tranche and recorded as a reduction of principal. The coverage test\nrepresents an over collateralization target by stating the balance of the performing collateral as a percentage of the balance of the Bancorp’s\ntranche, plus the balance of all senior tranches. The principal reduction in the senior tranche continues until the appropriate coverage test is\npassed. As a result of the principal reduction in the senior tranche, more cash is available for future payments to the Bancorp’s tranche.\nConsistent with the Investments – Debt and Equity Securities Topic, management considered the failure of the issuer of the security to make\nscheduled interest payments in determining whether a credit loss existed. Management will not capitalize the “payment in kind” interest\npayments to the book value of the securities and will keep these securities in non-accrual status until the quarterly interest payments resume.\nThe fair value of the Bancorp’s interest rate swap contracts, both assets and liabilities, are valued by a third-party pricing agent using an\nincome approach and are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.\nThe fair value of the Bancorp’s is based on the price of the underlying loans to are expected to be sold to an investor while taking into\nconsideration the probability the rate lock commitments will close and are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.\n97 of 113\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Values on a Recurring Basis\nThere were no transfers to or from Levels 1 and 2 during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Certificates of deposits in other financial institutions fair value amounts are\nbased on estimates of the rate the Bancorp would receive on similar deposits (Level 2). Loans held-for-sale comprise residential mortgages and\nare priced based on values established by the secondary mortgage markets (Level 2). The estimated fair value for net loans receivable is based\non the exit price notion which is the exchange price that would be received to transfer the loans at the most advantageous market price in an\norderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date (Level 3). Federal Home Loan Bank stock is estimated at book value\ndue to restrictions that limit the sale or transfer of the security. Fair values of accrued interest receivable and payable approximate book value, as\nthe carrying values are determined using the observable interest rate, balance, and last payment date.\nNon-interest and interest bearing deposits, which include checking, savings, and money market deposits, are estimated to have fair values\nbased on the amount payable as of the reporting date (Level 1). The fair value of fixed-maturity certificates of deposit (included in interest\nbearing deposits) are based on estimates of the rate the Bancorp would pay on similar deposits, applied for the time period until maturity (Level\n2). Estimated fair values for short-term repurchase agreements, which represent sweeps from demand deposits to accounts secured by pledged\nsecurities, are estimated based on the amount payable as of the reporting date (Level 1). Longer-term repurchase agreements, with contractual\nmaturity dates of three months or more, are based on estimates of the rate the Bancorp would pay on similar deposits, applied for the time\nperiod until maturity (Level 2). The fair value of FHLB Advances are estimated by discounting the future cash flows using quoted rates from the\nFHLB for similar advances with similar maturities (Level 2). The estimated fair value of other financial instruments, and off-balance sheet loan\ncommitments, approximate cost and are not considered significant to this presentation.\n101 of 113\nNote 18 – Parent Company Only Statements\n(Dollars in thousands)\nFinward Bancorp\nCondensed Balance Sheets\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2022 2021\nAssets\nCash on deposit with Peoples Bank $ 2,061 $ 1,183\nInvestment in Peoples Bank 131,431 153,772\nInvestment in NWIN Risk Management, Inc 2,401 1,970\nDividends receivable from Peoples Bank 1,331 1,070\nOther assets 538 581\nTotal assets $ 137,762 $ 158,576\nLiabilities and stockholders’ equity\nDividends payable $ 1,333 $ 1,079\nOther liabilities 36 882\nTotal liabilities 1,369 1,961\nAdditional paid in capital 69,032 30,430\nAccumulated other comprehensive (loss) income (64,300) 4,276\nRetained earnings 131,661 121,909\nTotal stockholders’ equity 136,393 156,615\nTotal liabilities and stockholders’ equity $ 137,762 $ 158,576\n(Dollars in thousands)\nFinward Bancorp\nCondensed Statements of Income\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022 2021\nDividends from Peoples Bank $ 24,263 $ 4,880\nDividends from NWIN Risk 925 830\nOperating expenses (117) (448)\nIncome before income taxes and equity in undistributed income of Peoples Bank 25,071 5,262\nIncome tax benefit (50) (94)\nIncome before equity in undistributed income of Peoples Bank 25,121 5,356\nEquity in undistributed\n(distributions in excess of income) income of Peoples Bank (10,472) 9,413\nincome of NWIN Risk Management, Inc 431 194\nNet income $ 15,080 $ 14,963\n102 of 113\n(Dollars in thousands)\nFinward Bancorp\nCondensed Statements of\nComprehensive Income\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022 2021\nNet Income $ 15,080 $ 14,963\nNet change in net unrealized gains and losses on securities available-for-sale:\nUnrealized loss arising during the period (89,323) (5,816)\nLess: reclassification adjustment for gains included in net income (662) (1,987)\nNet securities loss during the period (89,985) (7,803)\nTax effect 21,409 1,638\nOther comprehensive loss, net of tax (68,576) (6,165)\nComprehensive (loss) income, net of tax $ (53,496) $ 8,798\n(Dollars in thousands)\nFinward Bancorp\nCondensed Statements of Cash Flows\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022 2021\nCash flows from operating activities:\nNet income $ 15,080 $ 14,963\nAdjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities\nDistributions in excess of income (equity in undistributed income):\nPeoples Bank 10,472 (9,413)\nNWIN Risk Management, Inc (431) (1,024)\nStock based compensation expense 741 574\nChange in other assets (218) (161)\nChange in other liabilities (846) (120)\nNet cash provided by operating activities 24,798 4,819\nCash flows from investing activities:\nCash and cash equivalents from acquisition activity, net (18,725) -\nInvestment in Peoples Bank - (830)\nNet cash used by investing activities (18,725) (830)\nCash flows from financing activities:\nDividends paid (5,075) (4,310)\nNet surrender value of restricted stock awards (120) (131)\nNet cash used by financing activities (5,195) (3,867)\nNet change in cash 878 378\nCash at beginning of year 1,183 805\nCash at end of year $ 2,061 $ 1,183\nSUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES OF CASH FLOW INFORMATION:\nCash paid during the period for:\nIncome taxes 1,347 2,185\nNoncash activities:\nDividends declared not paid 1,332 1,079\n103 of 113\nItem 9.

Johnson III\n110 of 113\nExhibit 4.1\nDescription of the Registrant’s Securities\nRegistered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\nThe Common Stock, no par value per share (the “Common Stock”), of Finward Bancorp (the “Bancorp,” which is also referred to herein as “we,”\n“our,” or “us”) is registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). The following description of the\nmaterial terms of the Bancorp’s Common Stock is only a summary. This summary does not purport to be a complete description of the terms and conditions of\nthe Common Stock and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the Bancorp’s Restated Articles of Incorporation, which we refer to as the\n“Articles of Incorporation” and the Bancorp’s Amended and Restated By-Laws, which we refer to as the “By-Laws,” each of which are filed as an exhibit to the\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K of which this exhibit is a part, as well as the Indiana Business Corporation Law, which we refer to as the “IBCL,” and any other\ndocuments referenced in the summary and from which the summary is derived.\nTitle and Class\nThe title and class of the capital stock of the Bancorp that is registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act is Common Stock, without par value.\nAuthorized Shares\nThe Bancorp is authorized to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of Common Stock.\nDividend Rights\nThe Bancorp may pay dividends and make other distributions at such times, in such amounts, to such persons, for such consideration, and upon such\nterms and conditions as the Bancorp’s board of directors may determine, subject to all statutory restrictions, including certain banking law restrictions.\nThe Bancorp’s declaration of dividends is subject to Indiana law, which generally restricts the payment of dividends to amounts that will not affect the\nability of the corporation, after the dividend has been distributed, to pay its debts in the ordinary course of business. Moreover, such dividends may not exceed\nthe difference between the Bancorp’s total assets and total liabilities plus preferential amounts payable to shareholders with rights superior to those of the\nholders of Common Stock.\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve Board may prohibit the Bancorp’s payment of dividends if it concludes such payment would raise safety and\nsoundness concerns for either the Bancorp or its wholly-owned Indiana commercial bank subsidiary, Peoples Bank.\nVoting Rights\nEach holder of Common Stock generally has the right to cast one vote for each share of Common Stock held of record on all matters submitted to a\nvote of shareholders of the Bancorp.\nIndiana law provides that shareholders may not cumulate their votes in the election of directors unless the corporation’s articles of incorporation so\nprovide. The Articles of Incorporation do not grant cumulative voting rights to the Bancorp’s shareholders.\nNumber of Directors; Classification of the Board\nThe By-Laws state that the Bancorp’s board of directors will consist of three or more members, with the number thereof to be determined from time to\ntime by resolution of the board of directors. The Bancorp’s board of directors is divided into three classes, with each class containing directors as nearly equal\nin number as possible, with the term of office of one class expiring each year. Each director holds office for the term for which he or she was elected and until\nhis or her successor is elected and has qualified, or until his or her death, resignation, disqualification, or removal, or until there is a decrease in the number of\ndirectors.\n1\nLiquidation Rights\nIn the event of the liquidation, dissolution, and/or winding-up of the Bancorp, either voluntary or involuntary, after payment is made to the holders of\npreferred stock, if any, of the full amount to which they may be entitled under the Articles of Incorporation, the holders of Common Stock are entitled, to the\nexclusion of the holders of preferred stock, to share ratably, according to the number of shares of Common Stock held by them, in all the remaining assets of\nthe Bancorp available for distribution to its shareholders.\nAmendment of Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws\nExcept as otherwise provided below, amendments to the Articles of Incorporation must be approved by a majority vote of the Bancorp’s board of\ndirectors and also by a vote of shareholders entitled to vote on the matter in which more votes are cast in favor of the amendment than against the amendment.\nAny amendment or repeal of Article VIII of the Articles of Incorporation (regarding approval of business combinations), or of Sections 6.1 (regarding\nthe number of members on the board of directors), 6.6 (regarding removal of directors), 7.2 (regarding special meetings of shareholders), 7.5 (regarding the By-\nLaws), 10.2 (regarding the redemption of shares acquired in control share acquisitions), or 10.3 (regarding election to be subject to Chapter 43 of the IBCL, the\nIndiana Business Combinations Statute), or any other amendment of the Articles of Incorporation which would have the effect of modifying or permitting\ncircumvention of Article VIII or such other provisions of the Articles of Incorporation, requires the affirmative vote (i) of at least 80% of the votes entitled to\nbe cast by the holders of the outstanding shares of all classes of the Bancorp’s voting stock, acting as a single class; and (ii) a majority of the Bancorp’s\nindependent shareholders (which is generally defined in the Articles of Incorporation as shares beneficially owned by persons other than certain related persons\nof the Bancorp). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the voting thresholds described in the preceding sentence will not be required for any amendment to or repeal\nof the Articles of Incorporation if such amendment or repeal was approved by a favorable vote of at least two-thirds of the entire number of directors who\nqualify as “continuing directors” (as defined in the Articles of Incorporation) with respect to all related persons, in which case the amendment or repeal will\nonly require more votes to be cast in favor of the amendment or repeal than cast against it.\nThe Articles of Incorporation also may be amended by the Bancorp’s board of directors without shareholder approval to designate a new series of\npreferred shares.\nThe By-Laws may be amended only by a majority vote of the entire number of directors of the Bancorp’s board at the time of the vote.\nAnti-Takeover Effects of the Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws\nGeneral. The Articles of Incorporation include several provisions that may have the effect of rendering the Bancorp less attractive to potential\nacquirors, thereby discouraging future takeover attempts that certain shareholders might deem to be in their best interests, or pursuant to which shareholders\nmight receive a substantial premium for their shares over then-current market prices, but would not be approved by the Bancorp’s board of directors. These\nprovisions also have the effect of rendering the removal of management and the incumbent board of directors more difficult. However, the Bancorp’s board\nhas concluded that the potential benefits of these restrictive provisions outweigh the possible disadvantages.\n2\nDirectors. Certain provisions in the Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws impede changes in the majority control of the Bancorp’s board of\ndirectors. The By-Laws provide that the board will be divided into three classes, with directors in each class elected for staggered three-year terms. As a result,\nit would take two annual elections to replace a majority of the Bancorp’s board. Further, the By-Laws impose notice and information requirements in\nconnection with the nomination by shareholders of candidates for election to the board of directors or the proposal by shareholders of business to be acted upon\nat an annual meeting of shareholders.\nThe By-Laws provide that any vacancy occurring in the board, including a vacancy created by resignation, death, incapacity, or an increase in the\nnumber of directors, will be filled by selection of a successor, to serve for the remainder of the unexpired term, by a majority vote of the remaining members of\nthe board; provided that, if such vacancy or vacancies leaves the board with no members or if the remaining members of the board are unable to agree upon a\nsuccessor or determine not to select a successor, such vacancy may be filled by a vote of the shareholders at a special meeting called for that purpose or at the\nnext annual meeting of shareholders.\nUnder the Articles of Incorporation, any or all of the members of the board may be removed, for good cause, only at a meeting of the Bancorp’s\nshareholders called expressly for that purpose, by the affirmative vote of the holders of outstanding shares representing at least 80% of all the votes entitled to\nbe cast at an election of directors. Directors may not be removed in the absence of good cause.\nRestrictions on Call of Special Meetings. The By-Laws state that special shareholders’ meetings may be called at any time by the board of directors or\nthe President, and shall be called by the board if the Secretary of the Bancorp receives written, dated, and signed demands for a special meeting from the\nholders of shares representing at least 80% of all votes entitled to be cast on any issue proposed to be considered at the proposed special meeting.\nNo Cumulative Voting. The Articles of Incorporation do not provide for cumulative voting rights in the election of directors.\nAuthorization of Preferred Stock. The Bancorp is authorized to issue preferred stock from time to time in one or more series subject to applicable\nprovisions of law, and the board of directors is authorized to fix the designations, powers, preferences, and relative participating, optional, and other special\nrights of such shares, including voting rights, if any. In the event of a proposed merger, tender offer, or other attempt to gain control of the Bancorp not\napproved by the board of directors, it might be possible for the board to authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock with rights and preferences that\nwould impede the completion of such a transaction. An effect of the possible issuance of preferred stock, therefore, may be to deter a future takeover attempt.\nEvaluation of Offers. The IBCL specifically authorizes directors, in considering the best interests of a corporation, to consider the effects of any action\non shareholders, employees, suppliers, and customers of the corporation, the communities in which offices or other facilities of the corporation are located, and\nany other factors the directors consider pertinent. The Articles of Incorporation provide that the board, in determining whether to take or refrain from taking\nany action with respect to any matter, including the evaluation of a business combination or tender or exchange offer, and including making or declining to\nmake any recommendation to shareholders of the Bancorp, may consider both the short term and long term best interests of the Bancorp (including the\npossibility that these interests may be best served by the continued independence of the Bancorp), taking into account, and weighing as the board deems\nappropriate, the social and economic effects thereof on the Bancorp’s present and future employees, suppliers, and customers and its subsidiaries,\nthe communities in which offices or other facilities of the Bancorp are located, and any other factors the directors consider pertinent.\nProcedures for Certain Business Combinations. The Articles of Incorporation require the affirmative vote of 80% of the outstanding shares of all\nclasses of voting stock (subject to certain “fair price” and supermajority director approval exceptions), and an independent majority of shareholders, to approve\ncertain business combinations with holders of more than 10% of the Bancorp’s voting shares or their affiliates.\n3\nAmendments to Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws. As noted above, except for certain exceptions, amendments to the Articles of Incorporation\nmust be approved by a majority vote of the Bancorp’s board and also by a vote of shareholders in which more votes are cast in favor of the amendment than\nagainst the amendment. Additionally, any amendment or repeal of Article VIII of the Articles of Incorporation (regarding approval of business combinations),\nor of Sections 6.1 (regarding the number of members on the board of directors), 6.6 (regarding removal of directors), 7.2 (regarding special meetings of\nshareholders), 7.5 (regarding the By-Laws), 10.2 (regarding the redemption of shares acquired in control share acquisitions), or 10.3 (regarding election to be\nsubject to Chapter 43 of the IBCL, the Indiana Business Combinations Statute), or any other amendment of the Articles of Incorporation which would have the\neffect of modifying or permitting circumvention of Article VIII or such other provisions of the Articles of Incorporation, requires the affirmative vote (i) of at\nleast 80% of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of the outstanding shares of all classes of the Bancorp’s voting stock, acting as a single class; and\n(ii) a majority of the Bancorp’s independent shareholders.\nThe Articles of Incorporation may be amended by the board without shareholder approval to designate a new series of preferred shares.\nThe By-Laws may be amended only by a majority vote of the entire number of directors of the Bancorp’s board at the time of the vote.\nAbsence of Other Rights\nThe Company’s Common Stock has no sinking fund or redemption provisions or preemptive, conversion, or exchange rights.\n4\nExhibit 21.1\nSubsidiaries of the Bancorp\nName Jurisdiction of Organization\nPeoples Bank Indiana\nNWIN, LLC Nevada\nNWIN, Holdings Nevada\nNWIN, Investments, Inc.

Business\nGeneral\nFinward Bancorp, an Indiana corporation (the “Bancorp” or “FNWD”), was incorporated on January 31, 1994, and is the holding company for\nPeoples Bank, an Indiana-chartered commercial bank (the “Bank”). The Bank is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bancorp. The Bancorp’s\nbusiness activities include being a holding company for the Bank and the Bank's wholly owned subsidiaries, as well as a holding company for\nNWIN Risk Management, Inc., a captive insurance company.\nThe Bank is primarily engaged in the business of attracting deposits from the general public and the origination of loans, mostly upon the\nsecurity of single family residences and commercial real estate, as well as, construction loans and various types of consumer loans, commercial\nbusiness loans and municipal loans, within its primary market areas of Lake and Porter Counties, in Northwest Indiana, and Cook County,\nIllinois. In addition, the Bancorp's Wealth Management Group provides estate and retirement planning, guardianships, land trusts, profit sharing\nand 401(k) retirement plans, IRA and Keogh accounts, investment agency accounts, and serves as the personal representative of estates and\nacts as trustee for revocable and irrevocable trusts.\nThe Bank’s deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”), which is administered by the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), an agency of the federal government. As the holding company for the Bank, the Bancorp is subject to\ncomprehensive examination, supervision and regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“FRB”), while the Bank is\nsubject to comprehensive examination, supervision and regulation by both the FDIC and the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions (“DFI”).\nThe Bank is also subject to regulation by the FRB governing reserves required to be maintained against certain deposits and other matters. The\nBank is also a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) of Indianapolis, which is one of the eleven regional banks comprising the\nsystem of Federal Home Loan Banks.\nOn January 31, 2022, the Bancorp completed its previously announced acquisition of Royal Financial, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“RYFL”),\npursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated July 28, 2021, between the Bancorp and RYFL (the “Merger Agreement”). Pursuant to the\nterms of the RYFL Merger Agreement, RYFL merged with and into the Bancorp, with the Bancorp as the surviving corporation (the “RYFL\nMerger”). Simultaneously with the RYFL Merger, Royal Savings Bank (“Royal Bank”), an Illinois state chartered savings bank and wholly-owned\nsubsidiary of RYFL, merged with and into Peoples Bank, with Peoples Bank as the surviving bank. In connection with the RYFL Merger, each\nRYFL stockholder holding 101 or more shares of RYFL common stock had the right to receive, at the stockholder’s election, 0.4609 shares of\nFinward common stock or $20.14 in cash, or a combination of both, for each share of RYFL’s common stock, subject to allocation provisions and\nadjustment. Stockholders holding fewer than 101 shares of RYFL common stock received $20.14 in cash and no stock consideration for each\noutstanding share of RYFL common stock. Any fractional shares of Finward common stock that an RYFL stockholder would have otherwise\nreceived in the merger were cashed out in the amount of such fraction multiplied by $47.65. The Bancorp issued 795,423 shares of Bancorp\ncommon stock to the former RYFL stockholders, and paid cash consideration of approximately $18.7 million. Based upon the closing price of\nFNWD’s common stock on January 28, 2022, the transaction had an implied valuation of approximately $56.7 million. As a result of the\nacquisition, the Bank was able to further expand its retail banking network in the South Suburban Chicagoland market, bringing the total number\nof its full-service banking centers to 30.\nThe Bancorp maintains its corporate office at 9204 Columbia Avenue, Munster, Indiana, from which it oversees the operation of its thirty\nbranch locations. For further information, see “Properties.”\nPage 3 of 108\nForward-Looking Statements\nStatements contained in this filing on Form 10-K that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private\nSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The words or phrases “would be,” “will allow,” “intends to,” “will likely result,” “are expected to,” “will\ncontinue,” “is anticipated,” “estimate,” “project,” or similar expressions are also intended to identify “forward-looking statements” within the\nmeaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. The Bancorp cautions readers that forward-looking statements, including without\nlimitation those relating to the Bancorp’s future business prospects, interest income and expense, net income, liquidity, and capital needs are\nsubject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements\ndue to a number of factors, including those set forth above in “Recent Developments” and below in “Regulation and Supervision” of this Form 10-\nK.\nCertain of the statements made in this report are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning and protections of Section 27A of the\nSecurities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including\nstatements regarding our financial position, business strategy, and the plans and objectives of our management for future operations, are\nforward-looking statements. You can identify these forward-looking statements through our use of words such as “may,” “will,” “anticipate,”\n“assume,” “should,” “indicate,” “would,” “believe,” “contemplate,” “expect,” “estimate,” “continue,” “plan,” “point to,” “project,” “could,” “intend,”\n“target,” and other similar words and expressions relating to the future.\nAlthough management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, actual results may differ\nmaterially, and adversely or positively, from the expectations of the Bancorp that are expressed or implied by any forward-looking statement.\nRisks, uncertainties, and factors that could cause the Bancorp’s actual results to vary materially from those expressed or implied by any forward-\nlooking statement include but are not limited to:\n● the significant risks and uncertainties for our business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as our regulatory capital\nand liquidity ratios and other regulatory requirements caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which will depend on several factors,\nincluding the scope and duration of the pandemic, its influence on financial markets, the effectiveness of our remote work\narrangements and staffing levels in branches and other operational facilities, and actions taken by governmental authorities and\nother third parties in response to the pandemic;\n● the use of proceeds of future offerings of securities;\n● capital management activities, including possible future sales of new securities, or possible repurchases or redemptions by the\nBancorp of outstanding debt or equity securities;\n● changes in asset quality and credit risk;\n● our ability to sustain revenue and earnings growth;\n● changes in interest rates, market liquidity, and capital markets, as well as the magnitude of such changes, which may reduce net\ninterest margins;\n● inflation;\n● customer acceptance of the Bancorp’s products and services;\n● customer borrowing, repayment, investment, and deposit practices;\n● customer disintermediation;\nPage 4 of 108\n● the introduction, withdrawal, success, and timing of asset/liability management strategies or of mergers and acquisitions and other\nbusiness initiatives and strategies;\n● competitive conditions;\n● our ability to realize cost savings or revenues or to implement integration plans and other consequences associated with mergers,\nacquisitions, and divestitures;\n● changes in fiscal, monetary, and tax policies;\n● factors that may cause the Bancorp to incur impairment charges on its investment securities;\n● electronic, cyber, and physical security breaches;\n● claims and litigation liabilities, including related costs, expenses, settlements, and judgments, or the outcome of matters before\nregulatory agencies, whether pending or commencing in the future;\n● changes in accounting principles and interpretations;\n● economic conditions;\n● the impact, extent, and timing of technological changes, capital management activities, and other actions of the Federal Reserve\nBoard and legislative and regulatory actions and reforms; and\n● other factors and risk described in our other filings we make with the SEC under the Exchange Act.\nIn addition to the above factors, we also caution that the actual amounts and timing of any future common stock dividends or share\nrepurchases will be subject to various factors, including our capital position, financial performance, capital impacts of strategic initiatives, market\nconditions, and regulatory and accounting considerations, as well as any other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant in making such\na determination. Therefore, there can be no assurance that we will repurchase shares or pay any dividends to holders of our common stock, or\nas to the amount of any such repurchases or dividends. Further, statements about the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business,\noperations, financial performance, and prospects may constitute forward-looking statements and are subject to the risk that the actual impacts\nmay differ, possibly materially, from what is reflected in those forward-looking statements due to factors and future developments that are\nuncertain, unpredictable, and in many cases beyond our control, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, actions taken by\ngovernmental authorities in response to the pandemic, and the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on our customers, third parties, and\nus.\nBecause such forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or\nimplied by such statements. The foregoing list of important factors is not exclusive and you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these\nforward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report or, in the case of documents incorporated by reference, the dates of\nthose documents. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time\nby or on behalf of us. The “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 of this Form 10-\nK lists some of the factors that could cause the Bancorp’s actual results to vary materially from those expressed in or implied by any forward-\nlooking statements. We direct your attention to this discussion. Other risks and uncertainties that could affect the Bancorp’s future performance\nare set forth below in Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”\nPage 5 of 108\nLending Activities\nGeneral. The Bancorp’s product offerings include residential mortgage loans, construction loans, commercial real estate loans, consumer\nloans, commercial business loans and loans to municipalities. The Bancorp’s lending strategy stresses quality growth, product diversification,\nand competitive and profitable pricing. While lending efforts include both fixed and adjustable rate products, the focus has been on products with\nadjustable rates and/or shorter terms to maturity. It is management’s goal that all programs are marketed effectively to our primary market area.\nThe Bancorp is primarily a portfolio lender. Mortgage banking activities are limited to the sale of fixed rate mortgage loans with contractual\nmaturities generally exceeding fifteen years and greater. These loans are sold, on a case-by-case basis, in the secondary market as part of the\nBancorp’s efforts to manage interest rate risk. All loan sales are made to Freddie Mac or to the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis. All\nloans held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or market value.\nUnder Indiana Law, an Indiana bank generally may not make any loan to a borrower or its related entities if the total of all such loans by the\nbank exceeds 15% of its unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus (plus up to an additional 10% of unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus,\nin the case of loans fully collateralized by readily marketable collateral); provided, however, that certain specified types of loans are exempted\nfrom these limitations or subject to different limitations. The maximum amount that the Bank could have loaned to one borrower and the\nborrower’s related entities at December 31, 2021, under the 15% of capital and surplus limitation was approximately $22,029,000. At December\n31, 2021, the Bank had no loans that exceeded the regulatory limitations.\nAt December 31, 2021, there were no concentrations of loans in any type of industry that exceeded 10% of total loans that were not\notherwise disclosed as a loan category.\nPage 6 of 108\nLoan Portfolio. The following table sets forth selected data relating to the composition of the Bancorp’s loan portfolio by type of loan at the\nend of each of the last two years. The amounts are stated in thousands (000’s).\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2021 2020\nLoans secured by real estate:\nResidential real estate $ 260,134 $ 286,048\nHome equity 34,612 39,233\nCommercial real estate 317,145 298,257\nConstruction and land development 123,822 93,562\nMultifamily 61,194 50,571\nFarmland - 215\nTotal loans secured by real estate 796,907 767,886\nCommercial business 115,772 158,140\nConsumer 582 1,025\nManufactured homes 37,887 24,232\nGovernment 8,991 10,142\nLoans receivable 960,139 961,425\nLess:\nNet deferred loan origination costs 6,810 3,871\nUndisbursed loan funds (229) (150)\nLoans receivable, net of deferred fees and costs $ 966,720 $ 965,146\nPage 7 of 108\nLoan Maturity Schedule. The following table sets forth certain information at December 31, 2021, regarding the dollar amount of loans in\nthe Bancorp’s portfolio based on their contractual terms to maturity. Demand loans, loans having no schedule of repayments and no stated\nmaturity, and overdrafts are reported as due in one year or less. Contractual principal repayments of loans do not necessarily reflect the actual\nterm of the loan portfolio. The average life of mortgage loans is substantially less than their contractual terms because of loan prepayments and\nbecause of enforcement of due-on-sale clauses, which give the Bancorp the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in the event,\namong other things, that the borrower sells the property subject to the mortgage.

The primary lending area of the Bancorp encompasses Lake County in northwest Indiana and Cook County in northeast\nIllinois, where collectively a majority of loan activity is concentrated. The Bancorp is also an active lender in Porter County, and to a lesser\nextent, LaPorte, Newton, and Jasper counties in Indiana; and DuPage, Lake, and Will counties in Illinois.\nLoan Origination Fees. All loan origination and commitment fees, as well as incremental direct loan origination costs, are deferred and\namortized into income as yield adjustments.\nLoan Origination Procedure. The primary sources for loan originations are referrals from commercial customers, real estate brokers and\nbuilders, solicitations by the Bancorp’s lending and retail staff, and advertising of loan programs and rates. The Bancorp employs no staff\nappraisers. All appraisals are performed by fee appraisers that have been approved by the Board of Directors and who meet all federal\nguidelines and state licensing and certification requirements.\nDesignated officers have authorities, established by the Board of Directors, to approve loans. Loans up to $4,000,000 are approved by the\nloan officers’ loan committee. Loans from $4,000,000 to $7,000,000 are approved by the senior officers’ loan committee (SOLC). Loans from\n$7,000,000 to $15,000,000 are approved the executive officer’s loan committee. All loans in excess of $15,000,000, up to the legal lending limit\nof the Bank, must be approved by the Bank’s Board of Directors or its Credit Committee. (All members of the Bank’s Board of Directors and\nCredit Committee are also members of the Bancorp’s Board of Directors and Credit Committee, respectively.) Certain loan renewals and\nextensions may not require approval by the Board of Directors or the Credit Committee as long as there is no material change, credit\ndowngrade, significant change in borrower or guarantor status, material release or change in collateral value or the eligible loan renewal or\nextension is not outside the current concentration limits set by the Board of Directors. The maximum in-house legal lending limit as set by the\nBoard of Directors is the lower of 10% of the Bank’s risk based capital or $15,000,000. Requests that exceed this amount will be considered on a\ncase-by-case basis, after taking into consideration the legal lending limit, by specific Board action. The Bank will not extend credit to any of its\nexecutive officers, directors, or principal shareholders or to any related interest of that person, except in compliance with the insider lending\nrestrictions of Regulation O under the Federal Reserve Act and in an amount that, when aggregated with all other extensions of credit to that\nperson, exceeds $1.000,000 unless: (1) the extension of credit has been approved in advance by a majority of the entire Board of Directors of\nthe Bank, and (2) the interested party has abstained from participating directly or indirectly in the voting.\nPage 8 of 108\nAll loans secured by personal property must be covered by insurance in an amount sufficient to cover the full amount of the loan. All loans\nsecured by real estate must be covered by insurance in an amount sufficient to cover the full amount of the loan or restore the property to its\noriginal state. First mortgage loans must be covered by a lender’s title insurance policy in the amount of the loan.\nThe Current Lending Programs\nResidential Mortgage Loans. The primary lending activity of the Bancorp has been the granting of conventional mortgage loans to enable\nborrowers to purchase existing homes, refinance existing homes, or construct new homes. Conventional loans are made up to a maximum of\n97% of the purchase price or appraised value, whichever is less. For loans made in excess of 80% of value, private mortgage insurance is\ngenerally required in an amount sufficient to reduce the Bancorp’s exposure to 80% or less of the appraised value of the property. Loans insured\nby private mortgage insurance companies can be made for up to 97% of value. During 2021, 77% of mortgage loans closed were conventional\nloans with borrowers having 20% or more equity in the property. This type of loan does not require private mortgage insurance because of the\nborrower’s level of equity investment.\nFixed rate loans currently originated generally conform to Freddie Mac guidelines for loans purchased under the one‑to‑four family program.\nLoan interest rates are determined based on secondary market yield requirements and local market conditions. Fixed rate mortgage loans with\ncontractual maturities generally exceeding fifteen years and greater may be sold and/or classified as held for sale to control exposure to interest\nrate risk.\nThe 15 year mortgage loan program has gained wide acceptance in the Bancorp’s primary market area. As a result of the shortened maturity\nof these loans, this product has been priced below the comparable 20 and 30 year loan offerings. Mortgage applicants for 15 year loans tend to\nhave a larger than normal down payment; this, coupled with the larger principal and interest payment amount, has caused the 15 year mortgage\nloan portfolio to consist, to a significant extent, of second time home buyers whose underwriting qualifications tend to be above average.\nThe Bancorp’s Adjustable Rate Mortgage Loans (“ARMs”) include offerings that reprice annually or are “Mini-Fixed.” The “Mini‑Fixed”\nmortgage reprices annually after a one, three, five, seven or ten year period. ARM originations totaled $11.5 million for 2021 and $9.9 million for\n2020. During 2021, ARMs represented 6.1% of total mortgage loan originations. The ability of the Bancorp to successfully market ARM’s\ndepends upon loan demand, prevailing interest rates, volatility of interest rates, public acceptance of such loans and terms offered by\ncompetitors.\nConstruction Loans. Construction loans on residential properties are made primarily to individuals and contractors who are under contract\nwith individual purchasers. These loans are personally guaranteed by the borrower. The maximum loan-to-value ratio is 89% of either the current\nappraised value or the cost of construction, whichever is less. Residential construction loans are typically made for periods of six months to one\nyear.\nLoans are also made for the construction of commercial properties. All such loans are made in accordance with well-defined underwriting\nstandards. Generally if the loans are not owner occupied, these types of loans require proof of intent to lease and a confirmed end-loan takeout.\nIn general, loans made do not exceed 80% of the appraised value of the property. Commercial construction loans are typically made for periods\nnot to exceed two years or date of occupancy, whichever is less.\nPage 9 of 108\nCommercial Real Estate Loans. Commercial real estate loans are typically made to a maximum of 80% of the appraised value. Such loans\nare generally made on an adjustable rate basis. These loans are typically made for terms of 15 to 20 years. Loans with an amortizing term\nexceeding 15 years normally have a balloon feature calling for a full repayment within seven to ten years from the date of the loan. The balloon\nfeature affords the Bancorp the opportunity to restructure the loan if economic conditions so warrant. Commercial real estate loans include loans\nsecured by commercial rental units, apartments, condominium developments, small shopping centers, owner occupied commercial/industrial\nproperties, hospitality units and other retail and commercial developments.\nWhile commercial real estate lending is generally considered to involve a higher degree of risk than single‑family residential lending due to\nthe concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and the effects of general economic conditions on real estate developers and\nmanagers, the Bancorp has endeavored to reduce this risk in several ways. In originating commercial real estate loans, the Bancorp considers\nthe feasibility of the project, the financial strength of the borrowers and lessees, the managerial ability of the borrowers, the location of the project\nand the economic environment. Management evaluates the debt coverage ratio and analyzes the reliability of cash flows, as well as the quality\nof earnings. All such loans are made in accordance with well-defined underwriting standards and are generally supported by personal\nguarantees, which represent a secondary source of repayment.\nLoans for the construction of commercial properties are generally located within an area permitting physical inspection and regular review of\nbusiness records. Projects financed outside of the Bancorp’s primary lending area generally involve borrowers and guarantors who are or were\nprevious customers of the Bancorp or projects that are underwritten according to the Bank’s underwriting standards.\nConsumer Loans. The Bancorp offers consumer loans to individuals for personal, household or family purposes. Consumer loans are either\nsecured by adequate collateral, or unsecured. Unsecured loans are based on the strength of the applicant’s financial condition. All borrowers\nmust meet current underwriting standards. The consumer loan program includes both fixed and variable rate products.\nHome Equity Line of Credit. The Bancorp offers a fixed and variable rate revolving line of credit secured by the equity in the borrower’s\nhome. Both products offer an interest only option where the borrower pays interest only on the outstanding balance each month. Equity lines will\ntypically require a second mortgage appraisal and a second mortgage lender’s title insurance policy. Loans are generally made up to a maximum\nof 89% of the appraised value of the property less any outstanding liens.\nHome Improvement Loans and Equity Loans—Fixed Term. Home improvement and equity loans are made up to a maximum of 85% of\nthe appraised value of the improved property, less any outstanding liens. These loans are offered on both a fixed and variable rate basis with a\nmaximum term of 240 months. All home equity loans are made on a direct basis to borrowers.\nManufactured Homes. The Bancorp purchases fixed rate closed loans from a third party that are subject to Bancorp’s underwriting\nrequirements and secured by manufactured homes. The maturity date on these loans can range up to 25 years. In addition, these loans have a\nreserve account held at the Bancorp, further detail regarding this reserve can be found in Note 4 – Loans Receivable.\nCommercial Business Loans. Although the Bancorp’s priority in extending various types of commercial business loans changes from time\nto time, the basic considerations in determining the makeup of the commercial business loan portfolio are economic factors, regulatory\nrequirements and money market conditions. The Bancorp seeks commercial loan relationships from the local business community and from its\npresent customers. Conservative lending policies based upon sound credit analysis governs the extension of commercial credit. The following\nloans, although not inclusive, are considered preferable for the Bancorp’s commercial loan portfolio, loans collateralized by liquid assets; loans\nsecured by general use machinery and equipment; secured short‑term working capital loans to established businesses secured by business\nassets; short‑term loans with established sources of repayment and secured by sufficient equity and real estate; and unsecured loans to\ncustomers whose character and capacity to repay are firmly established.\nPage 10 of 108\nGovernment Loans. The Bancorp is permitted to purchase non-rated municipal securities, tax anticipation notes, and warrants within the\nlocal market area.\nNon‑Performing Assets, Asset Classification and Provision for Loan Losses\nLoans are reviewed on a regular basis and are generally placed on a non‑accrual status when, in the opinion of management, serious doubt\nexists as to the collectability of a loan. Loans are generally placed on non‑accrual status when either principal or interest is 90 days or more past\ndue. Consumer non-residential loans are generally charged off when the loan becomes over 120 days delinquent. Interest accrued and unpaid\nat the time a loan is placed on non‑accrual status is charged against interest income. Subsequent payments are either applied to the outstanding\nprincipal balance, tax and insurance reserve or recorded as interest income, depending on the assessment of the ultimate collectability of the\nloan.\nThe Bancorp’s mortgage loan collection procedures provide that, when a mortgage loan is 15 days or more delinquent, the borrower will be\ncontacted by mail and payment requested. If the delinquency continues, subsequent efforts will be made to contact the delinquent borrower. In\ncertain instances, the Bancorp will recast the loan or grant a limited moratorium on loan payments to enable the borrower to reorganize his, her,\nor its financial affairs. If the loan continues in a delinquent status for 120 days, the Bancorp will generally initiate foreclosure proceedings. Any\nproperty acquired as the result of foreclosure or by voluntary transfer of property made to avoid foreclosure is classified as foreclosed real estate\nuntil such time as it is sold or otherwise disposed of by the Bancorp. Foreclosed real estate is recorded at fair value at the date of foreclosure. At\nforeclosure, any write-down of the property is charged to the allowance for loan losses. Costs relating to improvement of property are capitalized,\nwhereas holding costs are expensed. Valuations are periodically performed by management, and a valuation allowance is established by a\ncharge to operations if the carrying value of a property exceeds its estimated fair value less selling costs. Subsequent gains or losses on\ndisposition, including expenses incurred in connection with the disposition, are charged to operations. Collection procedures for consumer loans\nprovide that when a consumer loan becomes ten days delinquent, the borrower will be contacted by mail and payment requested. If the\ndelinquency continues, subsequent efforts will be made to contact the delinquent borrower. In certain instances, the Bancorp may grant a\npayment deferral. If a loan continues to be delinquent after 60 days and all collection efforts have been exhausted, the Bancorp will initiate legal\nproceedings. Collection procedures for commercial business loans provide that when a commercial loan becomes ten days delinquent, the\nborrower will be contacted by mail and payment requested. If the delinquency continues, subsequent efforts will be made to contact the\ndelinquent borrower pursuant to the commercial loan collection policy. In certain instances, the Bancorp may grant a payment deferral or\nrestructure the loan. Once it has been determined that collection efforts are unsuccessful, the Bancorp will initiate legal proceedings.\nPage 11 of 108\nThe following table sets forth information regarding the Bancorp’s non-performing assets as of December 31, for each period indicated. The\namounts are stated in thousands (000’s).\n2021 2020\nLoans accounted for on a non-accrual basis:\nReal estate:\nResidential $ 4,651 $ 6,390\nCommercial 940 5,390\nMultifamily 455 504\nHome Equity 623 476\nCommercial business 387 1,039\nTotal $ 7,056 $ 13,799\nAccruing loans which are contractually past due 90 days or more:\nReal estate:\nCommercial $ 91 $ 437\nResidential 31 80\nHome equity 34 29\nConstruction and land development - 20\nCommercial business 49 -\nTotal $ 205 $ 566\nLoans that qualify as troubled debt restructurings and accruing:\nReal estate:\nCommercial $ 748 $ 872\nResidential - 542\nCommercial business 591 61\nHome Equity 83 -\nTotal $ 1,422 $ 1,475\nTotal of non-accrual, 90 days past due and accruing, and\nrestructurings $ 8,683 $ 15,840\nRatio of non-performing loans to total assets 0.51% 1.06%\nRatio of non-performing loans to total loans 0.76% 1.49%\n* non-performing loans include non-accrual loans and accruing loans which are contractually past due 90 days or\nmore\nForeclosed real estate $ - $ 538\nRatio of foreclosed real estate to total assets 0.00% 0.04%\nTrust preferred securities $ 992 $ 929\nRatio of trust preferred securities to total assets 0.06% 0.06%\nDuring 2021, gross interest income of $665 thousand would have been recorded on loans accounted for on a non-accrual basis if the loans\nhad been current throughout the period. Interest on such loans included in income during the period amounted to $12 thousand.\nFederal regulations require banks to classify their own loans and to establish appropriate general and specific allowances, subject to\nregulatory review. These regulations are designed to encourage management to evaluate loans on a case-by-case basis and to discourage\nautomatic classifications. Loans classified as substandard or doubtful must be evaluated by management to determine loan loss reserves. Loans\nclassified as loss must either be written off or reserved for by a specific allowance. Amounts reported in the general loan loss reserve are\nincluded in the calculation of the Bancorp’s total risk-based capital requirement (to the extent that the amount does not exceed 1.25% of total\nrisk-based assets), but are not included in Tier 1 leverage ratio calculations and Tier 1 risk-based capital requirements.\nPage 12 of 108\nSubstandard loans include non-performing loans and potential problem loans, where information about possible credit issues or other\nconditions causes management to question the ability of such borrowers to comply with loan covenants or repayment terms. No loans were\ninternally classified as doubtful or loss at December 31, 2021 or December 31, 2020.\nThe Bancorp's substandard loans are summarized below:\n(Dollars in thousands)\nDecember 31, December 31,\nLoan Segment 2021 2020\nResidential real estate $ 3,722 $ 6,387\nHome equity 632 495\nCommercial real estate 3,562 8,180\nConstruction and land development - -\nMultifamily 384 504\nFarmland - -\nCommercial business 387 1,061\nConsumer - -\nManufactured homes - -\nGovernment - -\nTotal $ 8,687 $ 16,627\nIn addition to identifying and monitoring non-performing and other classified loans, management maintains a list of special mention loans.\nSpecial mention loans represent loans management is closely monitoring due to one or more factors that may cause the loan to become\nclassified as substandard.\nThe Bancorp's special mention loans are summarized below:\n(Dollars in thousands)\nDecember 31, December 31,\nLoan Segment 2021 2020\nResidential real estate $ 2,940 $ 3,539\nHome equity 415 761\nCommercial real estate 12,011 11,983\nConstruction and land development 3,630 3,652\nMultifamily 153 1,408\nFarmland - -\nCommercial business 1,915 1,341\nConsumer - -\nManufactured homes 59 -\nGovernment - -\nTotal $ 21,123 $ 22,684\nA loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that a borrower will be unable to pay all amounts\ndue according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Typically, management does not individually classify smaller-balance\nhomogeneous loans, such as residential mortgages or consumer loans, as impaired, unless they are troubled debt restructurings.\nPurchased loans acquired in a business combination are recorded at estimated fair value on their purchase date. Purchased loans with\nevidence of credit quality deterioration since origination are considered purchased credit impaired loans. Expected future cash flows at the\npurchase date in excess of the fair value of loans are recorded as interest income over the life of the loans if the timing and amount of the future\ncash flows is reasonably estimable (“accretable yield”). The difference between contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to\nbe collected at acquisition is referred to as the non-accretable difference and represents probable losses in the portfolio. In determining the\nacquisition date fair value of purchased credit impaired loans, and in subsequent accounting, the Bancorp aggregates these purchased loans\ninto pools of loans by common risk characteristics, such as credit risk rating and loan type. Subsequent to the purchase date, increases in cash\nflows over those expected at the purchase date are recognized as interest income prospectively. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash\nflows will generally result in a provision for loan losses.\nPage 13 of 108\nThe Bancorp's impaired loans, including purchased credit impaired loans, are summarized below:\n(Dollars in thousands)\nDecember 31, December 31,\nLoan Segment 2021 2020\nResidential real estate $ 1,771 $ 2,165\nHome equity 284 353\nCommercial real estate 1,600 6,341\nConstruction and land development - -\nMultifamily 556 716\nFarmland - -\nCommercial business 1,597 2,246\nConsumer - -\nManufactured homes - -\nGovernment - -\nTotal $ 5,808 $ 11,821\nAt times, the Bancorp will modify the terms of a loan to forego a portion of interest or principal or reduce the interest rate on the loan to a rate\nmaterially less than market rates, or materially extend the maturity date of a loan as part of a troubled debt restructuring. The valuation basis for\nthe Bancorp’s troubled debt restructurings is based on the present value of expected future cash flows; unless consistent cash flows are not\npresent, then the fair value of the collateral securing the loan is the basis for valuation.\nThe Bancorp's troubled debt restructured loans are summarized below:\n(Dollars in thousands)\nDecember 31, 2021 December 31, 2020\nNumber of Recorded Number of Recorded\nLoan Segment Loans Investment Loans Investment\nResidential real estate 5 $ 342 8 $ 614\nHome equity 3 83 7 187\nCommercial real estate 3 747 4 872\nConstruction and land development - - - -\nMultifamily - - - -\nFarmland - - - -\nCommercial business 2 694 6 448\nConsumer - - - -\nManufactured homes - - - -\nGovernment - - - -\nTotal 13 $ 1,866 25 $ 2,121\nThe decrease in nonperforming, impaired, and substandard loans as of December 31, 2021, is related to the strategic sale of a single large\ncommercial real estate loan, that operates a hotel, totaling $5.1 million. Nonperforming loans at December 31, 2021, also decreased due to the\nremoval of various residential real estate loans from nonaccrual status totaling $2.9 million. Substandard loans at December 31, 2021, also\ndecreased due to the removal of various residential real estate loans totaling $2.7 million. Impaired loans at December 31, 2021, also decreased\ndue to the removal of eight commercial business or commercial real estate customers with loans totaling $623 thousand due to loan pay off or\nrefinance. The decrease in special mention loans as of December 31, 2021, is due to the removal of six commercial business, multifamily or\ncommercial real estate customers with loans totaling $2.5 million because of loan risk rating change or loan pay off and the removal of various\nresidential real estate and home equity loans totaling $945 thousand which was offset by the addition of seven commercial real estate or\ncommercial business customers with loans totaling $2.9 million.\nPage 14 of 108\nThe table that follows sets forth the allowance for loan losses and related ratios for the periods indicated.

Securities can be classified as either held-to-maturity (HTM) or available-for-sale (AFS) at the\ntime of purchase. No securities are classified as trading or as held-to-maturity. AFS securities are those the Bancorp may decide to sell if needed\nfor liquidity, asset-liability management or other reasons. During 2020, the Bancorp did not hold as investments any derivative instruments and\nwas not involved in hedging activities as defined by Accounting Standards Codification Topic 815 Derivatives and Hedging. It has been the policy\nof the Bancorp to invest its excess cash in U.S. government agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations,\nand municipal securities. In addition, short-term funds are generally invested as interest bearing balances in financial institutions and federal\nfunds. At December 31, 2021, the Bancorp’s investment portfolio totaled $526.9 million. In addition, the Bancorp had $3.2 million in FHLB stock.\nThe table below shows the carrying values of the components of the investment securities portfolio at December 31, on the dates indicated.\nThe amounts are stated in thousands (000’s).\n2021 2020\nMoney market fund $ - $ 52,941\nU.S. treasury securities:\nAvailable-for-sale 400 -\nU.S. government sponsored agencies:\nAvailable-for-sale 8,669 7,860\nCollateralized Mortgage Obligations (1): and Mortgage-backed\nsecurities\nAvailable-for-sale 184,701 154,736\nMunicipal Securities:\nAvailable-for-sale 332,127 194,203\nCollateralized Debt Securities:\nAvailable-for-sale 992 929\nTotals $ 526,889 $ 410,669\nThe contractual maturities and weighted average yields for the U.S. government securities, agency securities, municipal securities, and trust\npreferred securities at December 31, 2021, are summarized in the table below.

Payment in kind status results in a temporary delay in the payment of interest. As a result of a delay in the collection of the interest\npayments, management placed these securities in non-accrual status. At December 31, 2021, the cost basis of the two trust preferred securities\non non-accrual status totaled $2.2 million.\nPage 16 of 108\nSources of Funds\nGeneral. Deposits are the major source of the Bancorp’s funds for lending and other investment purposes. In addition to deposits, the\nBancorp derives funds from maturing investment securities and certificates of deposit, dividend receipts from the investment portfolio, loan\nprincipal repayments, repurchase agreements, advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis (FHLB) and other borrowings. Loan\nrepayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows are significantly influenced by general interest rates and\nmoney market conditions. Borrowings may be used on a short-term basis to compensate for reductions in the availability of other sources of\nfunds. They may also be used on a longer-term basis for general business purposes. The Bancorp uses repurchase agreements, as well as a\nline-of-credit and advances from the FHLB for borrowings. At December 31, 2021, the Bancorp had $14.6 million in repurchase agreements. The\nBancorp had no other borrowed funds as of December 31, 2021.\nDeposits. Retail and commercial deposits are attracted principally from within the Bancorp’s primary market area. The Bancorp offers a\nbroad selection of deposit instruments including non-interest bearing demand accounts, interest bearing demand accounts, savings accounts,\nmoney market deposit accounts, certificate accounts and retirement savings plans. Deposit accounts vary as to terms, with the principal\ndifferences being the minimum balance required, the time period the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate. Certificate account\nofferings typically range in maturity from ten days to 42 months. The deregulation of federal controls on insured deposits has allowed the\nBancorp to be more competitive in obtaining funds and to be flexible in meeting the threat of net deposit outflows. The Bancorp does not obtain\nfunds through brokers.\nThe following table presents the average daily amount of deposits and average rates paid on such deposits for the years indicated. The\namounts are stated in thousands (000’s).\n2021 2020\nAmount Rate % Amount Rate %\nNoninterest bearing demand deposits $ 280,900 - $ 236,400 -\nInterest bearing demand deposits 297,012 0.08 240,028 0.13\nMMDA accounts 253,468 0.13 233,904 0.36\nSavings accounts 277,839 0.06 230,579 0.07\nCertificates of deposit 271,882 0.46 298,403 1.34\nTotal deposits $ 1,381,101 0.18 $ 1,239,314 0.43\nAs of December 31, 2021, and 2020, approximately $452.0 million and $375.7 million, respectively, of our deposit portfolio was uninsured.\nThe uninsured amounts are estimates based on the methodologies and assumptions used for the Bank's regulatory reporting requirements.\nThe following table sets forth the portion of the Bank's time deposits, by account, that are in excess of the FDIC insurance limit, by remaining\ntime until maturity, as of December 31, 2021 (dollars in thousands).\n3 months or less $ 12,705\nOver 3 months through 6 months 6,478\nOver 6 months through 12 months 1,449\nOver 12 months 16,250\nTotal $ 36,882\nBorrowings. Borrowed money is used on a short-term basis to compensate for reductions in the availability of other sources of funds and is\ngenerally accomplished through repurchase agreements, as well as, through a line of credit and advances from the FHLB. Repurchase\nagreements generally mature within one year and are generally secured by U.S. government securities or U.S. agency securities, under the\nBancorp’s control. FHLB advances with maturities ranging from one year to five years are used to fund securities and loans of comparable\nduration, as well as to reduce the impact that movements in short-term interest rates have on the Bancorp’s overall cost of funds. Fixed rate\nadvances are payable at maturity, with a prepayment penalty.\nPage 17 of 108\nThe following tables set forth certain information regarding borrowing and repurchase agreements by the Bancorp at the end of and during\nthe periods indicated.

The subsidiary provides captive insurance for the subsidiaries of\nthe Bancorp.\nPeoples Service Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank was incorporated under the laws of the State of Indiana. The subsidiary\ncurrently provides insurance and annuity investments to the Bank’s wealth management customers.\nNWIN, LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank. NWIN, LLC was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada as an investment\nsubsidiary. The investment subsidiary currently holds Bank security investments, which are managed by a professional portfolio manager. In\naddition, the investment subsidiary is the parent of a real estate investment trust, NWIN Funding, Inc., that invests in real estate loans originated\nby the Bank.\nNWIN Funding, Inc. is a subsidiary of NWIN, LLC, and was formed as an Indiana Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT). The formation of\nNWIN Funding, Inc. provides the Bancorp with a vehicle that may be used to raise capital utilizing portfolio mortgages as collateral, without\ndiluting stock ownership. In addition, NWIN Funding, Inc. will receive favorable state tax treatment for income generated by its operations.\nColumbia Development Company, LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank and was incorporated under the laws of the State of\nIndiana. The subsidiary holds real estate properties that the Bank has acquired through the foreclosure process.\nThe consolidated financial statements include the Bancorp, its wholly owned subsidiaries, the Bank, NWIN Risk Management, Inc, and the\nBank’s wholly owned subsidiaries, Peoples Service Corporation, NWIN, LLC and Columbia Development Company, LLC. The Bancorp’s\nbusiness activities include being a holding company for the Bank as well as a holding company for NWIN Risk Management, Inc. The Bancorp’s\nearnings are dependent upon the earnings of the Bank. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in\nconsolidation.\nCompetition\nThe Bancorp’s primary market area for deposits, loans and financial services encompasses Lake and Porter Counties, in Northwest Indiana,\nand Cook County in northeast Illinois. All of the Bancorp’s banking centers and offices are located in its primary market area. Approximately\nninety-three percent of the Bancorp’s business activities are within this area.\nThe Bancorp faces strong competition in its primary market area for the attraction and retention of deposits and in the origination of loans.\nThe Bancorp’s most direct competition for deposits has historically come from commercial banks, savings associations, and credit unions\nlocated in its primary market area. Particularly in times of high interest rates, the Bancorp has had significant competition from mutual funds and\nother firms offering financial services. The Bancorp’s competition for loans comes principally from savings associations, commercial banks,\nmortgage banking companies, credit unions, insurance companies, and other institutional lenders.\nThe Bancorp competes for loans principally through the interest rates and loan fees it charges and the efficiency and quality of the services it\nprovides borrowers and other third-party sources. It competes for deposits by offering depositors a wide variety of savings accounts, checking\naccounts, competitive interest rates, convenient banking center locations, drive-up facilities, automatic teller machines, tax deferred retirement\nprograms, digital banking, and other miscellaneous services.\nThe activities of the Bancorp and the Bank in the geographic market served involve competition with other banks as well as with other\nfinancial institutions and enterprises, many of which have substantially greater resources than those available to the Bancorp. In addition, non-\nbank financial services companies with which the Bancorp and Bank compete, while subject to regulation by the CFPB, are generally not subject\nto the same type of extensive regulation by the federal and state banking agencies applicable to the Bancorp and the Bank.\nPage 22 of 108\nEmployees and Human Capital Resources\nWe believe that the foundation of our success in the banking business lies with the quality of our employees, the development of our\nemployees’ skills and career goals, and our ability to provide a comprehensive rewarding experience and work environment for our employees.\nWe encourage and support the development of our employees and, wherever possible, strive to fill positions from within the organization. As of\nDecember 31, 2021, the Bank had 254 full-time and 26 part-time employees. The employees are not represented by a collective bargaining\nagreement. Management believes its employee relations are good. The Bancorp has seven executive officers and has no other employees. The\nBancorp’s officers also are full-time employees of the Bank, and are compensated by the Bank.\nRegulation and Supervision\nBank Holding Company Regulation. The Bancorp is registered as a bank holding company for the Bank and has elected to be a financial\nholding company under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999. As a bank holding company and financial holding company, the Bancorp is subject\nto the regulation and supervision of the FRB under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the \"BHCA\"). Bank holding companies\nare required to file periodic reports with and are subject to periodic examination by the FRB.\nUnder the BHCA, without the prior approval of the FRB, the Bancorp may not acquire direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the voting\nstock or substantially all of the assets of any company, including a bank, and may not merge or consolidate with another bank holding company.\nIn addition, the Bancorp is generally prohibited by the BHCA from engaging in any nonbanking business unless such business is determined by\nthe FRB to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto. Under the BHCA, the FRB has the authority to require a bank\nholding company to terminate any activity or relinquish control of a nonbank subsidiary (other than a nonbank subsidiary of a bank) upon the\nFRB's determination that such activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness and stability of any bank subsidiary of the\nbank holding company.\nThe Change in Bank Control Act (“CBCA”) prohibits a person or group of persons from acquiring “control” of a bank holding company unless\nthe FRB has been notified and has not objected to the transaction. Under a rebuttable presumption established by the FRB, the acquisition of\n10% or more of a class of voting stock of a bank holding company with a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act,\nsuch as the Bancorp, would, under the circumstances set forth in the presumption, constitute acquisition of control of the Bancorp. In addition,\nthe CBCA prohibits any entity from acquiring 25% (the BHCA has a lower limit for acquirers that are existing bank holding companies) or more of\na bank holding company’s or bank’s voting securities, or otherwise obtaining control or a controlling influence over a bank holding company or\nbank without the approval of the FRB. On April 1, 2020, the FRB’s final rule clarifying the standards for determining whether one company has\ncontrol over another became effective. The final rule establishes four categories of tiered presumptions of noncontrol that are based on the\npercentage of voting shares held by the investor (less than 5%, 5-9.9%, 10-14.9% and 15-24.9%) and the presence of other indicia of control. As\nthe percentage of ownership increases, fewer indicia of control are permitted without falling outside of the presumption of noncontrol. These\nindicia of control include nonvoting equity ownership, director representation, management interlocks, business relationship and restrictive\ncontractual covenants. Under the final rule, investors can hold up to 24.9% of the voting securities and up to 33% of the total equity of a\ncompany without necessarily having a controlling influence.\nUnder the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), a bank holding company is\nexpected to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary bank(s). Pursuant to this requirement, a bank holding\ncompany should stand ready to use its resources to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary bank(s) during periods of financial stress or\nadversity. This support may be required by the FRB at times when the Bancorp may not have the resources to provide it or, for other reasons,\nwould not be inclined to provide it. Additionally, under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (\"FDICIA\"), a bank\nholding company is required to provide limited guarantee of the compliance by any insured depository institution subsidiary that may become\n\"undercapitalized\" (as defined in the statute) with the terms of any capital restoration plan filed by such subsidiary with its appropriate federal\nbanking agency.\nPage 23 of 108\nState Bank Regulation. As an Indiana commercial bank, the Bank is subject to federal regulation and supervision by the FDIC and to state\nregulation and supervision by the DFI. The Bank's deposit accounts are insured by the DIF, which is administered by the FDIC. The Bank is not a\nmember of the Federal Reserve System.\nBoth federal and Indiana law extensively regulate various aspects of the banking business such as reserve requirements, truth-in-lending\nand truth-in-savings disclosures, equal credit opportunity, fair credit reporting, trading in securities and other aspects of banking operations.\nCurrent federal law also requires banks, among other things, to make deposited funds available within specified time periods.\nUnder FDICIA, insured state chartered banks are prohibited from engaging as principal in activities that are not permitted for national banks,\nunless: (i) the FDIC determines that the activity would pose no significant risk to the appropriate deposit insurance fund, and (ii) the bank is, and\ncontinues to be, in compliance with all applicable capital standards.\nBranches and Acquisitions. Branching by the Bank requires the approval of the Federal Reserve and the DFI. Under current law, Indiana\nchartered banks may establish branches throughout the state and in other states, subject to certain limitations. Congress authorized interstate\nbranching, with certain limitations, beginning in 1997. Indiana law authorizes an Indiana bank to establish one or more branches in states other\nthan Indiana through interstate merger transactions and to establish one or more interstate branches through de novo branching or the\nacquisition of a branch. The Dodd-Frank Act permits the establishment of de novo branches in states where such branches could be opened by\na state bank chartered by that state. The consent of the state is no longer required.\nTransactions with Affiliates. Under Indiana law, the Bank is subject to Sections 22(h), 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, which\nrestrict financial transactions between banks and affiliated companies, such as the Bancorp. The statute limits credit transactions between a\nbank and its executive officers and its affiliates, prescribes terms and conditions for bank affiliate transactions deemed to be consistent with safe\nand sound banking practices, and restricts the types of collateral security permitted in connection with a bank's extension of credit to an affiliate.\nCapital Requirements. Federal regulations require FDIC insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: (i) a\ncommon equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%; (iii) a total capital to risk-\nbased assets ratio of 8%; and (iv) a 4% Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio.\nCommon equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common shareholders’ equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined\nas common equity Tier 1 and Additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital generally includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock\nand related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity\nTier 1 capital plus Additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus meeting\nspecified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities,\nintermediate preferred stock, and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a\nmaximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated\nOther Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”), up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair\nmarket values. Institutions that have not exercised the AOCI opt-out have AOCI incorporated into common equity Tier 1 capital (including\nunrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale-securities). Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and\nadjustments specified in the regulations.\nIn determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, assets, including certain off-balance\nsheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, and residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the\nregulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present\ngreater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0% is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50% is generally assigned to\nprudently underwritten first lien one to four-family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100% is assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a\nrisk weight of 150% is assigned to certain past due loans and a risk weight of between 0% to 600% is assigned to permissible equity interests,\ndepending on certain specified factors.\nPage 24 of 108\nIn addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions by the institution and certain\ndiscretionary bonus payments to management if an institution does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity\nTier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital\nconservation buffer requirement was phased in beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increased each year until fully\nimplemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019.\nThe FRB and FDIC have authority to establish individual minimum capital requirements in appropriate cases upon a determination that an\ninstitution’s capital level is or may become inadequate in light of the particular risks or circumstances. As of December 31, 2021, the Bank met all\napplicable capital adequacy requirements.\nBank holding companies are generally subject to consolidated capital requirements established by the FRB. The Dodd-Frank Act required\nthe FRB to set minimum capital levels for bank holding companies that are as stringent as those required for insured depository subsidiaries.\nHowever, under the FRB’s “Small Bank Holding Company” exemption from consolidated bank holding company capital requirements, bank\nholding companies and savings and loan holding companies with less than $3 billion in consolidated assets, such as the Bancorp, are exempt\nfrom consolidated regulatory capital requirements, unless the FRB determines otherwise in particular cases.\nFederal law establishes a system of prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions. The law requires that\ncertain supervisory actions be taken against undercapitalized institutions, the severity of which depends on the degree of undercapitalization.\nThe FDIC has adopted regulations to implement the prompt corrective action legislation as to insured state banks. An institution is deemed to be\n“well capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of\n5.0% or greater, and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5% or greater. An institution is “adequately capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital\nratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater, and a common equity Tier 1 ratio\nof 4.5% or greater. An institution is “undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of\nless than 6.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 4.0%, or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5%. An institution is deemed to be “significantly\nundercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a leverage ratio of\nless than 3.0%, or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0%. An institution is considered to be “critically undercapitalized” if it has a ratio of\ntangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%.\nSubject to a narrow exception, a receiver or conservator is required to be appointed for an institution that is “critically undercapitalized” within\nspecified time frames. The regulations also provide that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the FDIC within 45 days of the date an\ninstitution is deemed to have received notice that it is “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized,” or “critically undercapitalized.”\nCompliance with the plan must be guaranteed by any parent holding company up to the lesser of 5% of the institution’s total assets when it was\ndeemed to be undercapitalized or the amount necessary to achieve compliance with applicable capital requirements. In addition, numerous\nmandatory supervisory actions become immediately applicable to an undercapitalized institution including, but not limited to, increased\nmonitoring by regulators and restrictions on growth, capital distributions and expansion. The FDIC could also take any one of a number of\ndiscretionary supervisory actions, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors.\nSignificantly and critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to additional mandatory and discretionary measures.\nPage 25 of 108\nSection 201 of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 (the “Economic Growth Act”) directed federal\nbanking agencies to draft regulations establishing a new optional Community Bank Leverage Ratio (“CBLR”). The Economic Growth Act\nprovides that the CBLR will apply to a “qualifying community bank” which the Economic Growth Act defines as a bank with consolidated assets\nof less than $10 billion and satisfying additional criteria designed to disqualify institutions with a higher risk profile. Under the Economic Growth\nAct, qualifying community banks that meet or exceed the CBLR and elect to follow the alternative regulatory capital structure will be deemed to\nhave satisfied all generally applicable leverage capital and risk-based capital requirements and will be considered “well capitalized” under the\nFDIC prompt corrective action provisions. The Economic Growth Act directed the FRB, the FDIC, and the Office of the Comptroller of the\nCurrency (“OCC”) to jointly determine a community bank leverage ratio percentage, not less than 8% nor more than 10%, that must be\nmaintained to be deemed to have satisfied all generally applicable leverage capital and risk-based capital requirements and be considered well\ncapitalized. The Economic Growth Act also directed agencies to establish procedures for dealing with a qualifying bank that subsequently falls\nbelow the new ratio.\nThe final regulation implementing Section 201 became effective on January 1, 2020 (the “Final Rule”). Under the Final Rule, to be eligible to\nuse the CBLR framework, a banking organization must not be an advanced approaches organization and must have (i) a leverage ratio of\ngreater than 9%; (ii) total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion; (iii) total off-balance sheet exposures of 25% or less of total consolidated\nassets; and (iv) total trading assets plus trading liabilities of 5% or less of total consolidated assets. A qualifying institution may opt in and out of\nthe CBLR framework on its quarterly call report. An institution that ceases to meet any qualifying criteria is provided with a two-quarter grace\nperiod to either comply with the CBLR requirements or comply with the general capital regulations, including the risk-based capital requirements.\nSection 4012 of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act of 2020 (the “CARES Act”) required that the CBLR be temporarily\nlowered to 8%. The federal regulators issued a rule implementing the lower ratio effective April 23, 2020. The rule also established a two-quarter\ngrace period for a qualifying institution whose leverage ratio falls below the 8% CBLR requirement so long as the bank maintains a leverage ratio\nof 7% or greater. Another rule was issued to transition back to the 9% CBLR by increasing the ratio to 8.5% for calendar year 2021 and 9%\nthereafter. At this time, the Bank has not elected to opt in to the CBLR framework, but the framework is currently available to the Bank if it elects\nto opt in at some point in the future.\nThe following table shows that, at December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, the Bank’s capital exceeded all applicable regulatory capital\nrequirements. The dollar amounts are in millions.\n(Dollars in millions) Minimum Required To Be\nWell Capitalized Under\nMinimum Required For Prompt\nActual Capital Adequacy Purposes Corrective Action Regulations\nAt December 31, 2021 Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio\nCommon equity tier 1 capital to risk-\nweighted assets $ 133.7 12.6% $ 47.8 4.5% $ 69.0 6.5%\nTier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets $ 133.7 12.6% $ 63.7 6.0% $ 85.0 8.0%\nTotal capital to risk-weighted assets $ 147.0 13.9% $ 85.0 8.0% $ 106.2 10.0%\nTier 1 capital to adjusted average\nassets $ 133.7 8.4% $ 64.1 4.0% $ 80.1 5.0%\n(Dollars in millions) Minimum Required To Be\nWell Capitalized Under\nMinimum Required For Prompt\nActual Capital Adequacy Purposes Corrective Action Regulations\nAt December 31, 2020 Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio\nCommon equity tier 1 capital to risk-\nweighted assets $ 122.0 12.6% $ 43.8 4.5% $ 63.2 6.5%\nTier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets $ 122.0 12.6% $ 58.4 6.0% $ 77.8 8.0%\nTotal capital to risk-weighted assets $ 134.2 13.8% $ 77.8 8.0% $ 97.3 10.0%\nTier 1 capital to adjusted average\nassets $ 122.0 8.3% $ 59.1 4.0% $ 73.9 5.0%\nIn December 2017, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision published the last version of the Basel III accord, generally referred to as\n“Basel IV.” The Basel Committee stated that a key objective of the revisions incorporated into the framework is to reduce excessive variability of\nrisk-weighted assets (“RWA”), which will be accomplished by enhancing the robustness and risk sensitivity of the standardized approaches for\ncredit risk and operational risk, which will facilitate the comparability of banks’ capital ratios; constraining the use of internally modeled\napproaches; and complementing the risk-weighted capital ratio with a finalized leverage ratio and a revised and robust capital floor. The\nleadership of the FRB, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), and FDIC, who are tasked with implementing Basel IV, supported the\nrevisions. Under the current U.S. capital rules, operational risk capital requirements and a capital floor apply only to advanced approaches\ninstitutions, and not to the Bancorp. The impact of Basel IV on the Bancorp will depend on the manner in which it is implemented by the federal\nbanking regulators.\nPage 26 of 108\nBanking regulators may change these capital requirements from time to time, depending on the economic outlook generally and the outlook\nfor the banking industry. The Bancorp is unable to predict whether and when any such further capital requirements would be imposed and, if so,\nto what levels and on what schedule.\nNew Accounting Standards With Regulatory Effect. In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued an\naccounting standard update, “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,” which\nreplaces the current “incurred loss” model for recognizing credit losses with an “expected loss” model referred to as the Current Expected Credit\nLoss (“CECL”) model. Under the CECL model, the Bancorp will be required to present certain financial assets carried at amortized cost, such as\nloans held for investment and held-to-maturity debt securities, at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit\nlosses is to be based on information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable\nforecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. On December 21, 2018, the federal banking agencies approved a final rule\nmodifying their regulatory capital rules and providing an option to phase in over a period of three years the day-one regulatory capital effects of\nthe CECL model. The final rule also revises the agencies’ other rules to reflect the update to the accounting standards. The final rule took effect\nApril 1, 2019. The new CECL standard will become effective for the Bancorp for fiscal year ending December 31, 2023 and for interim periods\nwithin the fiscal year. The Bancorp’s management is currently evaluating the impact the CECL model will have on the Bancorp’s accounting.\nAdditional detail around managements current efforts can be found in Note 1 to the financial statements, under ASU No. 2016-13, Financial\nInstruments - Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.\nDividend Limitations. The Bancorp is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. The primary source of the Bancorp’s cash flow,\nincluding cash flow to pay dividends on the Bancorp’s Common Stock, is the payment of dividends to the Bancorp by the Bank. Under Indiana\nlaw, the Bank may pay dividends of so much of its undivided profits (generally, earnings less losses, bad debts, taxes and other operating\nexpenses) as is considered expedient by the Bank’s Board of Directors. However, the Bank must obtain the approval of the DFI for the payment\nof a dividend if the total of all dividends declared by the Bank during the current year, including the proposed dividend, would exceed the sum of\nretained net income for the year to date plus its retained net income for the previous two years. For this purpose, “retained net income” means\nnet income as calculated for call report purposes, less all dividends declared for the applicable period. An exemption from DFI approval would\nrequire that the Bank have been assigned a composite uniform financial institutions rating of 1 or 2 as a result of the most recent federal or state\nexamination; the proposed dividend would not result in a Tier 1 leverage ratio below 7.5%; and that the Bank not be subject to any corrective\naction, supervisory order, supervisory agreement, or board approved operating agreement.\nThe FDIC has the authority to prohibit the Bank from paying dividends if, in its opinion, the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe\nor unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the Bank. In addition, under FRB supervisory policy, a bank holding company generally\nshould not maintain its existing rate of cash dividends on common shares unless (i) the organization’s net income available to common\nshareholders over the past year has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and (ii) the prospective rate of earnings retention appears\nconsistent with the organization’s capital needs, assets, quality, and overall financial condition. The FRB expects bank holding companies to\nconsult with it in advance of declaring dividends that could raise safety and soundness concerns (i.e., such as when the dividend is not\nsupported by earnings or involves a material increase in the dividend rate) and in advance of repurchasing shares of common or preferred stock.\nFederal Deposit Insurance. Deposits in the Bank are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC up to a maximum amount, which\nis generally $250,000 per depositor, subject to aggregation rules. There is no unlimited insurance coverage for noninterest bearing transaction\naccounts. Rather, deposits held in noninterest bearing transaction accounts are aggregated with interest bearing deposits the owner may hold in\nthe same ownership category, and the combined insured up to at least $250,000. The Bank is subject to deposit insurance assessments by the\nFDIC pursuant to its regulations establishing a risk-related deposit insurance assessment system, based on the institution’s capital levels and\nrisk profile. Under the FDIC’s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk-weighted categories based on\nsupervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels, and certain other factors with less risky institutions paying lower assessments. An institution’s\ninitial assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned. There are also adjustments to a bank’s initial assessment rates based\non levels of long-term unsecured debt, secured liabilities in excess of 25% of domestic deposits and, for certain institutions, brokered deposit\nlevels. Pursuant to FDIC rules adopted under the Dodd-Frank Act (described below), initial assessments ranged from 5 to 35 basis points of the\ninstitution’s total assets minus its tangible equity. The Bank paid net deposit insurance assessments of $861 thousand during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021. For 2021, the deposit insurance assessment rate before applying one-time assessment credits was approximately 0.060%\nof insured deposits. No institution may pay a dividend if it is in default of the federal deposit insurance assessment.\nPage 27 of 108\nUnder the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC is authorized to set the reserve ratio for the Deposit Insurance Fund at no less than 1.35% of estimated\ninsured deposits, which is increased from the previous ratio of 1.15%. The FDIC must offset the effect of the increase in the minimum designated\nreserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35% on insured depository institutions of less than $10 billion, and may declare dividends to depository institutions\nwhen the reserve ratio at the end of a calendar quarter is at least 1.5%, although the FDIC has the authority to suspend or limit such permitted\ndividend declarations. The FDIC has set the designated reserve ratio for the deposit insurance fund at 2% of estimated insured deposits, which\nthe FDIC has established as a long-term goal. On September 30, 2018, the DIF reserve ratio reached 1.36 percent, exceeding the statutorily\nrequired minimum reserve ratio of 1.35 percent. As of September 30, 2020, the FDIC had announced that the ratio had declined to 1.30% due\nlargely to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The FDIC adopted a plan to restore the fund to the 1.35% ratio within eight years but did not\nchange its assessment schedule.\nUnder the Dodd-Frank Act, the assessment base for deposit insurance premiums is calculated as average consolidated total assets minus\naverage tangible equity. Tangible equity for this purpose means Tier 1 capital. The rate schedules set forth in the rule governing the assessment\nbase are scaled to the increase in the assessment base, including schedules that go into effect as the reserve ratio reaches 1.15%, 2%, and\n2.5%.\nThe schedules reduce the initial base assessment rate in each of the four risk-based pricing categories.\n● For small Risk category I banks, the rates range from 5-9 basis points.\n● The rates for small institutions in Risk Categories II, III and IV are 14, 23 and 35 basis points, respectively.\n● For large institutions and large, highly complex institutions, the rate schedule ranges from 5 to 35 basis points.\nThere are also adjustments made to the initial assessment rates based on long-term unsecured debt, depository institution debt, and\nbrokered deposits. The FDIC also provides for an assessment system for large depository institutions with over $10 billion in assets.\nThe FDIC has the authority to increase insurance assessments. A significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse\neffect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Bank. Management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in\nthe future.\nThe FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution if the FDIC determines, after a hearing, that the\ninstitution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe and unsound condition to continue operations or has\nviolated any applicable law, regulation, order or any condition imposed in writing by, or written agreement with, the FDIC. The FDIC may also\nsuspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for a permanent termination of insurance if the institution has no tangible\ncapital.\nFederal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis, which is one of eleven regional\nFederal Home Loan Banks. Each Federal Home Loan Bank serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. It is\nfunded primarily from funds deposited by member institutions and proceeds from the sale of consolidated obligations of the Federal Home Loan\nBank system. It makes loans to members (i.e., advances) in accordance with policies and procedures established by the board of trustees of the\nFederal Home Loan Bank. As a member, the Bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis in\nan amount equal to the greater of 1% of its aggregate unpaid residential mortgage loans, home purchase contracts or similar obligations at the\nbeginning of each year or 5% of our outstanding advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank. At December 31, 2021, the Bank was in\ncompliance with this requirement.\nPage 28 of 108\nAt December 31, 2021, the Bancorp owned $3.2 million of stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis (“FHLBI”). The FHLBI stock\nentitles the Bancorp to dividends from the FHLBI. The Bancorp recognized dividend income of approximately $70 thousand in 2021. At\nDecember 31, 2021, the Bancorp’s excess borrowing capacity based on collateral from the FHLBI was $192.8 million. Generally, the loan terms\nfrom the FHLBI are better than the terms the Bancorp can receive from other sources making it cheaper to borrow money from the FHLBI.\nFederal Reserve System. Under regulations of the FRB, the Bank is required to maintain reserves against its transaction accounts\n(primarily checking accounts) and non-personal money market deposit accounts. The effect of these reserve requirements is to increase the\nBank’s cost of funds. The Bank is in compliance with its reserve requirements.\nCommunity Reinvestment Act. Under the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”), the Bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation\nconsistent with its safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income\nneighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution’s\ndiscretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. The\nCRA requires the FDIC in connection with its examination of the Bank, to assess its record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to\ntake that record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by the Bank. For example, the regulations specify that a bank’s CRA\nperformance will be considered in its expansion (e.g., branching) proposals and may be the basis for approving, denying or conditioning the\napproval of an application. As of the date of its most recent regulatory examination, the Bank was rated “satisfactory” with respect to its CRA\ncompliance.\nGramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (\"Gramm-Leach\"), bank holding companies are permitted to offer their\ncustomers virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting) and\nmerchant banking. In order to engage in these new financial activities, a bank holding company must qualify and register with the FRB as a\n\"financial holding company\" by demonstrating that each of its bank subsidiaries is well capitalized, well managed and has at least a satisfactory\nrating under the CRA. As previously discussed, the Bancorp has elected to become a financial holding company under Gramm-Leach.\nGramm-Leach established a system of functional regulation, under which the federal banking agencies regulate the banking activities of\nfinancial holding companies, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regulates their securities activities and state insurance regulators\nregulate their insurance activities.\nUnder Gramm-Leach, federal banking regulators adopted rules limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose\nnonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. The rules require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some\ncircumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to nonaffiliated third parties. The privacy provisions of\nGramm-Leach affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial services companies and conveyed to outside\nvendors.\nThe Bancorp does not disclose any nonpublic information about any current or former customers to anyone except as permitted by law and\nsubject to contractual confidentiality provisions which restrict the release and use of such information.\nCybersecurity Guidelines. The federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines for establishing information security standards and\ncybersecurity programs for implementing safeguards under the supervision of the board of directors. These guidelines, along with related\nregulatory materials, increasingly focus on risk management and processes related to information technology and the use of third parties in the\nprovision of financial services. In October 2016, the federal banking agencies issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on enhanced\ncybersecurity risk-management and resilience standards that would apply to large and interconnected banking organizations and to services\nprovided by third parties to these firms. These enhanced standards would apply only to depository institutions and depository institution holding\ncompanies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, which would not currently include the Bancorp. However, similar standards\nand/or regulations may be adopted or implemented by federal and state banking agencies in the future which may be applicable to community\nbanking organizations such as the Bancorp.\nPage 29 of 108\nRecent cyberattacks against banks and other financial institutions that resulted in unauthorized access to confidential customer information\nhave prompted the federal banking regulators to issue extensive guidance on cybersecurity. Among other things, financial institutions are\nexpected to design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and ensure that their risk management processes address\nthe risks posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to authenticate customers accessing internet-based\nservices. A financial institution also should have a robust business continuity program to recover from a cyberattack and procedures for\nmonitoring the security of third-party service providers that may have access to nonpublic data at the institution. During 2021, the Bancorp did\nnot discover any material cybersecurity incidents.\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) within the\nFederal Reserve, which is granted broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection\nlaws, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Truth in Lending Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Fair\nDebt Collection Act, the Consumer Financial Privacy provisions of Gramm-Leach and certain other statutes. Many of the consumer financial\nprotection functions formerly assigned to the federal banking and other designated agencies are now performed by the CFPB. The CFPB has a\nlarge budget and staff, and has the authority to implement regulations under federal consumer protection laws and enforce those laws against,\nand examine, financial institutions. The CFPB has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with $10\nbillion or more in assets. Smaller institutions are subject to rules promulgated by the CFPB but continue to be examined and supervised by the\nfederal banking regulators for consumer compliance purposes. The CFPB has the authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive practice in\nconnection with the offering of consumer financial products. Additionally, this bureau is authorized to collect fines and provide consumer\nrestitution in the event of violations, engage in consumer financial education, track consumer complaints, request data, and promote the\navailability of financial services to underserved consumers and communities.\nMoreover, the Dodd-Frank Act authorized the CFPB to establish certain minimum standards for the origination of residential mortgages\nincluding a determination of the borrower’s ability to repay. In addition, the CFPB has published several final regulations impacting the mortgage\nindustry, including rules related to ability-to-pay, mortgage servicing, and mortgage loan originator compensation. The ability-to-repay rule makes\nlenders liable if they fail to assess ability to repay under a prescribed test, but also creates a safe harbor for so-called “qualified mortgages.”\nFailure to comply with the ability-to-repay rule may result in possible CFPB enforcement action and special statutory damages plus actual, class\naction, and attorneys’ fees damages, all of which a borrower may claim in defense of a foreclosure action at any time. The Dodd-Frank Act also\npermits states to adopt consumer protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level and, in certain\ncircumstances, permits state attorneys general to enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations. Federal preemption\nof state consumer protection law requirements, traditionally an attribute of the federal savings association charter, also was modified by the\nDodd-Frank Act and requires a case-by-case determination of preemption by the OCC and eliminates preemption for subsidiaries of a bank.\nDepending on the implementation of this revised federal preemption standard, the operations of the Bank could become subject to additional\ncompliance burdens in the states in which it operates.\nMortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending. Title XIV of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act,\nincludes a series of amendments to the Truth In Lending Act with respect to mortgage loan origination standards affecting, among other things,\noriginator compensation, minimum repayment standards and pre-payments. With respect to mortgage loan originator compensation, except in\nlimited circumstances, an originator is prohibited from receiving compensation that varies based on the terms of the loan (other than the principal\namount). The amendments to the Truth In Lending Act also prohibit a creditor from making a residential mortgage loan unless it determines,\nbased on verified and documented information of the consumer’s financial resources, that the consumer has a reasonable ability to repay the\nloan. The amendments also prohibit certain pre-payment penalties and require creditors offering a consumer a mortgage loan with a pre-\npayment penalty to offer the consumer the option of a mortgage loan without such a penalty. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act expands the\ndefinition of a “high-cost mortgage” under the Truth In Lending Act, and imposes new requirements on high-cost mortgages and new disclosure,\nreporting and notice requirements for residential mortgage loans, as well as new requirements with respect to escrows and appraisal practices.\nPage 30 of 108\nInterchange Fees for Debit Cards. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, interchange fees for debit card transactions must be reasonable and\nproportional to the issuer’s incremental cost incurred with respect to the transaction plus certain fraud related costs. Although institutions with\ntotal assets of less than $10 billion are exempt from this requirement, competitive pressures have required smaller depository institutions to\nreduce fees with respect to these debit card transactions.\nFederal Securities Law. The shares of Common Stock of the Bancorp have been registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange\nAct (the “1934 Act”). The Bancorp is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements of the 1934\nAct and the rules of the SEC there under. If the Bancorp has fewer than 1,200 record shareholders, it may deregister its shares under the 1934\nAct and cease to be subject to the foregoing requirements.\nShares of Common Stock held by persons who are affiliates of the Bancorp may not be resold without registration unless sold in accordance\nwith the resale restrictions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933. If the Bancorp meets the current public information requirements under\nRule 144, each affiliate of the Bancorp who complies with the other conditions of Rule 144 (including those that require the affiliate’s sale to be\naggregated with those of certain other persons) would be able to sell in the public market, without registration, a number of shares not to exceed,\nin any three-month period, the greater of (i) 1% of the outstanding shares of the Bancorp or (ii) the average weekly volume of trading in such\nshares during the preceding four calendar weeks.\nUnder the Dodd-Frank Act, the Bancorp is required to provide its shareholders an opportunity to vote on the executive compensation\npayable to its named executive officers and on golden parachute payments in connection with mergers and acquisitions. These votes are non-\nbinding and advisory. At least once every six years, the Bancorp must also permit shareholders to determine on an advisory basis whether such\nvotes should be held every one, two, or three years.\nFederal Reserve Monetary Policies. The Bancorp’s earnings and growth, as well as the earnings and growth of the banking industry in\ngeneral, are affected by the monetary and credit policies of monetary authorities, including the FRB. An important function of the FRB is to\nregulate the national supply of bank credit in order to combat recession and curb inflationary pressures. Among the instruments of monetary\npolicy used by the FRB to implement these objectives are open market operations in U.S. government securities, changes in reserve\nrequirements against member bank deposits, and changes in the Federal Reserve discount rate. These instruments are used in varying\ncombinations to influence overall growth of bank loans, investments, and deposits, and may also affect interest rates charged on loans or paid\nfor deposits. The monetary policies of the FRB have had a significant impact on the operating results of financial institutions in the past and are\nexpected to continue to have effects in the future.\nIn view of continually changing conditions in the national economy and in money markets, as well as the effect of credit policies by monetary and\nfiscal authorities, including the FRB, it is difficult to predict the impact of possible future changes in interest rates, deposit levels, and loan\ndemand, or their effect on the Bancorp’s business and earnings or on the financial condition of the Bancorp’s various customers.\nOther Future Legislation and Change in Regulations. Various other legislation, including proposals to expand or contract the powers of\nbanking institutions and bank holding companies, is from time to time introduced. This legislation may change banking statutes and the operating\nenvironment of the Bancorp and the Bank in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost\nof doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions and\nother financial institutions. The Bancorp cannot accurately predict whether any of this potential legislation will ultimately be enacted, and, if\nenacted, the ultimate effect that it, or implementing regulations, would have upon the financial condition or results of operations of the Bancorp or\nthe Bank.\nPage 31 of 108\nFederal Taxation\nFor federal income tax purposes, the Bank reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting. The Bancorp and the\nBank file a consolidated federal income tax return for each fiscal year ending December 31.\nState Taxation\nThe Bank is subject to Indiana’s Financial Institutions Tax (“FIT”), which is imposed at a flat rate of 6.0% on “adjusted gross income”. This\nrate is scheduled to decrease over the succeeding years as follows: to 5.5% for 2021, to 5.0% for 2022, and to 4.9% for 2023 and thereafter.\nAdditionally, the Bank is subject to Illinois state tax which is imposed at a flat rate of 9.5%. “Adjusted gross income,” for purposes of FIT, begins\nwith taxable income as defined by Section 63 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) and, thus, incorporates federal\ntax law to the extent that it affects the computation of taxable income. Federal taxable income is then adjusted by several Indiana and Illinois\nmodifications. Other applicable state taxes include generally applicable sales and use taxes plus real and personal property taxes.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nAt December 31, 2021, the Bancorp has consolidated total deferred tax assets of $7.2 million and consolidated total deferred tax liabilities of\n$4.3 million, resulting in a consolidated net deferred tax asset of $2.8 million, net of a $12 thousand valuation allowance. The valuation\nallowance of $12 thousand was provided for the state tax credit, as management does not believe these amounts will be fully utilized before\nstatutory expiration.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock involves risks. Before making any decision whether to invest in our common stock, you should carefully\nconsider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this report. These risks are not the only ones we will\nface. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business operations, financial condition,\nand results of operations. Our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.\nThe trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Also, please read\n“Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”\nRisks Related to Our Business\nAs a financial institution, the Bancorp is subject to a number of risks relating to its daily business.\nAs a financial institution, we are subject to a number of risks relating to our daily business. Although we undertake a variety of efforts to\nmanage and control those risks, many of the risks are outside of our control. Among the risks we face are the following:\n● Credit Risk – the risk that loan customers or other parties will be unable to perform their contractual repayment obligations.\n● Market Risk – the risk that changes in market rates and prices will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n● Liquidity Risk – the risk that the Bancorp or the Bank will have insufficient cash or access to cash to meet its operating needs.\n● Operational Risk – the risk of financial and reputational loss resulting from fraud, inadequate or failed internal processes, cyber-\nsecurity breaches, people and systems, or external events.\n● Economic Risk – the risk that the economy in our markets could decline, resulting in increased unemployment, decreased real\nestate values, and increased loan charge-offs.\nPage 32 of 108\n● Compliance Risk – the risk of additional action by our regulators or additional regulation that could hinder our ability to do business\nprofitably.\n● Regulatory Risk – the risk presented by the need to comply with all laws, rules, and regulations from multiple regulatory agencies,\nincluding but not limited to the FDIC, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the IDFI, the FRB, the SEC, and the U.S.\nDepartment of Labor.\n● Fiduciary Risk – the risk of failing to act in our fiduciary capacity in the best interests of the grantors and beneficiaries of trust\naccounts and benefit plans.\nAbove average interest rate risk associated with fixed-rate loans may have an adverse effect on our financial position or results of\noperations.\nPeoples Bank’s loan portfolio includes a significant amount of loans with fixed rates of interest. At December 31, 2021, $417.1 million, or\n43.4% of the Bank’s total loans receivable had fixed interest rates. The Bank offers adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) loans and fixed-rate loans.\nUnlike ARM loans, fixed-rate loans carry the risk that, because they do not reprice to market interest rates, their yield may be insufficient to offset\nincreases in the Bank’s cost of funds during a rising interest rate environment. Accordingly, a material and prolonged increase in market interest\nrates could be expected to have a greater adverse effect on the Bank’s net interest income compared to other institutions that hold a materially\nlarger portion of their assets in ARM loans or fixed-rate loans that are originated for committed sale in the secondary market.\nHigher loan losses could require the Bancorp to increase its allowance for loan losses through a charge to earnings.\nWhen we loan money, we incur the risk that our borrowers will not repay their loans. We reserve for loan losses by establishing an allowance\nthrough a charge to earnings. The amount of this allowance is based on our assessment of loan losses inherent in our loan portfolio. The\nprocess for determining the amount of the allowance is critical to our financial results and condition. It requires subjective and complex\njudgments about the future, including forecasts of economic or market conditions that might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their\nloans. We might underestimate the loan losses inherent in our loan portfolio and have loan losses in excess of the amount reserved. We might\nincrease the allowance because of changing economic conditions. For example, in a rising interest rate environment, borrowers with adjustable\nrate loans could see their payments increase. There may be a significant increase in the number of borrowers who are unable or unwilling to\nrepay their loans, resulting in our charging off more loans and increasing our allowance. In addition, when real estate values decline, the\npotential severity of loss on a real estate-secured loan can increase significantly, especially in the case of loans with high combined loan-to-value\nratios. Our allowance for loan losses at any particular date may not be sufficient to cover future loan losses. We may be required to increase our\nallowance for loan losses, thus reducing earnings.\nCommercial business lending may expose the Bancorp to increased lending risks.\nAt December 31, 2021, the Bank’s commercial business loan portfolio amounted to $115.8 million, or 12.1% of total loans. Subject to market\nconditions and other factors, the Bank intends to expand its commercial business lending activities within its primary market areas. Commercial\nbusiness lending is inherently riskier than residential mortgage lending. Although commercial business loans are often collateralized by\nequipment, inventory, accounts receivable, or other business assets, the liquidation value of these assets in the event of a borrower default is\noften an insufficient source of repayment because accounts receivable may be uncollectible and inventories and equipment may be obsolete or\nof limited use, among other things.\nPage 33 of 108\nCommercial real estate lending may expose the Bancorp to increased lending risks.\nAt December 31, 2021, the Bank’s commercial real estate loan portfolio amounted to $317.1 million, or 33.0% of total loans. Commercial real\nestate lending is inherently riskier than residential mortgage lending. Because payments on loans secured by commercial properties often\ndepend upon the successful operation and management of the properties, repayment of such loans may be affected by adverse conditions in the\nreal estate market or the economy, among other things.\nOur mortgage lending profitability could be significantly reduced if we are not able to resell mortgages at a reasonable gain on sale or\nexperience other problems with the secondary market process or we are unable to retain our mortgage loan sales force due to\nregulatory changes.\nCurrently, we sell a large portion of the mortgage loans we originate. The profitability of our mortgage banking operations depends in large\npart upon our ability to aggregate a high volume of loans and to sell them in the secondary market at a gain. Thus, we are dependent upon the\nexistence of an active secondary market and our ability to profitably sell loans into that market.\nOur ability to sell mortgage loans readily is dependent upon the availability of an active secondary market for single-family mortgage loans,\nwhich in turn depends in part upon the continuation of programs currently offered by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae (the “Agencies”)\nand other institutional and non-institutional investors. These entities account for a substantial portion of the secondary market in residential\nmortgage loans. Some of the largest participants in the secondary market, including the Agencies, are government-sponsored enterprises whose\nactivities are governed by federal law. Any future changes in laws that significantly affect the activity of such government-sponsored enterprises\ncould, in turn, adversely affect our operations.\nIn September 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were placed into conservatorship by the U.S. government. Although to date, the\nconservatorship has not had a significant or adverse effect on our operations, and during 2010 and 2012 the Federal Housing Finance Agency\nindicated that the Treasury Department is committed to funding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to levels needed in order to sufficiently meet their\nfunding needs, it is currently unclear whether further changes would significantly and adversely affect our operations. In addition, our ability to\nsell mortgage loans readily is dependent upon our ability to remain eligible for the programs offered by the Agencies and other institutional and\nnon-institutional investors. Our ability to remain eligible may also depend on having an acceptable peer-relative delinquency ratio for the Federal\nHousing Administration (“FHA”) and maintaining a delinquency rate with respect to Ginnie Mae pools that are below Ginnie Mae guidelines.\nAny significant impairment of our eligibility with any of the Agencies could materially and adversely affect our operations. Further, the criteria\nfor loans to be accepted under such programs may be changed from time-to-time by the sponsoring entity which could result in a lower volume\nof corresponding loan originations. The profitability of participating in specific programs may vary depending on a number of factors, including\nour administrative costs of originating and purchasing qualifying loans and our costs of meeting such criteria.\nOur mortgage lending profitability could be significantly reduced as changes in interest rates could affect mortgage origination\nvolume and pricing for selling mortgages on the secondary market.\nCurrently, we sell a large portion of the mortgage loans we originate. The profitability of our mortgage banking operations depends in large\npart upon our ability to originate and sell mortgages to the secondary market at a gain. A higher interest rate environment can negatively affect\nthe volume of loan originations and refinanced loans reducing the dollar amount of loans available to be sold to the secondary market. Higher\ninterest rates can also negatively affect the premium received on loans sold to the secondary market as competitive pressures to originate loans\ncan reduce pricing.\nOur information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security.\nThe Bank relies heavily on internal and outsourced digital technologies, communications, and information systems to conduct its business.\nAs our reliance on technology systems increases, the potential risks of technology-related operation interruptions in our customer relationship\nmanagement, general ledger, deposit, loan, or other systems or the occurrence of cyber incidents also increases. Cyber incidents can result\nfrom deliberate attacks or unintentional events including (i) unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or\nsensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruptions; (ii) denial-of-service attacks on websites; or (iii) intelligence gathering\nand social engineering aimed at obtaining information. The occurrence of operational interruption, cyber incident, or a deficiency in the cyber\nsecurity of our technology systems (internal or outsourced) could negatively impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nPage 34 of 108\nWe have policies and procedures expressly designed to prevent or limit the effect of a failure, interruption, or security breach of our systems\nand maintain cyber security insurance. However, such policies, procedures, or insurance may prove insufficient to prevent, repel, or mitigate a\ncyber incident. Significant interruptions to our business from technology issues could result in expensive remediation efforts and distraction of\nmanagement. Although we have not experienced any material losses related to a technology-related operational interruption or cyber-attack,\nthere can be no assurance that such failures, interruptions, or security breaches will not occur in the future or, if they do occur, that the impact\nwill not be substantial.\nThe occurrence of any failures, interruptions, or security breaches of our technology systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of\ncustomer business, result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss, or destruction of proprietary information, subject us to\nadditional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on\nour financial condition, results of operations, or stock price. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may also be required to spend significant\nadditional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security\nvulnerabilities.\nWe are subject to certain operational risks, including, but not limited to, customer or employee fraud and data processing system\nfailures and errors.\nEmployee errors and employee and/or customer misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm\nour reputation or financial performance. Misconduct by our employees could include, but is not limited to, hiding unauthorized activities from us,\nimproper or unauthorized activities on behalf of our customers, or improper use of confidential information. It is not always possible to prevent\nemployee errors and misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Employee\nerrors could also subject us to financial claims for negligence.\nWe maintain a system of internal controls and insurance coverage to mitigate against operational risks, including data processing system\nfailures and errors and customer or employee fraud. If our internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence, or if any resulting loss is not\ninsured or exceeds applicable insurance limits, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\nWe depend on outside third parties for processing and handling of our records and data.\nThe Bank relies on software developed by third party vendors to process various transactions. In some cases, we have contracted with third\nparties to run their proprietary software on our behalf. These systems include, but are not limited to, general ledger, payroll, employee benefits,\nloan and deposit processing, and securities portfolio management. While we perform a review of controls instituted by the vendors over these\nprograms in accordance with industry standards and perform our own testing of user controls, we must rely on the continued maintenance of\nthese controls by the outside party, including safeguards over the security of customer data. In addition, we maintain backups of key processing\noutput daily in the event of a failure on the part of any of these systems. Nonetheless, we may incur a temporary disruption in the ability to\nconduct our business or process our transactions or incur damage to our reputation if the third party vendor fails to adequately maintain internal\ncontrols or institute necessary changes to systems. Such disruption or breach of security may have a material adverse effect on our financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nPage 35 of 108\nWe continually encounter technological change.\nThe banking and financial services industry continually undergoes technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-\ndriven products and services. In addition to better meeting customer needs, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables\nfinancial institutions to reduce costs. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to address the needs of our customers by using\ntechnology to provide products and services that enhance customer convenience and that create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many\nof our competitors have greater resources to invest in technological improvements, and we may not effectively implement new technology-driven\nproducts and services or do so as quickly as our competitors, which could reduce our ability to effectively compete. Failure to successfully keep\npace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,\nand results of operations.\nWe may not be able to attract and retain skilled people.\nThe Bank’s success depends on its ability to attract and retain skilled people. Competition for the best people in most activities in which we\nengage can be intense, and we may not be able to hire people or retain them. The unexpected loss of services of certain of our skilled personnel\ncould have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills, knowledge of our market, years of industry experience, customer\nrelationships, and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.\nLoss of key employees may disrupt relationships with certain customers.\nOur customer relationships are critical to the success of our business, and loss of key employees with significant customer relationships may\nlead to the loss of business if the customers were to follow that employee to a competitor. While we believe our relationships with key personnel\nare strong, we cannot guarantee that all of our key personnel will remain with the organization, which could result in the loss of some of our\ncustomers and could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future, and such capital may not be available when needed or at all.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future to fund acquisitions and to provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to\nmeet our commitments, regulatory capital requirements, and business needs, particularly if our asset quality or earnings were to deteriorate\nsignificantly. We periodically explore acquisition opportunities with other financial institutions, some of which may be in a less favorable financial\ncondition than we are. Any future acquisition, particularly the acquisition of a significantly troubled institution or an institution of comparable size\nto us, may require us to raise additional capital in order to obtain regulatory approval and/or to remain well capitalized.\nOur ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on, among other things, conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are\noutside of our control, and our financial performance. Economic conditions and the loss of confidence in financial institutions may increase our\ncost of funding and limit access to certain customary sources of capital, including inter-bank borrowings, repurchase agreements, and\nborrowings from the discount window of the Federal Reserve.\nWe cannot guarantee that such capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all. Any occurrence that may limit our access to the capital\nmarkets, such as a decline in the confidence of debt purchasers, our depositors or counterparties participating in the capital markets, may\nadversely affect our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and, in turn, our liquidity. Moreover, if we need to raise capital in the future, we\nmay have to do so when many other financial institutions are also seeking to raise capital and would have to compete with those institutions for\ninvestors. An inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a materially adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations and may restrict our ability to grow.\nWe may be exposed to risk of environmental liabilities with respect to real property to which we take title.\nIn the course of our business, we may own or foreclose and take title to real estate, and could be subject to environmental liabilities with\nrespect to these properties (including liabilities for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in\nconnection with environmental contamination), or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances, or chemical\nreleases at a property.\nPage 36 of 108\nWe are exposed to intangible asset risk in that our goodwill may become impaired.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $14.2 million of goodwill and other intangible assets. A significant and sustained decline in our stock price\nand market capitalization, a significant decline in our expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the business climate, or slower\ngrowth rates could result in impairment of goodwill. If we were to conclude that a future write-down of our goodwill is necessary, then we would\nrecord the appropriate charge, which could be materially adverse to our operating results and financial position. For further discussion, see\nNotes 1 and 7, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” and “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements included in Item 8 this report.\nDamage to our reputation could damage our business.\nOur business depends upon earning and maintaining the trust and confidence of our customers, investors, and employees. Damage to our\nreputation could cause significant harm to our business and prospects. Harm to our reputation can arise from numerous sources, including,\namong others, employee misconduct, compliance failures, litigation, regulatory outcomes, or governmental investigations. In addition, a failure to\ndeliver appropriate standards of service and quality, or a failure or perceived failure to treat customers and clients fairly, can result in customer\ndissatisfaction, litigation, privacy breach, and heightened regulatory scrutiny, all of which can lead to lost revenue, higher operating costs, and\nharm to our reputation. Adverse publicity about the Bancorp, whether or not true, may result in harm to our existing business, customer\nrelationships and prospects. Should any events or factors that can undermine our reputation occur, there is no assurance that the additional\ncosts and expenses that we may need to incur to address the issues giving rise to the reputational harm would not adversely affect our earnings\nand results of operations.\nPotential acquisitions may disrupt our business and dilute stockholder value.\nWe periodically evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other\nfinancial institutions and financial services companies. We generally seek merger or acquisition partners that are culturally similar and possess\neither significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management, economies of scale, or expanded\nservices. Acquiring other banks, businesses, or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among other\nthings:\n● potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company;\n● exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company;\n● potential disruption to our business;\n● potential diversion of our management’s time and attention away from day-to-day operations;\n● the possible loss of key employees, business, and customers of the target company;\n● difficulty in estimating the value of the target company; and\n● potential problems in integrating the target company’s data processing and ancillary systems, customers, and employees with ours.\nAs a result, merger or acquisition discussions and, in some cases, negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving\nthe payment of cash or the issuance of our debt or equity securities may occur at any time. Acquisitions typically involve the payment of a\npremium over book, and, therefore, some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with\nany future transaction. To the extent we were to issue additional shares of common stock in any such transaction, our current shareholders\nwould be diluted and such an issuance may have the effect of decreasing our stock price, perhaps significantly. Furthermore, failure to realize\nthe expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits from an acquisition\ncould have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, merger and acquisition costs incurred by the\nBancorp may temporarily increase operating expenses.\nPage 37 of 108\nRisks Related to the Banking Industry\nOur business may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally.\nOur financial performance depends to a large extent on the business environment in our geographically concentrated eight-county market\narea of Lake, Porter, LaPorte, and Newton counties in Indiana, and Cook, DuPage, Lake, and Will counties in Illinois, the nearby suburban\nmetropolitan Chicagoland market, the states of Indiana and Illinois, and the U.S. as a whole. In particular, the current environment impacts the\nability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans as well as the value of collateral securing those loans. A favorable\nbusiness environment is generally characterized by economic growth, low unemployment, efficient capital markets, low inflation, high business\nand investor confidence, strong business earnings, and other factors. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused\nby declines in economic growth, business activity, or investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of\ncredit and capital; increases in inflation or interest rates; high unemployment; natural disasters; or a combination of these or other factors.\nIn the recent past, our market area, the suburban metropolitan Chicagoland market, the states of Indiana and Illinois, and the U.S. as a\nwhole experienced a downward economic cycle. Significant weakness in market conditions adversely impacted all aspects of the economy.\nBusiness activity across a wide range of industries and regions was greatly reduced, and local governments and many businesses experienced\nserious difficulty due to the lack of consumer spending and the lack of liquidity in the credit markets. In addition, unemployment increased\nsignificantly during that period, which further contributed to the adverse business environment for households and businesses.\nWhile economic conditions have improved, there can be no assurance that the economic recovery will continue, and future deterioration\nwould likely exacerbate the adverse effects of recent difficult market conditions on us and others in the financial institutions industry. Market\nstress could have a material adverse effect on the credit quality of our loans, and therefore, our financial condition and results of operations as\nwell as other potential adverse impacts including:\n● There could be an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies, lack of consumer confidence, increased market\nvolatility, and widespread reduction of business activity generally.\n● There could be an increase in write-downs of asset values by financial institutions, such as the Bank.\n● There could be the loss of collateral value on commercial and real estate loans that are secured by real estate located in our market\narea. A further significant decline in real estate values in our market would mean that the collateral for many of our loans would\nprovide less security. As a result, we would be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans because our ability to fully recover on\ndefaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral would be diminished.\n● Our ability to assess the creditworthiness of customers could be impaired if the models and approaches they use to select, manage,\nand underwrite credits become less predictive of future performance.\n● The process we use to estimate losses inherent in our loan portfolio requires difficult, subjective, and complex judgments. This\nprocess includes analysis of economic conditions and the impact of these economic conditions on borrowers’ ability to repay their\nloans. The process could no longer be capable of accurate estimation and may, in turn, impact its reliability.\nPage 38 of 108\n● The Bank could be required to pay significantly higher FDIC premiums in the future if losses further deplete the Deposit Insurance\nFund.\n● We could face increased competition due to intensified consolidation of the financial services industry. If current levels of market\ndisruption and volatility continue or worsen, there can be no assurance that we will not experience an adverse effect, which may be\nmaterial, on our ability to access capital and on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFuture economic conditions in our market area will depend on factors outside of our control, such as political and market conditions, broad\ntrends in industry and finance, legislative and regulatory changes, changes in government, military, and fiscal policies, and inflation.\nTurmoil in the financial markets could result in lower fair values for our investment securities.\nMajor disruptions in the capital markets experienced in recent years have adversely affected investor demand for all classes of securities,\nexcluding U.S. Treasury securities, and resulted in volatility in the fair values of our investment securities. Significant prolonged reduced investor\ndemand could manifest itself in lower fair values for these securities and may result in recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment\n(“OTTI”), which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nMunicipal securities can also be impacted by the business environment of their geographic location. Although this type of security historically\nexperiences extremely low default rates, municipal securities are subject to systemic risk since cash flows generally depend on (i) the ability of\nthe issuing authority to levy and collect taxes; or (ii) the ability of the issuer to charge for and collect payment for essential services rendered. If\nthe issuer defaults on its payments, it may result in the recognition of OTTI or a total loss, which could have a material adverse effect on our\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nWe face strong competition in all phases of our business from other banks, financial institutions, and non-banks.\nThe banking and financial services business in our market areas is highly competitive. Our competitors include large regional banks, local\ncommunity banks, savings and loan associations, securities and brokerage companies, mortgage companies, insurance companies, finance\ncompanies, money market mutual funds, credit unions, neo-banks (a digital or mobile-only bank that exists without any physical bank branches),\nand other non-bank financial and digital service providers, many of which have greater financial, marketing, and technological resources than us.\nMany of these competitors are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions that we are and may be able to compete more effectively as a\nresult.\nAlso, technology and other changes have lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for customers to complete financial transactions\nusing neo-banks, non-banks, and financial technology (“FinTech”) companies that historically have involved banks at one or both ends of the\ntransaction. These entities now offer products and services traditionally provided by community banks and often at lower costs. The wide\nacceptance of Internet-based commerce has resulted in a number of alternative payment processing systems, deposit, and lending platforms in\nwhich banks play only minor roles. For example, consumers can maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in\nbrokerage accounts or mutual funds. Consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and/or transferring funds directly without\nthe assistance of banks. Use of emerging alternative payment platforms, such as Apple Pay or Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, can alter\nconsumer credit card behavior and consequently impact our interchange fee income.\nThe process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as “disintermediation,” could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss\nof customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. The effects of disintermediation can also impact the lending\nbusiness because of the fast growing body of FinTech companies that use software to deliver mortgage lending and other financial services. A\nrelated risk is the migration of bank personnel away from the traditional bank environments into neo-banks, FinTech companies, and other non-\nbanks.\nPage 39 of 108\nIncreased competition in our market may result in a decrease in the amounts of our loans and deposits, reduced spreads between loan rates\nand deposit rates or loan terms that are more favorable to the borrower. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our ability\nto maintain our earnings record, grow our loan portfolios, and obtain low-cost funds. If increased competition causes us to significantly discount\nthe interest rates we offer on loans or increase the amount we pay on deposits, our net interest income could be adversely impacted. If\nincreased competition causes us to relax our underwriting standards, we could be exposed to higher losses from lending activities. Additionally,\nmany of our competitors are larger in total assets and capitalization, have greater access to capital markets, and offer a broader range of\nfinancial services than we can offer.\nThe Bancorp also is experiencing an increase in competition to acquire other banks, due to the overall strength of financial institutions and\ntheir high capital levels. In addition, credit unions and FinTech companies are now actively pursuing small bank acquisitions. Increased\ncompetition for bank acquisitions may slow the Bancorp’s ability to grow earning assets at comparable historical growth rates.\nWe are subject to federal regulations that seek to protect the Deposit Insurance Fund and the depositors and borrowers of the Bank,\nand our federal regulators may impose restrictions on our operations that are detrimental to holders of the Bancorp’s common stock.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision, and examination by the FRB, IDFI, and FDIC, our primary regulators. Such regulation\nand supervision governs the activities in which an institution and its holding company may engage, and are intended primarily for the protection\nof the insurance fund and the depositors and borrowers of the Bank rather than for holders of the Bancorp’s common stock. Our regulators may\nsubject us to supervisory and enforcement actions, such as the imposition of certain restrictions on our operations, requirements that we take\nremedial action, the classification of our assets and the determination of the level of our allowance for loan losses, that are aimed at protecting\nthe insurance fund and the depositors and borrowers of the Bank but that are detrimental to holders of the Bancorp’s common stock. Any change\nin our regulation or oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation, or supervisory action, may have a material impact\non our operations.\nAcquisitions and the addition of branch facilities may not produce revenue enhancements or cost savings at levels or within\ntimeframes originally anticipated and may result in unforeseen integration difficulties and dilution to existing shareholder value.\nWe regularly explore opportunities to establish branch facilities and acquire other banks or financial institutions. New or acquired branch\nfacilities and other facilities may not be profitable. We may not be able to correctly identify profitable locations for new branches. The costs to\nstart up new branch facilities or to acquire existing branches, and the additional costs to operate these facilities, may increase our noninterest\nexpense and decrease earnings in the short term. It may be difficult to adequately and profitably manage growth through the establishment of\nthese branches. In addition, we can provide no assurance that these branch sites will successfully attract enough deposits to offset the expenses\nof operating these branch sites. Any new or acquired branches will be subject to regulatory approval, and there can be no assurance that we will\nsucceed in securing such approvals.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to many\ndifferent industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including\nbrokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions\nexpose us to credit risk in the event of default by our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral\nheld by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us. There is\nno assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations or earnings.\nPage 40 of 108\nRisks Related to the Bancorp’s Common Stock\nAn investment in the Bancorp’s common stock is not an insured deposit.\nThe Bancorp’s common stock is not a bank deposit and, therefore, is not insured against loss by the FDIC, any other deposit insurance fund,\nor by any other public or private entity. Investment in the Bancorp’s common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described in this “Risk\nFactors” section and elsewhere in this prospectus and is subject to the same market forces that affect the price of common stock in any public\ncompany. As a result, if you acquire the Bancorp’s common stock, you could lose some or all of your investment.\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate, sometimes significantly, and this may make it difficult for you to resell our common\nstock at times or at prices you find attractive.\nAlthough our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, our stock price constantly changes, and we expect our stock price to\ncontinue to fluctuate in the future. Our stock price is impacted by a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors\ninclude:\n● variations in our operating results or the quality of our assets;\n● operating results that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts, and investors;\n● increases in loan losses, non-performing loans, and other real estate owned;\n● changes in the U.S. corporate tax rates;\n● changes in expectations as to our future financial performance;\n● announcements of new products, strategic developments, new technology, acquisitions, and other material events by us or our\ncompetitors;\n● ability to fund the Bancorp’s assets through core deposits and/or wholesale funding;\n● the operating and securities price performance of other companies that investors believe are comparable to us;\n● actual or anticipated sales of our equity or equity-related securities;\n● our past and future dividend practices;\n● our creditworthiness;\n● interest rates;\n● the credit, mortgage, and housing markets, and the markets for securities relating to mortgages or housing;\n● developments with respect to financial institutions generally; and\n● economic, financial, geopolitical, regulatory, congressional, or judicial events that affect us or the financial markets.\nIn addition, the stock market in general has experienced price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the\nmarket price of securities issued by many companies and particularly those in the financial services and banking sector, including for reasons\nunrelated to their operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect our stock price, notwithstanding our operating\nresults.\nPage 41 of 108\nThe trading volume in the Bancorp’s common stock is less than that of other larger financial institutions.\nAlthough the Bancorp’s common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, the trading volume in the common stock may be less than that\nof other, larger financial services companies. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity, and orderliness\ndepends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of the Bancorp’s common stock at any given time. This presence\ndepends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which the Bancorp has no control. During\nany period of lower trading volume of the Bancorp’s common stock, significant sales of shares of the Bancorp’s common stock, or the\nexpectation of these sales, could cause the Bancorp’s common stock price to fall.\nThe Bancorp’s Articles of Incorporation, Indiana law, and certain banking laws may have an anti-takeover effect.\nProvisions of the Bancorp’s Articles of Incorporation, the Indiana Business Corporation Law, and the federal banking laws, including\nregulatory approval requirements, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the Bancorp, even if doing so would be perceived to be\nbeneficial by the Bancorp’s shareholders. The combination of these provisions could have the effect of inhibiting a non-negotiated merger or\nother business combination, which, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of the Bancorp’s common stock.\nThe Bancorp may issue additional securities, which could dilute the ownership percentage of holders of the Bancorp’s common stock.\nThe Bancorp may issue additional securities to, among other reasons, raise additional capital or finance acquisitions, and, if it does, the\nownership percentage of holders of the Bancorp’s common stock could be diluted potentially materially.\nWe may not be able to pay dividends in the future in accordance with past practice.\nThe Bancorp has traditionally paid a quarterly dividend to common shareholders. The payment of dividends is subject to legal and regulatory\nrestrictions. Any payment of dividends in the future will depend, in large part, on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, and other\nfactors considered relevant by the Bancorp’s board of directors. The board may, at its discretion, reduce or eliminate dividends or change its\ndividend policy in the future.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNot applicable.\nItem 2. Properties\nThe Bancorp maintains its corporate office at 9204 Columbia Avenue, Munster, Indiana, from which it oversees the operation of the Bank’s\n30 banking locations. The Bancorp owns all of its office properties.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Bank operated 16 branches in Northwest Indiana, with 15 of the branches located in Lake County and 1\nbranch located in Porter County, Indiana, and 14 branches located in Cook County, Illinois.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGeneral\nThe Bancorp's earnings are dependent upon the earnings of the Bank. The Bank's earnings are primarily dependent upon net interest\nmargin. The net interest margin is the difference between interest income earned on loans and investments and interest expense paid on\ndeposits and borrowings stated as a percentage of average interest earning assets. The net interest margin is perhaps the clearest indicator of a\nfinancial institution's ability to generate core earnings. Fees and service charges, wealth management operations income, gains and losses from\nthe sale of assets, provisions for loan losses, income taxes and operating expenses also affect the Bancorp's profitability.\nA summary of the Bancorp’s significant accounting policies are detailed in Note 1 to the Bancorp’s consolidated financial statements\nincluded in this report. Preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America\nrequires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosure of contingent\nassets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period, as\nwell as the disclosures provided. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates associated with the allowance for loan losses are\nparticularly susceptible to material change in the near term.\nAt December 31, 2021, the Bancorp had total assets of $1.6 billion and total deposits of $1.4 billion. The Bancorp's deposit accounts are\ninsured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) that is administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), an\nagency of the federal government. At December 31, 2021, stockholders' equity totaled $156.6 million, with book value per share at $45.00. Net\nincome for 2021 was $15.0 million, or $4.30 basic and diluted earnings per common share. The return on average assets was 0.95%, while the\nreturn on average stockholders’ equity was 9.61%.\nRecent Developments\nAcquisition of Royal Financial, Inc. On January 31, 2022, the Bancorp completed its acquisition of Royal Financial, Inc. (“RYFL”) pursuant to\nan Agreement and Plan of Merger dated July 28, 2021 (the “Merger Agreement”) between the Bancorp and RYFL. Pursuant to the terms of the\nMerger Agreement, RYFL merged with and into the Bancorp, with the Bancorp as the surviving corporation (the “RYFL Merger”). Simultaneous\nwith the RYFL Merger, Royal Savings Bank, an Illinois state chartered savings bank and wholly-owned subsidiary of RYFL, merged with and into\nthe Bank, with the Bank as the surviving institution.\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, RYFL stockholders who owned 101 or more shares of RYFL common stock were permitted to\nelect to receive either 0.4609 shares of Finward common stock or $20.14 in cash, or a combination of both, for each share of RYFL common\nstock owned, subject to proration and allocation provisions such that 65% of the shares of RYFL common stock outstanding immediately prior to\nthe closing of the merger were converted into the right to receive shares of Finward common stock and the remaining 35% of the outstanding\nRYFL shares were converted into the right to receive cash. Stockholders holding less than 101 shares of RYFL common stock will have the right\nto receive fixed consideration of $20.14 in cash and no stock consideration for each share of RYFL common stock.\nAs a result of RYFL stockholder stock and cash elections and the related allocation and proration provisions of the Merger Agreement,\nFinward issued 795,423 shares of its common stock and paid cash consideration of approximately $18.7 million in the RYFL Merger. Based on\nthe January 28, 2022 closing price of $47.75 per share of Finward common stock, the transaction had an implied valuation of approximately\n$56.7 million. The acquisition further expanded the Bank’s banking center network in Cook County, Illinois, expanding the Bank’s full-service\nretail banking network to 30 banking centers.\nPage 46 of 108\nFinancial Condition\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, total assets increased by $124.5 million (8.3%), to $1.6 billion, with interest-earning assets\nincreasing by $125.1 million (8.9%). At December 31, 2021, interest‑earning assets totaled $1.5 billion and represented 94.0% of total assets.\nLoans totaled $966.7 million and represented 63.4% of interest-earning assets, 59.6% of total assets and 67.4% of total deposits. The loan\nportfolio, which is the Bancorp’s largest asset, is a significant source of both interest and fee income.\nDecember 31, December 31,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2021 2020\nBalance % Loans Balance % Loans\nResidential real estate $ 260,134 27.1% 286,048 33.0%\nHome equity 34,612 3.6% 39,233 5.4%\nCommercial real estate 317,145 33.0% 298,257 31.2%\nConstruction and land development 123,822 12.9% 93,562 9.7%\nMultifamily 61,194 6.4% 50,571 5.7%\nFarmland - 0.0% 215 0.0%\nConsumer 582 0.1% 1,025 0.1%\nManufactured Homes 37,887 3.9% 24,232 1.8%\nCommercial business 115,772 12.1% 158,140 11.4%\nGovernment 8,991 0.9% 10,142 1.7%\nLoans receivable 960,139 100.0% 961,425 100.0%\nPlus:\nNet deferred loans origination costs 6,810 3,871\nUndisbursed loan funds (229) (150)\nLoans receivable, net of deferred\nfees and costs $ 966,720 $ 965,146\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2021 2020\nLoans receivable to total assets 59.6% 64.5%\nLoans receivable to earning assets 63.4% 69.0%\nLoans receivable to total deposits 67.4% 74.1%\nThe Bancorp is primarily a portfolio lender. Mortgage banking activities historically have been limited to the sale of fixed rate mortgage loans\nwith contractual maturities greater than 15 years. These loans are identified as held for sale when originated and sold, on a loan-by-loan basis,\nin the secondary market. The Bancorp will also retain fixed rate mortgage loans with a contractual maturity greater than 15 years on a limited\nbasis. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, the Bancorp originated $153.1 million in new fixed rate mortgage loans for sale,\ncompared to $224.9 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Net gains realized from the mortgage loan sales totaled $5.3\nmillion for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, compared to $7.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. At\nDecember 31, 2021, the Bancorp had $5.0 million in loans that were classified as held for sale, compared to $11.3 million at December 31, 2020.\nIn addition, the Bancorp participates in the U.S. Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”), a program initiated\nto help small businesses maintain their workforces during the pandemic. As of December 31, 2021, the Bancorp approved 782 applications\ntotaling $91.5 million for the first round, with an average loan size of approximately $117 thousand. These loans helped local business owners\nretain 10,758 employees based on the borrowers’ applications. The Bancorp’s SBA lender fee is averaging approximately 3.80% for the first\nround of the program, and fees will be earned over the life of the associated loans. The first round of PPP closed in August of 2020. On\nDecember 21, 2020, Congress passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, which included provisions for a second round of PPP funding\nin 2021. As of December 31, 2021, the Bancorp approved 420 applications totaling $37.5 million for the second round, with an average loan size\nof approximately $89 thousand. These loans will help local business owners retain 4,410 employees based on the borrowers’ applications. The\nBancorp’s SBA lender fee is averaging approximately 5.32% for this program, and fees will be earned over the life of the associated loans. As of\nDecember 31, 2021, the Bancorp had remaining loan balances under the Paycheck Protection Program totaling $22.1 million.\nPage 47 of 108\nNon-performing loans include those loans that are 90 days or more past due and accruing and those loans that have been placed on non-\naccrual status. At December 31, 2021, all non-performing loans are also accounted for on a non-accrual basis, except for one commercial real\nestate loan totaling $91 thousand, two commercial business loans totaling $49 thousand, one home equity loan totaling $34 thousand, and one\nresidential real estate loan totaling $31 thousand that remained accruing and more than 90 days past due.\nThe Bancorp's nonperforming loans are summarized below:\n(Dollars in thousands)\nDecember 31, December 31,\nLoan Segment 2021 2020\nResidential real estate $ 4,682 $ 6,470\nHome equity 657 505\nCommercial real estate 1,031 5,827\nConstruction and land development - 20\nMultifamily 455 504\nFarmland - -\nCommercial business 436 1,039\nConsumer - -\nManufactured homes - -\nGovernment - -\nTotal $ 7,261 $ 14,365\nNonperforming loans to total loans 0.75% 1.49%\nNonperforming loans to total assets 0.45% 0.96%\nSubstandard loans include non-performing loans and potential problem loans, where information about possible credit issues or other\nconditions causes management to question the ability of such borrowers to comply with loan covenants or repayment terms.

Typically, management does not individually classify smaller-balance\nhomogeneous loans, such as residential mortgages or consumer loans, as impaired, unless they are troubled debt restructurings.\nPurchased loans acquired in a business combination are recorded at estimated fair value on their purchase date. Purchased loans with\nevidence of credit quality deterioration since origination are considered purchased credit impaired loans. Expected future cash flows at the\npurchase date in excess of the fair value of loans are recorded as interest income over the life of the loans if the timing and amount of the future\ncash flows is reasonably estimable (“accretable yield”). The difference between contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to\nbe collected at acquisition is referred to as the non-accretable difference and represents probable losses in the portfolio. In determining the\nacquisition date fair value of purchased credit impaired loans, and in subsequent accounting, the Bancorp aggregates these purchased loans\ninto pools of loans by common risk characteristics, such as credit risk rating and loan type. Subsequent to the purchase date, increases in cash\nflows over those expected at the purchase date are recognized as interest income prospectively. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash\nflows will generally result in a provision for loan losses.\nThe Bancorp's impaired loans, including purchased credit impaired loans, are summarized below:\n(Dollars in thousands)\nDecember 31, December 31,\nLoan Segment 2021 2020\nResidential real estate $ 1,771 $ 2,165\nHome equity 284 353\nCommercial real estate 1,600 6,341\nConstruction and land development - -\nMultifamily 556 716\nFarmland - -\nCommercial business 1,597 2,246\nConsumer - -\nManufactured homes - -\nGovernment - -\nTotal $ 5,808 $ 11,821\nAt times, the Bancorp will modify the terms of a loan to forego a portion of interest or principal or reduce the interest rate on the loan to a rate\nmaterially less than market rates, or materially extend the maturity date of a loan as part of a troubled debt restructuring. The valuation basis for\nthe Bancorp’s troubled debt restructurings is based on the present value of expected future cash flows; unless consistent cash flows are not\npresent, then the fair value of the collateral securing the loan is the basis for valuation.\nPage 49 of 108\nThe Bancorp's troubled debt restructured loans are summarized below:\n(Dollars in thousands)\nDecember 31, 2021 December 31, 2020\nNumber of Recorded Number of Recorded\nLoan Segment Loans Investment Loans Investment\nResidential real estate 5 $ 342 8 $ 614\nHome equity 3 83 7 187\nCommercial real estate 3 747 4 872\nConstruction and land development - - - -\nMultifamily - - - -\nFarmland - - - -\nCommercial business 2 694 6 448\nConsumer - - - -\nManufactured homes - - - -\nGovernment - - - -\nTotal 13 $ 1,866 25 $ 2,121\nThe decrease in nonperforming, impaired, and substandard loans as of December 31, 2021, is due to the loan sale with charge off for a\nsingle large commercial real estate loan relationship, which operates a hotel, totaling $5,080 thousand. Nonperforming loans at December 31,\n2021, also decreased due to the removal of various residential real estate loans from nonaccrual totaling $2,856 thousand. Substandard loans at\nDecember 31, 2021, also decreased due to the removal of various residential real estate loans totaling $2,665 thousand. Impaired loans at\nDecember 31, 2021, also decreased due to the removal of eight commercial business or commercial real estate customers with loans totaling\n$623 thousand due to loan pay off or refinance. The decrease in special mention loans as of December 31, 2021, is due to the removal of six\ncommercial business, multifamily or commercial real estate customers with loans totaling $2,513 thousand because of loan risk rating change or\nloan pay off and the removal of various residential real estate and home equity loans totaling $945 thousand which was offset by the addition of\nseven commercial real estate or commercial business customers with loans totaling $2,854 thousand.\nAt December 31, 2021, management is of the opinion that there are no loans, except certain of those discussed above, where known\ninformation about possible credit problems of borrowers causes management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to\ncomply with the present loan repayment terms and which will imminently result in such loans being classified as past due, non-accrual or a\ntroubled debt restructure. Management does not presently anticipate that any of the non-performing loans or classified loans would materially\naffect future operations, liquidity or capital resources.\nThe allowance for loan losses (ALL) is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit losses, increased by the provision for loan losses,\nand decreased by charge-offs net of recoveries. A loan is charged off against the allowance by management as a loss when deemed\nuncollectible, although collection efforts continue and future recoveries may occur. The determination of the amounts of the ALL and provisions\nfor loan losses is based on management’s current judgments about the credit quality of the loan portfolio with consideration given to all known\nrelevant internal and external factors that affect loan collectability as of the reporting date. The appropriateness of the current period provision\nand the overall adequacy of the ALL are determined through a disciplined and consistently applied quarterly process that reviews the Bancorp’s\ncurrent credit risk within the loan portfolio and identifies the required allowance for loan losses given the current risk estimates.\nPage 50 of 108\nThe Bancorp's provision for loan losses for the twelve months ended are summarized below:\n(Dollars in thousands)\nDecember 31, December 31,\nLoan Segment 2021 2020\nResidential real estate $ 220 $ 374\nHome equity 81 53\nCommercial real estate 639 1,713\nConstruction and land development 714 324\nMultifamily 222 97\nFarmland - -\nCommercial business (377) 1,145\nConsumer 10 (2)\nManufactured homes - -\nGovernment - (17)\nTotal $ 1,509 $ 3,687\nThe Bancorp's charge-off and recovery information is summarized below:\n(Dollars in thousands) (unaudited)\nAs of December 31, 2021\nLoan Segment Charge-off Recoveries Net Charge-offs\nResidential real estate $ (32) $ 81 $ 49\nHome equity (1) 1 -\nCommercial real estate (530) - (530)\nConstruction and land development - - -\nMultifamily - - -\nFarmland - - -\nCommercial business (158) 36 (122)\nConsumer (29) 8 (21)\nManufactured homes - -\nGovernment - - -\nTotal $ (750) $ 126 $ (624)\nThe ALL provisions take into consideration management’s current judgments about the credit quality of the loan portfolio, loan portfolio\nbalances, changes in the portfolio mix and local economic conditions. In determining the provision for loan losses for the current period,\nmanagement has considered risks associated with the local economy, changes in loan balances and mix, and asset quality.\nIn addition, management considers reserves that are not part of the ALL that have been established from acquisition activity. The Bancorp\nacquired loans for which there was evidence of credit quality deterioration since origination and it was determined that it was probable that the\nBancorp would be unable to collect all contractually required principal and interest payments. At December 31, 2021, total purchased credit\nimpaired loans nonaccretable and accretable discount totaled $1.4 million compared to $2.1 million at December 31, 2020. Additionally, the\nBancorp has acquired loans where there was no evidence of credit quality deterioration since origination and has marked these loans to their fair\nvalues. As part of the fair value of loans receivable, a net fair value discount was established for loans acquired and has a balance of $1.1 million\nat December 31, 2021, compared to $2.0 million at December 31, 2020. Details on these fair value marks and the additional reserves created\ncan be found in Note 4, Loans Receivable.\nA deferred cost reserve is maintained for the portfolio of manufactured home loans that have been purchased. This reserve is available for\nuse for manufactured home loan nonperformance and costs associated with nonperformance. If the segment performs in line with expectation,\nthe deferred cost reserve is paid as an origination cost to the third party originator of the loan.\nPage 51 of 108\nThe Bancorp's allowance to total loans and non-performing loans are summarized below:\n(Dollars in thousands)\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2021 2020\nAllowance for loan losses $ 13,343 $ 12,458\nTotal loans $ 966,720 $ 966,578\nNon-performing loans $ 7,261 $ 14,365\nALL-to-total loans 1.38% 1.29%\nALL-to-non-performing loans (coverage ratio) 183.8% 86.7%\nThe December 31, 2021, balance in the ALL account is considered adequate by management after evaluation of the loan portfolio, past\nexperience and current economic and market conditions. While management may periodically allocate portions of the allowance for specific\nproblem loans, the whole allowance is available for any loan charge offs that occur. The allocation of the ALL reflects performance and growth\ntrends within the various loan categories, as well as consideration of the facts and circumstances that affect the repayment of individual loans,\nand loans which have been pooled as of the evaluation date, with particular attention given to non-performing loans and loans which have been\nclassified as substandard, doubtful or loss. Management has allocated reserves to both performing and non-performing loans based on current\ninformation available.\nAt December 31, 2021, the Bank held no balances in foreclosed real estate, compared to $538 thousand and ten properties at December\n31, 2020. During 2021, net sales of foreclosed real estate totaled $585 thousand and net gains from the 2021 sales totaled $47 thousand.\nThe primary objective of the Bancorp’s investment portfolio is to provide for the liquidity needs of the Bancorp and to contribute to profitability\nby providing a stable flow of dependable earnings. Funds are generally invested in federal funds, interest bearing balances in other financial\ninstitutions, U.S. government securities, federal agency obligations, obligations of state and local municipalities and corporate securities. The\nsecurities portfolio, all of which is designated as available-for-sale, totaled $526.9 million at December 31, 2021, compared to $410.7 million at\nDecember 31, 2020, an increase of $116.2 million (28.3%). The increase in the securities portfolio during the year is a result of market value\nadjustments and investment of excess liquidity. At December 31, 2021, the securities portfolio represented 34.6% of interest-earning assets and\n32.5% of total assets compared to 29.4% of interest-earning assets and 27.4% of total assets at December 31, 2020.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Bancorp’s two investments in trust preferred securities are in “payment in kind” status. Payment in kind status\nresults in a temporary delay in the payment of interest. As a result of a delay in the collection of the interest payments, management placed\nthese securities on non-accrual status. At December 31, 2021, the cost basis of the two trust preferred securities on non-accrual status totaled\n$2.2 million.\nPage 52 of 108\nThe Bancorp’s end-of-period investment portfolio and other short-term investments and stock balances were as follows:\nDecember 31.

The Bancorp’s end-of-period\nborrowing balances were as follows:\nDecember 31, December 31, YTD\n(Dollars in thousands) 2021 2020 Change\nBalance Balance $ %\nRepurchase agreements $ 14,581 $ 13,711 $ 870 6.3%\nBorrowed funds - 6,149 (6,149) -100.0%\nTotal borrowed funds $ 14,581 $ 19,860 $ (5,279) -26.6%\nRepurchase agreements increased as part of normal account fluctuations within that product line. Borrowed funds decreased as FHLB advances\nwere paid down and matured during the year.\nPage 53 of 108\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFor the Bancorp, liquidity management refers to the ability to generate sufficient cash to fund current loan demand, meet deposit\nwithdrawals, and pay dividends and operating expenses. Because profit and liquidity are often conflicting objectives, management attempts to\nmaximize the Bank’s net interest margin by making adequate, but not excessive, liquidity provisions. Furthermore, funds are managed so that\nfuture profits will not be significantly impacted as funding costs increase.\nChanges in the liquidity position result from operating, investing and financing activities. Cash flows from operating activities are generally\nthe cash effects of transactions and other events that enter into the determination of net income. The primary investing activities include loan\noriginations, loan repayments, investments in interest bearing balances in financial institutions, and the purchase, sale, and maturity of\ninvestment securities. Financing activities focus almost entirely on the generation of customer deposits. In addition, the Bancorp utilizes\nborrowings (i.e., repurchase agreements, FHLB advances and federal funds purchased) as a source of funds.\nDuring 2021, cash and cash equivalents increased $13.3 million compared to a decrease of $27.3 million for 2020. During 2021, he primary\nsources of cash and cash equivalents were the sale loans originated for sale, proceeds from the maturity and paydown of securities, proceeds\nfrom the sale of securities, growth of deposits, and proceeds from the maturity and paydown of loans receivable. The primary uses of cash and\ncash equivalents were origination of loans for sale and purchase of securities. During 2021, net cash from operating activities totaled $17.0\nmillion, compared to $19.7 million for 2020. The decrease in cash in-flow from operating activities was primarily due to lower net income year\nover year, lower sale of loans originated for sale, and net change in accrued expenses and other liabilities. Net cash outflows from investing\nactivities totaled $125.9 million during 2021, compared to outflows of $185.0 million during 2020. The changes for the current year were primarily\nrelated to the decreased purchases of securities and net change in loans receivable. Net cash inflows from financing activities totaled $122.1\nmillion in 2021, compared to net cash inflows of $138.0 million in 2020. The increase during 2021 was primarily due to the change in deposits.\nOn a cash basis, the Bancorp paid dividends on common stock of $4.3 million during 2021 and 2020. During 2021, the Bancorp’s Board of\nDirectors maintained dividends as earnings and capital continued to be sufficient to warrant the current dividend.\nManagement strongly believes that safety and soundness is enhanced by maintaining a high level of capital. Stockholders' equity totaled\n$156.6 million at December 31, 2021, compared to $151.7 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of $4.9 million (3.2%). The increase was\nprimarily the result of net income of $15.0 million, offset against change in net unrealized gains of available for sale securities of $6.2 million and\ndividends of $4.3 million. At December 31, 2021, book value per share was $45.00 compared to $43.80 for 2020.\nThe following table shows that, at December 31, 2021, the Bank’s capital exceeded all regulatory capital requirements. The dollar amounts\nare in millions.\n(Dollars in millions) Minimum Required To Be\nMinimum Required For Well Capitalized Under Prompt\nActual Capital Adequacy Purposes Corrective Action Regulations\nAt December 31, 2021 Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio\nCommon equity tier 1 capital to risk-\nweighted assets $ 133.7 12.6% $ 47.8 4.5% $ 69.0 6.5%\nTier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets $ 133.7 12.6% $ 63.7 6.0% $ 85.0 8.0%\nTotal capital to risk-weighted assets $ 147.0 13.9% $ 85.0 8.0% $ 106.2 10.0%\nTier 1 capital to adjusted average\nassets $ 133.7 8.4% $ 64.1 4.0% $ 80.1 5.0%\nThe Bancorp’s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is entirely dependent upon the Bank’s ability to pay dividends to the Bancorp.\nUnder Indiana law, the Bank may pay dividends from its undivided profits (generally, earnings less losses, bad debts, taxes and other operating\nexpenses) as is considered expedient by the Bank’s Board of Directors. However, the Bank must obtain the approval of the Indiana Department\nof Financial Institutions (DFI) if the total of all dividends declared by the Bank during the current year, including the proposed dividend, would\nexceed the sum of retained net income for the year to date plus its retained net income for the previous two years. For this purpose, “retained\nnet income,” means net income as calculated for call report purposes, less all dividends declared for the applicable period. An exemption from\nDFI approval would require that the Bank have been assigned a composite uniform financial institutions rating of 1 or 2 as a result of the most\nrecent federal or state examination; the proposed dividend would not result in a Tier 1 leverage ratio below 7.5%; and that the Bank not be\nsubject to any corrective action, supervisory order, supervisory agreement, or board approved operating agreement. The aggregate amount of\ndividends that may be declared by the Bank in 2021, without the need for qualifying for an exemption or prior DFI approval, is its 2021 net profits\nplus $21.4 million. Moreover, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve Board may prohibit the payment of dividends if it determines that the payment of\ndividends would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the Bank. On November 19, 2021 the Board of\nDirectors of the Bancorp declared a fourth quarter dividend of $0.31 per share. The Bancorp’s fourth quarter dividend was paid to shareholders\non January 7, 2022.\nPage 54 of 108\nResults of Operations –\nComparison of 2021 to 2020\nNet income for 2021 was $15.0 million, compared to $15.9 million for 2020, a decrease of $969 thousand (6.1%). The twelve-month\nearnings decrease is primarily related to higher noninterest expense and lower noninterest income. The earnings represent a return on average\nassets of 0.95% for 2021, compared to 1.12% for 2020. The return on average equity was 9.61% for 2021, compared to 11.04% for 2020.\nNet interest income for 2021, was $48.6 million, an increase of $2.7 million (5.9%) from $45.9 million for 2020. During the year, the\nBancorp’s interest earning assets were negatively impacted by lower yields, while interest expense was driven lower primarily by decreased cost\nof funds. The weighted-average yield on interest-earning assets was 3.44% for 2021, compared to 3.91% for 2020. The weighted-average cost\nof funds was 0.15% for 2021, compared to 0.45% for 2020. The impact of the 3.44% return on interest earning assets and the 0.15% cost of\nfunds resulted in a net interest spread of 3.29% for 2021, compared to a net interest spread of 3.46% for 2020. During 2021, total interest\nincome decreased by $966 thousand (1.9%) while total interest expense decreased by $3.7 million (63.8%). The net interest margin was 3.29%\nfor 2021, compared to 3.47% for 2019. The Bancorp’s tax equivalent net interest margin for 2021, was 3.51% compared to 3.63% for 2020.\nComparing the net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis more accurately compares the returns on tax-exempt loans and securities to those\non taxable interest-earning assets.\nThe decrease in interest earning asset income for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, is\nprimarily related to continued decreased reinvestment rates in 2021 for loans, securities, and excess cash balances, as a result of the Federal\nReserve cuts occurring in March 2020. The decrease in interest bearing liability expense is primarily the result of the Bancorp adjusting deposit\nand repurchase agreement pricing to align with the current interest rate cycle.\nThe following table shows the change in noninterest income for the year ending December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020.\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Year Ended December 31, 12/31/2021 vs. 12/31/2020\n2021 2020 $ Change % Change\nNoninterest income:\nFees and service charges 5,388 5,161 227 4.4%\nGain on sale of loans held-for-sale, net 5,296 7,588 (2,292) -30.2%\nWealth management operations 2,375 2,138 237 11.1%\nGain on sale of securities, net 1,987 2,348 (361) -15.4%\nIncrease in cash value of bank owned life insurance 715 708 7 1.0%\nGain on sale of foreclosed real estate 47 78 (31) -39.7%\nOther 139 127 12 9.4%\nTotal noninterest income 15,947 18,148 (2,201) -12.1%\nThe increase in fees and service charges is primarily the result of the Bancorp’s efforts to provide products and services to help customers\nbe more successful, including debit card and ATM services. The decrease in gain on sale of loans is the result of significant refinance activity in\nthe prior year due to the economic and rate environment, which resulted in more loans originated and sold. The increase in wealth management\nincome is the result of the Bancorp’s continued focus on expanding its wealth management line of business. The decrease in gains on the sale\nof securities is a result of current market conditions and actively managing the portfolio.\nPage 55 of 108\nThe following table shows the change in noninterest expense for the year ending December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020.\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Year Ended December 31, 12/31/2021 vs. 12/31/2020\n2021 2020 $ Change % Change\nNoninterest expense:\nCompensation and benefits 24,241 22,855 1,386 6.1%\nOccupancy and equipment 5,537 4,933 604 12.2%\nData processing 3,648 2,267 1,381 60.9%\nFederal deposit insurance premiums 861 788 73 9.3%\nProfessional services 1,205 640 565 88.3%\nMarketing 1,085 732 353 48.2%\nOther 10,059 9,421 638 6.8%\nTotal noninterest expense 46,636 41,636 5,000 12.0%\nThe increase in compensation and benefits is primarily the result of management’s continued focus on talent management and retention.\nThe increase in occupancy and equipment is primarily related to facilities improvement efforts aimed at enhancing technology and efficiency. The\nincrease in data processing expense is primarily the result of increased system utilization and investment in technological advancements such\nas Salesforce and nCino. The increase in marketing expense is the result of increased marketing and rebranding initiatives. The increase in\nprofessional services is primarily the result of the Royal Financial acquisition. The increase in other operating expenses is primarily the result of\ninvestments in strategic initiatives focusing on growth of the organization, such as the acquisition of Royal Financial. The acquisition of RYFL is\ndiscussed in Note 2 of the financial statements.\nIncome tax expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021, totaled $1.4 million, compared to income tax expense of $2.8 for the year\nended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $1.4 million (49.0%). The combined effective federal and state tax rates for the Bancorp was 8.6% for\nthe year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 14.8% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Bancorp’s lower current period effective\ntax rate is a result of a greater increase to tax preferred income relative to earnings.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nCritical accounting policies are those accounting policies that management believes are most important to the portrayal of the Bancorp’s\nfinancial condition and that require management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. The Bancorp’s most critical accounting\npolicies are summarized below. Other accounting policies, including those related to the fair values of financial instruments and the status of\ncontingencies, are summarized in Note 1 to the Bancorp’s consolidated financial statements.\nValuation of Investment Securities – The fair values of securities available for sale are determined on a recurring basis by obtaining quoted\nprices on nationally recognized securities exchanges or pricing models utilizing significant observable inputs such as matrix pricing, which is a\nmathematical technique widely used in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities\nbut rather by relying on the securities’ relationship to other benchmark quoted securities. Different judgments and assumptions used in pricing\ncould result in different estimates of value. In certain cases where market data is not readily available because of lack of market activity or little\npublic disclosure, values may be based on unobservable inputs and classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\nAt the end of each reporting period securities held in the investment portfolio are evaluated on an individual security level for other-than-\ntemporary impairment in accordance with the Investments – Debt and Equity Securities Topic of the Accounting Standards Codification.\nSignificant judgments are required in determining impairment, which include making assumptions regarding the estimated prepayments, loss\nassumptions and the change in interest rates.\nPage 56 of 108\nWe consider the following factors when determining an other-than-temporary impairment for a security: The length of time and the extent to\nwhich the market value has been less than amortized cost; the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; the underlying\nfundamentals of the relevant market and the outlook for such market for the near future; and an assessment of whether the Bancorp has (1) the\nintent to sell the debt securities or (2) more likely than not will be required to sell the debt securities before its anticipated market recovery. If\neither of these conditions is met, management will recognize other-than-temporary impairment. If, in management’s judgment, an other-than-\ntemporary impairment exists, the cost basis of the security will be written down for the credit loss, and the unrealized loss will be transferred from\naccumulated other comprehensive loss as an immediate reduction of current earnings. Management will utilize an independent valuation\nspecialist to value securities semi-annually for other-than-temporary impairment.\nAllowance for Loan Losses – The Bancorp maintains an Allowance for Loan Losses (“ALL”) to absorb probable incurred credit losses that\narise from the loan portfolio. The ALL is increased by the provision for loan losses, and decreased by charge-offs net of recoveries. The\ndetermination of the amounts of the ALL and provisions for loan losses is based upon management’s current judgments about the credit quality\nof the loan portfolio with consideration given to all known relevant internal and external factors that affect loan collectability. The methodology\nused to determine the current year provision and the overall adequacy of the ALL includes a disciplined and consistently applied quarterly\nprocess that combines a review of the current position with a risk assessment worksheet. Factors that are taken into consideration in the\nanalysis include an assessment of national and local economic trends, a review of current year loan portfolio growth and changes in portfolio\nmix, and an assessment of trends for loan delinquencies and loan charge-off activity. Particular attention is given to non-accruing loans and\naccruing loans past due 90 days or more, and loans that have been classified as substandard, doubtful, or loss. Changes in the provision are\ndirectionally consistent with changes in observable data.\nCommercial and industrial, and commercial real estate loans that exhibit credit weaknesses and loans that have been classified as impaired\nare subject to an individual review. Where appropriate, ALL allocations are made to these loans based on management’s assessment of financial\nposition, current cash flows, collateral values, financial strength of guarantors, industry trends, and economic conditions. ALL allocations for\nhomogeneous loans, such as residential mortgage loans and consumer loans, are based on historical charge-off activity and current delinquency\ntrends. Management has allocated general reserves to both performing and non-performing loans based on historical data and current\ninformation available.\nRisk factors for non-performing and internally classified loans are based on an analysis of either the projected discounted cash flows or the\nestimated collateral liquidation value for individual loans defined as substandard or doubtful. Estimated collateral liquidation values are based on\nestablished loan underwriting standards and adjusted for current mitigating factors on a loan-by-loan basis. Aggregate substandard loan\ncollateral deficiencies are determined for residential, commercial real estate, commercial business, and consumer loan portfolios. These\ndeficiencies are then stated as a percentage of the total substandard balances to determine the appropriate risk factors.\nRisk factors for performing and non-classified loans are based on a weighted average of net charge-offs for the most recent three years,\nwhich are then stated as a percentage of average loans for the same period. Historical risk factors are calculated for residential, commercial real\nestate, commercial business, and consumer loans. The three year weighted average historical factors are then adjusted for current subjective\nrisks attributable to: regional and national economic factors; loan growth and changes in loan composition; organizational structure; composition\nof loan staff; loan concentrations; policy changes and out of market lending activity.\nThe risk factors are applied to these types of loans to determine the appropriate level for the ALL. Adjustments may be made to these\nallocations that reflect management’s judgment on current conditions, delinquency trends, and charge-off activity. Based on the above\ndiscussion, management believes that the ALL is currently adequate, but not excessive, given the risk inherent in the loan portfolio.\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars,\nwithout considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary assets and liabilities of the\nBancorp are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on the Bancorp’s performance than the effects of\ngeneral levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or magnitude as the prices of goods and services.\nItem 7A.

Financial Statements\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders, Board of Directors and Audit Committee\nFinward Bancorp\nMunster, Indiana\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Finward Bancorp (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2021, the related\nconsolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the year ended December 31,\n2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred\nto above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021, and the results of its operations\nand its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s\nfinancial statements based on our audit.\nWe are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to\nbe independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain\nreasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audit\nincluded performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and\nperforming procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by\nmanagement, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for\nour opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated\nor required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements\nand (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any\nway our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing\nseparate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nPage 58 of 108\nAllowances for Loan Losses\nDescription of the Matter\nAs described in Note 4 to the financial statements, the Company’s loan portfolio totaled $966.7 million and associated allowance for loan losses\n(ALLL) was $13.3 million at December 31, 2021. The Company also describes in Note 1 of the financial statements the accounting policy around\nthis estimate. The ALLL is an estimate of losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. The determination of the reserve requires significant\njudgment reflecting the Company’s best estimate of probable loan losses. The estimate consists of several key elements, which include: specific\nreserves for impaired loans, general reserves for each business lending division portfolio including percentage allocations for special attention\nloans not deemed impaired, and reserves for pooled homogenous loans, among others. The Company’s evaluation is based upon a continuing\nreview of these portfolios, estimates of customer performance, collateral values and dispositions, and assessments of economic and geopolitical\nevents, all of which are subject to judgment and change.\nWe identified the valuation of the ALLL as a critical audit matter. Auditing the ALLL involves a high degree of subjectivity in evaluating\nmanagement’s estimates, such as evaluating management’s assessment of economic conditions and other environmental factors used to adjust\nhistorical loss rates, evaluating the adequacy of specific reserves associated with impaired loans and assessing the appropriateness of loan\ngrades.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the estimated allowance for loan losses included:\n● Testing the design of internal controls, including those related to technology, over the ALLL including data completeness and accuracy,\nclassifications of loans by loan segment, historical loss data, the calculation of a loss rate, the establishment of qualitative adjustments,\ngrading and risk classification of loans and establishment of specific reserves on impaired loans and management’s review controls over\nthe ALLL balance.\n● Testing clerical and computational accuracy of the formulas within the ALLL model.\n● Testing the completeness and accuracy of the information and reports utilized in the ALLL, including reports used in management review\ncontrols over the ALLL.\n● Evaluating the qualitative adjustments to the historical loss rates, including assessing the basis for the adjustments and the\nreasonableness of the significant assumptions.\n● Testing of the loan review function and the accuracy of loan grades determined. Specifically, utilizing internal and external loan grading\nprofessionals to assist us in evaluating the appropriateness of loan grades and to assess the reasonableness of specific impairments on\nloans.\n● Evaluating the overall reasonableness of qualitative factors and the appropriateness of their direction and magnitude, compared to\nprevious years and the Company’s support for the direction and magnitude of the change.\n/s/ BKD, \u0000\u0000\u0000\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2021.\nIndianapolis, Indiana\nMarch 30, 2022\nPage 59 of 108\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nFinward Bancorp and Subsidiaries\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Finward Bancorp (formerly known as NorthWest Indiana Bancorp) and\nSubsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020; the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders'\nequity, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020; and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial\nstatements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position\nof the Company as of December 31, 2020 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020, in\nconformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the\nCompany’s consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company\nAccounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the\nU.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain\nreasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The\nCompany is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit we\nare required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the\neffectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to\nerror or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding\nthe amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe\nthat our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ Plante Moran, PLLC\nWe served as the Company’s auditor from 2009 to 2021.\nChicago, Illinois\nMarch 22, 2021\nPage 60 of 108\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nDecember 31,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2021 2020\nASSETS\nCash and non-interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions $ 12,725 $ 14,014\nInterest bearing deposits in other financial institutions 19,987 5,908\nFederal funds sold 464 -\nTotal cash and cash equivalents 33,176 19,922\nCertificates of deposit in other financial institutions 1,709 1,897\nSecurities available-for-sale 526,889 410,669\nLoans held-for-sale 4,987 11,329\nLoans receivable, net of deferred fees and costs 966,720 965,146\nLess: allowance for loan losses (13,343) (12,458)\nNet loans receivable 953,377 952,688\nFederal Home Loan Bank stock 3,247 3,918\nAccrued interest receivable 5,444 4,713\nPremises and equipment 31,385 30,785\nForeclosed real estate -

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation – The consolidated financial statements include Finward Bancorp (the “Bancorp” or “Finward”), its wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries NWIN Risk Management, Inc. (a captive insurance subsidiary) and Peoples Bank (the “Bank”), and the Bank’s wholly owned\nsubsidiaries, Peoples Service Corporation, NWIN, LLC, NWIN Funding, Incorporated, and Columbia Development Company, LLC. The\nBancorp’s business activities include being a holding company for the Bank as well as a holding company for NWIN Risk Management, Inc. The\nBancorp’s earnings are dependent upon the earnings of the Bank. Peoples Service Corporation provides insurance and annuity investments to\nthe Bank’s wealth management customers. NWIN, LLC is located in Las Vegas, Nevada and serves as the Bank’s investment subsidiary and\nparent of a real estate investment trust, NWIN Funding, Inc. NWIN Funding, Inc. was formed as an Indiana Real Estate Investment Trust. The\nformation of NWIN Funding, Inc. provides the Bancorp with a vehicle that may be used to raise capital utilizing portfolio mortgages as collateral,\nwithout diluting stock ownership. In addition, NWIN Funding, Inc. receives favorable state tax treatment for income generated by its operations.\nColumbia Development Company is a limited liability company that serves to hold certain real estate properties that are acquired through\nforeclosure. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates – Preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosure of\ncontingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting\nperiod, as well as the disclosures provided. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates associated with the allowance for loan\nlosses are particularly susceptible to material change in the near term.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk – The Bancorp grants residential, commercial real estate, commercial business and installment loans to\ncustomers primarily in Lake County, in northwest Indiana, and Cook County, in northeast Illinois. The Bancorp is also an active lender in Porter\nCounty, and to a lesser extent, LaPorte, Newton and Jasper counties in Indiana; and DuPage, Lake, and Will counties in Illinois. Substantially all\nloans are secured by specific items of collateral including residences, commercial real estate, land development, business assets and consumer\nassets.\nCash Flow Reporting – For purposes of the statements of cash flows, the Bancorp considers cash on hand, noninterest bearing deposits in\nother financial institutions, all interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions with original maturities of 90 days or less, and federal funds\nsold to be cash and cash equivalents. The Bancorp reports net cash flows for customer loan and deposit transactions and short-term borrowings\nwith maturities of 90 days or less.\nCertificates of deposits in other financial institutions – Certificates of deposits in other financial institutions generally mature within 5 years\nand are carried at cost.\nSecurities – The Bancorp classifies securities into held-to-maturity, available-for-sale, or trading categories. Held-to-maturity securities are\nthose which management has the positive intent and the Bancorp has the ability to hold to maturity, and are reported at amortized cost.\nAvailable-for-sale securities are those the Bancorp may decide to sell if needed for liquidity, asset-liability management or other reasons.\nAvailable-for-sale securities are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in other comprehensive income, net of tax. At\nDecember 31, 2021, and 2020, all of the Bancorp’s securities were classified as available-for-sale. The Bancorp does not have a held to maturity\nor trading portfolio. Realized gains and losses resulting from the sale of securities recorded on the trade date are computed by the specific\nidentification method. Interest and dividend income, adjusted by amortization of premiums or discounts on a level yield method, are included in\nearnings. Securities are reviewed for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis.\nPage 65 of 108\nThe Bancorp considers the following factors when determining an other-than-temporary impairment for a security: the length of time and the\nextent to which the market value has been less than amortized cost; the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; the underlying\nfundamentals of the relevant market and the outlook for such market for the near future; and an assessment of whether the Bancorp has (1) the\nintent to sell the debt security or (2) it is more likely than not that the Bancorp will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated\nmarket recovery. If either of these conditions are met, management will recognize other-than-temporary impairment. If, in management’s\njudgment, an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the cost basis of the security will be written down for the credit loss, and the unrealized\ncredit loss will be transferred from accumulated other comprehensive loss as an immediate reduction of current earnings.\nLoans Held-for-Sale – Mortgage loans originated and intended for sale in the secondary market are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or\nfair value, as determined by outstanding commitments from investors. Net unrealized losses, if any, are recorded as a valuation allowance and\ncharged to earnings.\nMortgage loans held-for-sale can be sold with servicing rights retained or released. The carrying value of mortgage loans sold is reduced by\nthe amount allocated to the servicing rights. Gains and losses on sales of mortgage loans are based on the difference between the selling price\nand the carrying value of the related loan sold.\nLoans and Loan Interest Income – Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or\npayoff are reported at the principal balance outstanding, net of unearned interest, and net deferred loan fees and costs. Interest income is\naccrued on the unpaid principal balance. Loan origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, are deferred and recognized in interest\nincome using the level‑yield method without anticipating prepayments.\nThe accrual of interest income on mortgage and commercial loans is discontinued at the time the loan is 90 days delinquent unless the loan is\nwell-secured and in process of collection. Consumer loans are typically charged-off no later than when they reach 120 days past due. Past due\nstatus is based on the contractual terms of the loan. In all cases, loans are placed on non-accrual or charged-off status at an earlier date if\ncollection of principal or interest is considered doubtful.\nGenerally, interest accrued but not received for loans placed on non-accrual status is reversed against interest income. Interest received on\nsuch loans is accounted for on the cash-basis or cost‑recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual. Loans are returned to accrual status\nwhen all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.\nAllowance for Loan Losses – The allowance for loan losses (“allowance”) is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit losses. Loan\nlosses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries,\nif any, are credited to the allowance. Management estimates the allowance balance required using past loan loss experience, the nature and\nvolume of the portfolio, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, economic conditions, and other factors.\nAllocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans, but the entire allowance is available for any loan that, in management’s judgment,\nshould be charged‑off.\nA loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Bancorp will be unable to collect the\nscheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by\nmanagement in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest\npayments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired.\nManagement determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case by case basis, taking into consideration all of the\ncircumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower’s prior payment\nrecord, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis by either\nthe present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, the loan’s obtainable market price, or the fair\nvalue of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. Large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are normally collectively evaluated\nfor impairment, unless part of a larger relationship or a trouble debt restructuring.\nTroubled Debt Restructures – A troubled debt restructuring of a loan is undertaken to improve the likelihood that the loan will be repaid in full\nunder the modified terms in accordance with a reasonable repayment schedule. All modified loans are evaluated to determine whether the loan\nshould be reported as a troubled debt restructure (TDR). A loan is a TDR when the Bancorp, for economic or legal reasons related to the\nborrower's financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower by modifying or renewing a loan under terms that the Bancorp would not\notherwise consider. To make this determination, the Bancorp must determine whether (a) the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and\n(b) the Bancorp granted the borrower a concession. This determination requires consideration of all of the facts and circumstances surrounding\nthe modification. An overall general decline in the economy or some level of deterioration in a borrower's financial condition does not inherently\nmean the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties.\nPage 66 of 108\nOn March 27, 2020, the President of the United States signed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”),\nwhich provides entities with optional temporary relief from certain accounting and financial reporting requirements under U.S. GAAP. Section\n4013 of the CARES Act allows financial institutions to suspend application of certain TDR accounting guidance for loan and lease modifications\nrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic made between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of December 31, 2021 or 60 days after the end of the COVID-\n19 national emergency, provided certain criteria are met. Section 4013 of the CARES Act was amended on December 27, 2020 to extend this\nrelief until January 1, 2022. The relief can be applied to loan and lease modifications for borrowers that were not more than 30 days past due as\nof December 31, 2020 and to loan and lease modifications that defer or delay the payment of principal or interest, or change the interest rate on\nthe loan. The Company chose to apply this relief to eligible loan and lease modifications. At December 31, 2021, loan and lease modification\nbalances related to the COVID-19 pandemic were $927 thousand.\nSome of the factors considered by management when determining whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties are: (1) is the\nborrower currently in default on any of its debts, (2) has the borrower declared or is the borrower in the process of declaring bankruptcy, and (3)\nabsent the current modification, the borrower would likely default.\nFederal Home Loan Bank Stock – The Bank is a member of the FHLB system. Members are required to own a certain amount of stock\nbased on the level of borrowings and other factors, and may invest in additional amounts. FHLB stock is carried at cost, classified as a restricted\nsecurity, and periodically evaluated for impairment based on ultimate recovery of par value. Both cash and stock dividends are reported as\nincome.\nTransfers of Financial Assets – Transfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when control over the assets has been surrendered.\nControl over transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when (1) the assets have been isolated from the Bancorp, (2) the transferee\nobtains the right (free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of the right) to pledge or exchange the transferred assets, and (3) the\nBancorp does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity.\nPremises and Equipment – Land is carried at cost. Premises and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Premises\nand related components are depreciated using the straight-line method with useful lives ranging from 15 to 39 years. Furniture and equipment\nare depreciated using the straight-line method with useful lives ranging from 2 to 10 years.\nForeclosed Real Estate – Assets acquired through or instead of loan foreclosure are initially recorded at fair value less estimated costs to\nsell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis. If fair value declines subsequent to foreclosure, a valuation allowance is recorded through\nexpense. Operating costs after acquisition are expensed.\nLong-term Assets – Premises and equipment and other long-term assets are reviewed for impairment when events indicate their carrying\namount may not be recoverable from future undiscounted cash flows. If impaired, the assets are recorded at fair value.\nBank Owned Life Insurance – The Bancorp has purchased life insurance policies on certain key executives. In accordance with accounting\nfor split-dollar life insurance, Bank owned life insurance is recorded at the amount that can be realized under the insurance contract at the\nbalance sheet date, which is the cash surrender value adjusted for other charges or other amounts due that are probable at settlement.\nPage 67 of 108\nGoodwill and Intangibles – The Bancorp records the assets acquired, including identified intangible assets, and the liabilities assumed in\nacquisitions at their fair values. These fair values often involve estimates based on third-party valuations, such as appraisals, or internal\nvaluations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques that may include estimates of attrition, inflation, asset growth\nrates or other relevant factors. In addition, the determination of the useful lives over which an intangible asset will be amortized is subjective.\nUnder the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 350, goodwill and indefinite-lived assets\nrecorded are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis, as well as on an interim basis if events or changes indicate that the asset might be\nimpaired. An impairment loss is recognized for any excess of carrying value over fair value of the goodwill or the indefinite-lived intangible asset.\nRepurchase Agreements – Substantially, all repurchase agreement liabilities represent amounts advanced by various customers that are not\ncovered by federal deposit insurance and are secured by securities owned by the Bancorp.\nIncome Taxes – Income tax expense is the total of the current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and\nliabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary differences between carrying amounts and tax\nbasis of assets and liabilities, computed using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces deferred tax assets to the amount\nexpected to be realized.\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Bancorp evaluated tax positions taken for filing with the Internal Revenue Service and all state\njurisdictions in which it operates. The Bancorp believes that income tax filing positions will be sustained under examination and does not\nanticipate any adjustments that would result in a material adverse effect on the Bancorp's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nAccordingly, the Bancorp has not recorded any reserves or related accruals for interest and penalties for uncertain tax positions at December 31,\n2021 and 2020.\nLoan Commitments and Related Financial Instruments – Financial instruments include off-balance sheet credit instruments, such as\ncommitments to make loans and standby letters of credit, issued to meet customer financing needs. The face amount for these items represents\nthe exposure to loss, before considering customer collateral or ability to repay. Such financial instruments are recorded when they are funded.\nAs part of mortgage banking operations, the Company enters into commitments to originate loans whereby the interest rate on these loans is\ndetermined prior to funding (“interest rate lock commitments”). Similar to loans held for sale, the fair value of rate lock commitments is subject to\nchange primarily due to changes in interest rates. The interest rate lock commitments on mortgage loans intended to be sold are recorded at fair\nvalue with changes in fair value recorded in current earnings as part of gain on sale of loans held-for-sale, net.\nEarnings Per Common Share – Basic earnings per common share is net income divided by the weighted-average number of common\nshares outstanding during the period. The restricted shares issued provide for dividend and voting rights and are therefore considered\nparticipating securities. Accordingly, all restricted stock is included in basic earnings per share.\nComprehensive Income – Comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income\nincludes unrealized gains and losses on securities available-for-sale.\nLoss Contingencies – Loss contingencies, including claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business, are recorded as\nliabilities when the likelihood of loss is probable and an amount or range of loss can be reasonably estimated. Management does not believe\nsuch matters currently exist that will have a material effect on the financial statements.\nRestrictions on Cash –– As of March 26, 2020, the Federal Reserve Bank eliminated reserve requirements for certain depository institutions,\nincluding the Bank. As such, there was no reserve requirement at December 31, 2021. As part of derivative contracts entered into by the\nBancorp, $3.9 million was pledged as collateral at December 31, 2021 and 2020. These balances are included in interest bearing deposits. At\nDecember 31, 2021, the Company’s correspondent cash accounts exceeded federally insured limits by $7.1 million. Additionally, the Company\nhad approximately $13.0 million of cash held by the FRB and the FHLB, which is not federally insured.\nPage 68 of 108\nFair Value of Financial Instruments – Fair values of financial instruments are estimated using relevant market information and other\nassumptions, as more fully disclosed in a separate note. Fair value estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment regarding\ninterest rates, credit risk, prepayments and other factors, especially in the absence of broad markets for particular instruments. Changes in\nassumptions or in market conditions could significantly affect the estimates.\nOperating Segments – While the Bancorp's executive management monitors the revenue streams of the various products and services, the\nidentifiable segments are not material and operations are managed and financial performance is evaluated on a company-wide basis.\nAccordingly, all of the Bancorp's financial service operations are considered by management to be aggregated in one reportable operating\nsegment.\nReclassification – Certain amounts appearing in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31,\n2020, may have been reclassified to conform to the December 31, 2021 presentation.\nTrust Assets – Assets of the Bancorp’s wealth management department, other than cash on deposit at the Bancorp, are not included in these\nconsolidated financial statements because they are not assets of the Bancorp.\nAdoption of New Accounting Pronouncements –\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.\nThis Standard simplifies the manner in which an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill\nimpairment test. Step 2 measures a goodwill impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying\namount of that goodwill. In computing the implied fair value of goodwill under Step 2, an entity, prior to the amendments in ASU No. 2017-04,\nhad to perform procedures to determine the fair value at the impairment testing date of its assets and liabilities, including unrecognized assets\nand liabilities, in accordance with the procedure that would be required in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in\na business combination. However, under the amendments in this ASU, an entity should (1) perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test\nby comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, and (2) recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the\ncarrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, with the understanding that the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of\ngoodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Additionally, ASU No. 2017-04 removes the requirements for any reporting unit with a zero or negative\ncarrying amount to perform a qualitative assessment and, if it fails such qualitative test, to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. Finally,\nthis ASU amends the Overview and Background sections of the Accounting Standards Codification as part of the FASB’s initiative to unify and\nimprove such sections across Topics and Subtopics. The new guidance was effective for the Bancorp’s year ending December 31, 2020, and\nwas adopted on January 1, 2020. The adoption of this ASU has not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements, and the\nBancorp has not recorded goodwill impairment to date as part of their acquisition activity.\nOn January 1, 2020, the Bancorp adopted the provision of ASU 2018–13, which modifies the disclosure requirements on fair value\nmeasurements. The amendment removes certain disclosures required by Topic 820 related to transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair\nvalue hierarchy; the policy for timing of transfers between levels; and the valuation processes for Level 3 fair value measurements. The update\nalso adds certain disclosure requirements related to changes in unrealized gains and losses for the period included in other comprehensive\nincome for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements held at the end of the reporting period and the range and weighted average of significant\nunobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements. For certain unobservable inputs, the Bancorp may disclose other\nquantitative information in lieu of the weighted average if we determine that other quantitative information would be a more reasonable and\nrational method to reflect the distribution of unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements. The adoption of this new\nguidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12 which remove specific exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 in GAAP. It\neliminates the need for an organization to analyze whether the following apply in a given period: exception to the incremental approach for\nintraperiod tax allocation; exceptions to accounting for basis differences where there are ownership changes in foreign investments; and\nexception in interim period income tax accounting for year-to-date losses that exceed anticipated losses. It also improves financial statement\npreparers’ application of income tax-related guidance and simplifies GAAP for: franchise taxes that are partially based on income; transactions\nwith a government that result in a step up in the tax basis of goodwill; separate financial statements of legal entities that are not subject to tax;\nand enacts changes in tax laws in interim periods. The guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods\nwithin those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. Early adoption is permitted. The Bancorp adopted ASU 2019-12 on January 1,\n2021 and it did not have a material impact on its accounting and disclosures.\nPage 69 of 108\nUpcoming Accounting Pronouncements -\nIn June 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.\nThe ASU includes increased disclosures and various changes to the accounting and measurement of financial assets including the Bancorp’s\nloans and available-for-sale debt securities. Each financial asset presented on the balance sheet would have a unique allowance for credit\nlosses valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected\non the financial asset. The amendments in this ASU also eliminate the probable initial recognition threshold in current GAAP and instead, reflect\nan entity’s current estimate of all expected credit losses using reasonable and supportable forecasts. In October 2019, the FASB voted and\napproved proposed changes to the effective date of this ASU for smaller reporting companies, such as the Bancorp, and other non-SEC\nreporting entities. The approval changed the effective date of the ASU to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim\nperiods within those fiscal periods. The new credit loss guidance will be effective for the Bancorp's as of January 1, 2023. Upon adoption, the\nASU will be applied using a modified retrospective transition method to the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is\neffective. A prospective transition approach is required for debt securities for which an other-than-temporary impairment had been recognized\nbefore the effective date. Early adoption for all institutions is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim\nperiods within those fiscal years. Management is in the process of evaluating the impact adoption of this update will have on the Bancorp’s\nconsolidated financial statements. This process of evaluation has engaged multiple areas of the Bancorp’s management in discussing loss\nestimation methods and the application of these methods to specific segments of the loans receivable portfolio. Management has been actively\nmonitoring developments and evaluating the use of different methods allowed. Due to continuing development of understanding of application,\nadditional time is required to understand how this ASU will affect the Bancorp’s financial statements. Management plans on running parallel\ncalculations and finalizing a method or methods of adoption in time for the effective date.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04 “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on\nFinancial Reporting.” These amendments provide temporary optional guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate\nreform. The ASU provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contract modifications\nand hedging relationships, subject to meeting certain criteria, that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. It is\nintended to help stakeholders during the global market-wide reference rate transition period. In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01\nwhich clarifies that certain optional expedients and exceptions in Topic 848 for contract modifications and hedge accounting apply to derivatives\nthat are affected by the discounting transition. The guidance is effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020, through December 31, 2022. The\nBancorp is implementing a transition plan to identify and modify its loans and other financial instruments with attributes that are either directly or\nindirectly influenced by LIBOR. The Bancorp believes the adoption of this guidance on activities after December 31, 2020, through December\n31, 2022, will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nRevision of Previously Issued Financial Statements –.\nWe have revised amounts reported in previously issued financial statements for the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K\nrelated to immaterial errors discovered during the second quarter of 2021. The errors relate to certain deferred costs recognized related to our\nmanufactured home loan product, which resulted in increased assets and understatements of expense in prior periods.\nWe evaluated the aggregate effects of the errors to our previously issued financial statements in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletins\nNo. 99 and No. 108 and, based upon quantitative and qualitative factors, determined that the errors were not material to the previously issued\nfinancial statements and disclosures included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nPage 70 of 108\nThe following tables present the revisions to the line items of our previously issued financial statements as of and for the year ended December\n31, 2020, to reflect the correction of the errors:\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\n(Dollar amounts in thousands except for per\nshare amounts)\nAs of December 31, 2020 As Reported Adjustment As Revised\nLoans receivable $ 966,578 $ (1,432) $ 965,146\nNet loans receivable 954,120 (1,432) 952,688\nOther assets 13,681 199 13,880\nTotal assets 1,497,525 (1,233) 1,496,292\nRetained earnings 112,494 (1,233) 111,261\nTotal shareholders' equity 152,922 (1,233) 151,689\nTotal liabilities and stockholders' equity 1,497,525 (1,233) 1,496,292\nConsolidated Statement of Income\nFor the year ending December 31, 2020 As Reported Adjustment As Revised\nCompensation and benefits $ 22,065 $ 790 $ 22,855\nTotal noninterest expense 40,846 790 41,636\nIncome before income tax expense 19,496 (790) 18,706\nIncome tax expenses 2,892 (118) 2,774\nNet income 16,604 (672) 15,932\nEarnings per common share:\nBasic 4.80 (0.20) 4.60\nDiluted 4.80 (0.20) 4.60\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\nFor the year ending December 31, 2020 As Reported Adjustment As Revised\nNet income $ 16,604 $ (672) $ 15,932\nComprehensive income, net of tax 22,784 (672) 22,112\nConsolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders' Equity\nBalance at January 1, 2020 As Reported Adjustment As Revised\nRetained earnings $ 100,185 $ (561) $ 99,624\nTotal equity 134,103 (561) 133,542\nFor the year ending December 31, 2020\nNet income 16,604 (672) 15,932\nRetained earnings 112,494 (1,233) 111,261\nTotal equity 152,922 (1,233) 151,689\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nYear ended December 31, 2020 As Reported Adjustment As Revised\nNet income $ 16,604 $ (672) $ 15,932\nDeferred tax expense 690 (118) 572\nNet cash - operating activities 20,526 (790) 19,736\nNet change in loan (49,196) 790 (48,406)\nNet cash - investing activities (185,850) 790 (185,060)\nPage 71 of 108\nNOTE 2 – Acquisition Activity\nOn January 31, 2022, Finward Bancorp (“Finward”) completed its previously announced acquisition of Royal Financial, Inc., a Delaware\ncorporation (“RYFL”), pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated July 28, 2021 (the “Merger Agreement”) between Finward and RYFL.\nThe stockholders of both Finward and RYFL approved the Merger Agreement at the respective stockholder meetings of the companies held on\nDecember 13, 2021. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, RYFL merged with and into Finward, with Finward as the surviving corporation (the\n“Merger”), and Royal Savings Bank, an Illinois state chartered savings bank and wholly-owned subsidiary of RYFL, merged with and into\nPeoples Bank, the wholly-owned Indiana state chartered commercial bank subsidiary of Finward, with Peoples Bank as the surviving bank.\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement, RYFL stockholders who owned 101 or more shares of RYFL common stock were permitted to\nelect to receive either 0.4609 shares of Finward common stock or $20.14 in cash, or a combination of both, for each share of RYFL common\nstock owned, subject to proration and allocation provisions such that 65% of the shares of RYFL common stock outstanding immediately prior to\nthe closing of the merger were converted into the right to receive shares of Finward common stock and the remaining 35% of the outstanding\nRYFL shares were converted into the right to receive cash. Stockholders holding less than 101 shares of RYFL common stock received fixed\nconsideration of $20.14 in cash per share and no stock consideration. As a result of RYFL stockholder stock and cash elections and the related\nallocation and proration provisions of the merger agreement, Finward issued 795,423 shares of its common stock and paid cash consideration of\napproximately $18.7 million in the Merger. Based on the January 28, 2022 closing price of $47.75 per share of Finward common stock, the\ntransaction had an implied valuation of approximately $56.7 million.\nIn connection with the acquisition, Robert W. Youman, was appointed to the boards of directors of Finward and Peoples Bank effective as of\nthe closing of the Merger.\nRYFL had a home office and eight branch offices in Cook County, Illinois. As of December 31, 2021, RYFL reported total assets of $547.1\nmillion, total loans of $464.8 million, and total deposits of $480.9 million. The Bancorp is in the process of determining the fair value of assets\npurchased and liabilities assumed. As a result of the acquisition, the combined company has approximately $2.2 billion in total assets, $1.4\nbillion in total loans, and $1.9 billion in deposits. The acquisition has further expanded the Bank’s banking center network in Cook County, Illinois.\nPage 72 of 108\nNOTE 3 – Securities\nThe estimated fair value of available-for-sale securities and the related gross unrealized gains and losses recognized in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss) were as follows:\n(Dollars in thousands)\nGross Gross Estimated\nCost Unrealized Unrealized Fair\nBasis Gains Losses Value\nDecember 31, 2021\nU.S. government sponsored entities $ 8,883 $ - $ (214) $ 8,669\nU.S. treasury securities 400 - - 400\nCollateralized mortgage obligations and residential mortgage-\nbacked securities 187,279 961 (3,539) 184,701\nMunicipal securities 322,750 9,904 (527) 332,127\nCollateralized debt obligations 2,173 - (1,181) 992\nTotal securities available-for-sale $ 521,485 $ 10,865 $ (5,461) $ 526,889\n(Dollars in thousands)\nGross Gross Estimated\nCost Unrealized Unrealized Fair\nBasis Gains Losses Value\nDecember 31, 2020\nMoney market fund $ 52,941 $ - $ - $ 52,941\nU.S. government sponsored entities 7,881 3 (24) 7,860\nCollateralized mortgage obligations and residential mortgage-\nbacked securities 151,355 3,417 (36) 154,736\nMunicipal securities 183,103 11,102 (2) 194,203\nCollateralized debt obligations 2,182 - (1,253) 929\nTotal securities available-for-sale $ 397,462 $ 14,522 $ (1,315) $ 410,669\nThe cost basis, estimated fair value of available-for-sale securities, and carrying amount, if different, at December 31, 2021, by contractual\nmaturity were as follows.

The use and application of these grades by the Bancorp is uniform and conforms to regulatory definitions.\nDuring the year, the Bancorp updated its risk rating naming structure, however the underlying grading system has not changed. The loan grading\nsystem is as follows:\n1 – Superior Quality\nLoans in this category are substantially risk free. Loans fully collateralized by a Bank certificate of deposit or Bank deposits with a hold are\nsubstantially risk free.\n2 – Excellent Quality\nThe borrower generates excellent and consistent cash flow for debt coverage, excellent average credit scores, excellent liquidity and net worth\nand are reputable operators with over 15 years experience. Current and debt to tangible net worth ratios are excellent. Loan to value is\nsubstantially below policy and collateral condition is excellent.\n3 – Great Quality\nThe borrower generates more than sufficient cash flow to fund debt service and cash flow is improving. Average credit scores are very strong.\nOperators are reputable with significant years of experience. Liquidity, net worth, current and debt to tangible net worth ratios are very strong.\nLoan to value is significantly below policy and collateral condition is significantly above average.\n4 – Above Average Quality\nThe borrower generates more than sufficient cash flow to fund debt service but cash flow trends may be stable or slightly declining. Average\ncredit scores are strong. The borrower is a reputable operator with many years of experience. Liquidity, net worth, current and debt to tangible\nnet worth ratios are strong. Loan to value is below policy and collateral condition is above average.\n5 – Average Quality\nBorrowers are considered creditworthy and can repay the debt in the normal course of business, however, cash flow trends may be inconsistent\nor fluctuating. Average credit scores are satisfactory and years of experience is acceptable. Liquidity and net worth are satisfactory. Current and\ndebt to tangible net worth ratios are average. Loan to value is slightly below policy and the collateral condition is slightly above average.\n6 – Pass\nBorrowers are considered credit worthy but financial condition may show signs of weakness due to internal or external factors. Cash flow trends\nmay be declining annually. Average credit scores may be low but remain acceptable. Borrower has limited years of experience. Liquidity, net\nworth, current and debt to tangible net worth ratios are below average. Loan to value is nearing policy limits and collateral condition is average.\n7 – Special Mention\nA special mention asset has identified weaknesses that deserve Management’s close attention. If left uncorrected, these weaknesses may result\nin deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the institution’s credit position at some future date. Special mention assets are not\nadversely classified and do not expose an institution to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification. There is still adequate protection by the\ncurrent sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged. The Special Mention rating is viewed as transitional and will\nbe monitored closely.\nLoans in this category may exhibit some of the following risk factors. Cash flow trends may be consistently declining or may be questionable.\nDebt coverage ratios may be at or near 1:1. Average credit scores may be very weak or the borrower may have minimal years of experience.\nLiquidity, net worth, current and debt to tangible net worth ratios may be very weak. Loan to value may be at policy limits or may exceed policy\nlimits. Collateral condition may be below average.\n8 – Substandard\nThis classification consists of loans which are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the\ncollateral pledged. Financial statements normally reveal some or all of the following: poor trends, lack of earnings and cash flow, excessive debt,\nlack of liquidity, and the absence of creditor protection. Loans are still considered collectible, but due to increased risks and defined weaknesses\nof the credit, some loss could be incurred in collection if the deficiencies are not corrected.\nPage 79 of 108\n9 – Doubtful\nSuch loans have been placed on nonaccrual status and may be heavily dependent upon collateral possessing a value that is difficult to\ndetermine or based upon some near-term event which lacks clear certainty. These loans have all of the weaknesses of those classified as\nSubstandard; however, based on existing conditions, these weaknesses make full collection of the principal balance highly improbable.\n10 – Loss\nLoans that are considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuing to carry them as assets is not warranted.\nPerforming loans are loans that are paying as agreed and are approximately less than ninety days past due on payments of interest and\nprincipal.\nDuring the twelve months ending December 31, 2021, three residential real estate loans to three customer totaling $203 thousand were\nmodified to include deferral of principal or interest resulting in troubled debt restructuring classification. One commercial business loan totaling\n$601 thousand was provided a short-term renewal and a pending long term restructure resulting in troubled debt restructuring classification. One\nresidential real estate trouble debt restructuring loan totaling $37 thousand had subsequently defaulted during the twelve months ending\nDecember 31, 2021. During the twelve months ending December 31, 2020, one residential real estate loan totaling $108 thousand was a new\ntroubled debt restructuring loan. In addition, during 2020, one commercial real estate loan totaling $142 thousand, one residential loan totaling\n$50 thousand and one home equity loan totaling $22 thousand were renewed as a troubled debt restructuring. One residential real estate loan\ntotaling $108 thousand and one commercial business trouble debt restructuring loan totaling $275 thousand, had subsequently defaulted during\nthe periods presented. All of the loans classified as troubled debt restructurings are also considered impaired. The valuation basis for the\nBancorp’s troubled debt restructurings is based on the present value of cash flows, unless consistent cash flows are not present, then the fair\nvalue of the collateral securing the loan is the basis for valuation.\nPage 80 of 108\nThe Bancorp's individually evaluated impaired loans are summarized below:\nFor the twelve months ended\nAs of December 31, 2021 December 31, 2021\nUnpaid Average Interest\nRecorded Principal Related Recorded Income\n(Dollars in thousands) Investment Balance Allowance Investment Recognized\nWith no related allowance recorded:\nResidential real estate $ 1,683 $ 3,017 $ -

Goodwill is tested annually for impairment.\nGoodwill arising from business combinations represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible assets in the business acquired. The\nBancorp’s goodwill relates to the value inherent in the banking industry and that value is dependent upon the ability of the Bancorp to provide\nquality, cost effective banking services in a competitive marketplace. If the implied fair value of goodwill is lower than its carrying amount,\ngoodwill impairment is indicated and goodwill is written down to its implied fair value. There has not been any impairment of goodwill identified or\nrecorded.

The Bancorp also has a state tax credit carry forward of approximately $86 thousand which began to expire in 2017 and will continue\nto expire if not used. Management has concluded that the state net operating losses will be fully utilized and therefore no valuation allowance is\nnecessary on the state net operating loss. A valuation allowance remains in place on the state tax credit carryforward that is not expected to be\nutilized before expiration. A valuation allowance of $12 thousand and $22 thousand was provided at December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively,\nfor the state tax credits net of federal benefit.\nPage 86 of 108\nThe Bancorp acquired $3.3 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards and $7.2 million of Illinois net operating loss carryforwards with\nthe acquisition of First Personal Financial Corp during 2018 of which $2.2 million of the federal losses expire in years ranging from 2028 to 2035,\n$1.1 million of the federal losses do not expire, and the Illinois losses expire in years ranging from 2019 to 2031. Under Section 382 of the\nInternal Revenue Code, the annual limitation on the use of the federal losses is $362 thousand for First Personal while there is no limitation on\nthe use of the Illinois losses. Management has determined that all of the losses are more likely than not to be utilized before expiration.\nThe Bancorp acquired $7.2 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards and $11.4 million of Illinois net operating loss carryforwards\nwith the acquisition of AJS Bancorp Inc. during 2019 of which $3.6 million of the federal losses expire in years ranging from 2030 to 2037, $3.6\nmillion of the federal losses do not expire, and the Illinois losses expire in years ranging from 2020 to 2031. Under Section 382 of the Internal\nRevenue Code, the annual limitation on the use of the federal losses is $834 thousand for AJS, while there is no limitation on the use of the\nIllinois losses. Management has determined that all of the losses are more likely than not to be utilized before expiration.\nAt December 31, 2021 $6.9 million of the federal loss carryforwards and $10.4 million of the Illinois loss carryforward remain; the benefit of\nwhich is reflected in deferred tax assets.\nThe Bancorp qualified under provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, to deduct from taxable income a provision for bad debts in excess of\nthe provision for such losses charged to income in the financial statements, if any. Accordingly, retained earnings at December 31, 2021, and\n2020, includes, approximately $8.4 million for which no provision for federal income taxes has been made. If, in the future this portion of retained\nearnings is used for any purpose other than to absorb bad debt losses, federal income taxes would be imposed at the then applicable rate. The\nunrecorded deferred income tax liability on the above amounts was approximately $2.2 million at both December 31, 2021, and 2020.\nThe Bancorp had no unrecognized tax benefits at any time during 2021 or 2020 and does not anticipate any significant increase or decrease\nin unrecognized tax benefits during 2021. Should the accrual of any interest or penalties relative to unrecognized tax benefits be necessary, it is\nthe Bancorp's policy to record such accruals through income tax accounts; no such accruals existed at any time during 2021 or 2020.\nThe Bancorp and its subsidiaries are subject to US Federal income tax as well as income tax of the states of Indiana and Illinois. The\nBancorp is no longer subject to examination by taxing authorities for the years before 2018.\nNote 9 – Deposits\nThe aggregate amount of certificates of deposit with a balance of $250 thousand or more was approximately $36.9 million at December 31,\n2021 and $46.7 million at December 31, 2020.\nAt December 31, 2021, scheduled maturities of certificates of deposit were as follows:\n(Dollars in\nthousands)\n2022 $ 198,727\n2023 31,573\n2024 7,772\n2025 1,135\n2026 10\nTotal $ 239,217\nPage 87 of 108\nThe Bancorp’s end-of-period deposit portfolio balances were as follows:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2021 2020\nBalance Balance\nChecking $ 629,038 $ 516,487\nSavings 293,976 254,108\nMoney market 271,970 246,916\nCertificates of deposit 239,217 284,828\nTotal deposits $ 1,434,201 $ 1,302,339\nNote 10 – Borrowed Funds\nAt December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, borrowed funds are summarized below:\n(Dollars in thousands)\n2021 2020\nFixed rate advances from the FHLB $ - $ 6,000\nOther - 149\nTotal $ - $ 6,149\nRepurchase agreements generally mature within one year and are secured by U.S. government and U.S. agency securities, under the\nBancorp’s control. At December 31, information concerning these retail repurchase agreements is summarized below:\n(Dollars in thousands)\n2020 2019\nEnding balance $ 14,581 $ 13,711\nAverage balance during the year 17,789 16,975\nMaximum month-end balance during the year 24,514 21,100\nSecurities underlying the agreements at year end:\nCarrying value 14,885 23,860\nFair value 14,885 23,860\nAverage interest rate during the year 0.26% 0.58%\nAverage interest rate at year end 0.26% 0.32%\nAt December 31, advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank were as follows:\n(Dollars in thousands)\n2020 2019\nFixed rate advances, none oustanding as of year ended 2021; average rate: 2021 –\nN/A; 2020 – 2.66% $ - $ 6,000\nFixed rate advances are payable at maturity, with a prepayment penalty. The advances were collateralized by mortgage loans with a carrying\nvalue totaling approximately $506.4 million at December 31, 2021. In addition to the fixed rate advances, the Bancorp maintains a $25.0 million\nline of credit with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis. The Bancorp did not have a balance on the line of credit at December 31, 2021\nor December 31, 2020. The Bancorp did not have other borrowings at December 31, 2021, as of December 31, 2020, the Bancorp had\noutstanding federal funds purchased of $149 thousand.\nPage 88 of 108\nNote 11 – Employees’ Benefit Plans\nThe Bancorp maintains an Employees’ Savings and Profit Sharing Plan and Trust for all employees who meet the plan qualifications.\nEmployees are eligible to participate in the Employees’ Savings and Profit Sharing Plan and Trust on the next January 1 or July 1 following the\ncompletion of one year of employment, attaining age 18, and completion of 1,000 hours of service. The Employees’ Savings Plan feature allows\nemployees to make pre-tax contributions to the Employees’ Savings Plan of 1% to 50% of Plan Salary, subject to limitations imposed by Internal\nRevenue Code section 401(k). Employees are able to begin deferring effective the first of the month following 90 days of employment. The Profit\nSharing Plan and Trust feature is non-contributory on the part of the employee. Contributions to the Employees’ Profit Sharing Plan and Trust are\nmade at the discretion of the Bancorp’s Board of Directors. Contributions for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were based on 3%\nand 6.5% of the participants’ total compensation, excluding incentives, respectively. Profit sharing contributions made by the Bank and earnings\ncredited to the employee’s account vest on the following schedule: two years of service, 40% of contributions and earnings; three years of\nservice, 60% of contributions and earnings; four years of service, 80% of contributions and earnings; and five years of service, 100% of\ncontributions and earnings. Participants also become 100% vested in the employer contributions and accrued earnings in their account upon\ntheir death, approved disability, or attainment of age 65 while employed at the Bank. The benefit plan expense amounted to approximately $439\nthousand for 2021 and $948 thousand for 2020.\nThe Bancorp maintains an Unqualified Deferred Compensation Plan (the “UDC Plan”). The purpose of the UDC Plan is to provide deferred\ncompensation to key senior management employees of the Bancorp in order to recognize their substantial contributions to the Bank and provide\nthem with additional financial security as inducement to remain with the Bank. The Compensation Committee selects which persons shall be\nparticipants in the UDC Plan. Participants’ accounts are credited each year with an amount based on a formula involving the participant’s\nemployer funded contributions under all qualified plans and the limitations imposed by Internal Revenue Code subsection 401(a)(17) and Code\nsection 415. The unqualified deferred compensation plan liability at December 31, 2021 and 2020 was approximately $242 thousand and $235\nthousand, respectively. The UDC Plan expense amounted to approximately $3 thousand for 2021 and $8 thousand for 2020.\nDirectors have deferred some of their fees in consideration of future payments. Fee deferrals, including interest, totaled approximately $74\nthousand and $68 thousand for 2021 and 2020, respectively. The deferred fee liability at December 31, 2021 and 2020 was approximately $1.4\nmillion.\nNote 12 – Regulatory Capital\nThe Bancorp and Bank are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Capital adequacy\nguidelines and prompt corrective action regulations involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items\ncalculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators.\nFailure to meet various capital requirements can initiate regulatory action. Prompt corrective action regulations provide five classifications,\nincluding well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized, although these\nterms are not used to represent overall financial condition. If adequately capitalized, regulatory approval is required to accept brokered deposits.\nIf undercapitalized, capital distributions are limited, as is asset growth and expansion, and capital restoration plans are required. At December\n31, 2021 and 2020, the most recent regulatory notifications categorized the Bancorp and Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory\nframework for prompt corrective action. There are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the\nBancorp’s or the Bank’s category.\nIn addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions by the institution and certain\ndiscretionary bonus payments to management if an institution does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity\nTier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements.\nPage 89 of 108\nIn addition, the following table shows that, at December 31, 2021, and 2020, the Bank’s capital exceeded all applicable regulatory capital\nrequirements. The dollar amounts are in millions.\n(Dollars in millions) Minimum Required To Be\nMinimum Required For Well Capitalized Under Prompt\nActual Capital Adequacy Purposes Corrective Action Regulations\nAt December 31, 2021 Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio\nCommon equity tier 1 capital to risk-\nweighted assets $ 133.7 12.6% $ 47.8 4.5% $ 69.0 6.5%\nTier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets $ 133.7 12.6% $ 63.7 6.0% $ 85.0 8.0%\nTotal capital to risk-weighted assets $ 147.0 13.9% $ 85.0 8.0% $ 106.2 10.0%\nTier 1 capital to adjusted average\nassets $ 133.7 8.4% $ 64.1 4.0% $ 80.1 5.0%\n(Dollars in millions) Minimum Required To Be\nMinimum Required For Well Capitalized Under Prompt\nActual Capital Adequacy Purposes Corrective Action Regulations\nAt December 31, 2020 Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio\nCommon equity tier 1 capital to risk-\nweighted assets $ 122.0 12.6% $ 43.8 4.5% $ 63.2 6.5%\nTier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets $ 122.0 12.6% $ 58.4 6.0% $ 77.8 8.0%\nTotal capital to risk-weighted assets $ 134.2 13.8% $ 77.8 8.0% $ 97.3 10.0%\nTier 1 capital to adjusted average\nassets $ 122.0 8.3% $ 59.1 4.0% $ 73.9 5.0%\nThe Bancorp’s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is entirely dependent upon the Bank’s ability to pay dividends to the Bancorp.\nUnder Indiana law, the Bank may pay dividends from its undivided profits (generally, earnings less losses, bad debts, taxes and other operating\nexpenses) as is considered expedient by the Bank’s Board of Directors. However, the Bank must obtain the approval of the Indiana Department\nof Financial Institutions (DFI) if the total of all dividends declared by the Bank during the current year, including the proposed dividend, would\nexceed the sum of retained net income for the year to date plus its retained net income for the previous two years. For this purpose, “retained\nnet income,” means net income as calculated for call report purposes, less all dividends declared for the applicable period. An exemption from\nDFI approval would require that the Bank have been assigned a composite uniform financial institutions rating of 1 or 2 as a result of the most\nrecent federal or state examination; the proposed dividend would not result in a Tier 1 leverage ratio below 7.5%; and that the Bank not be\nsubject to any corrective action, supervisory order, supervisory agreement, or board approved operating agreement. The aggregate amount of\ndividends that may be declared by the Bank in 2021, without the need for qualifying for an exemption or prior DFI approval, is its 2021 net profits\nplus $21.4 million. Moreover, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve Board may prohibit the payment of dividends if it determines that the payment of\ndividends would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the Bank. On November 19, 2021 the Board of\nDirectors of the Bancorp declared a fourth quarter dividend of $0.31 per share. The Bancorp’s fourth quarter dividend totaling $1.1 million was\npaid to shareholders on January 7, 2022.\nNote 13 – Stock Based Compensation\nThe Bancorp’s 2015 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the “Incentive Plan”), which was adopted by the Bancorp’s Board of Directors on\nFebruary 17, 2015 and approved by the Bancorp’s shareholders on April 24, 2015, permits the grant of equity awards for up to 250,000 shares of\ncommon stock. Awards granted under the Incentive Plan may be in the form of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, restricted\nstock, unrestricted stock, performance shares, or performance units. The purposes of the Plan are (i) to align the personal interests of plan\nparticipants with those of the shareholders of the Bancorp, (ii) to encourage key individuals to accept or continue employment or service with the\nBancorp and its subsidiaries, and (iii) to furnish incentives to such key individuals to improve operations and increase profits by providing such\nkey individuals the opportunity to acquire common stock of the Bancorp or to receive monetary payments based on the value of such common\nstock.\nThe fair value of each incentive stock option award is estimated on the date of grant using a closed form option valuation (Black-Scholes)\nmodel. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatilities of the Company’s common stock. No incentive stock options were granted during\n2021 or 2020. The Bancorp uses historical data to estimate option exercise and post-vesting termination behavior. The expected term of options\ngranted is based on historical data and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding, which takes into\naccount that the options are not transferable. The risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield\ncurve in effect at the time of the grant.\nPage 90 of 108\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no incentive stock options outstanding.\nRestricted stock awards are generally granted with an award price equal to the market price of the Bancorp’s common stock on the award\ndate. Restricted stock awards have been issued with a three to five year cliff-vesting period. Forfeiture provisions exist for personnel that\nseparate employment before the vesting period expires. Compensation expense related to restricted stock awards is recognized over the vesting\nperiod. Total compensation cost that has been charged against income for those plans was approximately $574 thousand and $415 thousand for\n2021 and 2020, respectively.\nWhen awarded restricted shares vest, employees of the Bank can elect to surrender a portion of their vested shares back to the Bancorp to\ncover the tax liability of their awards. Shares were surrendered with a total value of $131 thousand and $85 thousand in 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively.\nA summary of changes in the Bancorp’s non-vested restricted stock for 2021 and 2020 follows:\nWeighted\nAverage\nGrant Date\nNon-vested Shares Shares Fair Value\nNon-vested at January 1, 2020 30,205 $ 35.63\nGranted 13,243 44.30\nVested (6,400) 27.50\nForfeited (220) 43.65\nNon-vested at December 31, 2020 36,828 $ 40.11\nNon-vested at January 1, 2021 36,828 $ 40.11\nGranted 21,255 41.42\nVested (13,493) 34.84\nForfeited (355) 41.50\nNon-vested at December 31, 2021 44,235 $ 42.33\nAs of December 31, 2021, there was approximately $877 thousand of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested restricted\nshares granted under the Incentive Plan. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.5 years.\nPage 91 of 108\nNote 14 – Earnings per Common Share\nEarnings per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. A\nreconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic earnings per common share and diluted earnings per common share\ncomputations for 2021 and 2020 is presented below.\n(dollars in thousands except per share data)\n2021 2020\nBasic earnings per common share:\nNet income as reported $ 14,963 $ 15,932\nWeighted average common shares outstanding 3,477,309 3,461,948\nBasic earnings per common share $ 4.30 $ 4.60\nDiluted earnings per common share:\nNet income as reported $ 14,963 $ 15,932\nWeighted average common shares outstanding 3,477,309 3,461,948\nWeighted average common and dilutive potential common shares\noutstanding 3,477,309 3,461,948\nDiluted earnings per common share $ 4.30 $ 4.60\nNote 15 – Related Party Transactions\nThe Bancorp had aggregate loans outstanding to directors and executive officers (with individual balances exceeding $120 thousand) of\napproximately $3.9 million at December 31, 2021, and approximately $4.4 million at December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31,\n2021, the following activity occurred on these loans\n(Dollars in\nthousands)\nAggregate balance at the beginning of the year $ 4,350\nNew loans -\nRepayments (467)\nAggregate balance at the end of the year $ 3,883\nDeposits from directors and executive officers totaled approximately $3.9 million and $5.3 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively.\nNote 16 – Commitments and Contingencies\nThe Bancorp is a party to financial instruments in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial\ninstruments, which include commitments to make loans and standby letters of credit, are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated\nfinancial statements. Such financial instruments are recorded when they are funded.\nThe Bancorp’s exposure to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to\noriginate loans and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. Commitments generally have fixed\nexpiration dates or other termination clauses and may require the payment of a fee. The Bancorp uses the same credit policy to make such\ncommitments as it uses for on-balance sheet items. Since commitments to make loans may expire without being used, the amount does not\nnecessarily represent future cash commitments.\nPage 92 of 108\nThe Bancorp had outstanding commitments to originate loans as follows:\n(Dollars in thousands)\nFixed Variable\nRate Rate Total\nDecember 31, 2021:\nResidential real estate $ 34 $ 19,261 $ 19,295\nHome equity 41,944 7,066 49,010\nCommercial real estate 2,033 8,745 10,778\nConstruction and land development 34,817 24,491 59,308\nMultifamily 229 958 1,187\nConsumer 23,422 - 23,422\nCommercial business 545 61,440 61,985\nLot - 9,399 9,399\nTotal $ 103,024 $ 131,360 $ 234,384\nDecember 31, 2020:\nResidential real estate $ 749 $ 21,961 $ 22,710\nHome equity 44,972 7,951 52,923\nCommercial real estate 2,955 13,138 16,093\nConstruction and land development 20,667 30,959 51,626\nMultifamily 158 579 737\nConsumer 23,020 - 23,020\nCommercial business 946 56,744 57,690\nLot - 87 87\nTotal $ 93,467 $ 131,419 $ 224,886\nThe approximately $103.0 million in fixed rate commitments outstanding at December 31, 2021, had interest rates ranging from 2.25% to\n10.00%, for a period not to exceed forty-five days. At December 31, 2020, fixed rate commitments outstanding of approximately $93.5 million\nhad interest rates ranging from 2.25% to 10.00%, for a period not to exceed forty-five days. Mortgage interest rate locks with borrowers which\nare included with real estate commitments, were treated as derivative transactions.\nStandby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Bancorp to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. At\nDecember 31, 2021, and 2020, the Bancorp had standby letters of credit totaling approximately $12.3 and $11.5 million which are not included in\nthe tables above, respectively. The Bancorp evaluates each customer’s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral\nobtained, if deemed necessary by the Bancorp upon extension of credit, is based on management’s credit evaluation of the borrower. Collateral\nobtained may include accounts receivable, inventory, property, land or other assets.\nNote 17 – Derivative Financial Instruments\nThe Bancorp uses derivative financial instruments to help manage exposure to interest rate risk and the effects that changes in interest rates\nmay have on net income and the fair value of assets and liabilities. The Bancorp has certain interest rate derivative positions that are not\ndesignated as hedging instruments. Derivative assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and do not\ntake into account the effects of master netting agreements. Master netting agreements allow the Bancorp to settle all derivative contracts held\nwith a single counterparty on a net basis, and to offset net derivative positions with related collateral, where applicable. These derivative\npositions relate to transactions in which the Bancorp enters into an interest rate swap with a client while at the same time entering into an\noffsetting interest rate swap with another financial institution. In connection with each transaction, the Bancorp agrees to pay interest to the client\non a notional amount at a variable interest rate and receive interest from the client on the same notional amount at a fixed interest rate. At the\nsame time, the Bancorp agrees to pay another financial institution the same fixed interest rate on the same notional amount and receive the\nsame variable interest rate on the same notional amount. The transaction allows the client to effectively convert a variable rate loan to a fixed\nrate. Because the terms of the swaps with the customers and the other financial institutions offset each other, with the only difference being\ncounterparty credit risk, changes in the fair value of the underlying derivative contracts are not materially different and do not significantly impact\nthe Bancorp’s results of operations.\nPage 93 of 108\nThe Bancorp enters into commitments to originate loans whereby the interest rate on the loan is determined prior to funding (i.e., interest\nrate lock commitment). The interest rate lock commitments are considered derivatives and are recorded on the accompanying consolidated\nbalance sheets at fair value in accordance with FASB ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging.\nThe following table shows the amounts of non-hedging derivative financial instruments:\nDecember 31, 2021\nNotational or\ncontractual Asset derivatives Liability derivatives\nStatement of Financial Condition Statement of Financial Condition\n(Dollars in thousands) amount classification Fair value classification Fair value\nInterest rate swap contracts $ 94,154 Other assets $ 2,686 Other liabilties $ 2,686\nInterest rate lock commitments 7,837 Other assets 141 N/A -\nTotal $ 101,991 $ 2,827 $ 2,686\nDecember 31, 2020\nNotational or\ncontractual Asset derivatives Liability derivatives\nStatement of Financial Condition Statement of Financial Condition\n(Dollars in thousands) amount classification Fair value classification Fair value\nInterest rate swap contracts $ 72,707 Other assets $ 3,638 Other liabilties $ 3,638\nInterest rate lock commitments 26,443 Other assets 374 N/A -\nTotal $ 99,150 $ 4,012 $ 3,638\nThe following table shows the amounts included in the Statements of Income for non-hedging derivative financial instruments:\nYear-ended\nStatement of Income\n(Dollars in thousands) Classification 2021 2020\nInterest rate swap contracts Fees and service charges $ 379 $ 800\nGain on sale of loans held-for-\nInterest rate lock commitments sale, net (233) 187\nTotal $ 146 $ 987\nPage 94 of 108\nThe following table shows the offsetting of financial assets and derivative assets:\nGross Amounts not Offset in the\nStatement of Financial Condition\nCash\nGross Amounts of Gross Amounts Offset in the Net Amounts of Assets Presented Collateral\nStatement of Financial in the Statement of Financial\n(Dollars in thousands) Recognized Assets Condition Condition Financial Instruments Received Net Amount\nDecember 31, 2021\nInterest rate swap contracts $ 2,686 $ - $ 2,686 $ - $ - $ 2,686\nInterest rate lock commitments 141 - 141 - - 141\nTotal $ 2,827 $ - $ 2,827 $ - $ - $ 2,827\nGross Amounts not Offset in the\nStatement of Financial Condition\nNet Amounts of Liabilities Cash\nGross Amounts of Gross Amounts Offset in the Presented Collateral\nStatement of Financial in the Statement of Financial\n(Dollars in thousands) Recognized Liabilities Condition Condition Financial Instruments Received Net Amount\nDecember 31, 2020\nInterest rate swap contracts $ 3,638 $ - $ 3,638 $ - $ - $ 3,638\nInterest rate lock commitments 374 - 374 - - 374\nTotal $ 4,012 $ - $ 4,012 $ - $ - $ 4,012\nThe following table shows the offsetting of financial liabilities and derivative liabilities:\nGross Amounts not Offset in the\nStatement of Financial Condition\nNet Amounts of Liabilities Cash\nGross Amounts of Gross Amounts Offset in the Presented Collateral\nStatement of Financial in the Statement of Financial\n(Dollars in thousands) Recognized Liabilities Condition Condition Financial Instruments Pledged Net Amount\nDecember 31, 2021\nInterest rate swap contracts $ 2,686 $ - $ 2,686 $ - $ 3,930 $ (1,244)\nTotal $ 2,686 $ - $ 2,686 $ - $ 3,930 $ (1,244)\nGross Amounts not Offset in the\nStatement of Financial Condition\nNet Amounts of Liabilities Cash\nGross Amounts of Gross Amounts Offset in the Presented Collateral\nStatement of Financial in the Statement of Financial\n(Dollars in thousands) Recognized Liabilities Condition Condition Financial Instruments Pledged Net Amount\nDecember 31, 2020\nInterest rate swap contracts $ 3,638 $ - $ 3,638 $ - $ 3,930 $ (292)\nTotal $ 3,638 $ - $ 3,638 $ - $ 3,930 $ (292)\nPage 95 of 108\nNote 18 – Fair Values of Financial Instruments\nThe Fair Value Measurements Topic (the “Topic”) establishes a hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and\nminimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The Topic describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair\nvalue:\nLevel 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the\nmeasurement date.\nLevel 2: Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in\nmarkets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.\nLevel 3: Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a reporting entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would\nuse in pricing an asset or liability.\nThe fair values of securities available for sale are determined on a recurring basis by obtaining quoted prices on nationally recognized\nsecurities exchanges or pricing models utilizing significant observable inputs such as matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique widely\nused in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities, but rather by relying on the\nsecurities’ relationship to other benchmark quoted securities. Different judgments and assumptions used in pricing could result in different\nestimates of value. In certain cases where market data is not readily available because of lack of market activity or little public disclosure, values\nmay be based on unobservable inputs and classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\nAt the end of each reporting period, securities held in the investment portfolio are evaluated on an individual security level for other-than-\ntemporary impairment in accordance with the Investments – Debt and Equity Securities Topic. Impairment is other-than-temporary if the decline\nin the fair value of the security is below its amortized cost and it is probable that all amounts due according to the contractual terms of a debt\nsecurity will not be received. Significant judgments are required in determining impairment, which include making assumptions regarding the\nestimated prepayments, loss assumptions and the change in interest rates. The Bancorp considers the following factors when determining other-\nthan-temporary impairment for a security: the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than amortized cost; the\nfinancial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; the underlying fundamentals of the relevant market and the outlook for such market for\nthe near future; an assessment of whether the Bancorp (1) has the intent to sell the debt securities or (2) more likely than not will be required to\nsell the debt securities before their anticipated market recovery. If either of these conditions are met, management will recognize other-than-\ntemporary impairment. If, in management’s judgment, an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the cost basis of the security will be written\ndown for the credit loss, and the unrealized loss will be transferred from accumulated other comprehensive loss as an immediate reduction of\ncurrent earnings.\nThe Bancorp’s management utilizes a specialist to perform an other-than-temporary impairment analysis for each of its two pooled trust\npreferred securities. The analysis is performed annually on December 31 and utilizes analytical models used to project future cash flows for the\npooled trust preferred securities based on current assumptions for prepayments, default and deferral rates, and recoveries. The projected cash\nflows are then tested for impairment consistent with the Investments – Other Topic and the Investments – Debt and Equity Securities Topic. The\nother-than-temporary impairment testing compares the present value of the cash flows from quarter to quarter to determine if there is a\n“favorable” or “adverse” change. Other-than-temporary impairment is recorded if the projected present value of cash flows is lower than the book\nvalue of the security. To perform the annual other-than-temporary impairment analysis, management utilizes current reports issued by the\ntrustee, which contain principal and interest tests, waterfall distributions, note valuations, collection detail and credit ratings for each pooled trust\npreferred security. In addition, a detailed review of the performing collateral (which consists of banks) was performed. The review of the collateral\nbegan with a review of financial information provided by SNL Financial, a comprehensive database, widely used in the industry, which gathers\nfinancial data on banks from U.S. GAAP financial statements for public companies (annual and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q), as\nwell as regulatory reports for private companies, including consolidated financial statements for bank holding companies (FR Y-9C reports) and\nparent company-only financial statements for bank holding companies (FR Y-9SP reports) filed with the Federal Reserve and bank call reports\nfiled with the FDIC and OCC. Using the information sources described above, for each bank and thrift examined, the following items were\nexamined: nature of the issuer’s business, years of operating history, corporate structure, loan composition and loan concentrations, deposit mix,\nasset growth rates, geographic footprint and local economic environment. The issuers’ historical financial performance was reviewed and their\nfinancial ratios were compared to appropriate peer groups of regional banks or thrifts with similar asset sizes. The analysis focused on six broad\ncategories: profitability (revenue streams and earnings quality, return on assets and shareholder’s equity, net interest margin and interest rate\nsensitivity), credit quality (charge-offs and recoveries, non-current loans and total non-performing assets as a percentage of total loans, loan loss\nreserve coverage and the adequacy of the loan loss provision), operating efficiency (noninterest expense compared to total revenue), capital\nadequacy (Tier-1, total capital and leverage ratios and equity capital growth), leverage (tangible equity as a percentage of tangible assets, short-\nterm and long-term borrowings and double leverage at the holding company) and liquidity (the nature and availability of funding sources, net\nnon-core funding dependence and quality of deposits). In addition, for publicly traded companies, stock price movements were reviewed and the\nmarket price of publicly traded debt instruments was examined. The current other-than-temporary impairment analysis indicated that the\nBancorp’s two pooled trust preferred securities had no additional other-than-temporary impairment for the years ending December 31, 2021 and\n2020.\nPage 96 of 108\nThe table below shows the credit loss roll forward for the Bancorp’s pooled trust preferred securities that have been classified with other-than-\ntemporary impairment:\n(Dollars in\nthousands)\nCollateralized debt\nobligations\nother-than-\ntemporary\nimpairment\nEnding balance, December 31, 2020 $ 173\nAdditions not previously recognized -\nEnding balance, December 31, 2021 $ 173\nThe Bancorp’s subordination for each trust preferred security is calculated by taking the total performing collateral and subtracting the sum of\nthe total collateral within the Bancorp’s class and the total collateral within all senior classes, and then stating this result as a percentage of the\ntotal performing collateral. This measure is an indicator of the level of collateral that can default before potential cash flow disruptions may occur.\nIn addition, management calculates subordination assuming future collateral defaults by utilizing the default/deferral assumptions in the\nBancorp’s other-than-temporary impairment analysis. Subordination assuming future default/deferral assumptions is calculated by deducting\nfuture defaults from the current performing collateral. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, management reviewed the subordination levels for each\nsecurity in context of the level of current collateral defaults and deferrals within each security; the potential for additional defaults and deferrals\nwithin each security; the length of time that the security has been in “payment in kind” status; and the Bancorp’s class position within each\nsecurity.\nManagement calculated the other-than-temporary impairment model assumptions based on the specific collateral underlying each individual\nsecurity. The following assumption methodology was applied consistently to each of the two pooled trust preferred securities: For collateral that\nhas already defaulted, no recovery was assumed; no cash flows were assumed from collateral currently in deferral, with the exception of the\nrecovery assumptions. The default and recovery assumptions were calculated based on the detailed collateral review. The discount rate\nassumption used in the calculation of the present value of cash flows is based on the discount margin (i.e., credit spread) at the time each\nsecurity was purchased using the original purchase price. The discount margin is then added to the appropriate 3-month LIBOR forward rate\nobtained from the forward LIBOR curve.\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, the trust preferred securities with a cost basis of $2.2 million have been placed in “payment in kind” status.\nThe Bancorp’s securities that are classified as “payment in kind” are a result of not receiving the scheduled quarterly interest payments. For the\nsecurities in “payment in kind” status, management anticipates to receive the unpaid contractual interest payments from the issuer, because of\nthe self-correcting cash flow waterfall provisions within the structure of the securities. When a tranche senior to the Bancorp’s position fails the\ncoverage test, the Bancorp’s interest cash flows are paid to the senior tranche and recorded as a reduction of principal. The coverage test\nrepresents an over collateralization target by stating the balance of the performing collateral as a percentage of the balance of the Bancorp’s\ntranche, plus the balance of all senior tranches. The principal reduction in the senior tranche continues until the appropriate coverage test is\npassed. As a result of the principal reduction in the senior tranche, more cash is available for future payments to the Bancorp’s tranche.\nConsistent with the Investments – Debt and Equity Securities Topic, management considered the failure of the issuer of the security to make\nscheduled interest payments in determining whether a credit loss existed. Management will not capitalize the “payment in kind” interest\npayments to the book value of the securities and will keep these securities in non-accrual status until the quarterly interest payments resume.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Values on a Recurring Basis\nThere were no transfers to or from Levels 1 and 2 during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.

However, certain assumptions and unobservable inputs are often used by the appraiser, therefore, qualifying the assets as Level 3 in the\nfair value hierarchy. The fair value of foreclosed real estate is similarly determined by using the results of recent real estate appraisals. The\nnumerical range of unobservable inputs for these valuation assumptions is not meaningful to this presentation.\nThe following table shows carrying values and related estimated fair values of financial instruments as of the dates indicated.

Certificates of deposits in other financial institutions carrying amounts\napproximate fair value (Level 2). The fair values of securities available-for-sale are obtained from broker pricing (Level 2), with the exception of\ncollateralized debt obligations, which are valued by a third-party specialist (Level 3). Loans held-for-sale comprise residential mortgages and are\npriced based on values established by the secondary mortgage markets (Level 1). The estimated fair value for net loans receivable is based on\nthe exit price notion which is the exchange price that would be received to transfer the loans at the most advantageous market price in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants on the measurement date (Level 3). Federal Home Loan Bank stock is estimated at book value due to\nrestrictions that limit the sale or transfer of the security. Interest rate swap agreements, both assets and liabilities, are valued by a third-party\npricing agent using an income approach (Level 2). Fair values of accrued interest receivable and payable approximate book value, as the\ncarrying values are determined using the observable interest rate, balance, and last payment date.\nNon-interest and interest bearing deposits, which include checking, savings, and money market deposits, are estimated to have fair values\nbased on the amount payable as of the reporting date (Level 1). The fair value of fixed-maturity certificates of deposit (included in interest\nbearing deposits) are based on estimates of the rate the Bancorp would pay on similar deposits, applied for the time period until maturity (Level\n2). Estimated fair values for short-term repurchase agreements, which represent sweeps from demand deposits to accounts secured by pledged\nsecurities, are estimated based on the amount payable as of the reporting date (Level 1). Longer-term repurchase agreements, with contractual\nmaturity dates of three months or more, are based on estimates of the rate the Bancorp would pay on similar deposits, applied for the time\nperiod until maturity (Level 2). Short-term borrowings are generally only held overnight, therefore, their carrying amount is a reasonable estimate\nof fair value (Level 1). The fair value of FHLB Advances are estimated by discounting the future cash flows using quoted rates from the FHLB for\nsimilar advances with similar maturities (Level 2). The estimated fair value of other financial instruments, and off-balance sheet loan\ncommitments, approximate cost and are not considered significant to this presentation.\nNote 19 – Parent Company Only Statements\n(Dollars in thousands)\nFinward Bancorp\nCondensed Balance Sheets\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2021 2020\nAssets\nCash on deposit with Peoples Bank $ 1,183 $ 805\nInvestment in Peoples Bank 153,772 149,695\nInvestment in NWIN Risk Management, Inc 1,970 1,775\nDividends receivable from Peoples Bank 1,070 1,070\nOther assets 581 420\nTotal assets $ 158,576 $ 153,765\nLiabilities and stockholders’ equity\nDividends payable $ 1,079 $ 1,074\nOther liabilities 882 1,002\nTotal liabilities 1,961 2,076\nAdditional paid in capital 30,430 29,987\nAccumulated other comprehensive (loss) income 4,276 10,441\nRetained earnings 121,909 111,261\nTotal stockholders’ equity 156,615 151,689\nTotal liabilities and stockholders’ equity $ 158,576 $ 153,765\n(Dollars in thousands)\nFinward Bancorp\nCondensed Statements of Income\nYear Ended December 31,\n2021 2020\nDividends from Peoples Bank $ 4,880 $ 3,395\nOperating expenses 448 413\nIncome before income taxes and equity in undistributed income of Peoples\nBank 4,432 2,982\nIncome tax benefit (94) (86)\nIncome before equity in undistributed income of Peoples Bank 4,526 3,068\nEquity in undistributed (distributions in excess of income) income of Peoples\nBank 9,413 11,941\nincome of NWIN Risk Management, Inc 1,024 923\nNet income $ 14,963 $ 15,932\nPage 100 of 108\n(Dollars in thousands)\nFinward Bancorp\nCondensed Statements of\nComprehensive Income\nYear Ended December 31,\n2021 2020\nNet Income $ 14,963 $ 15,932\nNet change in net unrealized gains and losses on securities available-for-sale:\nUnrealized (loss) gain arising during the period (5,816) 10,169\nLess: reclassification adjustment for gains included in net income (1,987) (2,348)\nNet securities gain during the period (7,803) 7,821\nTax effect 1,638 (1,641)\nNet of tax amount (6,165) 6,180\nComprehensive income, net of tax $ 8,798 $ 22,112\n(Dollars in thousands)\nFinward Bancorp\nCondensed Statements of Cash Flows\nYear Ended December 31,\n2021 2020\nCash flows from operating activities:\nNet income $ 14,963 $ 15,932\nAdjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating\nactivities\nDistributions in excess of income (equity in undistributed income):\nPeoples Bank (9,413) (11,941)\nNWIN Risk Management, Inc (1,024) (923)\nDistribution from NWIN Risk Management, Inc 830 884\nStock based compensation expense 574 415\nChange in other assets (161) 190\nChange in other liabilities (120) 433\nNet cash - operating activities 5,649 4,990\nCash flows from investing activities:\nInvestment in Peoples Bank (830) -\nNet cash - investing activities (830) -\nCash flows from financing activities:\nDividends paid (4,310) (4,291)\nNet surrender value of restricted stock awards (131) (85)\nNet cash - financing activities (4,441) (4,376)\nNet change in cash 378 614\nCash at beginning of year 805 191\nCash at end of year $ 1,183 $ 805\nSUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES OF CASH FLOW INFORMATION:\nCash paid during the period for:\nIncome taxes 2,185 1,025\nNoncash activities:\nDividends declared not paid 1,079 1,074\nPage 101 of 108\nItem 9.

Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Bancorp’s\ndisclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as\nof December 31, 2021. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of December 31,\n2021, the Bancorp’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Bancorp in\nreports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time\nperiods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and such information is accumulated and communicated to the Bancorp’s management, including\nits principal executive and principal financial officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nThere were no changes in the Bancorp’s internal control over financial reporting during the year ended December 31, 2021, that have\nmaterially affected or are reasonably likely to affect, the Bancorp’s internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThe management of the Bancorp is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as\ndefined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Bancorp’s internal control over financial reporting is a process\ndesigned under the supervision of the Bancorp’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding\nthe reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Bancorp’s financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with\nU.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nAs of December 31, 2021, management assessed the effectiveness of the Bancorp’s internal control over financial reporting based on the\nframework established in the “Internal Control - Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission (COSO). Based on this evaluation, management has determined that the Bancorp’s internal control over financial reporting was\neffective as of December 31, 2021, based on the criteria specified.\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of the Bancorp’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal\ncontrol over financial reporting.

Payouts\nwill be determined as a percentage of the target opportunity based on performance relative to criteria established at the beginning of the year.\nThe Plan shall be administered by the Compensation and Benefits Committee of the Board of Directors of Finward Bancorp (the “Compensation Committee”).\nThe Compensation Committee shall make recommendations to the independent directors of the Board for approval.\nPerformance Period\nThe Plan operates on a calendar year schedule — January 1 through December 31.\nIncentive Award Opportunities\nInitial target award opportunities will be 30% of salary for the Executive Chairman and the CEO and 20% to 30% of salary for all other executive participants.\nPayouts will be determined relative to the target award opportunity based on the actual salary earned during the year.\nDetermination and Range of Payouts\nPayouts will be determined based on results relative to formulaic financial performance criteria, subject to adjustment based on defined modifiers.\nFormulaic Component\nThe Plan relies on the formulaic with modifier incentive plan model. This model provides for payouts at, above or below target based on results versus key\nfinancial goals. The Committee may modify payouts up or down based on strategic and individual goals, as well as defined risk criteria. The formulaic\ncomponent of the incentive plan will include Return on Assets, EPS Growth and Efficiency Ratio. The Compensation Committee shall determine the\nweightings on an annual basis.\nPayouts will be determined independently for each measure. For each measure, the target performance level will equal the budget, so performance in line with\nthe budget will result in a payout at target for that measure. Threshold and maximum performance levels will be set for each measure, and can result in payouts\nranging from 50% to 150% of target. Performance below the threshold performance level will result in $0 payout for that measure. Payouts will be interpolated\nbased on actual budget performance between threshold and target or between target and maximum.\nA common guideline is to suggest that threshold performance goals should have an 85-90% probability of attainment, target should have a 50-60% probability\nof attainment, and maximum goals should have a 10-15% probability of attainment. When setting threshold and maximum goals, the Committee should give\nconsideration to how historical results have varied relative to budget in the past, the range of results in the peer data, what would be required to achieve the\ndifferent performance levels (in terms of loan growth, fee income growth, etc.), and what percentage of incremental earnings (or loss of earnings) would be\nshared by executives.\nPAGE 1 ■ FNWD/INCENTIVE PLAN PROPOSAL ■ DECEMBER 2021\nIllustrative Framework of Performance and Payout Range and Calculated Payout\nThreshold Target/Budget Maximum % of Target\nMeasure (50% of target payout) (target payout) (150% of target payout) Actual Payout\nROA 1.01% 1.06% 1.17% 1.04% 98.1%\nEPS Growth 2.72% 6.80% 10.20% 3.30% 48.5%\nEfficiency Ratio 69.92% 66.59% 63.26% 66.92% 99.5%\nTotal Payout based on Formulaic Component (if equally weighted) 82.2%\nCorporate Performance Modifiers\nThe Compensation Committee may adjust the corporate performance results of the formulaic measures based on the following potential modifiers:\n■ Safety and Soundness (based on CAMELS, ERM Dashboard, and Board Risk Survey): The Compensation Committee may elect to reduce payouts by up\nto 20% if there are safety and soundness concerns, with the potential for no payout if there are significant poor risk outcomes or regulatory issues.\n■ Relative Performance Comparisons: Management will evaluate Peoples Bank performance relative to a peer group as approved by the Strategic Planning\nCommittee and the Board. The Compensation Committee may adjust payouts up to +/- 20% for performance significantly above or below the peer\nmedian.\n■ Strategic Objectives: Management, in collaboration with the Strategic Planning Committee, will identify one to three specific goals related to the Bank’s\nstrategic priorities at the beginning of the year. The Compensation Committee may adjust payouts up to +/- 20% based on performance relative to those\ngoals.\nIndividual Performance Modifier\nThe Compensation Committee may also adjust payouts based on individual performance, including, without limitation, leadership skills. Individual\nperformance may be evaluated through the use of tools such as performance evaluations, 360 peer evaluations, and Board evaluations. Executives will have\nspecific goals established at the beginning of the year. At the end of the year, the Compensation Committee will evaluate the performance of the Executive\nChairman and CEO relative to those goals and determine whether to make any adjust to the incentive payout.\nThe CEO will evaluate the performance of the other executives relative to their established goals and will make a recommendation to the Compensation\nCommittee as to whether to any adjustments should be made to the incentive payout. Absent significant performance concerns, generally, there would be no\nadjustments and if recommended, adjustments for individual performance will not exceed +/- 20%.\nPAGE 2 ■ FNWD/INCENTIVE PLAN PROPOSAL ■ DECEMBER 2021\nSummary of Payout Determination\nPAGE 3 ■ FNWD/INCENTIVE PLAN PROPOSAL ■ DECEMBER 2021\nAward Distributions\nThe Compensation Committee retains final authority and discretion to determine appropriate payouts under the Plan and to make recommendations to the\nindependent directors of the Board for approval. Upon approval of the award payout by the independent directors of the Board, participants receive the awards\nthrough payroll, generally on the second pay in February.\nPayments under this Plan are taxable income to participants in the year paid and will be subject to tax withholding.\nPAGE 4 ■ FNWD/INCENTIVE PLAN PROPOSAL ■ DECEMBER 2021\nLong-Term Incentives\nAward Vehicle\nExecutives will be eligible to receive annual grants of time-based restricted stock.\nGrant Sizes\nThe CEO will have a target long-term incentive opportunity equal to 25% of base salary and all other executives will have a target long-term incentive\nopportunity within a range of 10-20% of base salary. The target incentive will be adjusted based on actual results as compared to budget and other factors\ndeemed relevant by the Compensation Committee. The intent is for the grant target to remain within a range of 10-25% of salary.\nAward Vesting\nShares become fully vested three years from the grant date of the award. Unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee, Executives may satisfy\nall or part of their tax withholding obligations in connection with an Award by having the Bank withhold otherwise deliverable shares consistent with the terms\nand conditions set forth in the applicable stock option and incentive plan.\nPAGE 5 ■ FNWD/INCENTIVE PLAN PROPOSAL ■ DECEMBER 2021\nTerms and Conditions\nThe information represented below is subject to change and does not constitute a binding agreement.\nEffective Date\nThis Plan is effective January 1, 2018, and may be amended from time to time, subject to the approval of the independent directors of the Board.\nPlan Administration\nThe Compensation Committee has the sole authority to interpret the Plan and to make or nullify any rules and procedures, as necessary, for proper\nadministration of the Plan. Any determination by the Compensation Committee will be final and binding.\nThe Compensation Committee will annually review the plan to ensure proper alignment with the Bank’s business objectives.\nProgram Changes or Discontinuance\nThe Bank has developed this Plan based on existing business, market and economic conditions; current services; and staff assignments. If substantial changes\noccur that affect these conditions, services, assignments, or forecasts, the Bank may add to, amend, modify or discontinue any of the terms or conditions of the\nPlan at any time. Examples of substantial changes may include mergers, dispositions or other corporate transactions, changes in laws or accounting principles\nor other events that would in the absence of some adjustment, frustrate the intended operation of this arrangement.\nThe Compensation Committee may, at its sole discretion, waive any part of the Plan, as it deems appropriate.\nPlan Interpretation\nIf there is any ambiguity as to the meaning of any terms or provisions of this Plan or any questions as to the correct interpretation of any information contained\ntherein, the Bank's interpretation expressed by the Compensation Committee will be final and binding.\nChanges in Incentive Targets\nParticipants who receive a promotion or change roles where the participant becomes eligible or ineligible for an award or experience a change in incentive\nopportunity will receive a prorated award based on their status and the effective date of the promotion or role change. Award amounts will be calculated using\nthe participant’s base earnings and the incentive target for the applicable period. Base earnings refers to the base salary earned for the performance period and\nexcludes referral fees, commissions and any other previously paid performance compensation.\nParticipants that have an approved leave of absence are eligible to receive a prorated award calculated using their time in active status as permitted by the\nFamily Medical Leave Act or other applicable state and federal laws and regulations.\nTermination of Employment\nTo encourage employee retention, a participant must be an active employee of the Bank on the date the incentive award is paid to receive an award (please see\nexceptions for death, disability and retirement below). Participants who terminate employment during the performance period will not be eligible to receive an\naward. Participants who have given notice of resignation after the performance period and before payout are not eligible to receive an award.\nPAGE 6 ■ FNWD/INCENTIVE PLAN PROPOSAL ■ DECEMBER 2021\nDeath, Disability or Retirement\nParticipants who cease to be an active Peoples Bank employee due to death, disability or retirement (minimum age 65) will be eligible for a payout based on\ntheir actual salary earned during the performance period. The payout will be determined at the same time as all other participants, based on corporate and\nindividual performance results.\nClawback\nIn the event that, within 3 years of an incentive payout, the Bank is required to prepare an accounting revision or restatement or determined that the incentives\nwere paid based on inaccurate performance metric results, the Compensation Committee will determine whether a clawback of the incentives is appropriate.\nThe Compensation Committee will consider whether the payout would have been reduced based on the revised, restated or corrected financials, the difference\nbetween the actual payout and what the payout would have been based on the revised, restated or corrected financials, and whether there was any misconduct\non the part of plan participants that led to the revision, restatement or incorrect results. If the Compensation Committee determines a clawback is appropriate,\nthe Committee will provide the Participant with a written notice of the amount of excess incentive payments awarded under the Plan that the Participant must\nreimburse the Bank. The participant may elect to reimburse the Bank by having outstanding awards reduced (including holdbacks or long-term incentives),\nhaving future incentive payments reduced, or writing a check payable to the Bank for an amount equal to the written notification.\nAdditionally, in the event that the Compensation Committee determines that an incentive recipient engaged in fraud or intentional misconduct that resulted in\nsignificant financial and/or reputational harm to the Bank, the Compensation Committee will determine whether it is appropriate to clawback any incentive\ncompensation awarded during the preceding 3 years (including equity awards granted).
