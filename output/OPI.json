OPI intends to repurchase, redeem or repay the remaining $113.6 million of outstanding senior unsecured notes due 2025 with cash in connection with the consummation of the Exchange. The Exchange is expected to close before year end 2024. \n\nUnder the terms of the Exchange, noteholders party to the Exchange Agreement will exchange their 2025 Notes for: (i) a pro rata portion of $445 million new senior secured notes due 2027 (the “2027 Notes”), (ii) cash for accrued interest on the 2025 Notes up to but not including the closing date, (iii) a pro rata portion of approximately 11.5 million shares of OPI common stock, representing 19.9% of OPI’s issued and outstanding common shares as of the date of the Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Shares” and together with the 2027 Notes, the “Exchange Consideration”) and (iv) certain premiums as described below. The 2027 Notes will mature on March 15, 2027. The 2027 Notes will be issued with an interest rate of 3.25% per annum and require quarterly principal amortization of $6.5 million and a mandatory principal repayment of $125 million due by March 1, 2026, unless satisfied sooner with proceeds from certain asset sales. The 2027 Notes will be secured by first-priority liens on 35 properties with a Gross Book Value of approximately $1.3 billion and second-priority liens on 19 additional properties that secure OPI’s approximately $610 million of senior secured notes due 2029 with a Gross Book Value of approximately $717 million. \n\nCertain noteholders party to the Exchange Agreement (the “Backstop Parties”) have agreed to purchase for cash any Exchange Consideration to the extent that the maximum $340 million in principal amount of 2025 Notes are not exchanged for the full amount of the Exchange Consideration. \n\nBrian Donley, Chief Financial Officer of OPI, made the following comments: \n\n“We believe this agreement is an important milestone in our ongoing efforts to address our debt maturities in the face of operational and market headwinds. We appreciate the constructive dialogue with our noteholders and thank them for their ongoing support.” \n\n**Exchange Agreement**\n\nIn connection with the Exchange, OPI has agreed to pay a $15 million premium to the Backstop Parties, to be allocated among such parties based on their backstop commitments and a $10 million support premium to the parties to the Exchange Agreement to be allocated by the initial exchanging noteholders. In limited circumstances, certain other holders of 2025 Notes may also join the Exchange Agreement following its effectiveness. \n\n**About Office Properties Income Trust**\n\nOPI is a national REIT focused on owning and leasing office properties to high credit quality tenants in markets throughout the United States. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 59% of OPI’s revenues were from investment grade rated tenants.

These measures do not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be\nconsidered alternatives to net income (loss) as indicators of OPI's operating performance or as measures of OPI's liquidity. These measures should be considered in conjunction with net income (loss) as presented in\nOPI's condensed consolidated statements of income (loss). OPI considers these non-GAAP measures to be appropriate supplemental measures of operating performance for a REIT, along with net income (loss). OPI\nbelieves these measures provide useful information to investors because by excluding the effects of certain historical amounts, such as depreciation and amortization expense, they may facilitate a comparison of OPI's\noperating performance between periods and with other REITs and, in the case of NOI, Cash Basis NOI, Same Property NOI and Same Property Cash Basis NOI reflecting only those income and expense items that are\ngenerated and incurred at the property level may help both investors and management to understand the operations of OPI's properties.\nNOI and Cash Basis NOI\nThe calculations of net operating income, or NOI, and Cash Basis NOI exclude certain components of net income (loss) in order to provide results that are more closely related to OPI's property level results of\noperations. OPI calculates NOI and Cash Basis NOI as shown on page 25 and Same Property NOI and Same Property Cash Basis NOI as shown on page 26. OPI defines NOI as income from OPI's rental of real estate less\nOPI's property operating expenses. NOI excludes amortization of capitalized tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions that OPI records as depreciation and amortization expense. OPI defines Cash Basis NOI\nas NOI excluding non-cash straight line rent adjustments, lease value amortization, lease termination fees, if any, and non-cash amortization included in other operating expenses. OPI calculates Same Property NOI and\nSame Property Cash Basis NOI in the same manner that OPI calculates the corresponding NOI and Cash Basis NOI amounts, except that OPI only includes same properties in calculating Same Property NOI and Same\nProperty Cash Basis NOI. OPI uses NOI, Cash Basis NOI, Same Property NOI and Same Property Cash Basis NOI to evaluate individual and company-wide property level performance. Other real estate companies and\nREITs may calculate NOI, Cash Basis NOI, Same Property NOI and Same Property Cash Basis NOI differently than OPI does.\nEBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre\nOPI calculates earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, EBITDA for real estate, or EBITDAre, and Adjusted EBITDAre as shown on page 28. EBITDAre is calculated on the basis defined\nby The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or Nareit, which is EBITDA, excluding gains and losses on the sale of real estate, loss on impairment of real estate assets and adjustments to reflect OPI's\nshare of EBITDAre of its unconsolidated joint venture. In calculating Adjusted EBITDAre, OPI adjusts for the items shown on page 28 and includes business management incentive fees, if any, only in the fourth quarter\nversus the quarter when they are recognized as expense in accordance with GAAP due to their quarterly volatility not necessarily being indicative of OPI's core operating performance and the uncertainty as to whether\nany such business management incentive fees will be payable when all contingencies for determining such fees are known at the end of the calendar year. Other real estate companies and REITs may calculate EBITDA,\nEBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre differently than OPI does.\nFFO and Normalized FFO\nOPI calculates funds from operations, or FFO, and Normalized FFO as shown on page 29. FFO is calculated on the basis defined by Nareit, which is net income (loss), calculated in accordance with GAAP, plus real estate\ndepreciation and amortization of consolidated properties and OPI's proportionate share of the real estate depreciation and amortization of unconsolidated joint venture properties, but excluding impairment charges on\nreal estate assets and any gain or loss on sale of real estate, as well as certain other adjustments currently not applicable to us. In calculating Normalized FFO, OPI adjusts for the other items shown on page 29 and\nincludes business management incentive fees, if any, only in the fourth quarter versus the quarter when they are recognized as an expense in accordance with GAAP due to their quarterly volatility not necessarily being\nindicative of OPI's core operating performance and the uncertainty as to whether any such business management incentive fees will be payable when all contingencies for determining such fees are known at the end of\nthe calendar year. FFO and Normalized FFO are among the factors considered by OPI's Board of Trustees when determining the amount of distributions to OPI's shareholders. Other factors include, but are not limited\nto, requirements to maintain OPI's qualification for taxation as a REIT, limitations in OPI's credit agreement and public debt covenants, the availability to OPI of debt and equity capital, OPI's expectation of its future\ncapital requirements and operating performance and OPI's expected needs for and availability of cash to pay its obligations. Other real estate companies and REITs may calculate FFO and Normalized FFO differently\nthan OPI does.\nCash Available for Distribution\nOPI calculates cash available for distribution, or CAD, as shown on page 29. OPI defines CAD as Normalized FFO minus recurring real estate related capital expenditures and adjusted for other non-cash and non-\nrecurring items and certain amounts excluded from Normalized FFO but settled in cash. CAD is among the factors considered by OPI's Board of Trustees when determining the amount of distributions to OPI's\nshareholders. Other real estate companies and REITs may calculate CAD differently than OPI does.\nRETURN TO TABLE OF CONTENTS Q3 2024 30\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures and Certain Definitions (Continued)\nAdjusted total assets and total unencumbered assets include the original cost of real estate assets calculated in accordance with GAAP before impairment writedowns, if any, and exclude depreciation and amortization, accounts receivable\nand intangible assets, as defined in OPI's debt agreements. Unencumbered assets is calculated as adjusted total assets for properties not securing debt.\nAnnualized dividend yield is the annualized dividend per common share paid during the period divided by the closing price of OPI's common shares at the end of the period.\nAnnualized rental income is calculated using the annualized contractual base rents from OPI's tenants pursuant to its lease agreements as of September 30, 2024, plus straight line rent adjustments and estimated recurring expense\nreimbursements to be paid to OPI, and excluding lease value amortization.\nBuilding improvements generally include expenditures to replace obsolete building components and expenditures that extend the useful life of existing assets.\nConsolidated income available for debt service is earnings from operations excluding interest expense, depreciation and amortization, loss on asset impairment, gains and losses on early extinguishment of debt, gains and losses on sales\nof properties and equity in earnings of OPI's unconsolidated joint venture and including distributions from OPI's unconsolidated joint venture, if any, determined together with debt service for the period presented.\nDevelopment, redevelopment and other activities generally include capital expenditure projects that reposition a property or result in new sources of revenue.\nGAAP is U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nGross book value of real estate assets is real estate properties at cost calculated in accordance with GAAP, plus certain acquisition costs, if any, before depreciation and purchase price allocations, less impairment writedowns, if any.\nGross sales price is equal to the gross contract price and excludes closing costs.\nInvestment grade tenants include: (a) investment grade rated tenants; (b) tenants with investment grade rated parent entities that guarantee the tenant's lease obligations; and/or (c) tenants with investment grade rated parent entities that\ndo not guarantee the tenant's lease obligations. Tenants contributing 51.2% of annualized rental income as of September 30, 2024 were investment grade rated (or their payment obligations were guaranteed by an investment grade rated\nparent) and tenants contributing an additional 8.2% of annualized rental income as of September 30, 2024 were subsidiaries of an investment grade rated parent (although these parent entities are not liable for the payment of rents).\nLease related costs generally include capital expenditures used to improve tenants' space or amounts paid directly to tenants to improve their space and leasing related costs, such as brokerage commissions and tenant inducements.\nLeased square feet is pursuant to leases existing as of September 30, 2024, and includes (i) space being fitted out for tenant occupancy pursuant to OPI's lease agreements, if any, and (ii) space which is leased, but is not occupied or is\nbeing offered for sublease by tenants, if any. Square footage measurements are subject to changes when space is remeasured or reconfigured for new tenants.\nLeasing cost and concession commitments include commitments made for leasing expenditures and concessions, such as tenant improvements, leasing commissions, tenant reimbursements and free rent.\nNet debt is total debt less cash.\nPercent leased includes (i) space being fitted out for occupancy pursuant to OPI's lease agreements, if any, and (ii) space which is leased, but is not occupied or is being offered for sublease by tenants, if any, as of the measurement date.\nREIT is real estate investment trust.\nRentable square feet represents total square feet available for lease as of the measurement date. Square footage measurements are subject to changes when space is remeasured or reconfigured for new tenants.\nRolling four quarter CAD represents CAD for the preceding twelve month period as of the respective quarter end date.\nSame properties for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is based on properties OPI owned continuously since July 1, 2023; excludes 17 properties classified as held for sale, five properties affected by significant redevelopment\nactivities and two properties owned by an unconsolidated joint venture in which OPI owns a 51% interest.\nSame properties for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is based on properties OPI owned continuously since January 1, 2023; excludes 17 properties classified as held for sale, five properties affected by significant\nredevelopment activities and two properties owned by an unconsolidated joint venture in which OPI owns a 51% interest.\nSame property cash basis NOI % margin is Same Property Cash Basis NOI as a percentage of same property cash basis rental income. Cash basis rental income excludes non-cash straightline rent adjustments, the net effect of non-cash\namortization of intangible lease assets and liabilities and lease termination fees, if any.\nSame property NOI % margin is Same Property NOI as a percentage of same property rental income.\nSOFR is the secured overnight financing rate.\nTotal debt represents the outstanding principal balance as of the date reported.\nTotal gross assets is total assets plus accumulated depreciation.\nWeighted average remaining lease term is the average remaining lease term in years weighted based on annualized rental income.\nRETURN TO TABLE OF CONTENTS Q3 2024 31\nWarning Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nThis presentation contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other securities laws that are subject to risks and\nuncertainties.

TRUST\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n(unaudited)\nNote 1. Basis of Presentation\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements of Office Properties Income Trust and its subsidiaries, or OPI, we, us or our, are\nunaudited. Certain information and disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, for complete financial statements have been\ncondensed or omitted. We believe the disclosures made are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. However, the accompanying condensed\nconsolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes contained in our Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, or our 2023 Annual Report. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring\naccruals considered necessary for a fair statement of results for the interim period have been included. All intercompany transactions and balances with or\namong our consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated. Our operating results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be\nexpected for the full year.\nThe preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. Actual\nresults could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates in the condensed consolidated financial statements include purchase price allocations, useful lives\nof fixed assets and assessment of impairment of real estate and the related intangibles.\nGoing Concern\nOur portfolio has been adversely affected by shifts in office space utilization, including increased remote work arrangements and tenants consolidating their\nreal estate footprint. Demand for office space continues to face headwinds and declining rents and increasing costs to relet space when tenants can be identified\ncontinue to impact the market. In addition, there are limited debt or equity financing alternatives available to us to refinance our debt and financing sources we\nhave utilized have increased our cost of capital. The duration and ultimate impact of these factors on our properties and our business remains uncertain and\nsubject to change; however, these conditions continue to have a significant negative impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. As of\nOctober 30, 2024, our total available liquidity was comprised of $146,448 of cash and, in addition to long-term debt, our $456,700 of unsecured senior notes due\non February 1, 2025, or the 2025 Notes, are due within one year from the date of issuance of these financial statements.\nGiven the limited alternatives available to us to obtain debt or equity to refinance our maturing debt, the illiquid nature of our real estate assets and our\nability to incur additional debt while maintaining compliance with the financial covenants in our existing debt agreements, we are currently in negotiations with\ncertain holders of the 2025 Notes regarding a potential note exchange. However, we are not able to conclude that it is probable that the negotiations will result in\nan exchange that refinances the 2025 Notes prior to their maturity. If we are unable to consummate a transaction that refinances the 2025 Notes on terms which,\nin our view, allow us to continue as a going concern, our Board of Trustees may consider a reorganization in a bankruptcy court. As a result of the foregoing, we\nhave concluded that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year from the date of issuance of these financial\nstatements, or October 30, 2024.\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts\nor the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\n9\nTable of Contents\nOFFICE PROPERTIES INCOME TRUST\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n(unaudited)\nNote 2. Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280):\nImprovements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, or ASU No. 2023-07, which requires public entities to: (i) provide disclosures of significant segment\nexpenses and other segment items if they are regularly provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker, or the CODM, and included in each reported measure\nof segment profit or loss; (ii) provide all annual disclosures about a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets currently required by Accounting Standards\nCodification 280, Segment Reporting, or ASC 280, in interim periods; and (iii) disclose the CODM’s title and position, as well as an explanation of how the\nCODM uses the reported measures and other disclosures. Public entities with a single reportable segment must apply all the disclosure requirements of ASU No.\n2023-07, as well as all the existing segment disclosures under ASC 280. The amendments in ASU No. 2023-07 are incremental to the requirements in ASC 280\nand do not change how a public entity identifies its operating segments, aggregates those operating segments, or applies the quantitative thresholds to determine\nits reportable segments. ASU No. 2023-07 should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements and is effective for fiscal\nyears beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. We expect\nto include additional disclosures in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements as a result of the implementation of ASU No. 2023-07;\nhowever, these changes are not expected to have a material effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements.\nNote 3. Per Common Share Amounts\nWe calculate basic earnings per common share using the two class method. We calculate diluted earnings per common share using the more dilutive of the\ntwo class method or the treasury stock method. Unvested share awards and other potentially dilutive common shares, together with the related impact on\nearnings, are considered when calculating diluted earnings per common share. The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per common share is as follows\n(amounts in thousands, except per share data):\nNine Months Ended\nThree Months Ended September 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNumerators:\nNet (loss) income $ (58,414) $ (19,593) $ 12,573 $ (32,281)\nIncome attributable to unvested participating securities (2) (50) (74) (232)\nNet (loss) income used in calculating earnings per common share $ (58,416) $ (19,643) $ 12,499 $ (32,513)\nDenominators:\nWeighted average common shares outstanding - basic and diluted 51,197 48,403 49,444 48,365\nNet (loss) income per common share - basic and diluted $ (1.14) $ (0.41) $ 0.25 $ (0.67)\nNote 4. Real Estate Properties\nAs of September 30, 2024, our 145 wholly owned properties included approximately 19,543,000 rentable square feet, with an undepreciated carrying value\nof $3,873,075, including $176,465 classified as held for sale. We also had a noncontrolling ownership interest of 51% in an unconsolidated joint venture that\nowned two properties containing approximately 346,000 rentable square feet. We generally lease space at our properties on a gross lease, modified gross lease or\nnet lease basis pursuant to fixed term contracts expiring between 2024 and 2053. Some of our leases generally require us to pay all or some property operating\nexpenses and to provide all or most property management services. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we entered into 14 leases for\napproximately 987,000 rentable square feet for a weighted (by rentable square feet) average lease term of 10.2 years, and we made commitments of $65,916 for\nleasing related costs. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we entered into 39 leases for approximately 1,683,000 rentable square feet for a\nweighted (by rentable square feet) average lease term of 9.1 years and we made commitments for approximately $80,875 of leasing related costs. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, we had estimated unspent leasing related obligations of $100,646.\nWe regularly evaluate whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that could indicate an impairment in the value of long lived assets.\nImpairment indicators may include declining tenant occupancy, lack of progress re-leasing vacant\n10\nTable of Contents\nOFFICE PROPERTIES INCOME TRUST\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n(unaudited)\nspace, tenant bankruptcies, low long term prospects for improvement in property performance, weak or declining tenant profitability, cash flow or liquidity, our\ndecision to dispose of an asset before the end of its estimated useful life and legislative, market or industry changes that could permanently reduce the value of a\nproperty. If there is an indication that the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable, we estimate the projected undiscounted cash flows to determine if an\nimpairment loss should be recognized. The future net undiscounted cash flows are subjective and are based in part on assumptions regarding hold periods,\nmarket rents and terminal capitalization rates. We determine the amount of any impairment loss by comparing the historical carrying value to estimated fair\nvalue. We estimate fair value through an evaluation of recent financial performance and projected discounted cash flows using standard industry valuation\ntechniques. In addition to consideration of impairment upon the events or changes in circumstances described above, we regularly evaluate the remaining useful\nlives of our long lived assets. If we change our estimate of the remaining useful lives, we allocate the carrying value of the affected assets over their revised\nremaining useful lives.\nDisposition Activities\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold seven properties containing approximately 998,000 rentable square feet for an aggregate sales\nprice of $84,810, excluding closing costs. The sales of these properties, as presented in the table below, do not represent a strategic shift in our business. As a\nresult, the results of operations of these properties are included in continuing operations through the date of sale in our condensed consolidated statements of\ncomprehensive income (loss).\nNumber of Gain (Loss) on Sale of Loss on Impairment of\nDate of Sale Properties Location Rentable Square Feet Gross Sales Price (1) Real Estate Real Estate\nMarch 2024 1 Chicago, IL 248,000 $ 38,500 $ (2,448) $ —\nJuly 2024 1 Malden, MA 126,000 7,800 (10) 13,973\nAugust 2024 3 Indianapolis, IN 434,000 10,100 729 50,851\nSeptember 2024 1 Atlanta, GA 126,000 17,610 8,691 —\nSeptember 2024 1 San Jose, CA 64,000 10,800 (954) 819\n7 998,000 $ 84,810 $ 6,008 $ 65,643\n(1) Gross sales price is the contract price, excluding closing costs.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had 13 properties classified as held for sale in our condensed consolidated balance sheet that are under agreement to sell for\nan aggregate sales price of $107,802, excluding closing costs, as summarized below:\nLoss on Impairment of\nDate of Sale Agreement Number of Properties Location Rentable Square Feet Gross Sales Price (1) Real Estate\nMay 2024 1 Colorado Springs, CO 156,000 $ 26,164 $ —\nJuly 2024 5 Atlanta, GA 378,000 18,100 21,937\nAugust 2024 1 Rocklin, CA 19,000 2,650 —\nSeptember 2024 1 Kansas City, MO 87,000 8,000 4,370\nSeptember 2024 2 Santa Clara, CA 149,000 21,150 11,041\nOctober 2024 2 Tempe, AZ 101,000 10,738 —\nOctober 2024 1 Sacramento, CA 338,000 21,000 33,904\n13 1,228,000 $ 107,802 $ 71,252\n(1) Gross sales price is the contract price, excluding closing costs.\nWe also had four additional properties classified as held for sale in our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 and we recorded a\n$22,094 loss on impairment of real estate to adjust the carrying values of two of these properties to their estimated fair values, less costs to sell, during the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024. The pending sales in the preceding table are subject to conditions; accordingly, we cannot be sure that we will complete\nthese sales or that these sales will not be delayed or the pricing will not change. See Note 8 for more information regarding our properties held for sale.\n11\nTable of Contents\nOFFICE PROPERTIES INCOME TRUST\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n(unaudited)\nWe also recorded a $12,017 loss on impairment of real estate to reduce the carrying value of one property that was classified as held for sale to its estimated\nfair value, less costs to sell as of June 30, 2024. Subsequently, we removed this property from held for sale status due to a change of plan for sale and recorded\nan additional loss on impairment of $2,573 to reduce the carrying value of this property to its estimated fair value as of September 30, 2024.\nIn October 2024, we entered into agreements to sell an additional four properties with approximately 381,000 rentable square feet for an aggregate sales\nprice of $11,350, excluding closing costs.\nUnconsolidated Joint Ventures\nAs of September 30, 2024, we owned an interest in one joint venture that owned two properties. We accounted for this investment under the equity method\nof accounting.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our 1750 H Street, NW joint venture did not have sufficient cash flow to pay its monthly debt service,\nresulting in an event of default and the non-recourse mortgage lender to this joint venture completed a foreclosure of the property and the joint venture ceased to\nhave an economic interest in the property. We wrote off our full investment in this joint venture as of December 31, 2023 and did not make capital contributions\nto this joint venture during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Accordingly, we did not record our proportionate share of operating results of the joint\nventure for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our investments in our unconsolidated joint ventures consisted of the following:\nOPI Carrying Value of Investments at\nNumber of Rentable Square\nJoint Venture OPI Ownership September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Properties Location Feet\nProsperity Metro Plaza 51% $ 17,552 $ 18,128 2 Fairfax, VA 346,000\n1750 H Street, NW 50% — — 1 Washington, D.C. 125,000\nTotal $ 17,552 $ 18,128 3 471,000\nThe following table provides a summary of the mortgage debt of our unconsolidated joint ventures as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nPrincipal Balance at September Principal Balance at December 31,\nJoint Venture Interest Rate (1) Maturity Date 30, 2024 (2) 2023 (2)\nProsperity Metro Plaza 4.09% 12/1/2029 $ 50,000 $ 50,000\n1750 H Street, NW 3.69% 8/1/2027 — 32,000\nWeighted Average / Total 3.93% $ 50,000 $ 82,000\n(1) Includes the effect of mark to market purchase accounting.\n(2) Reflects the entire balance of the debt secured by the properties and is not adjusted to reflect the interests in the joint ventures we did not own. None of the debt is recourse to us.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the unamortized basis difference of our Prosperity Metro Plaza joint venture of $680 was primarily attributable to the difference\nbetween the amount we paid to purchase our interest in this joint venture, including transaction costs, and the historical carrying value of the net assets of this\njoint venture. The difference is being amortized over the remaining useful life of the related property and the resulting amortization expense is included in equity\nin net losses of investees in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\nNote 5. Leases\nOur leases provide for base rent payments and, in addition, may include variable payments. Rental income from operating leases, including any payments\nderived by index or market-based indices, is recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term once we have determined that the collectability of\nsubstantially all of the lease payments is probable. Some of our leases have options to extend or terminate the lease exercisable at the option of our tenants,\nwhich are considered when determining\n12\nTable of Contents\nOFFICE PROPERTIES INCOME TRUST\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n(unaudited)\nthe lease term. Allowances for bad debts are recognized as a direct reduction of rental income. In certain circumstances, some leases provide the tenant with the\nright to terminate if the legislature or other funding authority does not appropriate the funding necessary for the tenant to meet its lease obligations; we have\ndetermined the fixed non-cancelable lease term of these leases to be the full term of the lease because we believe the occurrence of early terminations to be a\nremote contingency based on both our historical experience and our assessments of the likelihood of lease cancellation on a separate lease basis.\nWe increased rental income to record revenue on a straight line basis by $8,854 and $8,691 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively, and $23,796 and $17,120 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Rents receivable, excluding properties classified\nas held for sale, included $134,218 and $112,440 of straight line rent receivables at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nWe do not include in our measurement of our lease receivables certain variable payments, including payments determined by changes in the index or\nmarket-based indices after the inception of the lease, certain tenant reimbursements and other income until the specific events that trigger the variable payments\nhave occurred. Such payments totaled $22,291 and $65,120 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, of which tenant\nreimbursements totaled $21,271 and $61,667, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, such payments totaled $21,067 and\n$64,627, respectively, of which tenant reimbursements totaled $19,722 and $60,641, respectively.\nNote 6. Concentration\nTenant and Credit Concentration\nAs of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the U.S. government and certain state and other government tenants combined were responsible for approximately\n24.5% and 28.1%, respectively, of our annualized rental income. The U.S. government is our largest tenant by annualized rental income and represented\napproximately 16.6% and 20.0% of our annualized rental income as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We define annualized rental income as the\nannualized contractual base rents from our tenants pursuant to our lease agreements as of the measurement date, plus straight line rent adjustments and estimated\nrecurring expense reimbursements to be paid to us, and excluding lease value amortization.\nGeographic Concentration\nAs of September 30, 2024, our 145 wholly owned properties were located in 30 states and the District of Columbia. Properties located in Virginia,\nCalifornia, District of Columbia, Illinois and Georgia were responsible for approximately 12.4%, 10.6%, 10.6%, 9.7% and 9.7% of our annualized rental income\nas of September 30, 2024, respectively.\nNote 7. Indebtedness\nOur principal debt obligations as of September 30, 2024 were: (1) $200,000 of outstanding borrowings under our $325,000 secured revolving credit facility;\n(2) $100,000 outstanding principal amount under our secured term loan; (3) $1,855,910 aggregate outstanding principal amount of senior notes and (4) $177,320\naggregate outstanding principal amount of mortgage notes.\nIn January 2024, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement, or our credit agreement, governing a new $325,000 secured revolving credit\nfacility and a $100,000 secured term loan. Our credit agreement replaced our prior revolving credit facility, which had a maturity date of January 31, 2024. As\ncollateral for all loans and other obligations under our credit agreement, certain of our subsidiaries pledged all of their respective equity interests in certain of\nour direct and indirect property owning subsidiaries, and our pledged subsidiaries provided first mortgage liens on 19 properties that had a gross book value of\nreal estate assets of $1,012,536 as of September 30, 2024. We can borrow, repay and reborrow funds available under our revolving credit facility until maturity,\nand no principal repayments on borrowings under our credit agreement are due until maturity. The maturity date of our credit agreement is January 29, 2027\nand, subject to the payment of an extension fee and meeting certain other requirements, we can extend the stated maturity date of our revolving credit facility by\none year. Our credit agreement contains a number of covenants, including covenants that require us to maintain certain financial ratios, restrict our ability to\nincur additional debt in excess of calculated amounts and, subject to limited exceptions, restrict our ability to increase our distribution rate above the current\nlevel of $0.01 per common share per quarter and enter into share repurchases. Availability of borrowings under our credit agreement is subject to ongoing\nminimum performance and market values of the 19 collateral properties, our satisfying certain financial covenants and other credit facility conditions.\n13\nTable of Contents\nOFFICE PROPERTIES INCOME TRUST\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n(unaudited)\nInterest payable on borrowings under our credit agreement is at a rate of the secured overnight financing rate, or SOFR, plus a margin of 350 basis points.\nWe are also required to pay an unused facility fee on the amount of total lending commitments, which was 25 basis points per annum at September 30, 2024. As\nof September 30, 2024, we had $200,000, outstanding under our revolving credit facility, $100,000 outstanding under our term loan and $125,000 available for\nborrowing under our revolving credit facility. In October 2024, we borrowed $125,000 under our revolving credit facility to preserve financial flexibility. As of\nOctober 29, 2024, we had fully drawn our $325,000 revolving credit facility and $100,000 was outstanding under our term loan.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the annual interest rate payable on borrowings under our credit agreement was 8.4%. The weighted average annual interest rate\nfor borrowings under our credit agreement for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 8.9%.\nWe were required to pay interest at a rate of SOFR plus a premium, which was 145 basis points per annum as of September 30, 2023, on the amount\noutstanding under our prior revolving credit facility, as well as a facility fee on the total amount of lending commitments, which was 30 basis points per annum.\nThe weighted average annual interest rate for borrowings under our prior revolving credit facility for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was\n6.8% and 6.4%, respectively.\nOur revolving credit facility is governed by a credit agreement with a syndicate of institutional lenders. Our credit agreement and senior notes indentures\nand their supplements provide for acceleration of payment of all amounts due thereunder upon the occurrence and continuation of certain events of default, such\nas, in the case of our credit agreement, a change of control of us, which includes The RMR Group LLC, or RMR, ceasing to act as our business and property\nmanager. Our credit agreement and senior notes indentures and their supplements also contain covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to incur\ndebts, require us to comply with certain financial covenants and, in the case of our credit agreement, restrict our ability to increase our distribution rate above the\ncurrent level of $0.01 per common share per quarter. We believe we were in compliance with the terms and conditions of the respective covenants under our\ncredit agreement and senior notes indentures and their supplements at September 30, 2024.\nSenior Secured Notes Issuance\nIn February 2024, we issued $300,000 of 9.000% senior secured notes due 2029, or the 2029 Notes. The aggregate net proceeds from the offering of the\n2029 Notes were $270,712, after initial purchaser discounts and other offering expenses. The 2029 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint,\nseveral and senior secured basis by certain of our subsidiaries and secured by a pledge of all of the respective equity interests of the subsidiary guarantors and\nfirst mortgage liens on 17 properties with a gross book value of real estate assets of $619,467 as of September 30, 2024. The 2029 Notes require semi-annual\npayments of interest only and are prepayable, at par plus accrued interest, after March 31, 2028.\nSenior Unsecured Notes Redemption\nIn March 2024, we redeemed, at par plus accrued interest, all $350,000 of our 4.25% senior unsecured notes due 2024. As a result of this redemption, we\nrecorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $425 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which represented the unamortized discounts related\nto these notes.\nSenior Notes Exchanges\nIn June 2024, we exchanged $567,429 of new 9.000% senior secured notes, or the New 2029 Notes, for an aggregate $865,219 of our outstanding\nunsecured senior notes, or the Existing Notes, and such transaction, the Senior Note Exchange, as follows:\nAggregate Principal Amount of Existing Notes\nExisting Notes Exchanged Accepted for Exchange Aggregate Principal Amount of New Notes Delivered\nExisting 4.50% 2025 Notes $ 150,846 $ 141,411\nExisting 2.650% 2026 Notes 159,512 114,803\nExisting 2.400% 2027 Notes 269,216 164,162\nExisting 3.450% 2031 Notes 285,645 147,053\nTotal $ 865,219 $ 567,429\n14\nTable of Contents\nOFFICE PROPERTIES INCOME TRUST\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n(unaudited)\nThe New 2029 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint, several and senior secured basis by certain of our subsidiaries and are secured by\nfirst mortgage liens on 19 properties with a gross book value of real estate assets of $716,969 as of September 30, 2024 and second mortgage liens on the 19\nproperties securing our credit agreement. The New 2029 Notes require semi-annual payments of interest only and are prepayable, at par plus accrued interest,\nafter June 3, 2028. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a gain on early extinguishment of debt of $225,210 as a result of the Senior\nNote Exchange.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, in a series of exchange transactions, we exchanged an aggregate principal amount of $8,300\nof the 2025 Notes for an aggregate 3,184,432 of our common shares at a weighted average price of $2.34 per share. During the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, we recorded a gain on early extinguishment of debt of $852 as a result of these exchanges.\nIn October 2024, in a series of exchange transactions, we exchanged an additional aggregate principal amount of $34,154 of the 2025 Notes for $42,570 of\nnew 9.0% senior secured notes due 2029 on substantially similar terms as the New 2029 Notes and an aggregate 1,870,238 of our common shares.\nThe gains we realized on early extinguishment of debt are considered cancellation of debt income, or CODI, for income tax purposes and part of our REIT\ntaxable income. We currently do not expect that any special distribution will be required to maintain our qualification for taxation as a real estate investment\ntrust, or REIT, as a result of generating CODI in 2024. However, this assertion is based on our expectation that we will complete additional dispositions that will\nresult in additional losses on sale of real estate in 2024. If these sales are not completed, we will be taxed at regular corporate income tax rates on any\nundistributed REIT taxable income.\nAs of September 30, 2024, seven of our properties with an aggregate gross book value of real estate assets of $304,961 were encumbered by mortgage notes\nwith an aggregate principal amount of $177,320. Our mortgage notes are non-recourse, subject to certain limited exceptions and do not contain any material\nfinancial covenants.\nNote 8. Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities\nThe following table presents certain of our assets measured at fair value at September 30, 2024, categorized by level of inputs as defined in the fair value\nhierarchy under GAAP, used in the valuation of each asset:\nFair Value at Reporting Date Using\nQuoted Prices in\nActive Markets for Significant Other Significant\nIdentical Assets (Level Observable Inputs Unobservable Inputs\nDescription Total 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nNon-recurring Fair Value Measurements Assets\nReal estate properties (1) $ 4,170 $ — $ — $ 4,170\nAssets of properties held for sale (2) $ 94,545 $ — $ 94,545 $ —\n(1) We recorded an impairment charge of $14,590 to reduce the carrying value of one property that was classified as held for sale as of June 30, 2024 and subsequently removed from held for stale\nstatus to its estimated fair value based on third party offers (Level 3 inputs as defined in the fair value hierarchy under GAAP).\n(2) We recorded an impairment charge of $93,346 to reduce the carrying values of 11 properties that are classified as held for sale in our condensed consolidated balance sheet to their estimated fair\nvalues less estimated costs to sell of $2,282, based on negotiated sales prices with third party buyers (Level 2 inputs as defined in the fair value hierarchy under GAAP).

We estimated the fair values of our mortgage notes payable using discounted cash flow analyses and currently prevailing market rates\n(Level 3 inputs as defined in the fair value hierarchy under GAAP) as of the measurement date. Because Level 3 inputs are unobservable, our estimated fair\nvalues may differ materially from the actual fair values.\nNote 9.

Our lease with Sonesta commenced in August 2023 and expires in 2053 and Sonesta has two options to extend the term for 10 years each. The lease\nwas amended in September 2024 to expand the premises by 5,900 rentable square feet. Pursuant to the amended lease agreement, Sonesta will pay us annual\nbase rent of approximately $6,724 beginning February 2025. The annual base rent will increase by 10% every five years throughout the term. Sonesta is also\nobligated to pay its pro rata share of the operating costs for the property.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following information should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes included in Part\nI, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with our 2023 Annual Report.\nOVERVIEW (dollars in thousands, except per share and per square foot data)\nWe are a REIT organized under Maryland law. As of September 30, 2024, our wholly owned properties were comprised of 145 properties and we had a\nnoncontrolling ownership interest of 51% in an unconsolidated joint venture that owned two properties containing approximately 346,000 rentable square feet.\nAs of September 30, 2024, our properties are located in 30 states and the District of Columbia and contain approximately 19,543,000 rentable square feet. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, our properties were leased to 237 different tenants with a weighted average remaining lease term (based on annualized rental income) of\napproximately 7.2 years. The U.S. government is our largest tenant, representing approximately 16.6% of our annualized rental income as of September 30,\n2024. The term annualized rental income as used herein is defined as the annualized contractual base rents from our tenants pursuant to our lease agreements as\nof September 30, 2024, plus straight line rent adjustments and estimated recurring expense reimbursements to be paid to us, and excluding lease value\namortization.\nLeases representing approximately 4.4% and 9.8% of our annualized rental income are scheduled to expire during the remainder of 2024 and 2025,\nrespectively, and we may be unable to renew leases or find replacement tenants. Certain changes in office space utilization, including increased remote work\narrangements and tenants consolidating their real estate footprint, continue to impact the office sector and our portfolio. The utilization and demand for office\nspace continues to face headwinds and the duration and ultimate impact of current trends on the demand for office space at our properties remains uncertain and\nsubject to change. Accordingly, we do not yet know what the full extent of the impacts will be on our or our tenants’ businesses and operations nor the long-term\noutlook for leasing at our properties. Higher interest rates, inflationary pressures, geopolitical hostilities and tensions, and concerns that the U.S. economy may\nenter an economic recession have caused disruptions in the financial markets and these factors could adversely affect our and our tenants’ financial condition\nand the ability or willingness of our tenants to renew our leases or pay rent to us. We also have a significant amount of debt maturing in the next 12 months. As\nof October 30, 2024, our total available liquidity was comprised of $146,448 of cash and, in addition to long-term debt, we had $456,700 of the 2025 Notes due\non February 1, 2025.\nGiven the limited alternatives available to us to obtain debt or equity to refinance our maturing debt, the illiquid nature of our real estate assets and our\nability to incur additional debt while maintaining compliance with the financial covenants in our existing debt agreements, we are currently in negotiations with\ncertain holders of the 2025 Notes regarding a potential note exchange. However, we are not able to conclude that it is probable that the negotiations will result in\nan exchange that refinances the 2025 Notes prior to their maturity. Accordingly, we have concluded that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as\na going concern for at least one year from the date of issuance of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q, or October 30, 2024.\nFor more information about the risks relating to these dynamics and conditions and their impacts on us and our business, see Part I, Item IA, “Risk Factors”,\nof our 2023 Annual Report.\nProperty Operations\nUnless otherwise noted, the data presented in this section includes properties classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2024 and excludes two\nproperties owned by an unconsolidated joint venture in which we owned a 51% interest.

Includes capitalized interest and\nother operating costs of $1,172 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and $1,978 and $8,691 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. We did not capitalize\nany interest and other operating costs during the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had estimated unspent leasing related obligations of $100,646, of which we expect to spend $66,949 over the next 12\nmonths.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had leases at our properties totaling approximately 3,090,000 rentable square feet that were scheduled to expire through\nDecember 31, 2025. As of October 29, 2024, we expect tenants with leases totaling approximately 2,637,000 rentable square feet that are scheduled to expire\nthrough December 31, 2025, excluding space that has been re-leased and space for which we are in advanced negotiations to re-lease, not to renew or to\ndownsize their leased space upon expiration, and we cannot be sure as to whether other tenants will renew their leases upon expiration. Of the 2,637,000\nrentable square feet leased to tenants known to be vacating, 1,765,000 rentable square feet relate to properties, excluding properties classified as held for sale,\nnot encumbered by debt. We continue to proactively engage with our existing tenants and are focused on overall tenant retention. Prevailing market conditions\nand our tenants’ needs at the time we negotiate and enter leases or lease renewals will generally determine rental rates and demand for leased space at our\nproperties, all of which are beyond our control. Whenever we renew or enter into new leases for our properties, we intend to seek rents which are equal to or\nhigher than our historical rents for the same properties; however, our ability to maintain or increase the rents for our properties will depend in large part upon\nmarket conditions, which are beyond our control. We cannot be sure of the rental rates that will result from our ongoing negotiations regarding lease renewals or\nany new or renewed leases we may enter. Also, we may experience material declines in our rental income due to vacancies upon lease expirations, early\nterminations or lower rents upon lease renewal or reletting. Additionally, we may incur significant costs and make significant concessions to renew our leases\nwith current tenants or attract new tenants to our properties.\n22\nTable of Contents\nAs of September 30, 2024, our lease expirations by year were as follows (square feet in thousands):\nNumber of Leased Annualized\nLeases Square Feet Percent of Cumulative Rental Income Percent of Cumulative\nYear (1) Expiring Expiring (2) Total Percent of Total Expiring Total Percent of Total\n2024 23 1,281 7.9 % 7.9 % $ 19,914 4.4 % 4.4 %\n2025 43 1,809 11.2 % 19.1 % 44,298 9.8 % 14.2 %\n2026 38 528 3.3 % 22.4 % 18,237 4.0 % 18.2 %\n2027 32 1,872 11.6 % 34.0 % 47,018 10.4 % 28.6 %\n2028 18 649 4.0 % 38.0 % 31,019 6.9 % 35.5 %\n2029 36 1,083 6.7 % 44.7 % 33,298 7.4 % 42.9 %\n2030 28 1,083 6.7 % 51.4 % 30,356 6.7 % 49.6 %\n2031 20 1,255 7.8 % 59.2 % 31,233 6.9 % 56.5 %\n2032 13 502 3.1 % 62.3 % 17,412 3.8 % 60.3 %\n2033 and thereafter 53 6,119 37.7 % 100.0 % 180,040 39.7 % 100.0 %\nTotal 304 16,181 100.0 % $ 452,825 100.0 %\nWeighted average remaining lease term (in years) 6.6 7.2\n(1) The year of lease expiration is pursuant to current contract terms. Some of our leases allow the tenants to vacate the leased premises before the stated expirations of their leases with little or no\nliability. As of September 30, 2024, tenants occupying approximately 2.2% of our rentable square feet and responsible for approximately 2.6% of our annualized rental income as of September 30,\n2024 had exercisable rights to terminate their leases before the stated terms of their leases expire. Also, in 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028, 2029, 2030, 2031, 2032, 2034, 2035, 2036, 2037 and 2040,\nearly termination rights become exercisable by other tenants who occupied an additional approximately 2.0%, 1.4%, 1.6%, 4.1%, 2.7%, 1.8%, 0.6%, 3.2%, 0.3%, 0.9%, 0.1%, 0.2% and 0.3% of\nour rentable square feet, respectively, and contributed an additional approximately 0.1%, 2.4%, 2.2%, 2.3%, 5.1%, 2.5%, 2.4%, 0.7%, 4.4%, 0.7%, 1.4%, 0.3%, 0.2% and 0.4% of our annualized\nrental income, respectively, as of September 30, 2024. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, pursuant to leases with seven of our tenants, these tenants had rights to terminate their leases if their\nrespective legislature or other funding authority does not appropriate rent amounts in their respective annual budgets. These seven tenants occupied approximately 3.9% of our rentable square feet\nand contributed approximately 4.2% of our annualized rental income as of September 30, 2024.\n(2) Leased square feet is pursuant to leases existing as of September 30, 2024, and includes (i) space being fitted out for tenant occupancy pursuant to our lease agreements, if any, and (ii) space\nwhich is leased, but is not occupied or is being offered for sublease by tenants, if any. Square feet measurements are subject to changes when space is remeasured or reconfigured for new tenants.\nWe generally will seek to renew or extend the terms of leases at properties with tenants when they expire. However, market and economic factors, along\nwith increases in remote work, changes in space utilization and government spending and budget priorities, may cause our tenants not to renew or extend their\nleases when they expire, or to seek to renew their leases for less space than they currently occupy. If we are unable to extend or renew our leases, or we renew\nleases for reduced space, it may be time consuming and expensive to relet our properties.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we derived 24.1% of our annualized rental income from our properties located in the metropolitan Washington, D.C. market\narea, which includes Washington, D.C., Northern Virginia and suburban Maryland. Current economic conditions in this area or a possible recession, including as\na result of current inflationary conditions or otherwise, could reduce demand from tenants for our properties, reduce rents that our tenants in this area are willing\nto pay when our leases expire and increase lease concessions for new leases and renewals. Additionally, there has been a decrease in demand for new leased\noffice space by the U.S. government, including in the metropolitan Washington, D.C. market area, and that could increase competition for government tenants\nand adversely affect our ability to retain government tenants or maintain or increase our rents when our leases expire.\nOur manager, RMR, employs a tenant review process for us. RMR assesses tenants on an individual basis based on various applicable credit criteria. In\ngeneral, depending on facts and circumstances, RMR evaluates the creditworthiness of a tenant based on information concerning the tenant that is provided by\nthe tenant and, in some cases, information that is publicly available or obtained from third party sources. We consider investment grade tenants to include: (a)\ninvestment grade rated tenants; (b) tenants with investment grade rated parent entities that guarantee the tenant’s lease obligations; and/or (c) tenants with\ninvestment grade rated parent entities that do not guarantee the tenant’s lease obligations. As of September 30, 2024, tenants contributing 51.2% of annualized\nrental income were investment grade rated (or their payment obligations were guaranteed by an investment grade rated parent) and tenants contributing an\nadditional 8.2% of annualized rental income were subsidiaries of an investment grade rated parent (although these parent entities were not liable for the payment\nof rents).\n23\nTable of Contents\nAs of September 30, 2024, tenants representing 1% or more of our total annualized rental income were as follows (square feet in thousands):\n% of Total\n% of Leased Sq.

The net proceeds from these sales were used to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility.\nWe continue to evaluate our portfolio and are currently in various stages of marketing certain of our properties for sale, and we may seek to sell additional\nproperties in the future. As of October 29, 2024, we have entered into agreements to sell 17 properties containing approximately 1,609,000 rentable square feet\nfor an aggregate sales price of $119,152, excluding closing costs. We cannot be sure we will sell any properties we are marketing for sale for prices in excess of\ntheir carrying values or otherwise. In addition, our pending sales are subject to conditions; accordingly, we cannot be sure that we will complete these sales or\nthat these sales will not be delayed or the pricing will not change.\nFor more information about our disposition activities, see Note 4 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nSegment Information\nWe operate in one business segment: ownership of real estate properties.\n24\nTable of Contents\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (amounts in thousands, except per share amounts)\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024, Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023\nNon-Comparable\nProperties Results\nComparable Properties (1) Results Three Months Ended Consolidated Results\nThree Months Ended September 30, September 30, Three Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change 2024 2023 2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nRental income $ 109,781 $ 112,939 $ (3,158) (2.8 %) $ 10,839 $ 20,422 $ 120,620 $ 133,361 $ (12,741) (9.6 %)\nOperating expenses:\nReal estate taxes 14,173 12,638 1,535 12.1 % 2,754 1,619 16,927 14,257 2,670 18.7 %\nUtility expenses 6,805 6,340 465 7.3 % 1,064 1,120 7,869 7,460 409 5.5 %\nOther operating expenses 23,636 23,439 197 0.8 % 2,983 4,507 26,619 27,946 (1,327) (4.7 %)\nTotal operating expenses 44,614 42,417 2,197 5.2 % 6,801 7,246 51,415 49,663 1,752 3.5 %\nNet operating income (2) $ 65,167 $ 70,522 $ (5,355) (7.6 %) $ 4,038 $ 13,176 69,205 83,698 (14,493) (17.3 %)\nOther expenses:\nDepreciation and amortization 46,047 52,266 (6,219) (11.9 %)\nLoss on impairment of real estate 41,847 — 41,847 n/m\nTransaction related costs 738 16,135 (15,397) (95.4 %)\nGeneral and administrative 4,927 5,720 (793) (13.9 %)\nTotal other expenses 93,559 74,121 19,438 26.2 %\nGain on sale of real estate 8,456 244 8,212 n/m\nInterest and other income 196 281 (85) (30.2 %)\nInterest expense (42,580) (28,835) (13,745) 47.7 %\nGain on early extinguishment of debt 264 — 264 n/m\nLoss before income tax expense and equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint venture (58,018) (18,733) (39,285) n/m\nIncome tax expense (230) (95) (135) 142.1 %\nEquity in net losses of investees (166) (765) 599 (78.3 %)\nNet loss $ (58,414) $ (19,593) $ (38,821) 198.1 %\nWeighted average common shares outstanding (basic and diluted) 51,197 48,403 2,794 5.8 %\nPer common share amounts (basic and diluted):\nNet loss $ (1.14) $ (0.41) $ (0.73) 178.0 %\nn/m - not meaningful\n(1) Comparable properties consists of 123 properties we owned on September 30, 2024 and which we owned continuously since July 1, 2023 and excludes 17 properties classified as held for sale,\nfive properties affected by significant redevelopment activities and two properties owned by an unconsolidated joint venture in which we own a 51% interest.\n(2) Our definition of net operating income, or NOI, and our reconciliation of net income (loss) to NOI are included below under the heading “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nReferences to changes in the income and expense categories below relate to the comparison of consolidated results for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nRental income. Rental income for non-comparable properties declined $14,129 related to our property disposition activities, partially offset by an increase\nin rental income of $4,546 due to the lease-up of certain properties affected by significant redevelopment activities. Rental income for comparable properties\ndeclined $3,158 as a result of increased vacancies and lower rents from lease renewals at certain of our properties in the 2024 period. Rental income includes\nnon-cash straight line rent adjustments totaling $8,854 in the 2024 period and $8,691 in the 2023 period, and amortization of acquired real estate leases and\nassumed real estate lease obligations totaling ($59) in the 2024 period and $56 in the 2023 period.\n25\nTable of Contents\nReal estate taxes. Real estate taxes increased $2,217 for redevelopment properties due to the substantial completion of redevelopment activities at certain\nproperties and $1,535 for comparable properties resulting from successful tax appeals at certain of our properties in the 2023 period, partially offset by a\ndecrease of $1,082 related to our property disposition activities.\nUtility expenses. Utility expenses for comparable properties increased $465 primarily due to higher electricity costs in the 2024 period and $51 due to the\nsubstantial completion of redevelopment activities at certain properties, partially offset by a decrease of $107 related to our property disposition activities.\nOther operating expenses. Other operating expenses for non-comparable properties declined $2,133 related to our property disposition activities, partially\noffset by an increase of $609 due to the substantial completion of redevelopment activities at certain properties. Other operating expenses for comparable\nproperties increased $197 due to higher repair and maintenance and salary costs in the 2024 period.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization for comparable properties declined $519 due to certain leasing related assets becoming fully\ndepreciated since July 1, 2023, partially offset by depreciation and amortization of improvements made to certain of our properties since July 1, 2023.\nDepreciation and amortization for non-comparable properties increased $2,551 due to the substantial completion of redevelopment activities at certain\nproperties, partially offset by a decline of $8,251 related to our property disposition activities.\nLoss on impairment of real estate. We recorded a $41,847 loss on impairment of real estate in the 2024 period to reduce the carrying value of 10 properties\nto their estimated fair values less costs to sell.\nTransaction related costs. Transaction related costs in the 2024 period consist of costs related to our evaluation of potential financing transactions.\nTransaction related costs in the 2023 period consist of costs incurred in connection with our terminated merger with Diversified Healthcare Trust, or DHC, and\nrelated financings.\nGeneral and administrative. The decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily the result of a decrease in base business management fees\nresulting from a decrease in average total market capitalization and a decrease in share based compensation in the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period.\nGain on sale of real estate. We recorded a $8,456 net gain on sale of real estate resulting from the sale of six properties in the 2024 period. We recorded a\n$244 gain on sale of real estate resulting from the sale of one property in the 2023 period.\nInterest and other income. The decrease in interest and other income is primarily due to the effect of lower cash balances invested in the 2024 period\ncompared to the 2023 period.\nInterest expense. The increase in interest expense is due to higher weighted average interest rates in the 2024 period.\nGain on early extinguishment of debt. We recorded a gain on early extinguishment of debt of $264 in the 2024 period resulting from the exchange of certain\nof the 2025 Notes for our common shares. For more information regarding these exchanges, see Note 7 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nIncome tax expense. Income tax expense is primarily the result of operating income earned in jurisdictions where we are subject to state income taxes and\ncan fluctuate based on the timing of our income, including as a result of gains or losses on the sale of real estate or the repayment of debt.\nEquity in net losses of investees. Equity in net losses of investees represents our proportionate share of losses from our investments in two unconsolidated\njoint ventures.\nNet loss. Net loss and net loss per basic and diluted common share decreased in the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period primarily as a result of the\nchanges noted above.\n26\nTable of Contents\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024, Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nNon-Comparable\nProperties Results\nComparable Properties (1) Results Nine Months Ended Consolidated Results\nNine Months Ended September 30, September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change 2024 2023 2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nRental income $ 329,763 $ 340,686 $ (10,923) (3.2 %) $ 53,978 $ 59,094 $ 383,741 $ 399,780 $ (16,039) (4.0 %)\nOperating expenses:\nReal estate taxes 38,740 38,017 723 1.9 % 8,623 7,474 47,363 45,491 1,872 4.1 %\nUtility expenses 18,738 17,534 1,204 6.9 % 3,044 2,928 21,782 20,462 1,320 6.5 %\nOther operating expenses 70,355 67,932 2,423 3.6 % 10,742 12,705 81,097 80,637 460 0.6 %\nTotal operating expenses 127,833 123,483 4,350 3.5 % 22,409 23,107 150,242 146,590 3,652 2.5 %\nNet operating income (2) $ 201,930 $ 217,203 $ (15,273) (7.0 %) $ 31,569 $ 35,987 233,499 253,190 (19,691) (7.8 %)\nOther expenses:\nDepreciation and amortization 146,779 155,559 (8,780) (5.6 %)\nLoss on impairment of real estate 173,579 — 173,579 n/m\nTransaction related costs 971 30,534 (29,563) (96.8 %)\nGeneral and administrative 15,861 17,430 (1,569) (9.0 %)\nTotal other expenses 337,190 203,523 133,667 65.7 %\nGain on sale of real estate 6,008 487 5,521 n/m\nInterest and other income 1,779 782 997 127.5 %\nInterest expense (116,405) (80,591) (35,814) 44.4 %\nGain on early extinguishment of debt 225,637 — 225,637 n/m\nIncome (loss) before income tax expense and equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint venture 13,328 (29,655) 42,983 (144.9 %)\nIncome tax expense (179) (336) 157 (46.7 %)\nEquity in net losses of investees (576) (2,290) 1,714 (74.8 %)\nNet income (loss) $ 12,573 $ (32,281) $ 44,854 (138.9 %)\nWeighted average common shares outstanding (basic and diluted) 49,444 48,365 1,079 2.2 %\nPer common share amounts (basic and diluted):\nNet (loss) income $ 0.25 $ (0.67) $ 0.92 (137.3 %)\nn/m - not meaningful\n(1) Comparable properties consists of 123 properties we owned on September 30, 2024 and which we owned continuously since January 1, 2023 and excludes 17 properties classified as held for sale,\nfive properties affected by significant redevelopment activities and two properties owned by an unconsolidated joint venture in which we own a 51% interest.\n(2) Our definition of NOI and our reconciliation of net income (loss) to NOI are included below under the heading “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nReferences to changes in the income and expense categories below relate to the comparison of consolidated results for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nRental income.

Utility expenses increased $536 due to the substantial completion of redevelopment activities at certain properties and $1,204 for\ncomparable properties primarily due to the lease-up of certain previously vacant properties and increased utility expenses at newly vacant properties where\ntenants previously paid utility expenses directly in the 2024 period, partially offset by a decline of $420 related to our property disposition activities.\nOther operating expenses. Other operating expenses for comparable properties increased $2,423 due to higher repair and maintenance costs, snow removal\ncosts and insurance costs in the 2024 period and $1,778 due to the substantial completion of redevelopment activities at certain properties, partially offset by a\ndecline of $3,741 related to our property disposition activities.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization for comparable properties declined $6,103 due to certain leasing related assets becoming\nfully depreciated since January 1, 2023, partially offset by depreciation and amortization of improvements made to certain of our properties since January 1,\n2023. Depreciation and amortization for non-comparable properties increased $9,590 due to the substantial completion of redevelopment activities at certain\nproperties, partially offset by a decline of $12,267 related to our property disposition activities.\nLoss on impairment of real estate. We recorded a $173,579 loss on impairment of real estate in the 2024 period to reduce the carrying value of 16 properties\nto their estimated fair values less costs to sell.\nTransaction related costs.

The increase in interest expense is due to higher weighted average interest rates in the 2024 period.\nGain on early extinguishment of debt. We recorded a gain on early extinguishment of debt of $225,637 in the 2024 period resulting from the Senior Note\nExchange and exchanges of certain of the 2025 Notes for our common shares. For more information regarding the Senior Note Exchange and the exchanges of\nthe 2025 Notes for our common shares, see Note 7 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on\nForm 10-Q.\nIncome tax expense. Income tax expense is primarily the result of operating income earned in jurisdictions where we are subject to state income taxes and\ncan fluctuate based on the timing of our income, including as a result of gains or losses on the sale of real estate or repayment of debt.\nEquity in net losses of investees. Equity in net losses of investees represents our proportionate share of losses from our investments in two unconsolidated\njoint ventures.\nNet income (loss). Net income (loss) and net income (loss) per basic and diluted common share increased in the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period\nprimarily as a result of the changes noted above.\n28\nTable of Contents\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe present certain “non-GAAP financial measures” within the meaning of the applicable SEC rules, including the calculations below of NOI, funds from\noperations, or FFO, and normalized funds from operations, or Normalized FFO. These measures do not represent cash generated by operating activities in\naccordance with GAAP and should not be considered alternatives to net (loss) income as indicators of our operating performance or as measures of our liquidity.\nThese measures should be considered in conjunction with net (loss) income as presented in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive net (loss)\nincome. We consider these non-GAAP measures to be appropriate supplemental measures of operating performance for a REIT, along with net (loss) income.\nWe believe these measures provide useful information to investors because by excluding the effects of certain historical amounts, such as depreciation and\namortization expense, they may facilitate a comparison of our operating performance between periods and with other REITs and, in the case of NOI, reflecting\nonly those income and expense items that are generated and incurred at the property level may help both investors and management to understand the operations\nof our properties.\nNet Operating Income\nThe calculation of NOI excludes certain components of net (loss) income in order to provide results that are more closely related to our property level\nresults of operations. We calculate NOI as shown below. We define NOI as income from our rental of real estate less our property operating expenses. NOI\nexcludes amortization of capitalized tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions that we record as depreciation and amortization expense. We use NOI to\nevaluate individual and company-wide property level performance. Other real estate companies and REITs may calculate NOI differently than we do.\nThe following table presents the reconciliation of net income (loss) to NOI for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet (loss) income $ (58,414) $ (19,593) $ 12,573 $ (32,281)\nEquity in net losses of investees 166 765 576 2,290\nIncome tax expense 230 95 179 336\n(Loss) income before income tax expense and equity in net\nlosses of investees (58,018) (18,733) 13,328 (29,655)\nGain on early extinguishment of debt (264) — (225,637) —\nInterest expense 42,580 28,835 116,405 80,591\nInterest and other income (196) (281) (1,779) (782)\nGain on sale of real estate (8,456) (244) (6,008) (487)\nGeneral and administrative 4,927 5,720 15,861 17,430\nTransaction related costs 738 16,135 971 30,534\nLoss on impairment of real estate 41,847 — 173,579 —\nDepreciation and amortization 46,047 52,266 146,779 155,559\nNOI $ 69,205 $ 83,698 $ 233,499 $ 253,190\n29\nTable of Contents\nFunds From Operations and Normalized Funds From Operations\nWe calculate FFO and Normalized FFO as shown below. FFO is calculated on the basis defined by The National Association of Real Estate Investment\nTrusts, which is net (loss) income, calculated in accordance with GAAP, plus real estate depreciation and amortization of consolidated properties and our\nproportionate share of the real estate depreciation and amortization of unconsolidated joint venture properties, but excluding impairment charges on real estate\nassets and any gain or loss on sale of real estate, as well as certain other adjustments currently not applicable to us. In calculating Normalized FFO, we adjust for\nthe other items shown below and include business management incentive fees, if any, only in the fourth quarter versus the quarter when they are recognized as\nan expense in accordance with GAAP due to their quarterly volatility not necessarily being indicative of our core operating performance and the uncertainty as\nto whether any such business management incentive fees will be payable when all contingencies for determining such fees are known at the end of the calendar\nyear. FFO and Normalized FFO are among the factors considered by our Board of Trustees when determining the amount of distributions to our shareholders.\nOther factors include, but are not limited to, requirements to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT, limitations in our credit agreement and public\ndebt covenants, the availability to us of debt and equity capital, our expectation of our future capital requirements and operating performance and our expected\nneeds for and availability of cash to pay our obligations. Other real estate companies and REITs may calculate FFO and Normalized FFO differently than we do.\nThe following table presents the reconciliation of net (loss) income to FFO and Normalized FFO for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet (loss) income $ (58,414) $ (19,593) $ 12,573 $ (32,281)\nAdd (less): Depreciation and amortization:\nConsolidated properties 46,047 52,266 146,779 155,559\nUnconsolidated joint venture properties 616 840 1,869 2,538\nLoss on impairment of real estate 41,847 — 173,579 —\nGain on sale of real estate (8,456) (244) (6,008) (487)\nFFO 21,640 33,269 328,792 125,329\nAdd (less): Transaction related costs 738 16,135 971 30,534\nGain on early extinguishment of debt (264) — (225,637) —\nLease termination fees for sold property — — (10,524) —\nNormalized FFO $ 22,114 $ 49,404 $ 93,602 $ 155,863\nWeighted average common shares outstanding (basic and diluted) 51,197 48,403 49,444 48,365\nFFO per common share (basic and diluted) $ 0.42 $ 0.69 $ 6.65 $ 2.59\nNormalized FFO per common share (basic and diluted) $ 0.43 $ 1.02 $ 1.89 $ 3.22\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur Operating Liquidity and Resources (dollar amounts in thousands, except per share amounts)\nOur principal sources of funds to meet operating and capital expenses, pay debt service obligations and make distributions to our shareholders are the\noperating cash flows we generate from our properties, net proceeds from property sales and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Our future cash flows\nfrom operating activities will depend primarily upon:\n• our ability to collect rent from our tenants;\n• our ability to maintain or increase the occupancy of, and the rental rates at, our properties;\n• our ability to control operating and capital expenses at our properties;\n• our ability to successfully sell properties that we market for sale; and\n• our ability to develop, redevelop or reposition properties to produce cash flows in excess of our cost of capital and property operating and capital\nexpenses.\n30\nTable of Contents\nThe office industry has been adversely affected by shifts in office space utilization, including increased remote work arrangements and tenants consolidating\ntheir real estate footprint. Demand for office space continues to face headwinds and the duration and ultimate impact of current trends on our properties remains\nuncertain and subject to change. These conditions continue to have a significant negative impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nWe are actively pursuing several strategic initiatives to improve liquidity, including asset sales and debt refinancing opportunities.\nWe plan to selectively sell certain properties from time to time to manage leverage levels and to improve our asset diversification, our geographic make-up\nand the average age of our properties, lengthen the weighted average term of our leases and increase tenant retention. During the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, we sold seven properties for an aggregate sales price of $84,810, excluding closing costs. We continue to evaluate our portfolio and are\ncurrently in various stages of marketing certain of our properties for sale. As of October 29, 2024, we had 17 properties containing approximately 1,609,000\nrentable square feet which are under agreement to sell for an aggregate sales price of $119,152. We cannot be sure we will sell any properties we are marketing\nfor sale for prices in excess of their carrying values or otherwise. In addition, our pending sales are subject to conditions; accordingly, we cannot be sure that we\nwill complete these sales or that these sales will not be delayed or the pricing will not change.\nThe following is a summary of our sources and uses of cash flows for the periods presented, as reflected in our condensed consolidated statements of cash\nflows:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of period $ 26,714 $ 12,249\nNet cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities 41,442 109,133\nInvesting activities (13,251) (156,942)\nFinancing activities (18,636) 75,188\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period $ 36,269 $ 39,628\nThe decrease in cash provided by operating activities for the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period was primarily due to higher interest expense and\ndecreased NOI due to property dispositions and reductions in occupied space at certain of our properties in the 2024 period. The decrease in cash used in\ninvesting activities in the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period was primarily due to decreased capital expenditures in the 2024 period, partially offset by\nhigher proceeds received from property sales. The change from cash provided by financing activities in the 2023 period to cash used in financing activities in the\n2024 period was primarily due to lower net borrowings and payment of debt issuance costs, partially offset by decreased distributions to our common\nshareholders in the 2024 period.\nOur Investment and Financing Liquidity and Resources (dollar amounts in thousands, except per share amounts)\nIn order to meet cash needs that may result from our desire or need to pay operating or capital expenses, make distributions or fund acquisitions, we\nmaintain a revolving credit facility which is governed by our credit agreement. Our obligations under our credit agreement are secured by a pledge by certain of\nour subsidiaries of all of their respective equity interests in certain of our direct and indirect property owning subsidiaries and first mortgage liens on 19\nproperties owned by the pledged subsidiaries with a gross book value of real estate assets of $1,012,536 as of September 30, 2024. We can borrow, repay and\nreborrow funds available under our revolving credit facility until maturity, and no principal repayments are due until maturity. The maturity date of our credit\nagreement is January 29, 2027, and, subject to the payment of an extension fee and meeting certain other requirements, we can extend the stated maturity date of\nour revolving credit facility by one year. Our credit agreement contains a number of covenants, including covenants that require us to maintain certain financial\nratios, restrict our ability to incur additional debt in excess of calculated amounts and, subject to limited exceptions, restrict our ability to increase our\ndistribution rate above the current level of $0.01 per common share per quarter and enter into share repurchases. Availability of borrowings under our credit\nagreement is subject to ongoing minimum performance and market values of the 19 collateral properties, our satisfying certain financial covenants and other\ncredit facility conditions.\nInterest payable on borrowings under our credit agreement is based on a rate of SOFR plus a margin of 350 basis points. We are also required to pay an\nunused facility fee on the amount of total lending commitments, which was 25 basis points per annum at September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the\nannual interest rate payable on borrowings under our credit agreement was 8.4%. As of September 30, 2024, we had $200,000 outstanding under our revolving\ncredit facility, $100,000 outstanding under our term loan and $125,000 available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility. In October 2024, we\n31\nTable of Contents\nborrowed $125,000 under our revolving credit facility to preserve financial flexibility. As of October 29, 2024, we had fully drawn our $325,000 revolving\ncredit facility and $100,000 was outstanding under our term loan.\nSenior Secured Notes Issuance and Senior Unsecured Notes Redemption\nIn February 2024, we issued $300,000 of the 2029 Notes. The aggregate net proceeds from this offering were $270,712, after initial purchaser discounts and\nother offering expenses. The 2029 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint, several and senior secured basis by certain of our subsidiaries and\nsecured by a pledge of all of the respective equity interests of the subsidiary guarantors and first mortgage liens on 17 properties with a gross book value of real\nestate assets of $619,467 as of September 30, 2024. The 2029 Notes require semi-annual payments of interest only and are prepayable, at par plus accrued\ninterest, after March 31, 2028.\nIn March 2024, we redeemed, at par plus accrued interest, all $350,000 of our 4.25% senior unsecured notes due 2024 using the proceeds from the 2029\nNotes and borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\nSenior Notes Exchanges\nIn June 2024, in connection with the Senior Note Exchange, we exchanged $567,429 of the New 2029 Notes for $865,219 aggregate principal of the\nExisting Notes. The New 2029 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint, several and senior secured basis by certain of our subsidiaries and are\nsecured by first mortgage liens on 19 properties with a gross book value of real estate assets of $716,969 as of September 30, 2024 and second mortgage liens on\nthe 19 properties securing our credit agreement. The New 2029 Notes require semi-annual payments of interest only and are prepayable, at par plus accrued\ninterest, after June 3, 2028.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, in a series of exchange transactions, we exchanged an aggregate principal amount of $8,300\nof the 2025 Notes for an aggregate 3,184,432 of our common shares.\nIn October 2024, in a series of exchange transactions, we exchanged an additional aggregate principal amount of $34,154 of the 2025 Notes for an\naggregate principal amount of $42,570 of new 9.0% senior secured notes due 2029 on substantially similar terms as the New 2029 Notes and 1,870,238 of our\ncommon shares. For more information regarding the Senior Note Exchange, our subsequent senior note exchanges and the New 2029 Notes, see Note 7 to our\nCondensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nAs of September 30, 2024, our debt maturities (other than our revolving credit facility), consisting of senior notes, a term loan and mortgage notes, were as\nfollows:\nYear Debt Maturities\n2024 $ —\n2025 490,854\n2026 140,488\n2027 180,784\n2028 123,487\n2029 and thereafter 1,197,617\nTotal $ 2,133,230\nNone of our unsecured debt obligations require sinking fund payments prior to their maturity dates. Our mortgage notes currently require monthly payments\nof interest only; however, certain of our mortgage notes will require payments of principal and interest after a specified date through maturity.\nIn addition to our debt obligations, as of September 30, 2024, we had estimated unspent leasing related obligations of $100,646, of which we expect to\nspend $66,949 over the next 12 months.\nAs of October 30, 2024, our total available liquidity was comprised of $146,448 of cash and, in addition to long-term debt, the 2025 Notes are due within\none year from the date of issuance of these financial statements. We are currently in negotiations with certain holders of the 2025 Notes for a potential note\nexchange. While we believe a note exchange with certain holders of the 2025 Notes would alleviate the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as going\nconcern, we are not able to conclude that it is probable that the negotiations will result in an exchange that satisfies the 2025 Notes prior to their maturity. If we\nare unable to consummate a transaction that refinances the 2025 Notes on terms which, in our view, allow us to continue as a going\n32\nTable of Contents\nconcern, our Board of Trustees may consider a reorganization in a bankruptcy court. As a result of the foregoing, we have concluded that there is substantial\ndoubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year from the date of issuance of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, or October 30, 2024.\nOur ability to obtain, and the costs of, our future debt financings will depend primarily on credit market conditions and our creditworthiness. We have no\ncontrol over market conditions. Potential investors and lenders will likely evaluate our ability to fund required debt service, repay debts when they become due\nand pay distributions to shareholders by reviewing our business practices and plans to balance our use of debt and equity capital so that our financial profile and\nleverage ratios afford us flexibility to withstand any reasonably anticipated adverse changes. Similarly, our ability to raise equity capital in the future will depend\nprimarily upon equity capital market conditions and our ability to conduct our business to maintain and grow our operating cash flows. It is uncertain what the\nultimate impacts of inflationary pressures, sustained high interest rates, deteriorating office fundamentals and market sentiment toward the office sector or any\neconomic recession will be. A protracted and extensive economic recession, further deterioration of office fundamentals or continued or intensified disruptions\nin capital markets could limit our access to financing from public sources, would likely increase our cost of capital and impact our ability to satisfy covenants\nand conditions under our credit agreement or senior notes.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid quarterly distributions to our shareholders totaling $1,477 using cash on hand. On October 16,\n2024, we declared a regular quarterly distribution payable to shareholders of record on October 28, 2024 of $0.01 per share, or approximately $555. We expect\nto pay this distribution on or about November 14, 2024 using cash on hand. We determine our distribution payout ratio with consideration for restrictions under\nour credit agreement, our expected capital expenditures, cash flows from operations and payment of debt obligations. For more information regarding the\ndistributions we paid and declared during 2024, see Note 9 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q.\nWe owned a 51% interest in an unconsolidated joint venture which owned two properties at September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the properties\nowned by this joint venture were encumbered by $50,000 principal amount of mortgage indebtedness, none of which is recourse to us. As of September 30,\n2024, we did not control the activities that are most significant to this joint venture and, as a result, we accounted for our investment in this joint venture under\nthe equity method of accounting. For more information on the financial condition and results of operations of this joint venture, see Note 4 to our Condensed\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Other than this joint venture, as of September 30, 2024, we\nhad no off balance sheet arrangements that have had or that we expect would be reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, changes in\nfinancial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nDebt Covenants (dollars in thousands)\nOur principal debt obligations as of September 30, 2024 consisted of $200,000 of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility, $100,000\noutstanding principal amount under our secured term loan, an outstanding principal balance of $1,855,910 of senior notes and mortgage notes with an\noutstanding principal balance of $177,320. Also, the two properties owned by the joint venture in which we owned a 51% interest secured an additional\nmortgage note. Our senior notes are governed by indentures and their supplements. Our credit agreement and our senior notes indentures and their supplements\nprovide for acceleration of payment of all amounts outstanding upon the occurrence and continuation of certain events of default, such as, in the case of our\ncredit agreement, a change of control of us, which includes RMR ceasing to act as our business and property manager. Our credit agreement and our senior notes\nindentures and their supplements also contain a number of covenants, including those that restrict our ability to incur debts, including debts secured by\nmortgages on our properties, in excess of calculated amounts, require us to comply with certain financial covenants and, in the case of our credit agreement,\nrestrict our ability to increase our distribution rate above the current level of $0.01 per common share per quarter. As of September 30, 2024, we believe we were\nin compliance with the terms and conditions of our respective covenants under our credit agreement and our senior notes indentures and their supplements. Our\nmortgage notes are non-recourse, subject to certain limited exceptions, and do not contain any material financial covenants.\nAs of September 30, 2024, adjusted total assets for covenant purposes as defined in our senior notes indentures were $5,173,078. Assets serving as\ncollateral under our credit agreement, our secured senior notes or mortgage notes represented $2,756,946 of adjusted total assets, as defined in our senior notes\nindentures. Our unencumbered assets represented $2,416,132 of adjusted total assets.\n33\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents the calculation of adjusted total assets to total assets in accordance with GAAP as of September 30, 2024:\nTotal assets $ 3,725,951\nPlus: accumulated depreciation 619,474\nPlus: adjustments to reflect original cost of real estate assets 1,184,176\nLess: accounts receivable and intangibles (356,523)\nAdjusted total assets $ 5,173,078\nNeither our credit agreement nor our senior notes indentures and their supplements contain provisions for acceleration which could be triggered by our\ncredit ratings.\nOur credit agreement and our senior notes indentures and their supplements contain cross default provisions to any other debts of more than $25,000 (or\nmore than $50,000 in certain circumstances).\nRelated Person Transactions\nWe have relationships and historical and continuing transactions with RMR, RMR Inc. and others related to them. For more information about these and\nother such relationships and related person transactions, see Notes 10 and 11 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of\nthis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our 2023 Annual Report, our definitive Proxy Statement for our 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and our other filings\nwith the SEC. In addition, see the section captioned “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of our 2023 Annual Report for a description of risks that may arise as a\nresult of these and other related person transactions and relationships. We may engage in additional transactions with related persons, including businesses to\nwhich RMR or its subsidiaries provide management services.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect\nreported amounts. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include purchase\nprice allocations, useful lives of fixed assets and assessment of impairment of real estate and the related intangibles.\nA discussion of our critical accounting estimates is included in our 2023 Annual Report. There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting\nestimates since the year ended December 31, 2023.\n34\nTable of Contents\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data)\nWe are exposed to risks associated with market changes in interest rates. We manage our exposure to this market risk by monitoring available financing\nalternatives. Our strategy to manage exposure to changes in interest rates has not materially changed since December 31, 2023. Other than as described below,\nwe do not currently foresee any significant changes in our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or in how we manage this exposure in the near future.\nFixed Rate Debt\nAs of September 30, 2024, our outstanding fixed rate debt consisted of the following:\nPrincipal Annual Interest Annual Interest Interest Payments\nDebt Balance (1) Rate (1) Expense Maturity Due\nSenior unsecured notes $ 490,854 4.500% $ 22,088 2025 Semi-annually\nSenior unsecured notes 140,488 2.650% 3,723 2026 Semi-annually\nSenior unsecured notes 80,784 2.400% 1,939 2027 Semi-annually\nMortgage note (one property) 26,340 8.139% 2,144 2028 Monthly\nMortgage note (one property) 42,700 8.272% 3,532 2028 Monthly\nMortgage note (two properties) 54,300 7.671% 4,165 2028 Monthly\nSenior secured notes 300,000 9.000% 27,000 2029 Semi-annually\nSenior secured notes 567,429 9.000% 51,069 2029 Semi-annually\nSenior unsecured notes 114,355 3.450% 3,945 2031 Semi-annually\nMortgage note (one property) 30,680 7.210% 2,212 2033 Monthly\nMortgage note (one property) 8,400 7.305% 614 2033 Monthly\nMortgage note (one property) 14,900 7.717% 1,150 2033 Monthly\nSenior unsecured notes 162,000 6.375% 10,328 2050 Quarterly\nTotal $ 2,033,230 $ 133,909\n(1) The principal balances and annual interest rates are the amounts stated in the applicable contracts. In accordance with GAAP, our carrying values and recorded interest expense may differ from\nthese amounts because of market conditions at the time we issued or assumed these debts. For more information, see Notes 7 and 8 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included\nin Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nOur senior notes require semi-annual or quarterly interest payments through maturity. Our mortgage notes require monthly payments of interest only or\npayments of principal and interest through maturity. As these debts require interest to be paid at a fixed rate, changes in market interest rates during the term of\nthese debts will not affect our interest obligations. If these debts were refinanced at interest rates which are one percentage point higher or lower than shown\nabove, our annual interest cost would increase or decrease by approximately $20,333.\nChanges in market interest rates would also affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt obligations; increases in market interest rates decrease the fair value\nof our fixed rate debt, while decreases in market interest rates increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt. In response to significant and prolonged increases in\ninflation, the U.S. Federal Reserve has raised interest rates multiple times since the beginning of 2022. Although the U.S. Federal Reserve has recently lowered\ninterest rates and indicated that it may further lower interest rates in 2024, we cannot be sure that it will do so, and interest rates may remain at the current high\nlevels or continue to increase. Based on the balances outstanding at September 30, 2024, and discounted cash flow analyses through the respective maturity\ndates, and assuming no other changes in factors that may affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt obligations, a hypothetical immediate one percentage point\nincrease in interest rates would change the fair value of those obligations by approximately $58,913.\nOur fixed rate debt arrangements may allow us to make repayments earlier than the stated maturity date. In some cases, we are not allowed to make early\nrepayment prior to a cutoff date and we are generally allowed to make prepayments only at a premium equal to a make whole amount, as defined, which is\ngenerally designed to preserve a stated yield to the note holder. These prepayment rights may afford us opportunities to mitigate the risk of refinancing our debts\nat maturity at a higher rate by refinancing prior to maturity.\n35\nTable of Contents\nIn addition to the fixed rate debt presented in the table above, at September 30, 2024, we had a noncontrolling ownership interest of 51% in an\nunconsolidated joint venture that owned two properties that were secured by fixed rate debt consisting of the following mortgage note:\nOur JV Annual\nAnnual\nOwnership Principal Interest Interest\nInterest Rate\nDebt Interest Balance (1)(2) (1) Expense Maturity Payments Due\nMortgage note (two properties) 51% $ 50,000 4.090% $ 2,045 2029 Monthly\n(1) The principal balance and annual interest rate are the amounts stated in the applicable contracts. In accordance with GAAP, the joint venture’s recorded interest expense may differ from these\namounts because of market conditions at the time it incurred the debt.\n(2) Reflects the entire balance of the debt secured by the properties and is not adjusted to reflect the interest in the joint venture we do not own. None of the debt is recourse to us.\nFloating Rate Debt\nAs of September 30, 2024, our floating rate debt consisted of $200,000 outstanding under our $325,000 secured revolving credit facility and $100,000\noutstanding on our secured term loan, both of which are governed by our credit agreement. Our credit agreement matures on January 29, 2027. We can borrow,\nrepay and reborrow funds available under our revolving credit facility, and no principal payments are due under our credit agreement until maturity. Subject to\nthe payment of an extension fee and meeting certain other requirements, we can extend the stated maturity date of our revolving credit facility by one year.\nBorrowings under our credit agreement are in U.S. dollars and require interest to be paid at a rate of SOFR plus a margin of 350 basis points. Accordingly,\nwe are vulnerable to changes in U.S. dollar based short term rates, specifically SOFR. Generally, a change in interest rates would not affect the value of our\nfloating rate debt but would affect our operating results.\nThe following table presents the impact a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have on our annual floating rate interest expense as of\nSeptember 30, 2024:\nImpact of an Increase in Interest Rates\nTotal Interest Annual Earnings\nAnnual Interest Rate (1) Outstanding Debt Expense Per Year Per Share Impact (2)\nAt September 30, 2024 8.4% $ 300,000 $ 25,200 $ 0.51\nOne percentage point increase 9.4% $ 300,000 $ 28,200 $ 0.57\n(1) Based on SOFR plus a margin of 350 basis points per annum as of September 30, 2024.\n(2) Based on the weighted average common shares outstanding (diluted) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nThe following table presents the impact a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have on our annual floating rate interest expense as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 if we were fully drawn on our revolving credit facility and term loan:\nImpact of an Increase in Interest Rates\nTotal Interest Annual Earnings\nAnnual Interest Rate (1) Outstanding Debt (2) Expense Per Year Per Share Impact (3)\nAt September 30, 2024 8.4% $ 425,000 $ 35,700 $ 0.72\nOne percentage point increase 9.4% $ 425,000 $ 39,950 $ 0.81\n(1) Based on SOFR plus a margin of 350 basis points per annum as of September 30, 2024.\n(2) Represents the maximum amount available under our revolving credit facility and term loan.\n(3) Based on the weighted average common shares outstanding (diluted) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nThe foregoing tables show the impact of an immediate increase in floating interest rates as of September 30, 2024. If interest rates were to increase\ngradually over time, the impact would be spread over time. Our exposure to fluctuations in floating interest rates will increase or decrease in the future with\nincreases or decreases in the outstanding amount under our revolving credit facility or our term loan, or our other floating rate debt, if any. Although we have no\npresent plans to do so, we may in the future enter into hedge arrangements from time to time to mitigate our exposure to changes in interest rates.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nAs of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the\nparticipation of our Managing Trustees, our President and Chief Operating Officer and our\n36\nTable of Contents\nChief Financial Officer and Treasurer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based upon that evaluation, our Managing Trustees, our President and Chief Operating Officer and our Chief Financial\nOfficer and Treasurer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or\nare reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nWarning Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and\nother securities laws that are subject to risks and uncertainties.

All persons dealing with Office\nProperties Income Trust in any way shall look only to the assets of Office Properties Income Trust for the payment of any sum or the performance of any\nobligation.\n38\nTable of Contents\nPart II. Other Information\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to risks and uncertainties, a number of which are described under the caption “Risk Factors” in our 2023 Annual Report. The risks\ndescribed in our 2023 Annual Report and below may not be the only risks we face but are risks we believe may be material at this time. Other risks of which we\nare not yet aware, or that we currently believe are not material, may also materially and adversely impact our business operations or financial results. If any of\nthe events or circumstances described in the risk factors contained in our 2023 Annual Report or included below occurs, our business, financial condition,\nliquidity, results of operations or ability to pay distributions to our shareholders could be adversely impacted and the value of an investment in our securities\ncould decline. Investors and prospective investors should consider the risks described in our 2023 Annual Report and below and the information contained under\nthe caption “Warning Concerning Forward-Looking Statements” and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q before deciding whether to invest in our\nsecurities.\nRisk Relating to Going Concern\nWe have concluded that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur portfolio has been adversely affected by shifts in office space utilization, including increased remote work arrangements and tenants consolidating their\nreal estate footprint. Demand for office space continues to face headwinds and declining rents and increasing costs to relet space when tenants can be identified\ncontinue to impact the market. In addition, there are limited debt or equity financing alternatives available to us to refinance our debt and financing sources we\nhave utilized have increased our cost of capital. The duration and ultimate impact of these factors on our properties and our business remains uncertain and\nsubject to change; however, these conditions continue to have a significant negative impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. As of\nOctober 30, 2024, our total available liquidity was comprised of $146,448 of cash and, in addition to long-term debt, the 2025 Notes are due within one year\nfrom the date of issuance of these financial statements.\nAs discussed in Note 1 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, based on these\nchallenges and upcoming debt maturities, we have concluded that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year\nafter the date of issuance of such financial statements, or October 30, 2024. Our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon many factors, including our\nability to meet our debt covenants, repay our debts and other obligations when due and our ability to successfully negotiate a note exchange with certain holders\nof the 2025 Notes.\nWhile we believe a note exchange with certain holders of the 2025 Notes would alleviate the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as going\nconcern, any exchange is subject to the approval and participation of holders of the 2025 Notes and other closing conditions and we cannot provide assurance\nthat the 2025 Notes exchange will be completed. If we are unable to consummate a transaction that refinances the 2025 Notes on terms which, in our view, allow\nus to continue as a going concern, our Board of Trustees may consider a reorganization in a bankruptcy court. We cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain\nany future financing, and any such financing we may obtain may not be sufficient to repay our existing debt. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds, we may\nbe unable to continue as a going concern.\n39\nTable of Contents\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds (dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nIssuance of equity securities. Between September 17, 2024 and September 30, 2024, we entered into a series of privately negotiated exchange agreements,\nunder which we issued an aggregate of 629,943 of our common shares in exchange for $1,500 of the 2025 Notes. Based on the aggregate principal amount of\nthe 2025 Notes exchanged plus $10 aggregate accrued interest thereon through the relevant date of exchange, the common shares issued had an average implied\nvalue of approximately $2.26 per share. Pursuant to Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the common shares issued in the private\nexchanges were issued in each case to existing security holders of us exclusively in exchange for such holders’ securities and no commission or other\nremuneration was paid or given for soliciting the exchange. Other exemptions may apply.\nIssuer purchases of equity securities. The following table provides information about our purchases of our equity securities during the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2024:\nTotal Number of Shares Maximum Approximate Dollar\nPurchased as Part of Value of Shares that May Yet Be\nNumber of Shares Average Price Paid Publicly Announced Plans Purchased Under the Plans or\nCalendar Month Purchased (1) per Share or Programs Programs\nJuly 1, 2024 - July 31, 2024 13,063 $ 1.98 — $ —\nSeptember 1, 2024 - September 30, 2024 63,579 2.27 — —\nTotal 76,642 $ 2.22 — $ —\n(1) These common share withholdings and purchases were made to satisfy tax withholding and payment obligations of our officers and certain other current and former officers and employees of\nRMR in connection with the vesting of awards of our common shares to them. We withheld and purchased these shares at their fair market value based upon the trading price of our common\nshares at the close of trading on Nasdaq on the purchase date.\nItem 6.

Nothing in the data used or derived from third party sources\nshould be construed as investment advice. Some data and other information presented are also based on our good faith estimates and beliefs, derived from our\nreview of internal surveys and independent sources and our experience. OPI believes that these external sources, estimates and beliefs are reliable and reasonable,\nbut OPI has not independently verified them. Although OPI is not aware of any misstatements regarding the data presented herein, these estimates and beliefs\ninvolve inherent risks and uncertainties and are based on assumptions that are subject to change.\nUnless otherwise expressly noted, (1) all data presented are as of or for the three months ended September 30, 2024, (2) references to “weighted average” mean a\nweighted average by annualized rental income, (3) references to “annualized rental income” mean the annualized contractual rents, as of September 30, 2024,\nincluding straight line rent adjustments and excluding lease value amortization, adjusted for tenant concessions, including free rent and amounts reimbursed to\ntenants, plus estimated recurring expense reimbursements from tenants (annualized rental income may differ from actual historical rental revenues calculated\npursuant to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP), and (4) all data presented excludes two properties, which are encumbered by a $45 million of\nmortgage note, owned by an unconsolidated joint venture in which OPI owns a 51% interest.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis presentation contains non-GAAP financial measures including NOI and Cash NOI. Calculations of, and reconciliations for these metrics to the closest GAAP\nmetrics, are included in an Appendix hereto.

These measures do not\nrepresent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered alternatives to net (loss)income as indicators of OPI's operating performance or as measures of OPI's\nliquidity. These measures should be considered in conjunction with net (loss) income as presented in OPI's condensed consolidated statements of income (loss). OPI considers these non-GAAP measures to be\nappropriate supplemental measures of operating performance for a REIT, along with net (loss) income. OPI believes these measuresprovide useful information to investors because by excluding the effects of\ncertain historical amounts, such as depreciation and amortization expense, they may facilitate a comparison of OPI's operating performance between periods and with other REITs and, in the case of NOI and Cash\nNOI reflecting only those income and expense items that are generated and incurred at the property level may help both investors andmanagement to understand the operations of OPI's properties.\nNOI and Cash NOI\nThe calculations of net operating income, or NOI, and Cash NOI exclude certain components of net (loss) income in order to provide results that are more closely related to OPI's property level results of operations.\nOPI calculates NOI and Cash NOI as shown on page 13. OPI defines NOI as income from OPI's rental of real estate less OPI's property operating expenses. NOI excludes amortization of capitalized tenant\nimprovement costs and leasing commissions that OPI records as depreciation and amortization expense. OPI defines Cash NOI as NOIexcluding non-cash straight line rent adjustments, lease value amortization,\nlease termination fees, if any, and non-cash amortization included in other operating expenses. Other real estate companies and REITs may calculate NOI, Cash NOI differently than OPI does.\nAdjusted total assets and total unencumbered assets include the original cost of real estate assets calculated in accordance with GAAP before impairment writedowns, if any, and exclude depreciation and\namortization, accounts receivable and intangible assets, as defined in OPI's debt agreements. Unencumbered assets is calculated as adjusted total assets for properties not securing debt.\nAnnualized rental income is calculated using the annualized contractual base rents from OPI's tenants pursuant to its lease agreements as of September 30, 2024, plus straight line rent adjustments and estimated\nrecurring expense reimbursements to be paid to OPI and excluding lease value amortization.\nBuilding capital generally include expenditures to replace obsolete building components and expenditures that extend the useful life of existing assets.\nCommitted Leasing Obligations include leasing commissions and tenant improvements based on leases in effect as of September 30, 2024.\nConsolidated income available for debt service is earnings from operations excluding interest expense, depreciation and amortization, loss on asset impairment, gains and losses on early extinguishment of debt,\ngains and losses on sales of properties and equity in earnings of OPI's unconsolidated joint venture and including distributions from OPI's unconsolidated joint venture, if any, determined together with debt service\nfor the period presented.\nGAAP is U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nG&A is general and administrative expenses.\nGross book value of real estate assets is real estate properties at cost, plus certain acquisition costs, if any, before depreciation and purchase price allocations, less impairment writedowns, if any.\nInvestment grade tenants include: (a)investment grade rated tenants; (b)tenants with investment grade rated parent entities that guarantee the tenant's lease obligations; and/or (c)tenants with investment grade\nrated parent entities that do not guarantee the tenant's lease obligations. Tenants contributing 51% of annualized rental income as of September 30, 2024 were investment grade rated (or their payment obligations\nwere guaranteed by an investment grade rated parent) and tenants contributing an additional 8% of annualized rental income as of September 30, 2024 were subsidiaries of an investment grade rated parent\n(although these parent entities are not liable for the payment of rents).\nLeasing capital generally include capital expenditures used to improve tenants' space or amounts paid directly to tenants to improve their space and leasing related costs, such as brokerage commissions and\ntenant inducements.\nNet debt is total debt less cash.\nRentable Square Feet (or SF) represents total square feet available for lease as of the measurement date. Square footage measurements are subject to changes when space is remeasured or reconfigured for new\ntenants.\nTotal debt represents the outstanding principal balance as of the date reported.\nTotal gross assets is total assets plus accumulated depreciation.\nWALT by Revenue or Weighted Average Remaining Lease Term is the average remaining lease term in years weighted based on annualized rental income.\n14\nOFFICE PROPERTIES INCOME TRUST\nINVESTOR PRESENTATION\nNovember 2024\nTwo Newton Place\n255 Washington Street,\nSuite 300\nNewton, MA 02458\nOPIREIT.COM\n15"
