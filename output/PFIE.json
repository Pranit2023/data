(NASDAQ: PFIE), a technology company (the \"Company\") that provides solutions which enhance the efficiency, safety, and reliability of industrial combustion appliances, today reported financial results for its third quarter ending September 30, 2024.\n\n**Third Quarter Summary (comparisons to prior-year quarter)**\n\n  * Revenue of $17.2 million, compared to $14.9 million\n  * Gross profit of $8.3 million, compared to $7.5 million\n  * Gross margin of 48.2%, compared to 50.0%\n  * Net income of $2.2 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, versus $2.0 million and $0.04\n  * Generated EBITDA of $3.1 million, versus $2.9 million\n  * Cash and investments of $16.9 million with no debt\n\n\n\n**Pending Acquisition and Conference Call Update**\n\nOn October 29, 2024, Profire Energy announced it agreed to be acquired by CECO Environmental in an all cash transaction for $2.55 a share. The transaction is anticipated to close in Q1 2025.\n\nAs a result of the pending transaction, and as is common during the pendency of such transactions, Profire will not hold an earnings conference call in connection with its third quarter financial results.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nTotal revenues for the period equaled $17.2 million, compared to $15.2 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $14.9 million in the prior-year quarter. The sequential and year-over-year increase was partially driven by strong activity in our diversification business.\n\nGross profit was $8.3 million, compared to $7.9 million in the second quarter and $7.5 million in the third quarter of 2023. Gross margin was 48% of revenues, compared to 52% of revenues in the prior quarter and 50% of revenues in the prior-year quarter. The sequential and year-over-year decrease is partially related to inflationary pressures across the business as well as the increase in diversification business, driven by critical energy infrastructure and non-oil and gas projects, which can have lower overall project margins.\n\nTotal operating expenses were $5.5 million, compared to $5.3 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $4.9 million in the year-ago quarter. The sequential increase is primarily due to ongoing inflation pressure on our business as well as increased headcount to support strategic growth and increased business activity.\n\nCompared with the same quarter last year, operating expenses for G&A increased 10%, R&D increased 85% and depreciation decreased by 7%. The increase in R&D has been driven by inflation, headcount increases and increased new product development and certification activities.\n\nNet income was $2.2 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, compared to net income of $2.1 million or $0.04 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2024 and $2.0 million or $0.04 per diluted share in the same quarter last year.\n\n**About Profire Energy, Inc.**\n\nProfire Energy is a technology company providing solutions that enhance the efficiency, safety, and reliability of industrial combustion appliances while mitigating potential environmental impacts related to the operation of these devices.

(Nasdaq: CECO) (“CECO”), a leading environmentally focused, diversified industrial company whose solutions protect people, the environment and industrial equipment, and Profire Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ: PFIE) (“Profire”), a technology company providing solutions that enhance the efficiency, safety, and reliability of industrial combustion appliances, today announced a definitive agreement where CECO will acquire Profire, in an all-cash transaction.\n\nProfire is a leader in burner management technology and combustion control systems that provide mission-critical combustion automation and control solutions and services to improve environmental efficiency, safety and reliability for industrial thermal applications globally. Profire estimates its 2024 sales to be greater than $60 million with adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 20 percent.​\n\n“I am excited to announce the acquisition of Profire and we look forward to welcoming their tremendous organization to our portfolio of leading solution companies,” said Todd Gleason, CECO’s Chief Executive Officer. “With an installed base approaching 100,000 burner management systems and a growing industrial market product offering, we look forward to accelerating their global market expansion and introducing their high-efficiency solutions to more customers in industrial air and water. We are also confident that the increased scale and combined corporate organizations will generate meaningful efficiencies and synergies. The addition of Profire is another important step in our ongoing execution of programmatic M&A and we expect it will further advance our position as the leading environmental solutions provider in industrial markets.”\n\n“We are extremely pleased to announce this transaction with CECO which is a testament to the value that has been created for Profire employees, customers and shareholders,” said Cameron Tidball and Ryan Oviatt, co-CEOs of Profire. “The combination of our well-established leadership in niche energy and industrial mission critical applications with CECO’s proven track record of acquiring and investing in companies to enhance their growth and create scale will unlock even more value for all constituents.”\n\n**Transaction Details and Timing**\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, a subsidiary of CECO (“Merger Sub”) will commence a tender offer to acquire all issued and outstanding shares of Profire common stock at a price of $2.55 per share, in cash, without interest and subject to applicable withholding tax. The tender offer will initially remain open for 20 business days from the date of commencement of the tender offer, subject to extension under certain circumstances. The transaction, which has been unanimously approved by Profire’s Board of Directors, implies an equity value of approximately $125 million and a total enterprise value for Profire of approximately $108 million.\n\nThe tender offer is subject to customary closing conditions, including that at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Profire’s common stock are tendered and not withdrawn in the tender offer and the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976.\n\nThe price represents a 46.5% premium over Profire’s closing share price of $1.74 on October 25, 2024 and a premium of 60.3% to Profire’s 30-day volume weighted average share price on October 25, 2024. Following a successful completion of the tender offer, including the satisfaction of certain customary conditions, CECO will acquire all remaining untendered shares of Profire common stock at the same price of $2.55 per share in cash through a merger of Merger Sub with Profire, with Profire continuing as the surviving corporation.\n\nUpon completion of the transaction, Profire will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of CECO and shares of Profire’s common stock will no longer be listed on any public market. The parties anticipate that the combination will be completed in the first quarter of 2025.\n\n**Advisors**\n\nStephens Inc. is serving as financial advisor and Mayer Brown LLP is serving as legal counsel to Profire.CECO Environmental Corp. is being advised by Foley & Lardner LLP (Legal), and KPMG (tax).\n\n**ABOUT CECO ENVIRONMENTAL** CECO Environmental is a leading environmentally focused, diversified industrial company, serving a broad landscape of industrial air, industrial water, and energy transition markets across the globe through its key business segments: Engineered Systems and Industrial Process Solutions.

(NASDAQ: PFIE), a technology company (the \"Company\") that provides solutions which enhance the efficiency, safety, and reliability of industrial combustion appliances, today reported financial results for its second quarter ending June 30, 2024. A conference call will be held on Thursday, August 8, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. ET to discuss the results.\n\n**Second Quarter Summary (comparisons to prior-year quarter)**\n\n  * Revenue of $15.2 million, compared to $14.6 million\n  * Gross profit of $7.9 million, compared to $7.4 million\n  * Gross margin increased by 90 basis points to 51.8%\n  * Net income of $2.1 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, versus $2.9 million and $0.06\n  * Generated EBITDA of $3.0 million, versus $3.7 million\n  * Cash and investments of $18.4 million with no debt\n\n\n\n\"We reported another very successful quarter, highlighted by the second highest quarterly revenue in company history, further progress across our diversification strategy, and maintaining momentum within our legacy business,\" said Ryan Oviatt, co-CEO and Chief Financial Officer of Profire Energy. \"We increased our cash balance while building our inventory and repurchasing shares, and continue to remain debt-free.\"\n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nTotal revenues for the period equaled $15.2 million, compared to $13.6 million in the first quarter of 2024 and $14.6 million in the prior-year quarter. The sequential and year-over-year increase was partially driven by the timing of certain orders that moved into the second quarter of this year due to changes in customer readiness as well as strong activity in our diversification business.\n\nGross profit was $7.9 million, compared to $6.8 million in the first quarter and $7.4 in the second quarter of 2023. Gross margin was 52% of revenues, compared to 50% of revenues in the prior quarter and 51% of revenues in the prior-year quarter. The sequential and year-over-year increase is related to product mix, partially offset by inflationary pressures across the business.\n\nTotal operating expenses were $5.3 million, compared to $5.0 million in the first quarter of 2024 and $4.2 million in the year-ago quarter. The sequential increase is primarily due to ongoing inflation pressure on our business as well as increased headcount to support strategic growth and increased business activity. The prior-year quarter included a nonrecurring benefit from the employee retention tax credit (\"ERC\") of $762,000. Without this benefit, the year-over-year increase would have only been 6% which is due to increased inflation and headcount.\n\nCompared with the same quarter last year, operating expenses for G&A increased 25%, R&D increased 56% and depreciation increased by 7%. The increase in G&A was driven by the ERC benefit noted above while the increase in R&D was a result of increased activity on new product development and certifications.\n\nNet income was $2.1 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, compared to net income of $1.4 million or $0.03 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2024 and $2.9 million or $0.06 per diluted share in the same quarter last year also primarily driven by the prior year ERC credit.\n\n\"Our diversification efforts continue to be a critical component of our growth strategy, representing 15% of our total revenue for the quarter, as diversified sales for the first half of 2024 outpaced the first six months of 2023,\" said Cameron Tidball, co-CEO of Profire Energy. \"The outlook for energy derived from hydrocarbon production remains very strong as the global demand for energy continues to grow. We remain very optimistic about the outlook for Profire for the second half of 2024 and beyond as well as our ability to deliver long-term shareholder value.\"\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nProfire Energy Executives will host the call, followed by a question-and-answer period.\n\nDate: Thursday, August 8, 2024Time: 8:30 a.m. ET (6:30 a.m. MT)Toll-free dial-in number: 1-800-225-9448International dial-in number: 1-203-518-9708Conference ID: PROFIRE\n\nThe conference call will be webcast live and available for replay via this link: [https://viavid.webcasts.com/starthere.jsp?ei=1653744&tp_key=6e0824482a](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=08FK5-MMVsky3JW8C8UprnpF7679j9x0_Dt3ouC_sWLtBuyQJP0GVp25und1VyceL7hd50QwdjnEtSgiWwU47Org0MVptBzXWCkTqcWrh_U-UgPcwHLtMwsNjil-cVR4pp8jYHTiOFw7TLBmqUD4_UdmZv8RofrZd4WxG957qtvkZM_I3fA3V9BeZ8eonGorxBYg--pP2dPHzszLNasGBnhL3vxrCjcaxIEyNVWQkdA= \"Opens in a new window\")The webcast replay will be available for one year.\n\nPlease call the conference telephone number five minutes prior to the start time.

(NASDAQ: PFIE), a technology company (the \"Company\") that provides solutions which enhance the efficiency, safety, and reliability of industrial combustion appliances, today reported financial results for its third quarter ending September 30, 2024.\n\n**Third Quarter Summary (comparisons to prior-year quarter)**\n\n  * Revenue of $17.2 million, compared to $14.9 million\n  * Gross profit of $8.3 million, compared to $7.5 million\n  * Gross margin of 48.2%, compared to 50.0%\n  * Net income of $2.2 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, versus $2.0 million and $0.04\n  * Generated EBITDA of $3.1 million, versus $2.9 million\n  * Cash and investments of $16.9 million with no debt\n\n\n\n**Pending Acquisition and Conference Call Update**\n\nOn October 29, 2024, Profire Energy announced it agreed to be acquired by CECO Environmental in an all cash transaction for $2.55 a share. The transaction is anticipated to close in Q1 2025.\n\nAs a result of the pending transaction, and as is common during the pendency of such transactions, Profire will not hold an earnings conference call in connection with its third quarter financial results.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nTotal revenues for the period equaled $17.2 million, compared to $15.2 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $14.9 million in the prior-year quarter. The sequential and year-over-year increase was partially driven by strong activity in our diversification business.\n\nGross profit was $8.3 million, compared to $7.9 million in the second quarter and $7.5 million in the third quarter of 2023. Gross margin was 48% of revenues, compared to 52% of revenues in the prior quarter and 50% of revenues in the prior-year quarter. The sequential and year-over-year decrease is partially related to inflationary pressures across the business as well as the increase in diversification business, driven by critical energy infrastructure and non-oil and gas projects, which can have lower overall project margins.\n\nTotal operating expenses were $5.5 million, compared to $5.3 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $4.9 million in the year-ago quarter. The sequential increase is primarily due to ongoing inflation pressure on our business as well as increased headcount to support strategic growth and increased business activity.\n\nCompared with the same quarter last year, operating expenses for G&A increased 10%, R&D increased 85% and depreciation decreased by 7%. The increase in R&D has been driven by inflation, headcount increases and increased new product development and certification activities.\n\nNet income was $2.2 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, compared to net income of $2.1 million or $0.04 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2024 and $2.0 million or $0.04 per diluted share in the same quarter last year.\n\n**About Profire Energy, Inc.**\n\nProfire Energy is a technology company providing solutions that enhance the efficiency, safety, and reliability of industrial combustion appliances while mitigating potential environmental impacts related to the operation of these devices. It is primarily focused in the upstream, midstream, and downstream transmission segments of the oil and gas industry. However, in recent years, we have completed many installations of our burner-management solutions in other industries that we believe will be applicable as we expand our addressable market over time.

Its products and services are sold primarily throughout North America. It has an experienced team of sales and service professionals that are strategically positioned across the United States and Canada. Profire has offices in Lindon, Utah; Victoria, Texas; Midland-Odessa, Texas; Homer, Pennsylvania; Greeley, Colorado; Millersburg, Ohio; and Acheson, Alberta, Canada.

In the opinion of management, all adjustments have been made (which include only normal recurring adjustments) which are necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows at September 30, 2024 and for all periods presented herein.\n\nCertain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"US GAAP\") have been condensed or omitted. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited financial statements contained in its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (\"Form 10-K\"). The results of operations for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full years. Certain amounts in the accompanying September 30, 2023 condensed consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income and footnotes have been reclassified to conform to the September 30, 2024 presentation.\n\nNOTE 2 – ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nOrganization and Line of Business\n\nThis Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Company is presented to assist in understanding the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company's accounting policies conform to US GAAP.\n\nThe Company provides burner-management products, solutions and services primarily for the oil and gas industry within the US and Canadian markets. The Company has made progress in expansion efforts outside of these markets into other industries with combustion and burner management requirements as well as into other international locations. \n\nSignificant Accounting Policies\n\nThere have been no changes to the significant accounting policies of the Company from the information provided in Note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in the Company's most recent Form 10-K.\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nAccounting Standards Update No. 2023-07 —Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures The update is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The amendments require disclosure of significant segment expenses regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM) as well as other segment items, extend certain annual disclosures to interim periods, clarify the applicability to single reportable segment entities, permit more than one measure of profit or loss to be reported under certain conditions, and require disclosure of the title and position of the CODM. The new disclosures have been adopted in this report. See NOTE 10 – SEGMENT INFORMATION.\n\nAccounting Standards Update No. 2023-09 —Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures The update requires the annual financial statements to include consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation, and income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. ASU 2023-09 is effective for the Company’s annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted, and should be applied on a prospective basis, with a retrospective option. We are currently evaluating the effect that adoption of ASU 2023-09 will have on our disclosures.\n\nThe Company has evaluated all other recent accounting pronouncements and determined that the adoption of other pronouncements applicable to the Company has not had, nor is expected to have, a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\n9\n\nPROFIRE ENERGY, INC.

The leases for office equipment are classified as financing leases, and the typical term is between 36 and 60 months. We have the option to extend most office equipment leases, but we do not intend to do so. Accordingly, no extensions have been recognized in the right-of-use asset or lease liability. The office equipment lease payments are not variable, and the lease agreements do not include any non-lease components, residual value guarantees, or restrictions. There are no interest rates implicit in the office equipment lease agreements, so we have used our incremental borrowing rate to determine the discount rate to be applied to our financing leases for the purpose of determining our lease liabilities. The weighted average discount rate applied to our financing leases was 4.50% through 2023 and is 7.5% in 2024, and the weighted average remaining lease term is 2.1 years.\n\nThe following table shows the components of financing lease cost:\n\nFor the Three Months Ended September 30,| For the Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \nFinancing Lease Cost| 2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nAmortization of right-of-use assets| $| 12,559 | $| 14,332 | $| 37,677 | $| 28,811  \nInterest on lease liabilities| 2,358 | 4,438 | 7,960 | 6,226  \nTotal financing lease cost| $| 14,917 | $| 18,770 | $| 45,637 | $| 35,037  \n  \nWe lease two warehouse spaces, one with a two-year lease, and another with a four-year lease, both of which are recorded as operating leases. The weighted average discount rate applied to our operating leases was 4.5% through 2023 and is 7.5% in 2024, and the weighted average remaining lease term is 3.0 years. The remainder of our office space leases are considered to be short-term, and we have elected not to recognize those on our balance sheet under the short-term recognition exemption. Operating lease expense recognized during the three- and nine-months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was $77,388 and $15,081, and $154,476 and $52,285, respectively. \n\n11\n\nPROFIRE ENERGY, INC.

Purchases under the program will be made pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan to be entered into at the discretion of management. The size and timing of any purchases were and will be dependent on price, market and business conditions and other factors. \n\nOn May 9, 2023, the Company announced that the Board had authorized a share repurchase program allowing the Company to repurchase up to $2,000,000 worth of the Company’s common stock from time to time through April 30, 2024.

See further details below about certain subsets of these outstanding equity-based awards.\n\nOn June 12, 2024, pursuant to the annual renewal of director compensation, the Board approved a grant of 192,699 RSUs to the Company's independent directors. Half of the RSUs vested immediately on the date of grant and the remaining 50% of the RSUs will vest on the first anniversary of the grant date or at the Company's next annual meeting of stockholders, whichever is earlier. The awards will result in total compensation expense of approximately $264,000 to be recognized over the vesting period.\n\nOn April 9, 2024, the Compensation Committee of the Board (the \"Compensation Committee\") approved the 2024 Executive Incentive Plan (the “2024 EIP”) for Ryan W. Oviatt, the Company's Co-CEO, Co-President, and CFO, Cameron M. Tidball, the Company's Co-CEO and Co-President, and Patrick D. Fisher, the Company's Vice President of Product Development. The 2024 EIP provides for the potential award of incentive compensation to the participants based on the Company’s financial performance in fiscal 2024. If earned, the incentive compensation will be payable in cash and stock, and the stock portion of the incentive compensation is intended to constitute an award under the Company's 2023 Equity Incentive Plan (the \"2023 Plan\"). In addition to the 2024 EIP, the Board also approved as a long-term incentive plan the grants of a restricted stock unit awards to Messrs.

The target incentive compensation amount for Mr. Oviatt is equal to 65% of his base salary as of December 31, 2024, the target incentive compensation amount for Mr. Tidball is equal to 65% of his base salary as of December 31, 2024, and the target incentive compensation for Mr. Fisher is equal to 40% of his base salary as of December 31, 2024. Under no circumstance can the participants receive more than two times the assigned target incentive compensation.\n\nParticipants will be eligible to receive incentive compensation based upon reaching or exceeding performance goals established by the Compensation Committee for fiscal 2024. The performance goals in the 2024 EIP are based on the Company’s total revenue, EBITDA, and two non-financial factors including strategic growth initiatives and safety and other. Each of the revenue, EBITDA, and strategic growth initiatives performance goals will be weighted 30% while the safety and other goal will be weighted 10% in calculating incentive compensation amounts.\n\nThe incentive compensation amounts earned under the 2024 EIP, if any, will be paid 50% in cash and 50% in shares of restricted stock under the 2023 Plan. In no event shall the total award exceed 200% of the target incentive compensation amount for each participant, or exceed any limitations otherwise set forth in the 2023 Plan. The actual incentive compensation amounts, if any, will be determined by the Compensation Committee upon the completion of fiscal 2024 reporting period and paid by March 15, 2025, subject to all applicable tax withholding.\n\n2024 LTIP\n\nThe 2024 LTIP consists of total awards of up to 204,651 restricted stock units (“Units”) to Mr. Oviatt, up to 204,651 Units to Mr. Tidball, and up to 36,195 Units to Mr. Fisher, pursuant to two separate restricted stock unit award agreements (collectively, the “2024 LTIP Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreements”) entered between the Company and each participant.

The incentive compensation was payable in cash and stock, and the stock portion of the incentive compensation constituted an award under the 2023 Plan. \n\nParticipants were eligible to receive incentive compensation based upon reaching or exceeding performance goals established by the Compensation Committee for fiscal 2023. The performance goals in the 2023 EIP were based on the Company’s total revenue, EBITDA, and two non-financial factors including revenue source diversification and safety and environmental performance. Each of the revenue, EBITDA, and revenue diversification performance goals were weighted 30% while the safety and environment goal was weighted 10% in calculating incentive compensation amounts.\n\nOn March 6, 2024, the Compensation Committee approved the incentive compensation amounts based on achieving certain targets pursuant to the 2023 EIP. The incentive compensation amounts earned under the 2023 EIP were paid 50% in cash and 50% in shares of restricted stock under the 2023 Plan. In satisfaction of the 50% of the 2023 EIP plan that was payable in stock, the Compensation Committee approved a one-time bonus for Company executives that was settled by issuing a total of 225,698 shares of common stock, or 121,624 shares net of tax withholding. These shares were fully vested as of March 6, 2024.\n\nIn addition to the 2023 EIP, the Board also approved as a long-term incentive plan the grants of RSU awards to Messrs.

One such agreement covers 33% of each award recipient’s Units that are subject to time-based vesting, and the other such agreement covers the remaining 67% of such award recipient’s Units that may vest based on performance metrics. Upon vesting, the award agreements entitle the award recipients to receive one share of the Company’s common stock for each vested Unit. The vesting period of the 2023 LTIP began on January 1, 2023 and terminates on December 31, 2025 (the “2023 LTIP Performance Vesting Date”).\n\nThe Units subject to time-based vesting, including 95,692 Units to Mr. Oviatt, 95,692 Units for Mr. Tidball, and 16,956 Units to Mr. Fisher, will vest in three equal and annual installments beginning December 31, 2023 and ending on December 31, 2025 if the award recipients’ employment continues with the Company through such dates. \n\nThe performance-vesting Units, including up to 191,384 Units for Mr. Oviatt, 191,384 Units for Mr. Tidball, and 33,912 Units to Mr. Fisher, may vest over a three-year performance period beginning January 1, 2023 (the “2023 LTIP Performance Period”) based upon the following Company performance metrics:\n\n14\n\nPROFIRE ENERGY, INC.

One such agreement covers the 33% of each award recipient’s RSUs that are subject to time-based vesting, and the other such agreement covers the remaining 67% of such award recipient’s RSUs that may vest based on performance metrics. Upon vesting, the award agreements entitle the award recipients to receive one share of the Company’s common stock for each vested unit. The vesting period of the 2022 LTIP began on January 1, 2022 and terminates on December 31, 2024 (the “2022 LTIP Performance Vesting Date”).\n\nThe RSUs subject to time-based vesting, including 76,744 RSUs to Mr. Oviatt, 76,744 RSUs for Mr. Tidball, and 14,341 RSUs to Mr. Fisher, will vest in three equal and annual installments beginning December 31, 2022 and ending on December 31, 2024 if the award recipients’ employment continues with the Company through such dates. \n\nThe performance-vesting RSUs, including up to 153,488 RSUs for Mr. Oviatt, 153,488 RSUs for Mr. Tidball, and 28,682 RSUs to Mr. Fisher, may vest at the end of the three-year performance period beginning January 1, 2022 (the \"2022 LTIP Performance Period\") based upon the following Company performance metrics:\n\n15\n\nPROFIRE ENERGY, INC.

Oviatt, Tidball, Fugal, and Fisher pursuant to the 2014 Plan (the “2021 LTIP”). The 2021 LTIP consists of total awards of up to 204,543 RSUs to Mr. Oviatt, up to 204,543 RSUs to Mr. Tidball, up to 85,908 RSUs to Mr. Fugal, and up to 47,973 RSUs to Mr. Fisher, pursuant to two separate restricted stock unit award agreements (collectively, the “2021 LTIP Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreements”) between the Company and each participant. One agreement covers the 33% of each award recipient’s RSUs that are subject to time-based vesting, and the other agreement covers the remaining 67% of such award recipient’s RSUs that may vest based on performance metrics. Upon vesting, the award agreements entitle the award recipients to receive one share of the Company’s common stock for each vested RSU. The vesting period of the 2021 LTIP began on January 1, 2021 and terminated on December 31, 2023 (the “2021 LTIP Performance Vesting Date”).\n\nThe RSUs subject to time-based vesting, including 68,181 RSUs to Mr. Oviatt, 68,181 RSUs for Mr. Tidball, 28,636 RSUs to Mr. Fugal, and 15,991 RSUs to Mr. Fisher, vested in three equal annual installments that began on December 31, 2021 and ended on December 31, 2023.\n\nThe performance-vesting RSUs, including up to 136,362 RSUs for Mr. Oviatt, 136,362 RSUs for Mr. Tidball, 57,272 RSUs for Mr. Fugal, and 31,982 RSUs to Mr. Fisher, were eligible to vest over a three-year performance period beginning January 1, 2021 based upon the following Company performance metrics:\n\nPerformance Metric| Weight| Target| Above Target| Outstanding  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nTotal Shareholder Return | 1/3| 135%| 194%| 253%  \nRelative Total Shareholder Return | 1/3| Third Quartile| Second Quartile| First Quartile  \nEBITDA as a Percentage of Total Revenue | 1/3| 10%| 15%| 20%  \n  \nOne-third of such performance-vesting RSUs, consisting of 45,454 RSUs for Mr. Oviatt, 45,454 RSUs for Mr. Tidball, 19,091 RSUs for Mr. Jay Fugal, the Company's former Vice President of Operations, and 10,661 RSUs for Mr. Fisher, were \n\n16\n\nPROFIRE ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\n\neligible to vest for each of the three performance metrics identified in the table above. The number of RSUs that vested for each performance metric on the 2021 LTIP Performance Vesting Date was determined as follows:\n\n•if the “Target” level for such performance metric is not achieved, none of the RSUs relating to such performance metric will vest;\n\n•if the “Target” level (but no higher level) for such performance metric is achieved, 50% of the RSUs relating to such performance metric will vest;\n\n•if the “Above Target” level (but no higher level) for such performance metric is achieved, 75% of the RSUs relating to such performance metric will vest; and\n\n•if the “Outstanding” level for such performance metric is achieved, 100% of the RSUs relating to such performance metric will vest.\n\nMr. Fugal resigned effective October 31, 2021 from his position as Vice President of Operations to pursue an opportunity as CEO of another company. Accordingly, Mr. Fugal did not receive incentive compensation under the 2021 LTIP, and his unvested RSUs have been forfeited.\n\nOn March 6, 2024, the Compensation Committee approved the incentive compensation amounts based on achieving certain targets pursuant to the 2021 LTIP. The performance vesting RSUs were settled by issuing a total of 152,354 shares of common stock, or 80,059 shares net of tax withholding. \n\nThe foregoing summary of the 2021 LTIP is qualified in its entirety by the text of each of the 2021 LTIP Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreements, which the Company filed as exhibits to its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2021.\n\nNOTE 8 – REVENUE\n\nPerformance Obligations\n\nOur performance obligations include providing product and servicing our product as well as other combustion related equipment. We recognize product revenue performance obligations in most cases when the product is delivered to the customer. Occasionally, if we are shipping the product on a customer’s account, we recognize revenue when the product has been shipped. At that point in time, the control of the product is transferred to the customer. When we perform service work, we apply the practical expedient that allows us to recognize service revenue when we have the right to invoice the customer for the work completed. We do not engage in transactions acting as an agent. The time needed to complete our performance obligations varies based on the size of the project; however, we typically satisfy our performance obligations within a few months of entering into the applicable sales contract or service contract.\n\nOur customers have the right to return certain unused and unopened products within 90 days for a restocking fee. We provide a warranty on some of our products ranging from 90 days to 2 years, depending on the product. See [Note 5](#i051afcdc0a0f47c2a2fcb2f839c6b831_43) for the amount accrued for expected returns and warranty claims as of September 30, 2024.\n\nContract Balances\n\nWe have elected to use the practical expedient in ASC 340-40-25-4 (regarding recognition of the incremental costs of obtaining a contract) for costs related to contracts that are estimated to be completed within one year. All of our current sales contracts and service contracts are expected to be completed within one year, and as a result, we have not recognized a contract asset account. If we had chosen not to use this practical expedient, we would not expect a material difference in the contract balances. Occasionally, we collect milestone payments up front from customers on larger jobs. These payments are classified as deferred revenue until the deliverables have been met and revenue can be properly recognized in our financial statements. Each of the contracts related to these milestone payments is short-term in nature and we expect to recognize associated revenues within one year. As a result, we consider it appropriate to record deferred revenue for these transactions and do not have any other contract liability balances.\n\nDisaggregation of Revenue\n\n17\n\nPROFIRE ENERGY, INC.

Our product and services lines are similar in their production processes, customers, and economic characteristics; and we do not manage the business or allocate costs based on individual product or service lines. Revenues are regularly reviewed on a disaggregated basis between our US and Canada subsidiaries; however, individual subsidiary operating performance is not reviewed regularly. Each subsidiary has a different purpose within the consolidated organization as a whole and they are not comparable to one another. As a result, we have concluded that we only have one operating segment, which is the consolidated company as a whole.

(the “Company” or “we”) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with CECO Environmental Corp., a Delaware corporation (“Parent”), and Combustion Merger Sub, Inc. (“Merger Sub”), a Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. The Merger Agreement provides for the acquisition of the Company by Parent in a two-step all cash transaction, consisting of a tender offer, followed by a subsequent merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the “Merger”), with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation.\n\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, and on the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, Parent will cause Merger Sub to commence a cash tender offer (the “Offer”) to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share of the Company (the “Company Common Stock”), at a price per share of Company Common Stock of $2.55 (the “Offer Price”) net to the seller thereof in cash, without any interest, subject to any required withholding taxes.\n\nThe Offer will initially remain open for 20 business days from the date of commencement of the Offer (unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company). If at the scheduled expiration time of the Offer any of the conditions to the Offer have not been satisfied or waived, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, extend the Offer for up to 3 additional periods of up to 10 business days per extension (with each such period to expire at one minute after 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on the last business day of such period) (or such other duration as may be agreed in writing by Parent and the Company), to permit such conditions to the Offer to be satisfied.\n\nThe obligation of Merger Sub to accept for payment Shares validly tendered pursuant to the Offer is subject to customary closing conditions, including: (a) the number of shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not validly withdrawn prior to the expiration time of the Offer, when added to any shares of Company Common Stock already owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any of Parent’s other subsidiaries, equals at least a majority of the voting power of the then issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the “Minimum Tender Condition”); (b) the accuracy of the Company’s representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement (subject to any applicable Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement) and other materiality qualifiers); (c) the absence of any Material Adverse Effect; and (d) the waiting period applicable to the Offer under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act of 1976 shall have expired or been terminated.\n\nAs soon as practicable following the acceptance of the shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer (the “Offer Closing”), subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, the Merger will be effected pursuant to Section 92A.133 of the Nevada Revised Statues (the “NRS”) and Section 252 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”), without a vote of the Company stockholders. \n\nSubject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), by virtue of the Merger, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a) owned by Parent, the Merger Sub or the Company (as treasury stock or otherwise) or any of their direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor, and (b) other than the shares contemplated in the foregoing clause (a), shall be converted into the right to receive, in cash and without interest, an amount equal to the Offer Price (the “Merger Consideration”) in cash, without any interest, subject to any required withholding taxes. \n\nAs the Effective Time, each award of restricted stock units relating to a share of Company Common Stock (“Company RSU”) that is outstanding under the Company’s 2014 Equity Incentive Plan and 2023 Equity Incentive Plan as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested, shall fully vest and be canceled and converted into the right to receive, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of: (a) the aggregate number of shares of restricted stock, assuming that Company RSU with vesting requirements subject to performance goals have been met at the maximum level of performance, and (b) the Merger Consideration, less any taxes required to be withheld. The Merger Agreement contains various customary representations and warranties of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub. Many of the representations made by the Company are subject to and qualified by a Material Adverse Effect and/or Knowledge of the Company standard. \n\n21\n\nPROFIRE ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\n\nThe Company, Parent and Merger Sub have also made certain customary covenants in the Merger Agreement, including (a) covenants by the Company regarding the operation of its business and that of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time and (b) a non-solicitation covenant prohibiting the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective officers and directors from directly or indirectly facilitating or encouraging the submission of a Takeover Proposal, the making of a proposal that could be reasonably expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal or taking certain other restricted actions in connection therewith. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to the Offer Closing, the Company receives a bona fide unsolicited written Takeover Proposal that did not result from a material breach of the non-solicitation covenant and the Company’s board of directors (the “Company Board”) determines in good faith, after consulting with financial and legal advisors, that such proposal could reasonably constitute a Superior Proposal and that failure to take such action would reasonably be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law, the Company may take certain actions to participate in discussions and negotiations and to furnish information with respect to such Takeover Proposal.\n\nThe Company shall prepare and file a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 and, subject to certain exceptions, the Company Board shall recommend that the stockholders accept the Offer and tender their Company Shares to Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer (the “Company Board Recommendation”) and not withdraw, amend, modify or qualify such Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub. However, subject to the satisfaction of certain terms and conditions, the Company and the Company Board, as applicable, are permitted to take certain actions which may, as more fully described in the Merger Agreement, include changing the Company Board Recommendation and entering into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement) if, among other things, the Company Board has concluded in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable law.\n\nThe Merger Agreement contains certain customary termination rights for the Company and Parent, including, among others, the right of: (a) each of Company and Parent to terminate the Merger Agreement if the Offer Closing has not occurred on or before March 31, 2025, (b) the Company to terminate the Merger Agreement if, prior to the Offer Closing, the Company Board has authorized the Company to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal in compliance with the Company’s superior proposal covenants and the Company ultimately enters into a definitive agreement for such Superior Proposal, and (c) Parent to terminate the Merger Agreement, if prior to the Offer Closing, a Company Adverse Recommendation Change has occurred or the Company has intentionally breached or intentionally failed to perform its non-solicitation covenants in any material respect. \n\nUpon termination of the Merger Agreement pursuant to the termination rights described in clauses (b) and (c) of the immediately preceding paragraph, the Company will be required to pay Parent a termination fee of $4,375,000. \n\nThe foregoing description of the Merger Agreement is only a summary, does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.\n\nThe Merger Agreement, and the foregoing description of the Merger Agreement, have been included to provide investors and our stockholders with information regarding the terms of the Merger. The assertions embodied in the representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Merger Agreement were made only for purposes of the Merger Agreement, were solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement, and may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties, including being qualified by information in a confidential disclosure letter provided by the Company to Parent in connection with the signing of the Merger Agreement. Moreover, certain representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement were made as of a specified date, may be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from what might be viewed as material to stockholders, or may have been used for the purpose of allocating risk between the parties to the Merger Agreement. Accordingly, the representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement should not be relied on by any persons as characterizations of the actual state of facts and circumstances about the Company, Parent or Merger Sub at the time they were made or otherwise, and information in the Merger Agreement should be considered in conjunction with the entirety of the factual disclosure about the Company in the Company’s public reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the Company’s public disclosures.\n\nTender and Support Agreements\n\nConcurrently with the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement, on October 28, 2024 Brenton Hatch (and certain of his affiliates), the Chairman of the Company Board, Ryan Oviatt, the Co-Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company, and Cameron Tidball, the Co-Chief Executive Officer of the Company (collectively, the “Stockholders”), will each enter into a Tender and Support Agreement (the “Tender and Support Agreement”) with Parent and Merger Sub. The Tender and Support Agreements provide, among other things, that the Stockholders will tender, or cause to be tendered, \n\n22\n\nPROFIRE ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\n\nin the Offer (a) all of the Company Common Stock beneficially owned, as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, by each Stockholder, respectively, as of the date of the Tender and Support Agreements and (b) all shares of Company Common Stock or other voting securities of the Company that are issued to or otherwise directly or indirectly acquired by and become owned by such Stockholder after the execution of the Tender and Support Agreement (clauses (a) and (b), the “Owned Shares”). By entering into the Tender and Support Agreements, the Stockholders also agreed to other customary terms and conditions, including certain restrictions on transferring their Owned Shares and issuing public statements or press releases. Each of the Stockholders’ respective obligations under the Tender and Support Agreement will automatically terminate upon the earliest to occur of (i) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with it terms, (ii) the time of the Offer Closing, provided that each Stockholder has tendered all of its Owned Shares and complied with the covenants in the Tender and Support Agreement, (iii) the making of a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with the Merger Agreement, (iv) the entry of Parent or Merger Sub, without the prior written consent of the Stockholders, into any amendment or modification of the Merger Agreement that decreases the Offer Price or changes the form of Merger Consideration and (v) the termination of the Tender and Support Agreement by written notice from Parent and Merger Sub.\n\n23\n\nItem 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nThis discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our consolidated operating results, financial condition, liquidity, and capital resources during the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to the financial statements contained in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q and our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThis quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), that are based on management's beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to management. For this purpose, any statement contained in this report that is not a statement of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking, including, but not limited to, statements relating to our future actions, intentions, plans, strategies, objectives, results of operations, cash flows and the adequacy of or need to seek additional capital resources and liquidity.

Our legacy business is primarily focused in the upstream, midstream, and downstream transmission segments of the oil and gas industry. However, in recent years, we have completed many installations of our burner-management solutions in other industries for which we believe our solutions will be applicable as we expand our addressable market over time. We specialize in the engineering and design of burner and combustion management systems and solutions used on a variety of natural and forced draft applications. We sell our products and services primarily throughout North America. Our experienced team of sales and service professionals are strategically positioned across the United States and Canada providing support and service for our products.\n\n24\n\nPrincipal Products and Services\n\nAcross the energy industry, there are numerous demands for heat generation and control. Applications such as combustors, enclosed flares, gas production units, treaters, glycol and amine reboilers, indirect line-heaters, heated tanks, and process heaters require heat to support the production and or processing function. This heat is generated through the process of combustion, which must be controlled, managed, and supervised. Combustion and the resulting generation of heat are integral to the process of separating, treating, storing, incinerating, and transporting oil and gas. Factors such as specific gravity, the presence of hydrates, temperature and hydrogen sulfide content contribute to the need for heat generation in oil and gas production and processing applications. Our burner-management systems ignite, monitor, and manage pilot and burner systems that are utilized in this process. Our technology affords remote operation, reducing the need for employee interaction with the appliance's burner for purposes such as re-ignition or temperature monitoring. In addition, our burner-management systems can help reduce emissions by safely reigniting a failed flame, thereby improving efficiencies and up-time. Our extensive service and combustion experience provides customers with solutions that are consistent with industry trends and regulatory requirements to mitigate environmental impacts and reduce emissions through optimized burner operation. \n\nOil and gas companies, including upstream, midstream, downstream, pipeline, and gathering operators, utilize burner-management systems to achieve increased safety, greater operational efficiencies, and improved compliance with industry regulations. Without a burner-management system, a field employee must discover and reignite an extinguished burner flame, then restart the application manually. Without a proper burner-management system, all application monitoring must be accomplished in-person, directly on-site. This requirement for on-site monitoring, in an operational environment with limited field personnel, can result in the potential interruption of production for long periods of time and increased risks associated with reigniting a flame, which can lead to site hazards, including explosions and the possibility of venting gas into the atmosphere. In addition, without a burner-management system, burners often operate for longer durations, frequently with lower efficiency, resulting in increased equipment fatigue and greater expense related to fuel consumption. \n\nWe continue to assess regulatory requirements applicable to our customers. We believe our burner-management systems and services offer solutions for customers to meet compliance standards where applicable. In addition to product sales, we dispatch specialized service technicians to provide maintenance and installation support throughout the United States and Canada. \n\nWe initially developed our first burner-management controller in 2005. Since that time, our systems have become widely adopted throughout the United States and Western Canada. Profire burner-management systems have been designed to comply with widely accepted safety and industrial codes and standards in North America, including those prescribed and certified by the Canadian Standards Association (CSA), Underwriters Laboratories (UL), and Safety Integrity Level (SIL) standards. \n\nOur systems and solutions have been widely adopted by exploration and production companies (E&P), midstream operators, pipeline operators, as well as downstream transmission and utility providers. Our customers include Antero, ATCO, Chesapeake, Chevron, CNRL, ConocoPhillips, Devon Energy, Dominion Energy, EQT, Kinder Morgan, National Grid, Ovintiv, Oxy, Range Resources, Williams, XTO, and others. Our systems have also been sold and installed in other parts of the world including many countries in South America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. Though firmly established and primarily focused on North American oil and gas markets, we continue to invest in expansion efforts in developing sales in diversified industries where we can utilize our combustion technology.\n\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance Focus\n\nAs guiding principles and core to our strategy, our products and solutions are developed with a focus on safety, environmental impacts, reliability, and efficiency. Protecting human life, protecting the environment, and protecting our customers’ investments are essential to our business objectives. Our products play a crucial role in supporting our customers’ existing and future initiatives regarding improving workplace safety and environmental impacts.\n\nOur burner-management technology is designed to monitor, operate, and manage a wide array of complex industrial heat applications. Providing our customers with safety-approved and certified technology, purposefully designed and built to meet regulatory requirements and process needs, is a critical component of our customers’ safety protocols and initiatives.\n\n25\n\nProper burner and combustion management control, coupled with peripheral solutions, increase site and location safety while reducing emissions. Profire's technology and solutions are integrated into a variety of applications to significantly reduce the release of methane and volatile organic compounds into the environment. \n\nProfire burner-management controls and complementary solutions provide users with the ability to monitor field equipment remotely. This reduces truck rolls and the need for field personnel to travel to and manually inspect burner malfunctions in remote sites and locations. By dramatically reducing the number and frequency of physical trips to site, our automated solutions help our customers improve safety, reduce emissions, and decrease operating costs. \n\nOperator safety is at the heart of our burner-management solution technology. Integration of our solutions and products helps our customers increase the likelihood that their employees return home safe each day. Adding greater physical distance between humans and the combustion process, as well as ensuring gas supplies are properly shut off when no flame is present, are two of the critical elements of how our burner-management solutions help protect human life.\n\nResults of Operations\n\nComparison quarter over quarter\n\nThe table below presents certain financial data comparing the most recent quarter to prior quarters:For the three months ended  \n---  \nSeptember 30, 2024| June 30, 2024| March 31, 2024| December 31, 2023| September 30, 2023  \nTotal Revenues| $| 17,197,953 | $| 15,160,513 | $| 13,641,140 | $| 14,495,724 | $| 14,943,899   \nGross Profit Percentage| 48.2 | %| 51.8 | %| 49.5 | %| 53.9 | %| 50.0 | %  \nOperating Expenses| $| 5,531,603 | $| 5,268,034 | $| 5,019,681 | $| 5,026,596 | $| 4,933,479   \nIncome from Operations| $| 2,750,152 | $| 2,591,540 | $| 1,737,090 | $| 2,780,539 | $| 2,543,605   \nNet Income| $| 2,182,637 | $| 2,062,725 | $| 1,434,374 | $| 3,290,546 | $| 2,039,390   \nOperating Cash Flow| $| (6,908)| $| 2,476,306 | $| (2,692,138)| $| 4,395,818 | $| 885,573   \n  \nRevenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 increased by 15% or $2,254,054 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023, largely due to ongoing progress in our diversified revenue streams, which consists of projects in midstream plant operations and industries outside of oil and gas. Diversified revenue in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 26% of total revenue compared to 17% of total revenue in the prior year quarter. The legacy business was also up compared to the prior year quarter despite oil and natural gas prices being lower. The third quarter of 2024 average oil price was $76.44 compared to $82.26 in the same period of last year. Overall customer demand for Profire products increased during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 which caused an increase in revenue for Profire. \n\nRevenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 increased by 13% or $2,037,440 compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2024, partially due to the higher natural gas prices and North America rig counts in the third quarter of 2024. The quarter's revenue also benefited from a 95% increase in diversified revenue from Q2 to Q3. \n\nOur gross profit margin for the third quarter of 2024 was down 1.8% from the same quarter of last year and down 3.6% from quarter ended June 30, 2024. The gross margin percentage was impacted by normal fluctuations in product, service and customer mix as well as typical movements in warranty and inventory reserves. Diversified revenue also applied downward pressure on margins due to higher percentages of resell product in these solutions. \n\nOperating expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 increased $598,124 from the same quarter of last year, due to increases in headcount and cost inflation across the business. Operating expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 increased $263,569 from the prior quarter ended June 30, 2024 primarily due to increases in headcount and labor related costs. \n\nDue to the factors discussed above, we reported income from operations of $2,750,152 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to income from operations of $2,543,605 for the same quarter in 2023 and income from operations of $2,591,540 in the quarter ended June 30, 2024. \n\n26\n\nDue to the combination of factors discussed above relating to revenues, gross profit margin and operating expenses, we reported net income of $2,182,637 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to net income of $2,039,390 for the same quarter in 2023 and net income of $2,062,725 in the quarter ended June 30, 2024. \n\nThe Company used net operating cash of $6,908 during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to generating operating cash flows of $885,573 during the same quarter of 2023 and use of operating cash of $2,476,306 in the quarter ended June 30, 2024. The fluctuations in operating cash flows are due primarily to the changes in net income and working capital balances. \n\nComparison of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\n\nThe table below presents certain financial data comparing the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the same period ended September 30, 2023:For the Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---  \n2024| 2023| $ Change| % Change  \nTotal Revenues| $| 45,999,606 | $| 44,187,449 | $| 1,812,157 | 4.1 | %  \nGross Profit Percentage| 49.8 | %| 51.4 | %| (1.6)| %  \nOperating Expenses| $| 15,819,316 | $| 13,651,321 | $| 2,167,995 | 15.9 | %  \nIncome from Operations| $| 7,078,784 | $| 9,073,317 | $| (1,994,533)| (22.0)| %  \nNet Income| $| 5,679,737 | $| 7,486,169 | $| (1,806,432)| (24.1)| %  \nOperating Cash Flow| $| (222,740)| $| 2,668,232 | $| (2,890,972)| (108.3)| %  \n  \nRevenues during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, increased 4.1% compared to the same period of last year. The increase in revenue was partially driven by a net increase in oil prices. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the average oil price per barrel was $78.57 whereas the average price was $77.27 per barrel during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Ongoing progress with diversified revenue streams also contributed to the increase in revenue. Diversified revenue in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was nearly 18% of total revenue compared to 11% in the same period of the prior year. \n\nOur gross profit percentage decreased by 1.6% during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to changes in product mix. Operating expenses increased 15.9% due to increases in headcount, general cost inflation in the current year, and the employee retention payroll tax credit in the prior year nine-month period. Due to the decrease in gross margin percentage and the increase in operating expenses, we recognized net income of $5,679,737 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net income of $7,486,169 for the same period in 2023. The Company used operating cash flows of $222,740 during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to generating operating cash flows of $2,668,232 during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 due to the changes in net income and working capital balances. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nWorking capital at September 30, 2024 was $39,726,996 compared to $35,377,246 at December 31, 2023. \n\nOur liquidity position is impacted by operating, investing and financing activities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used $222,740 of cash from operating activities, primarily due to a decrease in net income, purchases of inventory and payment of income taxes and other liabilities. Operating activity trends consist of cash inflows and outflows related to changes in operating assets and liabilities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used $611,149 of cash from investing activities to purchase property and equipment. Investing activity trends consist of changes in the mix of our investment portfolio and purchases or sales of fixed assets. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used $1,926,290 of cash in financing activities, primarily related to the purchase of treasury stock and taxes paid on employee stock award settlements during the year. Financing activity trends consist of transactions related to stock repurchases and equity awards. The extent to which our liquidity position will be impacted in the future depends on industry trends and developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. As of September 30, 2024, we held $16,887,070 of cash and investments that form our core excess liquidity which could be utilized, if required, due to the issues described above. \n\n27\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nWe have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements, nor do we plan to engage in any in the foreseeable future.\n\nItem 3.

Business\nOverview\nWe are a technology company providing solutions that enhance the efficiency, safety, and reliability of industrial combustion appliances while mitigating potential environmental\nimpacts related to the operation of these devices. Our legacy business is primarily focused in the upstream, midstream, and downstream transmission segments of the oil and gas\nindustry. However, in recent years, we have completed many installations of our burner-management solutions in other industries for which we believe our solutions will be\napplicable as we expand our addressable market over time. We specialize in the engineering and design of burner and combustion management systems and solutions used on a\nvariety of natural and forced draft applications. We sell our products and services primarily throughout North America. Our experienced team of sales and service professionals are\nstrategically positioned across the United States and Canada, providing support and service for our products.\nPrincipal Products and Services\nAcross the energy industry, there are numerous demands for heat generation and control. Applications such as combustors, enclosed flares, gas production units, treaters, glycol and\namine reboilers, indirect line-heaters, heated tanks, and process heaters require heat to support the production and or processing function. This heat is generated through the process\nof combustion, which must be controlled, managed, and supervised. Combustion and the resulting generation of heat are integral to the process of separating, treating, storing,\nincinerating, and transporting oil and gas. Factors such as specific gravity, the presence of hydrates, temperature and hydrogen sulfide content contribute to the need for heat\ngeneration in oil and gas production and processing applications. Our burner-management systems ignite, monitor, and manage pilot and burner systems that are utilized in this\nprocess. Our technology affords remote operation, reducing the need for employee interaction with the appliance's burner for purposes such as re-ignition or temperature monitoring.\nIn addition, our burner-management systems can help reduce emissions by safely reigniting a failed flame, thereby improving efficiencies and up-time. Our extensive service and\ncombustion experience provides customers with solutions that are consistent with industry trends and regulatory requirements to mitigate environmental impacts and reduce\nemissions through optimized burner operation.\nOil and gas companies, including upstream, midstream, downstream, pipeline, and gathering operators, utilize burner-management systems to achieve increased safety, greater\noperational efficiencies, and improved compliance with industry regulations. Without a burner-management system, a field employee must discover and reignite an extinguished\nburner flame, then restart the application manually. Without a proper burner-management system, all application monitoring must be accomplished in-person, directly on-site. This\nrequirement for on-site monitoring, in an operational environment with limited field personnel, can result in the potential interruption of production for long periods of time and\nincreased risks associated with reigniting a flame, which can lead to site hazards, including explosions and the possibility of venting gas into the atmosphere. In addition, without a\nburner-management system, burners often operate for longer durations, frequently with lower efficiency, resulting in increased equipment fatigue and greater expense related to fuel\nconsumption.\nWe continue to assess regulatory requirements applicable to our customers. We believe our burner-management systems and services offer solutions for customers to meet\ncompliance standards where applicable. In addition to product sales, we dispatch specialized service technicians to provide maintenance and installation support throughout the\nUnited States and Canada.\nWe initially developed our first burner-management controller in 2005. Since that time, our systems have become widely adopted throughout the United States and Western\nCanada. Profire burner-management systems have been designed to comply with widely accepted safety and industrial codes and standards in North America, including those\nprescribed and certified by the Canadian Standards Association (CSA), Underwriters Laboratories (UL), and Safety Integrity Level (SIL) standards.\nOur systems and solutions have been widely adopted by exploration and production companies (E&P), midstream operators, pipeline operators, as well as downstream transmission\nand utility providers. Our customers include, Antero, ATCO, Chesapeake, Chevron, CNRL, ConocoPhillips, Devon Energy, Dominion Energy, EQT, Kinder Morgan, National\nGrid, Ovintiv, Oxy, Range Resources, Williams, XTO, and others. Our systems have also been sold and installed in other parts of the world including many countries in South\nAmerica, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. Though firmly established and primarily focused on North American oil and gas markets, we continue to invest in expansion\nefforts in developing sales in diversified industries where our combustion technology can be utilized.\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance Focus\n5\nAs guiding principles and core to our strategy, our products and solutions are developed with a focus on safety, environmental impacts, reliability, and efficiency. Protecting human\nlife, protecting the environment, and protecting our customers’ investments are essential to our business objectives. Our products play a crucial role in supporting our customers’\nexisting and future initiatives regarding improving workplace safety and environmental impacts.\nOur burner-management technology is designed to monitor, operate, and manage a wide array of complex industrial heat-applications. Providing our customers with safety-\napproved and certified technology, purposefully designed and built to meet regulatory requirements and process needs, is a critical component of our customers’ safety protocols\nand initiatives.\nProper burner and combustion management control, coupled with peripheral solutions, increase site and location safety while reducing emissions. Profire's technology and solutions\nare integrated into a variety of applications to significantly reduce the release of methane and volatile organic compounds into the environment.\nProfire burner-management controls and complementary solutions provide users with the ability to monitor field equipment remotely. This reduces truck rolls and the need for field\npersonnel to travel to and manually inspect burner malfunctions in remote sites and locations. By dramatically reducing the number and frequency of physical trips to site, our\nautomated solutions help our customers improve safety, reduce emissions, and decrease operating costs.\nOperator safety is at the heart of our burner-management solution technology. Integration of our solutions and products helps our customers increase the likelihood that their\nemployees return home safe each day. Adding greater physical distance between humans and the combustion process, as well as ensuring gas supplies are properly shut off when no\nflame is present, are two of the critical elements of how our burner-management solutions help protect human life.\nPrincipal Markets and Distribution Methods\nOur principal market is the oil and gas industry of the United States and Western Canada, specifically, the Permian, Marcellus, Niobrara, Bakken, STACK, SCOOP and Eagle Ford\nUS basins as well as the Duvernay and Montney and other formations located in Canada. We place a strong emphasis on developing and fostering direct relationships with end\nusers on many fronts including environmental, health and safety, automation, engineering, and field operations leaders and team members.\nDue to the nature of our legacy business, we collaborate with and sell to many Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) who build production, processing, and heating\nequipment as well as other strategic partners that deliver Instrumentation and Electrical (I&E) services in the industry. These channels provide us with a relatively easy-to-scale\naugmentation to our sales and service teams.\nLeveraging our core technology, platforms and combustion expertise, we have started to achieve success and complete projects in new diversified markets. Through direct sales,\nnew OEM and strategic re-sell relationships, we have found opportunities to diversify our market footprint and expand into industries that reside outside of our traditional oil and\ngas segments. Some industries of focus include biogas, biomass, power generation, agriculture, heat treat and metal manufacturing, mining, hydrogen production and petrochemical.\nCompetition\nProfire has several competitors including Clear Rush (ACL), Combustex, SureFire, and Platinum. These companies offer similar products and services to Profire, but at a smaller\nscale. While price is a significant method of competition within the oil and gas industry, we believe the most important competitive factors are performance, quality, reliability,\ndurability, product support and service expertise. We believe this quality-focused approach will enable us to remain competitive.\nThrough our development of products with enhanced capabilities, we have begun to compete with companies such as Honeywell Thermal, Emerson, Fireye, and Siemens in\nconnection with larger, more complex combustion applications. As we continue to expand further into downstream oil and gas applications and outside of traditional oil and gas\nmarkets, we expect this competition to intensify.\nSources and Availability of Raw Materials\nWe operate under release date purchase orders with the majority of our suppliers, including our international-based supply chain. This allows our procurement team to work closely\nwith our suppliers to navigate market fluctuations and the changing needs of our customers. In the past, we have not experienced any sudden or dramatic increase in the prices of the\nmajor parts or components needed for our systems. However, as industry activity levels fluctuate and global economic pressures change, we have experienced upward pressure on\nthe prices of system components, which may persist for some time.\n6\nSome of the components that we resell, such as some of our valve products, are available from a limited number of suppliers. If our access to such products becomes constricted, we\ncould experience a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition. Many of the component parts we use are relatively low-priced and historically have\nbeen readily available through multiple suppliers and manufacturers; however, we have seen dramatic increases in the price as well as decreases in the supply of some of these\ncomponents. The persistence of these pressures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. We have been proactively working with\nadditional contract manufacturers and vendors to reduce these supply chain risks and have been combating the cost increases with increased prices on the products we sell to our\ncustomers.\nWe utilize third-party contract manufacturers, to assemble our burner-management system controllers, along with other proprietary products. We believe this has provided us with\nimproved manufacturing efficiency. Additionally, the use of third-party fabricators enables us to concentrate our capital on liquidity maintenance, research and development\nprojects, and other strategies that align with our core competencies instead of investments in manufacturing equipment. Under the direction of our product engineers, the\nmanufacturers are able to procure all electronic parts, specialty cases and components, and from those components assemble the complete system. Using specialty equipment and\nprocesses provided by us, our control systems are tested on-site by the manufacturer, and if the finished product is acceptable, it is shipped to us for distribution. We subsequently\nperform our own quality-control testing and ensure the programming for each system is ready for the anticipated environment of the customer. Shipments to us from our\nmanufacturers are usually limited to a few hundred units at a time, so that in the event any one shipment is lost or damaged, inventory levels are not seriously impacted. The entire\nmanufacturing process is typically completed within 90 to 120 days of the manufacturer receiving our purchase order and having all the necessary components on hand. Due to\nglobal supply chain challenges over the past several years, we have experienced significant increases to some of the long lead time components used in our systems.\nOur burner-management system contract manufacturers are located in Alberta, Canada.\nWe believe we have adequate alternative manufacturing sources available if we lose the services of our current manufacturers. While such a loss might result in a temporary short-\nterm disruption, we do not expect it would result in a materially adverse impact on our ability to meet demand for our products or results of operations, financial condition, and cash\nflows for a significant period of time. We periodically evaluate alternative manufacturing options to ensure our current fabricators are competitive in price, manufacturing quality\nand fulfillment speed, and to ensure we have the ability to scale our production levels based on customer demand and market conditions.\nDependence upon Major Customers\nDuring the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues. Nonetheless, the loss of a major\ncustomer could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nPatents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property\nWe have filed or acquired several patent applications for various product innovations. We intend to continue to assess the strategic and financial value of each potential patent as we\ndevelop various intellectual properties.\nWhile our patents and patent applications as a group are important, we do not consider any patent or application to be of such importance that the loss or expiration thereof would\nhave a material adverse effect on our business.\nNeed for Governmental Approval of our Principal Products or Services\nWe are required to obtain certain safety certifications/ratings for our combustion-management systems before they are released to the market. We have received the appropriate\ncertifications including CSA, Intertek, and UL certifications for our burner-management systems.\nAlthough sales of our products and services have not been dependent on industry regulations, we believe industry regulations have enhanced our sales environment in certain\ngeographies. We believe that increased regulation in the areas of lower emissions and higher safety standards for our customers—especially when coupled with consistent\nenforcement—may influence potential customers to purchase our products or services and could even increase quantities purchased by existing customers.\nEffects of Existing or Probable Governmental Regulation on our Business\n7\nWe believe that our products and services can help our customers achieve and maintain regulatory compliance and in some instances, exceed industry standards, regarding\nemissions, safe burner ignition methods, data logging, or other safety or environmental compliance requirements or standards that may impact our customers and markets.\nExamples of such regulations include:\n• B149.3-10, which has evolved in recent years and is effective for Alberta, Canada, governs the safety precautions that must be met concerning the ignition of\nthe pilot and the main burner in Alberta. It requires a programmable control to be used if the controller complies with certain certification requirements\npromulgated by the CSA.\n• Regulation 7 of the Air Quality Control Commission regulations in Colorado requires that combustion devices be equipped with an auto-igniter which will\nautomatically attempt to relight the pilot flame in the combustion chamber of a control device. The auto-igniter requirement is to reduce the risk of volatile\norganic compound emissions.\n• R307-503, as passed by the Utah Department of Air Quality, mandates that all open and enclosed flares have an auto-igniter designed to automatically attempt\nto relight the pilot flame of a flare in order to combust volatile organic compound emissions.\n• Order 25417, in North Dakota, requires producers to condition crude oil before transportation and prove oil temperature is above 110 degrees Fahrenheit, to\nburn off toxic gases from the oil.\nOur burner-management systems help companies comply with these regulations and other clean air and emissions reduction initiatives and requirements. On behalf of our\ncustomers, we monitor regulatory requirements that impact their businesses and industries. We are currently monitoring the impact of the Methane Waste Prevention Act of 2021,\nthe Clean Energy and Sustainability Accelerator Act, EPA New Source Performance Standards as part of 40 CFR Subpart OOOO and OOOOa, and others. We believe our burner-\nmanagement systems and ancillary products can help customers meet the more stringent standards being proposed. We have assigned sales and service professionals to specific\ngeographic areas to ensure we have a strong presence in the states and provinces with specific safety and emissions regulations.\nWe are focused on providing products and services that exceed existing regulatory and industry safety standards. We believe demand for our products may increase as regulators\nand our customers continue to tighten safety and efficiency standards in the industry and as our customers demand technological solutions. In addition to satisfying regulatory and\nsafety requirements, we believe our customers continue to recognize the operational efficiencies that can be realized through the use of our burner-management systems and related\nproducts. However, significant changes in the regulatory environment could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition in either positive or negative ways\ndepending on the nature of the change.\nResearch and Development\nWe place strong emphasis on product-oriented research and development relating to the development of new or improved products and systems. During the fiscal years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we spent $917,123 and $1,051,858, respectively, on research and development programs.\nCost and Effects of Compliance with Federal, State and Local Environmental Laws\nOur business is affected by local, provincial, state, federal and foreign laws and other regulations relating to the gas and electric safety standards and codes presently existing in the\noil and gas industry, as well as laws and regulations relating to worker safety and environmental protection.\nDuring the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, we did not incur material direct costs to comply with applicable environmental laws. There\ncan be no assurance, however, that this will continue to be the case in the future as environmental laws and regulations relating to the oil and natural gas industry are routinely\nsubject to change.\nCorporate Structure\nWe were incorporated on May 5, 2003 in the State of Nevada. We have four wholly-owned subsidiaries: Profire Combustion, Inc., an Alberta, Canada corporation; Prochem, ULC,\nan Alberta, Canada unlimited liability corporation; Profire Holdings, LLC, a Utah limited liability company; and Midflow Services, an Ohio limited liability company.\n8\nEmployees\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had a total of 123 employees, 118 of whom were full-time employees.\nExecutive Officers of the Registrant\nName Age Positions Held\nBrenton W. Hatch 73 Chairman of the Board (July 2022 to present)\nSpecial Advisor & Chairman (July 2021 to June 2022)\nExecutive Chairman (Jul 2020 to Jun 2021)\nRyan Oviatt 50 Co-Chief Executive Officer and Co-President (2020 to present)\nChief Financial Officer (2015 to present)\nCameron Tidball 47 Co-Chief Executive Officer and Co-President (2020 to present)\nChief Business Development Officer (2018-2020)\nVice President of Sales & Marketing (2012-2017)\nPatrick Fisher 46 Vice President of Product Development (2019 to present)\nAvailable Information\nOur annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or\n15(d) of the Exchange Act, are available free of charge on our website at www.profireenergy.com as soon as reasonably practicable after we file such information electronically\nwith, or furnish it to, the SEC.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nThe statements in this section describe the known material risks to our business and should be considered carefully.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nDependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our\nreputation.\nWe outsource our manufacturing processes and other functions and continue to evaluate additional outsourcing in order to maintain efficient operations. If our contract\nmanufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, our ability to bring products to market and our reputation\ncould suffer. For example, during a market upturn, our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements, which may prevent us from fulfilling our\ncustomers' orders on a timely basis. The ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control. Additionally, changing or replacing our contract manufacturers\nor other outsourcers could cause disruptions or delays.\nEpidemics, pandemics or other similar outbreaks could hurt our business and financial condition.\nThe outbreak of epidemics, pandemics or other similar outbreaks in the future may adversely affect our operations. This may be due to closures or restrictions requested or\nmandated by governmental authorities, disruption to supply chains and workforce, reduction of demand for our products and services, credit losses when customers and other\ncounterparties fail to satisfy their obligations to us, and volatility in global equity securities markets, among other factors. We share most of these risks with all businesses.\nChanges in the level of capital-spending by our customers could materially and adversely impact our business and financial condition.\nOur principal customers are oil and natural gas exploration and production companies that operate in the upstream and midstream space and the original equipment manufacturers,\nor OEMs, that supply the exploration and production companies with the required production and processing equipment. Thus, the results of our operations and financial condition\ndepend on the level of capital spending by our customers. The energy industry's level of capital spending is significantly influenced by the prevailing commodity prices of natural\ngas and crude oil because the amount of crude oil and natural gas that our\n9\ncustomers can economically produce also depends on the prevailing prices for those commodities. Volatility in commodity prices may make our customers reluctant to invest in the\noil and gas industry where our products would be used. Although our products may enhance the operational efficiency of producing wells, other operational decisions and\nbehaviors by producers could lead to reductions or delays in the capital spending of our customers and therefore reduce the demand for our products and services, which could\nmaterially and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nThe energy industry’s level of capital spending may also be affected by government regulations or other efforts designed to mitigate climate change or reduce greenhouse gas\nemissions. Increasing attention to climate change, increasing societal expectations on companies to address climate change, and potential consumer and customer use of substitutes\nto oil and gas may result in increased costs and lower profits for our customers, and reduced demand for their products. These factors may also cause our customers to allocate more\ncapital spending to other areas or other types of energy production.\nWe depend on our customers' willingness to make operating and capital expenditures to transport, refine and produce oil and natural gas. Industry conditions are influenced by\nnumerous factors over which we have no control, such as:\n• the level of oil and gas production;\n• the demand for oil and gas related products;\n• domestic and worldwide economic conditions;\n• political instability in the Middle East and other oil-producing regions;\n• the actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC);\n• political and economic instability, including wars and acts of terrorism, political unrest, boycotts, curtailments of trade, tariffs and sanctions, and other business\nrestrictions;\n• the price of foreign imports of oil and gas, including liquefied natural gas;\n• natural disasters or weather conditions, such as hurricanes;\n• technological advances affecting energy consumption;\n• the level of oil and gas inventories globally;\n• the cost of producing oil and gas;\n• the price and availability of alternative fuels and energy sources;\n• increasing attention and expectations relating to climate change and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions;\n• merger and divestiture activity among oil and gas producers; and\n• governmental regulations, including those related to climate change.\nThese and other industry conditions could influence our customers’ willingness to make operating and capital expenditures to transport, refine and produce oil and natural gas. If\nour customers reduce or eliminate such operating and capital expenditures, it may adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nChanges in foreign exchange rates in countries where our business operates could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nA portion of our consolidated revenue and consolidated operating income is in Canadian dollars. As a result, we are subject to significant risks, including:\n• Canadian currency exchange risks resulting from changes in Canadian currency exchange rates and the execution of controls in this area; and\n• limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in the United States to fund our operations in Canada.\nIf the volatility in the CAD/USD exchange rate causes a devaluation in either currency, it could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nThe competitive nature of the oilfield services industry could lead to an increase of direct competitors.\nAs our segment within the oil and gas exploration and production industry grows and matures it is reasonable to expect additional companies may seek to enter this market. New\nentrants to our industry may be more highly capitalized, better recognized or better situated to take advantage of market opportunities. If we are unable to adequately compete\nagainst\n10\ncurrent and future competitors, or if the competition results in price reductions or decreased demand for our products, our business, financial condition and results of operations may\nbe materially and adversely affected.\nWe may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions, joint ventures or divestitures, or these benefits may take longer to realize than expected.\nOur future business strategies may include growth through the acquisitions of other businesses. We may not be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities or successfully\nacquire those opportunities that are identified. Even if we are successful in integrating future acquisitions into existing operations, we may not derive the benefits, such as\nadministrative or operational synergy or earnings, that were expected from such acquisitions, which may result in the commitment of capital resources without the expected returns\non capital. Additionally, the competition for acquisition opportunities may increase which in turn would increase our cost of making acquisitions.\nIn pursuing our business strategy, from time to time we evaluate targets for potential acquisitions. We conduct due diligence to identify valuation issues and potential loss\ncontingencies, negotiate transaction terms, complete transactions and manage post-closing matters such as the integration of acquired businesses. However, we may incur\nunanticipated costs or expenses following a completed acquisition, including post-closing asset impairment charges, expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities,\nlitigation, and other liabilities.\nThe risks associated with our past or future acquisitions also include the following:\n• the business culture of the acquired business may not match well with our culture;\n• we may fail to retain, motivate and integrate key management and other employees of the acquired business;\n• we may experience problems in retaining customers and integrating customer bases;\n• we may experience complexities associated with managing the combined businesses; and\n• consolidating multiple physical locations.\nThe anticipated benefits of acquisitions may not be realized, if at all, and we may incur significant time and costs beyond those anticipated with the integration of new acquisitions\nto the existing business. If we are unable to accomplish the integration and management of the combined business successfully or achieve a substantial portion of the anticipated\nbenefits of these acquisitions within the time frames anticipated by Management, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nMany of these factors are outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues, and diversion of Management's\ntime and attention. They may also delay the realization of the benefits we anticipate when we enter into a transaction. Failure to implement our acquisition strategy, including\nsuccessfully integrating acquired businesses, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nOur operations involve operating hazards, which, if not insured or indemnified against, could harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations are subject to hazards inherent in our technology's use in oilfield service operations, oilfield development and oil production activities, including fire, explosions,\nblowouts, spills and damage or loss from natural disasters, each of which could result in substantial damage to the oil-producing formations and oil wells, production facilities,\nother property, equipment and the environment, or in personal injury or loss of life. These hazards could also result in the suspension of purchasing, or in claims by employees,\ncustomers or third parties which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nSome of these risks are either not insurable or insurance is available only at rates that we consider uneconomical. Although we will maintain liability insurance in an amount that we\nconsider consistent with industry practice, the nature of these risks is such that liabilities could exceed policy limits. We may not always be successful in obtaining contractual\nindemnification from our customers, and customers who provide contractual indemnification protection may not maintain adequate insurance or otherwise have the financial\nresources necessary to support their indemnification obligations. Our insurance or indemnification arrangements may not adequately protect us against liability or loss from all the\nhazards of our operations. The occurrence of a significant event that we have not fully insured or indemnified against, or the failure of a customer to\n11\nmeet its indemnification obligations to us, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges to governmental regulation of the oil and gas industry could materially and adversely affect our business.\nIf the laws and regulations governing oil and natural gas exploration and production were to become less stringent, we could experience a decline in the demand for our products,\nwhich we expect would materially and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. These regulations are subject to change and new regulations may curtail\nor eliminate customer activities in certain areas where we currently operate. Furthermore, our operations are affected by local, provincial, state, federal, and foreign laws and other\nregulations relating to oil, gas and electric standards. Such standards can be related to safety, environmental protection, or other regulatory dimensions for the oil and gas\nindustry. Less stringent standards could adversely impact our business and financial conditions.\nIncreased legislation, regulation and other government actions related to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions could also increase costs for our customers and reduce\ndemand for their products, which could cause a reduction in demand for our products and adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOur international business development initiatives subject us to certain operating risks, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur international business development initiatives involve additional risks not associated with our domestic operations. We intend to continue our expansion into international oil\nand gas producing areas. The effects of operating internationally from the risks we describe will not be the same in all countries and jurisdictions. Risks associated with our efforts\noutside of the United States include risks of:\n• multiple, conflicting, and changing laws and regulations, export and import restrictions, and employment laws;\n• regulatory requirements, and other government approvals, permits, and licenses;\n• adverse tax consequences;\n• political and economic instability, including wars and acts of terrorism, political unrest, boycotts, curtailments of trade, tariffs and sanctions, and other business\nrestrictions;\n• expropriation, confiscation, or nationalization of assets;\n• renegotiation or nullification of existing contracts;\n• difficulties and costs in recruiting and retaining individuals skilled in international business operations;\n• foreign exchange restrictions;\n• foreign currency fluctuations;\n• foreign taxation;\n• the inability to repatriate earnings or capital;\n• changing foreign and domestic monetary policies;\n• cultural and communication challenges;\n• regional economic downturns;\n• foreign governmental regulations favoring or requiring the awarding of contracts to local contractors or requiring foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or\npurchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction that may harm our ability to compete; and\n• failure to comply with anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\nOur business could result in liability for litigation, personal injury and property damage claims assessments.\nMost of our products are used in hazardous production applications and involve exposure to inherent risks, including explosions and fires, where an accident or a failure of a\nproduct could result in liability for personal injury, loss of life, property damage, pollution or other environmental hazards or loss of production. Litigation may arise from a\ncatastrophic occurrence at a location where our equipment and services are used. This litigation could result in large claims for damages, including consequential damages, and\ncould impair the market's acceptance of our products. The frequency and severity of such incidents could affect our operating costs, insurability and relationships with customers,\nemployees and regulators. These occurrences could result in substantial costs and diversion of Management's attention and resources, which could have an adverse effect on our\nbusiness.\n12\nOur business may be subject to product liability claims or product recalls, which could be expensive and could result in diversion of Management's attention.\nAs an installer and servicer of oilfield combustion management technologies and related products, we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the\nevent that our products, or the equipment into which our products are incorporated, could malfunction and result in personal injury or death. We may be named in product liability\nclaims even if there is no evidence that our technology, products or services caused or contributed to the accidents. Product liability claims could result in significant losses as a\nresult of expenses incurred in defending claims or the awarding of damages. In addition, we may be required to participate in recalls involving our products if any of our products\nprove to be defective, or we may voluntarily initiate a recall or make payments related to such claims as a result of various industry or business practices, or in an effort to maintain\ngood customer relationships. Our product liability insurance may not be sufficient to cover all product liability claims, such claims may exceed our insurance coverage limits, or\nsuch insurance may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Any product liability claim brought against us could have a material adverse effect on\nour reputation and business.\nUninsured or underinsured claims or litigation or an increase in our insurance premiums could adversely impact our results of operations.\nAlthough we maintain insurance protection for certain risks in our business and operations, we are not fully insured against all possible risks, nor are all such risks insurable. It is\npossible an unexpected judgment could be rendered against us for which we could be uninsured or underinsured and damages could be beyond the amounts we currently have\nreserved or anticipate incurring. Significant increases in the cost of insurance and more restrictive coverage may have an adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, we\nmay not be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable or our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover future claims and assessments\nthat may arise.\nOur assets and operations, as well as the assets and operations of our customers, could be adversely affected by weather and other natural phenomena.\nOur assets and operations could be adversely affected by natural phenomena, such as tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, wildfire, floods, and landslides. A significant disruption in\nour operations or the operations of our customers due to weather or other natural phenomena could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nLiability to customers under warranties may materially and adversely affect our earnings.\nWe provide warranties as to the proper operation and conformance to specifications of the products we sell. Failure of our products to operate properly or to meet specifications may\nincrease our costs by requiring additional engineering resources and services, replacement of parts and equipment, or monetary reimbursement to a customer. In the past we have\nreceived warranty claims and we expect to continue to receive them in the future. To the extent that we incur substantial warranty claims in any period, our reputation, our ability to\nobtain future business, and our earnings could be adversely affected.\nSome of our products use equipment and materials that are available from a limited number of suppliers.\nWe purchase equipment provided by a limited number of manufacturers. During periods of high demand, these manufacturers may not be able to meet our requests for timely\ndelivery, resulting in delayed deliveries of equipment and higher prices for equipment. There are a limited number of suppliers for certain materials used in burner-management\nsystems, our largest product line. Although these materials are generally available, supply disruptions may occur due to factors beyond our control. Such disruptions, delayed\ndeliveries, and higher prices could limit our ability to meet our customers' needs, or could increase the related costs, thus possibly reducing our revenues and profits.\nWe are exposed to risks of delay, cancellation, and nonpayment by customers in the ordinary course of our business activities.\nWe are exposed to risks of loss in the event of delay, cancellation, and nonpayment by our customers. Our customers are subject to their own operating and regulatory risks and may\nbe highly leveraged. Any delay and any increases in the cancellation of contracts or nonpayment by our customers and/or counterparties could adversely affect our results of\noperations and financial condition. In addition, the same factors that may lead to a reduction in our potential customers'\n13\nspending may also increase our exposure to the risks of nonpayment and nonperformance by our existing customers. A significant reduction in our customers' liquidity may result in\na decrease in their ability to pay or otherwise perform their obligations to us. Any increase in nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers, either as a result of recent changes\nin financial and economic conditions or otherwise, could have an adverse impact on our operating results and adversely affect our liquidity.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be materially adversely affected if we are unable to obtain and maintain effective intellectual\nproperty rights for our technologies and planned products, or if the scope of the intellectual property protection is not sufficiently broad.\nOur success may depend, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property protection with respect to our proprietary technology and products. In\nrecent years, patent rights have been the subject of significant litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of patent rights is highly\nuncertain. Pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products or which effectively prevent others from\ncommercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the same, especially in jurisdictions in which we hope to secure\nprotection, may diminish the value of patents or narrow the scope of patent protection. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, and\npatent applications, in the United States and other jurisdictions. As a result, such discoveries are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all.\nTherefore, we may not have been the first to make the inventions claimed in our patents or pending patent applications, or we may not have been the first to file for patent protection\nof such inventions.\nEven if the patent applications we rely on are issued as patents, they may not be issued in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from\ncompeting with us, or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our patents by developing similar or alternative\ntechnologies or products in a non-infringing manner. The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its scope, validity or enforceability, and patents may be challenged in the courts\nor patent offices in the United States and internationally. Such challenges may result in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, which could limit our\nability to stop, or prevent us from stopping, others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our\ntechnology and products. As a result, our patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours, or\notherwise provide us with a competitive advantage.\nWhile we are not currently engaged in any material intellectual property litigation, in the future we may commence lawsuits against others if we believe they have infringed our\nrights. We may not be successful in any such litigation. Our involvement in any intellectual property litigation could require the expenditure of substantial time and other\nresources, may adversely affect the development of sales of our products or intellectual property, our capital resources, or may divert the efforts of our technical and management\npersonnel, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending our patents throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not\nobtained patent protection, to develop their own products, and may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection but where enforcement is not\nas strong as in the United States. Competitors' products may compete with our products in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued patents, and our intellectual property rights\nmay not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights\nin foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries may not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, which could make it difficult for\nus to stop the infringement of any patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce any patent rights in foreign\njurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, the value of our technology could be materially adversely affected, harming our business and competitive\nposition.\n14\nSome of our proprietary intellectual property is not protected by patents or copyrights, and, despite our precautions, it may be possible for third parties to obtain and use such\nintellectual property without authorization. We rely upon confidential proprietary information, including trade secrets, unpatented know-how, technology, software, and other\nproprietary information, to develop and maintain our competitive position. Any disclosure to, or misappropriation by, third parties of our confidential proprietary information could\nenable competitors to quickly duplicate or surpass our technological achievements, thus eroding our competitive position in the market. We seek to protect our confidential\nproprietary information, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees and our collaborators and consultants. We also have agreements with our employees and selected\nconsultants that obligate them to assign their inventions to us.\nThese agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information; however, our trade secrets and other confidential information could be disclosed or competitors could\notherwise gain access to our trade secrets, or that technology relevant to our business could be independently developed by a person that is not a party to such agreements.\nFurthermore, if the employees, consultants or collaborators that are parties to these agreements breach or violate the terms of these agreements, we may not have adequate remedies\nfor any such breach or violation, and we could lose our trade secrets through such breaches or violations. Further, our trade secrets could be disclosed, misappropriated or otherwise\nbecome known or be independently discovered by our competitors. In addition, intellectual property laws in foreign countries may not protect trade secrets and confidential\ninformation to the same extent as the laws of the United States. If we are unable to prevent disclosure of the intellectual property related to our technologies to third parties, we may\nnot be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which would harm our ability to protect our rights and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the success of our business.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability and the ability of our distributors, contract manufacturers, and suppliers to manufacture, market, and sell our products, and to use\nour proprietary technologies without infringing, misappropriating, or otherwise violating the proprietary rights or intellectual property of third parties. While we are not aware of\nany issued or pending patent applications that could restrict our ability to operate, we may in the future become party to, or be threatened with, adversarial proceedings or litigation\nregarding intellectual property rights with respect to our products and technology. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing or future intellectual\nproperty rights. If we are found to infringe a third party's intellectual property rights, we may be temporarily or permanently prohibited from commercializing our products that are\nheld to be infringing. We might, if possible, also be forced to redesign our products so that we no longer infringe the third-party intellectual property rights, or we could be required\nto obtain a license from such third party to continue developing and marketing our products and technology. We may also elect to enter into such a license in order to settle pending\nor threatened litigation. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be\nnon-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us, and we could be required to pay significant royalties and other fees. We could be\nforced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or product. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages. A finding of\ninfringement could prevent us from commercializing our products or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business.\nEven if we are successful in defending against intellectual property claims, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to such claims may cause us to incur significant expenses\nand could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially decrease our operating profits and\nreduce our resources available for development activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings. As a result\nof their substantially greater financial resources, some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can.\nUncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of litigation or other intellectual property-related proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to\ncompete in the marketplace.\nIf we do not develop and commercialize new competitive products, our revenue may decline.\nTo remain competitive in the market for combustion and other emissions control technologies, we must continue to develop and commercialize new products. If we are not able to\ndevelop commercially competitive products in a timely manner in response to industry demands, our business and revenues will be adversely affected. Our future ability to develop\nnew products depends on our ability to:\n15\n• design and commercially produce products that meet the needs of our existing and new customers;\n• attract and retain talented research-and-development management and personnel;\n• successfully market new products; and\n• protect our proprietary designs from our competitors.\nWe may encounter resource constraints or technical or other difficulties that could delay introduction of new products and services. Our competitors may introduce new products\nbefore we do and achieve a competitive advantage.\nAdditionally, the time and expense invested in product development may not result in commercial products or revenues. Our inability to enhance existing products in a timely\nmanner or to develop and introduce new products that incorporate new technologies, conform to stringent regulatory standards and performance requirements, and achieve market\nacceptance in a timely manner, could negatively impact our competitive position. New product development or modification is costly, involves significant research, development,\ntime and expense, and may not necessarily result in the successful commercialization of any new products. Moreover, we may experience operating losses after new products are\nintroduced and commercialized because of high start-up costs, unexpected manufacturing costs or problems, or lack of demand.\nNew technologies could render our existing products obsolete.\nNew developments in technology may negatively affect the development or sale of some or all of our products or make our products obsolete. Our success depends upon our ability\nto design, develop and market new or modified technologies and related products.\nOur business and financial condition could be negatively impacted if we lose the services of certain members of senior management.\nOur development to date has largely depended, and in the future will continue to largely depend, on the efforts of our senior management. We currently do not have key-person\ninsurance on any of our senior management team. Thus, the loss of any member of our senior management could impair our ability to execute our business plan and could therefore\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nFailing to attract and retain skilled employees could impair our growth potential and profitability.\nOur ability to remain productive and profitable depends substantially on our ability to attract and retain skilled employees. Our ability to scale our operations depends on our ability\nto increase our labor force. The demand for skilled oilfield employees is high and the supply is limited. As a result of the volatility of the oilfield services and technology industry,\nour ability to offer competitive wages and retain skilled employees may be diminished.\nA portion of our total compensation program for key personnel has historically included awards of options to buy our common stock or other equity-based awards. If the price of\nour common stock performs poorly, such performance may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract key personnel. In addition, if we are unable to continue to provide\nattractive equity compensation awards or other compensation incentives for any reason, we may be unable to retain and motivate existing personnel and recruit new personnel.\nIf we are unable to expand in existing or into new markets, our ability to grow our business as profitably as planned could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to expand our market share in our existing markets or successfully enter new or contiguous markets especially in light of industry volatility. In addition, such\nexpansion could adversely affect our profitability and results of operations. If we are unable to enter into new markets, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to manage growth effectively, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur ability to successfully expand to new markets, or expand our penetration in existing markets, depends on a number of factors including:\n• our ability to market our products and services to new customers;\n16\n• our ability to provide large-scale support and training materials for a growing customer base;\n• our ability to hire, train and assimilate new employees;\n• the adequacy of our financial resources; and\n• our ability to correctly identify and exploit new geographical markets and to successfully compete in those markets.\nWe may not be able to achieve our planned expansion and our products may not gain access to new markets or be accepted in new marketplaces. We may not achieve greater\nmarket penetration in existing markets and we may not achieve planned operating results, or results comparable to those we experience in existing markets, in the new markets we\nenter.\nDisruptions, failures or security breaches of our information technology infrastructure could have a negative impact on our operations.\nInformation technology is critically important to our business operations. We use information technology to manage all business processes including manufacturing, financial,\nlogistics, sales, marketing, and administrative functions. These processes collect, interpret and distribute business data and communicate internally and externally with employees,\nsuppliers, customers, and others.\nWe invest in industry standard security technology to protect our data and business processes against risk of data security breach and cyber-attack. Our data security management\nprogram includes identity, trust, vulnerability, and threat management business processes as well as adoption of standard data protection policies. We measure our data security\neffectiveness through industry accepted methods and remediate significant findings. Additionally, we require our major technology suppliers and any outsourced services to\nmaintain and comply with accepted security certification standards.\nWhile we believe that our security technology and processes provide adequate measures of protection against security breaches and reduce cybersecurity risks, disruptions in, or\nfailures of, information technology systems have occurred from time to time and may occur in the future and could have a negative impact on our operations or business reputation.\nFailure of our systems, including failures due to cyber-attacks that would prevent the ability of systems to function as intended, could cause transaction errors, loss of customers and\nsales, and could have negative consequences to our business, our employees, and those with whom we do business.\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile and you may have difficulty reselling any shares of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock has been volatile and fluctuates widely in price in response to various factors which are beyond our control. The price of our common stock\nis not necessarily indicative of our operating performance or long-term business prospects. In addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price\nand volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market\nprice of our common stock. Factors such as the following could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially:\n• the underlying price of the commodities in the oil and gas industry;\n• announcements of capital budget changes by a major customer;\n• the introduction of new products by our competitors;\n• announcements of technology advances by us or our competitors;\n• current events affecting the political and economic environment in the United States or Canada;\n• foreign currency fluctuations;\n• conditions or industry trends, including demand for our products, services and technological advances;\n• changes to financial estimates by us or by any securities analysts who might cover our stock;\n• changes in our key personnel;\n• government regulation of our industry;\n• seasonal, economic, or financial conditions;\n• our quarterly operating and financial results; or\n• litigation or public concern about the safety of our products.\n17\nThe realization of any of these risks and other factors beyond our control could cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly. In particular, the market price\nof our common stock may be influenced by variations in oil and gas prices, because demand for our products and services is closely related to commodity prices. The stock market\nin general experiences, from time to time, extreme price and volume fluctuations. Periodic and/or continuous market fluctuations could result in extreme volatility in the price of our\ncommon stock, which could cause a decline in the value of our common stock. Price volatility may be worse if the trading volume of our common stock is low.\nA small number of existing stockholders own a significant amount of our common stock, which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of any stockholder vote.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our executive officers, directors, and certain beneficial owners owned approximately 25% of our common stock. As a result, our insiders have sufficient\nvoting power to significantly influence the outcome of many matters requiring stockholder approval. These matters may include:\n• the composition of our Board of Directors, which has the authority to direct our business, appoint and remove our officers, and declare dividends;\n• approving or rejecting a merger, consolidation, or other business combination;\n• raising future capital; and\n• amending our articles of incorporation and bylaws.\nThis concentration of ownership of our common stock could delay or prevent proxy contests, mergers, tender offers, open-market purchase programs, or other purchases of our\ncommon stock that might otherwise give our other stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of our common stock. This\nconcentration of ownership may also adversely affect our share price. The interests of these existing stockholders may differ from the interests of our other stockholders.\nWhile we have no existing agreements or plans for mergers or other corporate transactions that would require a stockholder vote at this time, this concentration of ownership may\ndelay, prevent or deter a change in control, or deprive investors of a possible premium for owned common stock as part of a sale of our Company.\nOur existing stockholders could experience dilution if we elect to raise equity capital to meet our liquidity needs or to finance strategic transactions.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we may desire to raise capital, issue stock to employees pursuant to our 2023 Equity Incentive Plan or utilize our common stock to effect strategic\nbusiness transactions. If we issue equity securities in connection with any of these actions, such issuance will result in dilution to our existing stockholders.\nFuture sales of our common stock, or the perception that future sales may occur, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline, even if our business is doing\nwell.\nIf any significant number of outstanding shares of our common stock are sold, such sales could have a depressive effect on the market price of our stock. Sales of substantial\namounts of shares in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could depress prevailing market prices for the shares. Such sales may also make it more\ndifficult for us to sell equity securities or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price which we deem appropriate.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, and current and potential\nstockholders may lose confidence in our financial reporting.\nWe are required by the SEC to establish and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting that provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial\nreporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We are likewise required, on a quarterly basis, to evaluate the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and to disclose any changes in internal control over financial reporting. In Item 9A of this report, we disclose that with\nrespect to the standards of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the internal controls-standard to which we are subject, we concluded that our internal control over\nfinancial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023. For additional information on this item, please see Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.\n18\nAlthough we concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of December 31, 2023, we cannot be certain that our internal control practices will\nensure that we will have or maintain adequate internal control over our financial reporting in future periods. Any failure to have or maintain such internal controls could adversely\nimpact our ability to report our financial results accurately and on a timely basis. If our financial statements are not accurate, investors may not have a complete understanding of\nour operations.\nWe may be subject to stockholder litigation, thereby diverting our resources, which could materially adversely affect our profitability and results of operations.\nThe market for our common stock is volatile, and we expect it will continue to be volatile for the indefinite future. Plaintiffs often initiate securities class action litigation against a\ncompany following periods of volatility in the market price for its securities. In addition, stockholders may bring actions against companies relating to past transactions or other\nmatters. Any such actions could give rise to substantial damages and thereby materially adversely affect our consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations. Even\nif an action is not resolved against us, the uncertainty and expense associated with stockholder actions could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, and financial\ncondition. Litigation can be costly, time-consuming and disruptive to business operations. The defense of lawsuits could also result in diversion of Management’s time and attention\naway from business operations, which could harm our business.\nWe could issue “blank check” preferred stock without stockholder approval with the effect of diluting existing stockholders and impairing their voting rights, and provisions in\nour charter documents and under Nevada corporate law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable.\nOur articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of up to 10,000,000 shares of “blank check” preferred stock with designations, rights and preferences as may be determined\nfrom time to time by our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock with\ndividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights which could dilute the interest of, or impair the voting power of, our common stockholders. The issuance of a series of\npreferred stock could be used as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control. Any aspect of the foregoing, alone or together, could delay or prevent\nunsolicited takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends for the foreseeable future, and therefore investors should not buy our stock if they wish to receive cash dividends.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends or distributions on our common stock. We currently intend to retain our future earnings to support operations and to finance\nexpansion and, therefore, we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any payment of cash dividends in the future will be\ndependent on the amount of funds legally available, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant.\nAccordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.\nInvestors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.\nAnti-takeover effects of certain provisions of Nevada state law hinder a potential takeover of our company.\nAlthough we are not currently subject to Nevada’s control share law, we could become subject to Nevada’s control share law in the future. A corporation is subject to Nevada’s\ncontrol share law if it has more than 200 stockholders, at least 100 of whom are stockholders of record and residents of Nevada, and it does business in Nevada or through an\naffiliated corporation. The law focuses on the acquisition of a “controlling interest” which means the ownership of outstanding voting shares sufficient, but for the control share law,\nto enable the acquiring person to exercise the following proportions of the voting power of the corporation in the election of directors: (i) one-fifth or more but less than one-third,\n(ii) one-third or more but less than a majority, or (iii) a majority or more. The ability to exercise such voting power may be direct or indirect, as well as individual or in association\nwith others.\nThe effect of the control share law is that the acquiring person, and those acting in association with it, obtains only such voting rights in the control shares as are conferred by a\nresolution of the stockholders of the corporation, approved at a special or annual meeting of stockholders. The control share law contemplates that voting rights will be considered\nonly once by the other stockholders. Thus, there is no authority to strip voting rights from the control shares of an acquiring person once those rights have been approved. If the\nstockholders do not grant voting rights to the control shares acquired by an acquiring\n19\nperson, those shares do not become permanent non-voting shares. The acquiring person is free to sell its shares to others. If the buyers of those shares themselves do not acquire a\ncontrolling interest, their shares do not become governed by the control share law. If control shares are accorded full voting rights and the acquiring person has acquired control\nshares with a majority or more of the voting power, any stockholder of record, other than an acquiring person, who has not voted in favor of approval of voting rights is entitled to\ndemand fair value for such stockholder’s shares. Nevada’s control share law may have the effect of discouraging takeovers of the corporation.\nIn addition to the control share law, Nevada has a business combination law which prohibits certain business combinations between Nevada corporations and “interested\nstockholders” for two years after the “interested stockholder” first becomes an “interested stockholder,” unless the corporation’s Board of Directors approves the combination in\nadvance. For purposes of Nevada law, an “interested stockholder” is any person who is (i) the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of ten percent or more of the voting power of\nthe outstanding voting shares of the corporation, or (ii) an affiliate or associate of the corporation and at any time within the two previous years was the beneficial owner, directly or\nindirectly, of ten percent or more of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of the corporation. The definition of the term “business combination” is sufficiently broad to\ncover virtually any kind of transaction that would allow a potential acquirer to use the corporation’s assets to finance the acquisition or otherwise to benefit its own interests rather\nthan the interests of the corporation and its other stockholders. The effect of Nevada’s business combination law is to potentially discourage parties interested in taking control of\nour Company from doing so if it cannot obtain the approval of our Board of Directors.\nWe may not be able to maintain compliance with the Nasdaq Capital Market's continued listing requirements.\nOur common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market. There are a number of continued listing requirements that we must satisfy in order to maintain our listing on the Nasdaq\nCapital Market. Although we intend to comply with all of the continued listing requirements, it is possible we may fail to do so. If we fail to maintain compliance with all applicable\ncontinued listing requirements for the Nasdaq Capital Market and they determine to delist our common stock, the delisting could adversely affect the market liquidity of our\ncommon stock, our ability to obtain financing, repay any future debt we could incur, and fund our operations.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNot applicable.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nRisk Management and Strategy\nWe recognize the importance of cybersecurity in safeguarding sensitive customer and employee information, protecting our stakeholders, and maintaining customer trust. Our\napproach to identifying and managing cybersecurity risks includes performing periodic risk assessments, implementing and overseeing governance and policies, maintaining an\nincident response plan, ongoing training and awareness programs, evaluating the control environments of third-party IT vendors, and a goal of continuous improvement.\nCybersecurity is an important and integrated part of our enterprise risk management process that identifies, monitors, and mitigates business, operational and legal risks by\ninvolving employees, executive leaders, board members and third parties as necessary.\nWe understand the importance of educating our employees about cybersecurity risks, and, over the past several years have implemented awareness and training programs for\nemployees with a goal of continually increasing employee education on the risks and threats of cybersecurity. This initiative aims to foster a culture of cybersecurity awareness and\nempower our employees to be vigilant in identifying and assisting with the mitigation of potential threats.\nIn addition, we maintain a cybersecurity risk insurance policy that would help defray the costs associated with a covered cybersecurity incident if it occurred; however, the costs\nrelated to cybersecurity threats or disruptions may not be fully insured.\nGovernance\nThe Chief Financial Officer and IT Manager comprise our cybersecurity team. This team is responsible for assessing and managing our cyber risk management program, informs\nsenior management regarding the prevention, detection, mitigation,\n20\nand remediation of cybersecurity incidents and supervises such efforts. The cybersecurity team has experience selecting, deploying, and operating cybersecurity technologies,\ninitiatives, and processes, and relies on threat intelligence as well as other information obtained from governmental, public and/or private sources, including external consultants.\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors oversees the Company’s cybersecurity program and the steps taken by management to monitor, identify, and mitigate cybersecurity\nrisks. The cybersecurity team briefs the Audit Committee on the effectiveness of the Company’s cyber risk management program, typically on a quarterly basis.\nOur goal is for continuous improvement in our cybersecurity program. We regularly monitor, evaluate, and aim to enhance our capabilities, experience, and expertise through\ninvestments in technology, infrastructure, personnel, and the use of outside consultants. Our objective is to try to stay ahead of emerging threats and maintain the highest level of\ncybersecurity resilience.\nWe face risks from cybersecurity threats that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or reputation. Prior\ncybersecurity incidents have not had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, but the scope and impact of any future\nincident cannot be predicted. See “Risk Factors – Risks Relating to Our Business – Disruptions, failures or security breaches of our information technology infrastructure could\nhave a negative impact on our operations.”\nItem 2.

Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent\nuncertainties, and an adverse result in matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. As of December 31, 2023, Management is not aware of any pending legal,\njudicial or administrative proceedings to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any properties of the Company or its subsidiaries is the subject that we\nbelieve could have a material impact on our operations or financial statements.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\n21\nPART II\nItem 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nMarket Information for Registrant's Common Equity and Holders\nThe Company's common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol \"PFIE.\" As of March 12, 2024, there were approximately 75 shareholders of record for\nour common stock. The number of record shareholders was determined from the records of our stock transfer agent and does not include beneficial owners of common stock whose\nshares are held in the names of various security brokers, dealers, registered clearing houses or agencies, banks, or other fiduciaries.\nDividends\nThe Company has not declared or paid any dividends in the past two years and does not intend to do so in the foreseeable future.\nSecurities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans\nThe table below displays information relating to equity compensation:\nNumber of securities to be Weighted-average Number of securities remaining available\nissued upon exercise of exercise price of for future issuance under\noutstanding options, outstanding options, equity compensation plans (excluding\nPlan category warrants and rights warrants and rights securities reflected in column (a))\n(a) (b) (c)\nEquity compensation plans approved by security holders 1,878,266 $ 1.10 5,313,848\nEquity compensation plans not approved by security holders — — —\nTotal 1,878,266 $ 1.10 5,313,848\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nPursuant to the board of directors' approval of a share repurchase program allowing the Company to repurchase up to $2,000,000 worth of the Company’s common stock from time\nto time through April 30, 2024, the Company entered into a 10b5-1 Plan in May 2023. After an initial 30-day cooling off period, the Company began purchasing shares of common\nstock\n22\npursuant to the terms of the 10b5-1 Plan in June 2023.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nFor a complete understanding, this Management's Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with the Financial Statements and Notes to the Financial Statements\ncontained in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nResults of Operations\nRevenues, Cost of Goods Sold, and Gross Profit\nThe table below presents information regarding revenues, cost of goods sold, and gross profit.\nFor the Year Ended For the Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2023 % of Revenue December 31, 2022 % of Revenue $ Change % Change\nTotal Revenues 58,208,060 100 % 45,936,643 100 % $ 12,271,417 27 %\nTotal Cost of Goods Sold 27,676,042 48 % 24,285,253 53 % $ 3,390,789 14 %\nGross Profit 30,532,018 52 % 21,651,390 47 % $ 8,880,628 41 %\nTotal revenues increased by 27%, which was primarily driven by improved customer demand, increases in product sales prices and supply chain improvements for our burner-\nmanagement systems and components, and progress in our revenue diversification efforts, despite a significant decrease in oil prices and rig counts and resulting completion\nactivity. The average oil price in 2023 was $77.58 per barrel compared to $94.90 per barrel in 2022, representing a decrease of 18%. The 2023 weekly average of the onshore rig\ncount for North America was 848, down 4% from a weekly average of 885 rigs in 2022. The average Henry Hub natural gas price decreased by 61% during this same time period.\nCustomer demand increased during 2023, despite these industry trends. Revenues in 2023 benefited from strong, ongoing progress in our strategic growth and diversification\ninitiatives that are targeted at expansion into new industries and new areas within the oil and gas industry.\nTotal cost of goods sold (\"COGS\") increased, in large part, due to the increase in revenues. As a percentage of revenue, COGS decreased during 2023 due to changes in product mix\nand product-related services as well as due to the fixed cost leverage provided by higher revenues. With our current operating cost structure, we have been able to grow revenue\nfaster than the fixed costs of operating our business. Despite this, we continue to experience inflationary pressures for both direct and indirect costs. We continue to work with our\nsuppliers in an effort to control our inventory costs and limit impacts of inflation. As a result of these changes, total gross profit increased by $8,880,628 during 2023 compared to\n2022 and increased as a percentage of total revenue.\n23\nOperating Expenses\nThe table below presents information on operating expenses:\nFor the Year Ended For the Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2023 % of Revenue December 31, 2022 % of Revenue $ Change % Change\nGeneral and administrative expenses 17,184,917 30 % 14,776,905 32 % $ 2,408,012 16 %\nResearch and development 917,123 2 % 1,051,858 2 % $ (134,735) (13)%\nDepreciation and amortization expense (inclusive of\namounts in COGS) 1,108,962 2 % 1,101,044 2 % $ 7,918 1 %\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $2,408,012 or 16% during 2023 compared to 2022 but decreased as a percentage of revenue because the growth rate of fixed costs\nwas lower than the growth rate of revenues during the period. The increase in 2023 was driven primarily by growth in overall business activity, by inflationary pressures on\nemployee costs and ongoing supply chain challenges.\nResearch and development expenses decreased by $134,735 or 13% during 2023 compared to 2022 and decreased slightly as a percentage of revenue. These decreases were largely\na result of employee wage subsidies received from the Canadian government. We continue to prioritize research and development projects to ensure that we remain a leader in\ntechnology and automation in the industries we serve. We intend to continue our research and development efforts during 2024 in order to further diversify and enhance our product\nofferings.\nDepreciation and amortization expense (inclusive of amounts in COGS) increased slightly by $7,918 or 1% in 2023 compared to 2022.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nManagement is committed to maintaining strong liquidity in an effort to be conservative and able to respond quickly to changes in industry or economic conditions. The Company\ncurrently has no long-term debt and does not have any immediate plans that would require long-term financing. While management believes sources of financing are available if\nneeded, we cannot be certain that financing would be available to us on favorable terms, or at all.

During the year ended December 31, 2023, we generated $7,064,050 of positive cash flow from\noperating activities. Most of this was generated through cash operating activities, excluding non-cash expenses, which was partially offset by various movements in working capital\nitems that resulted in a sizable increase in net working capital during the year. The primary drivers of the working capital change were increases in accounts receivable and\ninventory which were both due to increased revenues and customer demand. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we used $1,266,492 of cash in investing activities,\nprimarily due to net purchases of property and equipment and changes in the mix of our financial investment portfolio. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we used\n$2,454,519 of cash in financing activities, primarily related to the purchase of treasury stock. Financing activity trends consist of transactions related to equity awards and purchases\nor sales of treasury stock.\nWe may use our liquidity to fund support of our research and development efforts, share repurchase programs, the funding of key projects and spending required by any upturn in\nthe Company’s business and the pursuit of possible acquisitions. The pursuit of possible acquisitions may require a capital raise through the capital markets or for us to incur debt in\norder to successfully execute any potential acquisition.\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted our business in 2020 and subsequent periods through early 2022. Even though the world has largely recovered from the\nprimary effects of this pandemic, the future outbreak of any similar global pandemic and its effect on our liquidity position will depend on future developments, which are highly\nuncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we hold $19,992,640 of cash and investments that form our core excess liquidity which could be utilized, if required, due to the issues described above.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements, nor do we plan to engage in any in the foreseeable future.\nItem 7A.

(“the Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of\noperations and comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2023 and the related notes\n(collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the\nCompany as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2023, in\nconformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our\naudits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with\nrespect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether\nthe financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its\ninternal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of\nexpressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included\nevaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that\nour audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nCritical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee\nand that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We\ndetermined that there were no critical audit matters.\n/s/ Sadler, Gibb & Associates, LLC\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2011.\nSalt Lake City, UT\nMarch 13, 2024\n26\nPROFIRE ENERGY, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022\nNOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nOrganization and Line of Business\nThis Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Profire Energy, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \"Company\") is presented to assist in understanding the\nCompany's consolidated financial statements. The Company's accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"US\nGAAP\").\nThe Company specializes in the engineering and design of burner-management systems and solutions used on a variety of oilfield and other industrial natural-draft and forced-air\ncombustion applications. We sell our products and services primarily throughout North America and Canada.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Certain amounts in the accompanying\nDecember 31, 2022 consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income and footnotes have been reclassified to conform to the December 31, 2023 presentation.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nAccounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments The update adds a\nnew impairment model, known as the current expected credit loss (\"CECL\") model, that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. Under the new guidance, an entity\nrecognizes an allowance for its estimate of expected credit losses at the initial recognition of an in-scope financial instrument. The CECL model does not have a minimum\nthreshold for recognition of impairment losses and entities will need to measure expected credit losses on assets that have a low risk of loss. Since the Company is a smaller\nreporting company, as defined by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), the new guidance became effective on January 1, 2023. The Company adopted ASU\n2016-13 effective January 1, 2023, but the adoption of ASU 2016-13 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. See NOTE 1 –\nORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - Accounts Receivable.\nAccounting Standards Update No. 2023-07 —Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures The update is intended to improve\nreportable segment disclosure requirements through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The amendments require disclosure of significant segment expenses\nregularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM) as well as other segment items, extend certain annual disclosures to interim periods, clarify the applicability to\nsingle reportable segment entities, permit more than one measure of profit or loss to be reported under certain conditions, and require disclosure of the title and position of the\nCODM. We expect to adopt the new disclosures as required for the year ended December 31, 2024. We are currently evaluating the impact on the related disclosures.\nAccounting Standards Update No. 2023-09 —Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures The update requires the annual financial statements to\ninclude consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation, and income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. ASU 2023-09 is effective for\nthe Company’s annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted, and should be applied on a prospective basis, with a retrospective\noption. We are currently evaluating the effect that adoption of ASU 2023-09 will have on our disclosures.\nThe Company has evaluated all other recent accounting pronouncements and determined that the adoption of other pronouncements applicable to the Company has not had, nor is\nexpected to have, a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with US GAAP requires Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and\nliabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the\n31\nPROFIRE ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022\ndate of the financial statements and the reportable amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nForeign Currency and Comprehensive Income\nThe functional currencies of the Company and its subsidiaries in the United States and Canada are the U.S. Dollar (\"USD\") and the Canadian Dollar (\"CAD\"), respectively. The\nfinancial statements of the subsidiary Profire Combustion, Inc. were translated to USD using year-end exchange rates for the balance sheet, and average exchange rates for the\nstatements of operations. Equity transactions were translated using historical rates. The period-end exchange rates of 0.7547 and 0.7370 were used to convert the Company's\nDecember 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 balance sheets, respectively, and the statements of operations used weighted average rates of 0.7411 and 0.7679 for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. All amounts in the financial statements and footnotes are presumed to be stated in USD, unless otherwise identified.\nForeign currency translation gains or losses as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rates are reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Income and Comprehensive Income\n(Loss), and the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity.\nIn addition to foreign currency translation gains and losses, the Company recognizes unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities as part of comprehensive\nincome, as discussed in the investments policy below.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Certificates of deposit held for investment that are not debt\nsecurities are included in \"Short-term investments.\" Certificates of deposit with remaining maturities greater than one year are classified as \"Long-term investments.\" Our cash and\ncash equivalents held in FDIC insured institutions can exceed the federally insured limit periodically and at the end of reporting periods. Our balances exceeded federally insured\namounts by $8,376,661 and $5,328,825 as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\nAccounts Receivable\nReceivables from the sale of goods and services are stated at net realizable value. This value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts. The allowance\nis calculated based on past collectability and customer relationships. The Company recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of $365,394 and $220,745 as of December 31,\n2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Uncollectible accounts are written off after all collection efforts have been exhausted and Credit Committee approval is granted. Bad\ndebt expense recognized was $488,420 and $77,704 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\nInventories\nThe Company's inventories are valued at the lower of cost (the purchase price, including additional fees) or market. Inventory costs are determined based on the average cost basis.\nA reserve for slow-moving and potentially obsolete inventories is recorded as of each balance sheet date and total inventories are presented net of that reserve.\nInvestments\nInvestments consist of available-for-sale debt securities and mutual funds invested in debt securities that the Company carries at fair value. Securities with original maturities of\ngreater than three months at the date of purchase are classified as investments. Of these, bonds with maturities of less than one year, and mutual funds expected to be liquidated\nwithin one year from the balance sheet date, are classified as Short-Term Investments. Bonds with maturities of greater than one year or mutual funds not expected to be liquidated\nwithin one year as of the balance sheet date are classified as Long-Term Investments.\nThe Company accumulates unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, on the Company's available-for-sale securities in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) in the\nShareholders' Equity section of its balance sheets. Such unrealized gains or losses do not increase or decrease net income for the applicable accounting period. The Company\nincludes realized\n32\nPROFIRE ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022\ngains and losses on its available-for-sale securities in other income (expense), in its Statements of Operations. Dividend and interest income earned on all investments is included in\nearnings as other income.\nLong-Lived Assets\nThe Company periodically reviews the carrying amount of long-lived assets for impairment. An asset is considered impaired when estimated future cash flows are less than the\nasset's carrying amount. In the event the carrying amount of such asset is not considered recoverable, the asset is adjusted to its fair value.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the difference between the total purchase price and the fair value of assets (tangible and intangible) and liabilities at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is\nreviewed for impairment annually on December 31, and more frequently as circumstances warrant, and written down only in the period in which the recorded value of such assets\nexceed their fair value. The Company does not amortize goodwill in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification\n(\"ASC\") 350, \"Intangibles—Goodwill and Other\" (\"ASC 350\"). Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. The reporting unit for goodwill testing purposes is the\nconsolidated company as a whole.\nOther Intangible Assets\nThe Company accounts for Other Intangible Assets under the guidance of ASC 350, \"Intangibles—Goodwill and Other.\" Under such guidance, other intangible assets with definite\nlives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and tested annually for impairment when indicators of impairment exist or more frequently as circumstances warrant. Intangible\nassets with indefinite lives are tested annually for impairment.\nTreasury Stock\nTreasury stock repurchased and held by the Company is recorded as a separate line item on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Treasury stock is held at cost until retired or reissued.\nLegal, brokerage, and other costs to acquire shares are not included in the cost of treasury stock. When treasury stock is reissued or retired, any gains are included as part of\nadditional paid-in capital. Losses upon reissuance or retirement reduce additional paid-in capital to the extent that previous net gains from the same class of stock have been\nrecognized and any losses above that are recognized as part of retained earnings.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company's revenue recognition practices follow ASC 606, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\" .Refer to Note 10 for further details.\nCost of Sales\nThe Company includes product costs (i.e., material, direct labor and overhead costs), shipping and handling expense, production-related depreciation expense and product license\nagreement expense in cost of sales.\nAdvertising Costs\nThe Company classifies expenses for advertising as general and administrative expenses and recognizes the expense when incurred. The Company incurred advertising costs of\n$163,669 and $59,792 during the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company follows the provisions of ASC 718, \"Share-Based Payments,\" which requires all share-based payments to employees to be recognized in the income statement based\non their grant date fair values and is recognized over the requisite service period, which is generally the service period. The Company uses the Black-Scholes pricing model for\ndetermining the fair value of stock options. The intrinsic value method is used to value restricted stock and restricted stock units. The Company has elected to recognize forfeitures\nas they occur.\n33\nPROFIRE ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company performs\nongoing credit evaluations of its customers and maintains allowances for potential credit losses. Sales to the Company's four largest customers represented approximately 16% and\n11% of total sales during the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company is subject to US income taxes on a stand-alone basis. The Company and its subsidiary, Profire Combustion, Inc. file separate stand-alone tax returns in each\njurisdiction in which they operate. Profire Combustion, Inc. is a corporation operating in Canada and is subject to Canadian income taxes on its stand-alone taxable income.\nThe Company utilizes an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences on the\nbasis of assets and liabilities as reported for financial statement and income tax purposes. Deferred income taxes reflect the tax effects of net operating loss and tax credit carryovers\nand temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Realization of\ncertain deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings, if any. The Company makes estimates and judgments in determining the need for a provision for income taxes,\nincluding the estimation of our taxable income for each full fiscal year.\nDefined Contribution Retirement Plan\nThe Company matches employee contributions to our 401(k) plan up to 4% of their annual salary. The expense is recognized as part of general and administrative expenses on the\nincome statement and was $224,297 and $193,876 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at historical cost and depreciated over the useful life of the asset using the straight-line method. Useful lives are assigned to assets depending on\ntheir category. For details regarding property and equipment, refer to Note 5.\nResearch and Development\nThe Company's policy is to expense all costs associated with research and development (\"R&D\") that have no future alternative uses when those costs are incurred. Costs incurred\nto acquire assets currently used in R&D that do have future alternative uses are capitalized and the cost of depreciation is included in R&D expense.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe carrying value of cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair value because of the short-term nature of these\ninstruments. Bond and mutual fund investments are presented at fair value as of the balance sheet date and accumulated gains or losses on those investments are reported in other\ncomprehensive income. Refer to Note 2 for further details regarding instruments recorded at fair value.\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per\nshare is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the dilutive effect, if any, of common stock equivalents. Common stock\nequivalents whose effect would be antidilutive are not included in diluted earnings per share. The Company uses the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive effect, which\nassumes that all common stock equivalents have been exercised at the beginning of the period and that the funds obtained from those exercises were used to repurchase shares of\ncommon stock of the Company at the average closing market price during the period. Refer to Note 13 for further details on the earning per share calculation.\n34\nPROFIRE ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022\nNOTE 2 - FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND INVESTMENTS\nThe fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that could be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market\nparticipants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements do not include transaction costs.\nA fair value hierarchy is used to prioritize the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values. Categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the\nlowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The fair value hierarchy is divided into the following three categories:\nLevel 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2: Observable market-based inputs or inputs that are corroborated by market data.\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.\nFair value estimates of financial instruments are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant information about financial markets and specific financial instruments. As these\nestimates are subjective in nature, involving uncertainties and matters of significant judgment, they cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions can significantly\naffect estimated fair value. Management is of the opinion that the Company is not exposed to significant interest or credit risks arising from financial instruments and any declines\nin the value of investments are temporary in nature. Money market funds and certificates of deposits are shown at cost on the balance sheet and their adjusted cost approximates\ntheir fair value.\nThe following tables show the adjusted cost, unrealized gains (losses) and fair value of the Company's cash and cash equivalents and investments held as of December 31, 2023 and\n2022:\nDecember 31, 2023\nCash\nAdjusted Pre-Tax Unrealized and Cash\nCost Gains/(Losses) Fair Value Equivalents Short Term Long Term\nLevel 1\nMoney Market Funds $ 3,069,668 $ — $ 3,069,668 $ 3,069,668 $ — $ —\nOther Funds 1,889,552 (202,991) 1,686,561 — — 1,686,561\n4,959,220 (202,991) 4,756,229 3,069,668 — 1,686,561\nLevel 2\nCorporate Bonds 1,375,209 (62,885) 1,312,324 — 247,438 1,064,886\nMunicipal Bonds 6,373,922 (147,686) 6,226,236 — 2,552,101 3,674,135\n7,749,131 (210,571) 7,538,560 — 2,799,539 4,739,021\nTotal $ 12,708,351 $ (413,562) $ 12,294,789 $ 3,069,668 $ 2,799,539 $ 6,425,582\n35\nPROFIRE ENERGY, INC.

The leases for office equipment are classified as financing leases and the typical term is3 years. We have the option to\nextend most office equipment leases, but we do not intend to do so. Accordingly, no extensions have been recognized in the right-of-use asset or lease liability. The office\nequipment lease payments are not variable, and the lease agreements do not include any non-lease components, residual value guarantees, or restrictions. There are no interest rates\nimplicit in the office equipment lease agreements, so we have used our incremental borrowing rate to determine the discount rate to be applied to our financing leases. In 2023, we\nentered into a new lease agreement to replace some aging office equipment. The weighted average discount rate applied to our financing leases is 4.50% and the weighted average\nremaining lease term is 2.6 years.\nThe following table shows the components of financing lease cost:\nFor the Year Ended December For the Year Ended December 31,\nFinancing Lease Cost 31, 2023 2022\nAmortization of right-of-use assets $ 41,370 $ 34,658\nInterest on lease liabilities 9,450 3,147\nTotal financing lease cost $ 50,820 $ 37,805\nThe Company leases two warehouse spaces, one with a two-year lease, and another with a four-year lease, both of which are recorded as operating leases. The weighted average\ndiscount rate applied to our financing leases is 4.5% and the weighted average remaining lease term is 3.9 years. The remainder of our office space leases are considered to be\nshort-term, and we have elected not to recognize those on our balance sheet under the short-term recognition exemption. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and December\n31, 2022, we recognized $75,603 and $79,378, respectively, of lease costs associated with office space leases.\n39\nPROFIRE ENERGY, INC.

As of December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, the Company held6 ,243,363 and 5,038,130\nshares in treasury at a total cost of $9,324,272 and $7,336,323, respectively. Pursuant to the board of directors' approval of share repurchase programs allowing the Company to\nrepurchase up to $2,000,000 worth of the Company’s common stock from time to time both through April 30, 2024 and September 30, 2022, the Company entered into 10b5-1\nPlans in May 2023 and September 2021, respectively. After an initial 30-day cooling off period, the Company began purchasing shares of common stock pursuant to the terms of\nthe 10b5-1 Plan in June 2023 and October 2021, respectively. The Company was not obligated to make any purchases, and the program could have been suspended or discontinued\nat any time. During 2023 and 2022, the Company repurchased 1,205,233 and 961,221 shares of common stock, respectively. All such repurchases during 2023 and 2022 were made\nat market prices. As of the end of December 2023, the Company had spent the full allotment under both programs.\nOn June 29, 2023, and June 15, 2022, pursuant to the annual renewal of director compensation, the Board approved grants of1 95,966 and 178,623 RSUs, respectively, to the\nCompany's independent directors. Under both grants, half of the RSUs vested immediately on the date of grant and the remaining 50% of the RSUs will vest on the first anniversary\nof the grant date or at the Company's subsequent annual meeting of stockholders, whichever is earlier. The awards will result in total compensation expense of approximately\n$243,000 and $234,000, respectively, to be recognized over the vesting period.\nOn April 25, 2023, the Compensation Committee of the Board (the \"Compensation Committee\") approved the 2023 Executive Incentive Plan (the “2023 EIP”) for Messrs. Oviatt,\nTidball, and Fisher. The 2023 EIP provides for the potential award of incentive compensation to the participants based on the Company’s financial performance in fiscal 2023. If\nearned, the incentive compensation will be payable in cash and stock, and the stock portion of the incentive compensation is intended to constitute an award under the Company’s\n2023 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2023 Plan”). In addition to the 2023 EIP, the Board also approved as a long-term incentive plan the grants of a restricted stock unit awards to\nMessrs. Oviatt, Tidball, and Fisher pursuant to the 2023 Plan (the “2023 LTIP”). The 2023 Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors on April 25, 2023, subject to shareholder\napproval at the annual meeting of stockholders of the Company (the “Annual Meeting”). The 2023 Plan was approved by the shareholders of the Company at the Annual Meeting\nwhich was held on June 14, 2023.\n2023 EIP\nUnder the terms of the 2023 EIP, each participating executive officer was assigned a target incentive compensation amount for fiscal 2023. The target incentive compensation\namount for Mr. Oviatt was equal to 62% of his base salary as of December 31, 2023, the target incentive compensation amount for Mr. Tidball was equal to6 2% of his base salary\nas of December 31, 2023, and the target incentive compensation for Mr. Fisher was equal to 37% of his base salary as of December 31, 2023. Under no circumstance can the\nparticipants receive more than two times the assigned target incentive compensation.\n40\nPROFIRE ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022\nParticipants were eligible to receive incentive compensation based upon reaching or exceeding performance goals established by the Compensation Committee for fiscal 2023. The\nperformance goals in the 2023 EIP are based on the Company’s total revenue, EBITDA, and two non-financial factors including revenue source diversification and safety and\nenvironmental performance. Each of the revenue, EBITDA, and revenue diversification performance goals will be weighted 30% while the safety and environment goal will be\nweighted 10% in calculating incentive compensation amounts.\nThe incentive compensation amounts earned under the 2023 EIP will be paid5 0% in cash and 50% in shares of restricted stock under the 2023 Plan. In no event shall the total\naward exceed 200% of the target incentive compensation amount for each participant, or exceed any limitations otherwise set forth in the 2023 Plan. The actual incentive\ncompensation amounts were determined by the Compensation Committee on March 6, 2024 and will be paid by March 15, 2024, subject to all applicable tax withholding.\n2023 LTIP\nThe 2023 LTIP consists of total awards of up to 287,076 restricted stock units (“Units”) to Mr. Oviatt, up to 287,076 Units to Mr. Tidball, and up to 50,868 Units to Mr. Fisher,\npursuant to two separate restricted stock unit award agreements (collectively, the “2023 LTIP Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreements”) entered between the Company and each\nparticipant. One such agreement covers 33% of each award recipient’s Units that are subject to time-based vesting, and the other such agreement covers the remaining 67% of such\naward recipient’s Units that may vest based on performance metrics. Upon vesting, the award agreements entitle the award recipients to receive one share of the Company’s\ncommon stock for each vested Unit. The vesting period of the 2023 LTIP began on January 1, 2023 and terminates on December 31, 2025 (the “Performance Vesting Date”).\nThe Units subject to time-based vesting, including 95,692 Units to Mr. Oviatt, 95,692 Units for Mr. Tidball, and 16,956 Units to Mr. Fisher, will vest in three equal and annual\ninstallments beginning December 31, 2023 and ending on December 31, 2025 if the award recipients’ employment continues with the Company through such dates.\nThe performance-vesting Units, including up to 191,384 Units for Mr. Oviatt, 191,384 Units for Mr. Tidball, and 33,912 Units to Mr. Fisher, may vest over a three-year performance\nperiod beginning January 1, 2023 based upon the following Company performance metrics:\nPerformance Metrics Weight Target Above Target Outstanding\nTotal Shareholder Return 1/3 94.2% 142.7% 191.3%\nRelative Total Shareholder Return 1/3 Third Quartile Second Quartile First Quartile\nEBITDA as a Percentage of Total Revenue 1/3 15% 17.5% 20%\nOne-third of such performance-vesting Units, consisting of 63,794 Units for Mr. Oviatt, 63,794 Units for Mr. Tidball, and 11,304 Units for Mr. Fisher, may vest for each of the three\nperformance metrics identified in the table above.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022\nOn April 6, 2022, the Compensation Committee approved the 2022 Executive Incentive Plan (the “2022 EIP”) for Messrs. Oviatt, Tidball, and Fisher. The 2022 EIP provided for\nthe potential award of incentive compensation to the participants based on the Company’s financial performance in fiscal 2022. The incentive compensation was payable in cash and\nstock, and the stock portion of the incentive compensation constituted an award under the Company's 2014 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (the \"2014 Plan\").\nParticipants were eligible to receive incentive compensation based upon reaching or exceeding performance goals established by the Compensation Committee for fiscal 2022. The\nperformance goals in the 2022 EIP were based on the Company’s total revenue, EBITDA, and a non-financial milestone relating to revenue source diversification. Each of these\nperformance goals were weighted one third in calculating incentive compensation amounts.\nOn March 6, 2023, the Compensation Committee approved the incentive compensation amounts based on achieving certain targets pursuant to the 2022 EIP. The incentive\ncompensation amounts earned under the 2022 EIP were paid 50% in cash and 50% in shares of restricted stock under the 2014 Plan. The incentive compensation amounts resulted\nin the Compensation Committee approving a one-time bonus for Company executives that was settled by issuing a total of 341,961 shares of common stock, or 192,964 shares net\nof tax withholding. These shares were fully vested as of March 6, 2023.\nIn addition to the 2022 EIP, the Board also approved as a long-term incentive plan the grants of restricted stock unit awards to Messrs. Oviatt, Tidball, and Fisher pursuant to the\n2014 Plan (the “2022 LTIP”). The 2022 LTIP consists of total awards of up to 230,232 RSUs to Mr. Oviatt, up to 230,232 RSUs to Mr. Tidball, and up to 43,023 RSUs to Mr.\nFisher, pursuant to two separate restricted stock unit award agreements (collectively, the “2022 LTIP Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreements”) entered into between the Company\nand each participant. One such agreement covers the 33% of each award recipient’s RSUs that are subject to time-based vesting, and the other such agreement covers the remaining\n67% of such award recipient’s RSUs that may vest based on performance metrics. Upon vesting, the award agreements entitle the award recipients to receiveo ne share of the\nCompany’s common stock for each vested unit. The vesting period of the 2022 LTIP began on January 1, 2022 and terminates on December 31, 2024 (the “2022 LTIP Performance\nVesting Date”).\nThe RSUs subject to time-based vesting, including 76,744 RSUs to Mr. Oviatt, 76,744 RSUs for Mr. Tidball, and 14,341 RSUs to Mr. Fisher, will vest in three equal and annual\ninstallments beginning December 31, 2022 and ending on December 31, 2024 if the award recipients’ employment continues with the Company through such dates.\nThe performance-vesting RSUs, including up to 153,488 RSUs for Mr. Oviatt, 153,488 RSUs for Mr. Tidball, and 28,682 RSUs to Mr. Fisher, may vest at the end of the three year\nperformance period beginning January 1, 2022 based upon the following Company performance metrics:\nPerformance Metric Weight Target Above Target Outstanding\nTotal Shareholder Return 1/3 89% 136% 183%\nRelative Total Shareholder Return 1/3 Third Quartile Second Quartile First Quartile\nEBITDA as a Percentage of Total Revenue 1/3 10% 15% 20%\nOne-third of such performance-vesting RSUs, consisting of 51,163 RSUs for Mr. Oviatt, 51,163 RSUs for Mr. Tidball, and 9,561 RSUs for Mr. Fisher, may vest for each of the\nthree performance metrics identified in the table above. The number of RSUs that will vest for each performance metric on the 2022 LTIP Performance Vesting Date shall be\ndetermined as follows:\na. if the “Target” level for such performance metric is not achieved, none of the RSUs relating to such performance metric will vest;\nb. if the “Target” level (but no higher level) for such performance metric is achieved,5 0% of the RSUs relating to such performance metric will vest;\nc. if the “Above Target” level (but no higher level) for such performance metric is achieved,7 5% of the RSUs relating to such performance metric will vest; and\nd. if the “Outstanding” level for such performance metric is achieved, 100% of the RSUs relating to such performance metric will vest.\nThe foregoing summary of the 2022 EIP and the 2022 LTIP Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreements is qualified in its entirety by the text of the 2022 EIP and each of the 2022\nLTIP Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreements, which were filed as exhibits to Form 10-Q for the quarter ending March 31, 2022.\n42\nPROFIRE ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022\n2021 LTIP\nOn May 28, 2021, the Board approved as a long-term incentive plan, the grants of restricted stock unit awards to Messrs. Oviatt, Tidball, Fugal, and Fisher pursuant to the 2014\nPlan (the “2021 LTIP”). The 2021 LTIP consists of total awards of up to 204,543 Units to Mr. Oviatt, up to 204,543 Units to Mr. Tidball, up to 85,908 Units to Mr. Fugal, and up to\n47,973 Units to Mr. Fisher, pursuant to two separate restricted stock unit award agreements (collectively, the “2021 LTIP Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreements”) between the\nCompany and each participant. One agreement covers 33% of each award recipient’s Units that are subject to time-based vesting, and the other agreement covers the remaining\n67% of such award recipient’s Units that may vest based on performance metrics. Upon vesting, the award agreements entitle the award recipients to receive one share of the\nCompany’s common stock for each vested Unit. The vesting period of the 2021 LTIP began on January 1, 2021 and terminated on December 31, 2023 (the “2021 LTIP\nPerformance Vesting Date”).\nThe Units subject to time-based vesting, including 68,181 Units to Mr. Oviatt, 68,181 Units for Mr. Tidball, 28,636 Units to Mr. Fugal, and 15,991 Units to Mr. Fisher, vested in\nthree equal annual installments beginning December 31, 2021 and ending on December 31, 2023 for recipients who were still employed with the Company through such dates.\nThe performance-vesting Units, including up to 136,362 Units for Mr. Oviatt, 136,362 Units for Mr. Tidball, 57,272 Units for Mr. Fugal, and 31,982 Units to Mr. Fisher, were\neligible to vest over a three-year performance period beginning January 1, 2021 based upon the following Company performance metrics:\nPerformance Metric Weight Target Above Target Outstanding\nTotal Shareholder Return 1/3 135% 194% 253%\nRelative Total Shareholder Return 1/3 Third Quartile Second Quartile First Quartile\nEBITDA as a Percentage of Total Revenue 1/3 10% 15% 20%\nOne-third of such performance-vesting Units, consisting of 45,454 Units for Mr. Oviatt, 45,454 Units for Mr. Tidball, 19,091 Units for Mr. Fugal, and 10,661 Units for Mr. Fisher,\nwere eligible to vest for each of the three performance metrics identified in the table above. The number of Units that may have vested for each performance metric on the 2021\nLTIP Performance Vesting Date shall be determined as follows:\n• if the “Target” level for such performance metric is not achieved, none of the Units relating to such performance metric will vest;\n• if the “Target” level (but no higher level) for such performance metric is achieved,5 0% of the Units relating to such performance metric will vest;\n• if the “Above Target” level (but no higher level) for such performance metric is achieved,7 5% of the Units relating to such performance metric will vest; and\n• if the “Outstanding” level for such performance metric is achieved, 100% of the Units relating to such performance metric will vest.\nMr. Fugal resigned, effective October 31, 2021, from his position as Vice President of Operations to pursue an opportunity as CEO of another company. Accordingly, Mr. Fugal is\nnot eligible for any awards that were not vested prior to October 31, 2021 under the 2021 LTIP.\nThe foregoing summary of the 2021 LTIP and the 2021 LTIP Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreements is qualified in its entirety by the text of each of the 2021 LTIP Restricted\nStock Unit Award Agreements, which the Company filed as exhibits to its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2021.\nStock Options\nNo stock options were issued during the years ended December 31, 2023 or December 31, 2022.\nNOTE 10 - REVENUE\nPerformance Obligations\n43\nPROFIRE ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022\nOur performance obligations include providing product and servicing our product and other combustion equipment related to our product. We recognize product revenue\nperformance obligations in most cases when the product is delivered to the customer. Occasionally, if we are shipping the product on a customer’s account, we recognize revenue\nwhen the product has been shipped. At that point in time, the control of the product is transferred to the customer. When we perform service work, we apply the practical expedient\nthat allows us to recognize service revenue when we have the right to invoice the customer for the work completed. We do not engage in transactions acting as an agent. The time\nneeded to complete our performance obligations varies based on the size of the project; however, we typically satisfy our performance obligations within a few months of entering\ninto the applicable sales or service contract.\nOur customers have the right to return certain unused and unopened products within 90 days for a restocking fee. We provide a warranty on some of our products ranging from 90\ndays to 2 years, depending on the product. The amount accrued for expected returns and warranty claims was immaterial as of December 31, 2023.\nContract Balances\nWe have elected to use the practical expedient in ASC 340 (regarding recognition of the incremental costs of obtaining a contract) for costs related to contracts that are estimated to\nbe completed within one year. All of our current sales contracts and service contracts are expected to be completed within one year, and as a result, we have not recognized a\ncontract asset account. If we had chosen not to use this practical expedient, we would not expect a material difference in the contract balances. We do receive payments in advance\nof recognizing revenue on some contracts, but they do not result in any material contract liabilities. See Note 7 for additional information.\nSignificant Judgments\nFor most revenue contracts, we invoice the customer when the performance obligation is satisfied and payment is due 30 days later. Occasionally, other terms such as progress\nbillings or longer terms are agreed to on a case-by-case basis. We do not have significant financing components, non-cash consideration, or variable consideration. We estimate the\ntransaction price between performance obligations based on stand-alone product prices. We elected the practical expedient by which disclosures are not required regarding the value\nof unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less.\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nAll revenue recognized in the income statement is considered to be revenue from contracts with customers. The table below shows revenue by category:\nYear Ended December 31, 2023 Year Ended December 31, 2022\nElectronics $ 22,329,182 $ 16,439,208\nManufactured 13,188,773 9,282,342\nRe-Sell 18,766,340 16,596,713\nService 3,923,765 3,618,380\nTotal Revenue $ 58,208,060 $ 45,936,643\nNOTE 11 – STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nPeriodically the Company issues stock-based awards to employees and independent directors. Vesting terms for outstanding grants vary by grant, ranging from immediate to ratably\nover 5 years. Typically, grants expire one year after the final vesting. The Board has authorized 6,119,834 shares to be granted for such awards under the 2023 Plan. Historically,\nthe Company has only issued non-qualified stock options, restricted stock, and restricted stock units; however, the 2023 Plan does allow for other types of awards to be granted in\nthe future. Most awards have been exercisable or convertible based solely on meeting service conditions; however, some grants to executives have been made convertible based on\nmeeting both service and performance conditions. Upon exercise or conversion, the Company may issue new shares or reissue shares held in treasury, at the discretion of\nManagement. The Company has elected to recognize forfeitures as they occur.\nThe Company uses the Black-Scholes method for measuring compensation cost of stock options and the intrinsic value method for measuring compensation cost of restricted stock\nand restricted stock units. Total compensation cost for share-\n44\nPROFIRE ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022\nbased payments recognized in income was $1,043,740 and $814,769 during the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2023,\nthe Company had $600,770 in unamortized compensation expense with a weighted average of 1.42 years remaining. The Company received $177,281 and $33,863 in cash from the\nexercise of share options during the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. For the tax effect on total compensation expense and the exercise of\noptions, see Note 12 for the income tax provision.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the intrinsic value of options exercised was $939,335 and $19,113, respectively. The total fair value of options,\nrestricted stock, and restricted stock units vested during the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $1,049,170 and $742,313, respectively.

Accordingly, the\nCompany had no accruals for interest and penalties at December 31, 2023, nor December 31, 2022. When our tax returns for the year ended December 31, 2022 were finalized\nthere was an immaterial amount of penalties and interest that was ultimately paid. We do not expect any material penalties or interest will result from the filing of our 2023 tax\nreturn. If the Company were to incur any such material charges, it would recognize interest related to underpayment of income taxes in interest expense and recognize any penalties\nin operating expenses.\nThe Company is current on its U.S. and Canadian income tax filings. Tax years that remain open for examination are 2021 through 2023 in the U.S. and 2016 through 2023 in\nCanada.\nAt December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, the Company had operating loss carryforwards at its Canadian subsidiary of $0 CAD and $2,622,292 CAD, respectively. A\nvaluation allowance was recorded for 100% of operating loss carry forward balance as of December 31, 2022. As a result, no deferred tax asset was recorded on our balance sheet at\nDecember 31, 2022 for these operating loss carry forwards.\nAt December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company had no operating loss carryforwards at its US subsidiary. In 2022, we completed an application for the Employee\nRetention Credit under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. Based on the amended payroll tax returns filed with the government, we qualified for\napproximately $1,500,000 in payroll tax credit, offset by approximately $204,000 in fees spent with our tax preparers to calculate and apply for the credit. To be conservative and\nallow for the risk of a reduced credit amount approved by the IRS, in 2022, we recorded a reduction in payroll tax expense of $761,132. The remaining credit of $761,132, along\nwith interest income of\n48\nPROFIRE ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022\n$55,499 was recorded when the full credit was received in 2023. The full benefit was claimed for tax purposes on the 2021 tax return and on an amended 2020 income tax return\nwhich flipped the company’s prior tax loss in 2021 to a small taxable income position and reduced the taxable losses in 2020.\nThe Company had a net deferred tax asset of $496,785 as of December 31, 2023. The deferred tax asset on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 does not have a valuation\nallowance associated with it. Realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income to offset the tax items that will be deductible in the future.\nAlthough realization is not assured, Management believes it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset will be realized.\nIn 2023, the Company identified an adjustment to its deferred tax balances, primarily related to stock compensation and fixed asset depreciation, which had accumulated over\nseveral years. The Company evaluated the materiality of the adjustment in the current and prior periods of accumulation and found the adjustment to be immaterial to all periods.\nThe adjustment resulted in the recognition of a deferred tax benefit of $828,098, which is included as a component of total income tax expense for the year ended December 31,\n2023.\nIn 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law, which among other things, allowed net operating losses from the year 2020 to be carried back five years to claim refunds for taxes\nthat were previously paid. Since our US Subsidiary had taxable income in prior years, during 2021, we filed an amendment to our 2015 and 2016 tax returns and utilized all of the\nnet operating losses from the year ended December 31, 2020, which generated a tax refund of $416,560 which was received in 2022.\nThe Company invests in available-for-sale securities that are reported on the balance sheet at fair value, with the gains/losses reported net of tax as part of Other Comprehensive\nIncome (OCI).

These shares were fully\nvested as of March 6, 2024.\n52\nItem 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nManagement, with the participation of our Co-Chief Executive Officers and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the design and effectiveness of our internal controls\nover financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures (pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b-c) under the Exchange Act as of December 31, 2023. These controls are designed to\nensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the\nSEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Management, including our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, as\nappropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, Management concluded that our controls were effective as of December 31, 2023.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated\nunder the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company's principal executive officer and principal\nfinancial officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nAll internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Because of these inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may\nnot prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation\nand presentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or\nthat the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, the Company's management conducted an assessment of\nthe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in the Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission (2013).\nBased upon this assessment, the Company's management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\nOur financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K have been audited by Sadler, Gibb & Associates, LLC, independent registered public accounting\nfirm, as indicated in the report included elsewhere herein.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no material changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 that materially affected, or are\nreasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nAttestation\nPursuant to Item 308(b) of Regulation S-K, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Wall Street Reform Act), this report does\nnot include an attestation report of the Company’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. The Wall Street Reform Act exempts\nsmaller reporting companies from the requirement to obtain an external audit on the effectiveness of internal financial reporting controls.\nLimitations on the Effectiveness of Internal Controls\n53\nAn internal control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are\nmet. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of\nthe inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company\nhave been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or\nmistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by Management override of the internal control.\nThe design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed\nin achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with\nthe policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nItem 9B. Other Information\nDuring the period ended December 31, 2023, none of our directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act)a dopted or terminated any Rule 10b5-\n1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as such terms are defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K under the Act).\nItem 9C.
